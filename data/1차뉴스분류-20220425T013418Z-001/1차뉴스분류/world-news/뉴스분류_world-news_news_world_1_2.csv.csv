VIENNA (Reuters) -Western powers on Tuesday warned Russia against wrecking an almost completed deal on bringing the United States and Iran back into compliance with the 2015 nuclear accord, as Iran's top negotiator was set to return from consultations in Tehran.
Eleven months of talks to restore the deal which lifted sanctions on Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear programme have reached their final stages. 
But they have been complicated by a last-minute demand from Russia for guarantees from the United States that Western sanctions targeting Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine would not affect its business with Iran.
U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said Russia was seeking to reap extra benefits from its participation in the effort to restore the nuclear agreement, but it will not succeed.
""Russia is trying to up the ante and broaden its demands with regard to the (nuclear deal) and we are not playing 'Lets make a deal',"" Nuland, the No. 3 U.S. diplomat, told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing.
Iran's top negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani is due back in Vienna on Wednesday after unexpectedly returning to Tehran on Monday for consultations, an Iranian and a European official said.
The talks' coordinator, Enrique Mora of the European Union, said on Monday the time had come for political decisions to be taken to end the negotiations.
""The window of opportunity is closing. We call on all sides to make the decisions necessary to close this deal now, and on Russia not to add extraneous conditions to its conclusion,"" Britain, France and Germany said in a joint statement to the U.N. nuclear watchdog's 35-nation Board of Governors.
Iran has sought to remove all sanctions and it wants guarantees from the United States that it will not abandon the agreement once more, after then-U.S. President Donald Trump walked out of the deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions.
Diplomats have said until now that several differences still needed to be overcome in the talks, including the extent to which sanctions on Iran, notably its elite revolutionary guards, would be rolled back and what guarantees Washington would give if it were to again renege on the deal.
Two Western officials said there was now a final text on the table and those issues had been resolved.
While they couldn't rule out further last-minute surprises, they said the last big open question was whether Russia's demands were manageably narrow and limited to nuclear cooperation spelled out in the agreement, as Moscow's envoy to the talks has told other parties, or much broader, as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has described them.
""We are very close to an agreement. It is essential we conclude while we still can,"" France's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne-Claire Legendre told reporters in a daily briefing.
""We are concerned by the risks that further delays could weigh on the possibility of concluding,"" she said.
COMMON INTEREST
Moscow threw the potential wrench in the works on Saturday, just as months of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington in Vienna appeared to be headed for an agreement, with Lavrov saying the Western sanctions over Ukraine had become a stumbling block for the nuclear deal.
The EU's Mora and Russia's top negotiator Mikhail Ulyanov held talks in Vienna on Tuesday evening, exchanging views on the ""current developments and way ahead,"" Moscow's envoy said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Western officials say there is common interest in avoiding a nuclear nonproliferation crisis, and they are trying to ascertain whether what Russia is demanding regards only its commitments to the Iran deal. That would be manageable, but anything beyond that would be problematic, they say.
The new agreement would lead to Russia taking in excess highly enriched uranium that would be taken out of Iran to bring Tehran back into compliance with the original deal's caps on the purity and amount of the enriched uranium it is stockpiling.
Rosatom, a state-run company formed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2007, is key to that and has still not been added to Western sanctions.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken played down the issue during a visit to Estonia on Tuesday and said Russia and the United States still shared a desire to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.
European negotiators from France, Britain, and Germany had already temporarily left the talks as they believed they had gone as far as they could go and it was now up to the two main protagonists to agree on outstanding issues.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's intelligence office was aware in advance about threats connected to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, but failed to warn other law enforcement offices until it was too late, the department's internal watchdog has found.
The new report from the DHS inspector general paints a critical picture of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A), which it says failed at least three times to disseminate intelligence about the storming of the building by then- President Donald Trump's supporters, who wanted to block Congress' certification of his November 2020 election defeat.
More than 140 police officers were assaulted, as were members of the media. One of the rioters, Ashli Babbitt, died after she was shot by Capitol Police as she climbed through a doorway. 
Since the attack, more than 775 people have been criminally charged.
""In the weeks before the events at the U.S. Capitol, I&A identified specific open source threat information related to January 6 but did not issue any intelligence products about these threats until January 8,"" the report says, adding that some of the missteps came from ""inexperienced collectors"" who received ""inadequate training"".
In one example, a field office division tried to share intelligence suggesting the right-wing group the Proud Boys planned to shut down the Washington, D.C. water system at 11:29 a.m. on Jan. 6.
The former chairman of the Proud Boys, Enrique Tarrio, was charged on Tuesday, just a few hours after the inspector general's report was released, for conspiring with fellow members to block President Joe Biden's election victory from being certified by lawmakers.
Other cryptic messages uncovered by intelligence-gatherers included people who openly discussed sharing maps of the U.S. Capitol building.
""I found a map of all the exits and entrances to the Capitol building,"" one person wrote to another on Jan. 2, 2021. ""I feel like people are actually going to try and hurt politicians. Jan 6th is gonna be crazy.""
In response to the report, John Cohen, a senior official with the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, said he concurred with the report's findings and recommendations, which call for additional training and more timely reporting on urgent open source threat intelligence.

“As Secretary (Alejandro) Mayorkas has said, the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021 was a violent assault on our democracy,"" a DHS spokesperson said.
The spokesperson added that the DHS ""has strengthened intelligence analysis, information sharing, and operational preparedness"" since the attack.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A U.S. judge on Tuesday ordered the dismissal of Virginia Giuffre's lawsuit accusing Britain's Prince Andrew of sexually abusing her when she was underage, as Britain's finance ministry confirmed that no public funds were used in their settlement.
The dismissal by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan federal court had been requested by Giuffre and Andrew, and was expected following the settlement announced on Feb. 15 between Giuffre and Queen Elizabeth's second son.
That accord included an undisclosed payment, with Andrew making a ""substantial donation"" to Giuffre's charity in support of victims' rights.
Andrew, the Duke of York, did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to settle the civil lawsuit. He has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing.
The finance ministry issued its comment after The Sun, a British tabloid, said Andrew's older brother Prince Charles was bankrolling most of the settlement, with the queen chipping in.
Giuffre's case had focused on Andrew's friendship with the late Jeffrey Epstein, the financier and sex offender who the 38-year-old Giuffre said also sexually abused her.
Andrew, 62, denied Giuffre's accusations that he forced her to have sex when she was 17 at the London home of Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's mansion in Manhattan, and Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
The allegations and Andrew's relationship with Epstein severely damaged the prince's reputation, forcing him to give up his royal patronages and no longer be known as ""His Royal Highness.""

In a statement announcing the settlement, Andrew said he regretted his association with Epstein, and accepted that Giuffre had suffered as an abuse victim.
Epstein killed himself at age 66 in a Manhattan jail in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Maxwell is seeking a new trial after being convicted in December of recruiting and grooming underage girls for Epstein to abuse.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Leaders of U.S. spy agencies said on Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin may intensify the assault on Ukraine despite military setbacks and economic hardships resulting from international sanctions, setting up ""an ugly next few weeks.""
They estimated that 2,000 to 4,000 Russian troops had died and said Russia was feeling the effects of sanctions, but the situation could become much worse for Ukrainians, with food and water supplies in Kyiv possibly running out within two weeks.
""Our analysts assess that Putin is unlikely to be deterred by such setbacks and instead may escalate,"" Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told the annual House of Representatives Intelligence Committee hearing on worldwide threats, where she testified with other intelligence agency directors.
Haines said Putin's announcement that he was elevating his nuclear forces' readiness was ""extremely unusual"" since the 1960s, but that intelligence analysts had not observed changes in Russia's nuclear posture beyond what was detected during previous international crises.
""We also have not observed force-wide nuclear posture changes that go beyond what we've seen in prior moments of heightened tensions,"" Haines said.
William Burns, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, echoed Haines' assessment that Russia is unlikely to back down. 
""I think Putin is angry and frustrated right now. He's likely to double down and try to grind down the Ukrainian military with no regard for civilian casualties,"" Burns said.
Burns said he and CIA analysts do not see how Putin can accomplish his goal of taking Kyiv and replacing President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's government with a pro-Moscow or puppet leadership.
""I fail to see how he can produce that kind of an end game and where that leads, I think, is for an ugly next few weeks in which he doubles down ... with scant regard for civilian casualties,"" Burns told the committee.
'DESPERATE' IN KYIV
Given reports that Russia is cutting off basic supplies to Kyiv, home to 2.8 million people, Lieutenant General Scott Berrier, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said the situation in Ukraine's capital could worsen quickly. 
""I don't have a specific number of days of supply that the population has. But with supplies being cut off, it will be somewhat desperate in, I would say, 10 days to two weeks,"" Berrier said.
Berrier said the United States did not have evidence that Russia had committed war crimes beyond what has appeared on social media. Berrier said that ""the bombing of schools and facilities that are not associated with the Ukrainian military certainly would indicate that he is stepping up right to the line if he hasn't done so already.""
Burns said China's leaders are ""unsettled"" by events surrounding the assault on Ukraine, despite refusing to condemn Russia or call the attack an invasion. 
""They did not anticipate the significant difficulties the Russians were going to run into. I think they are unsettled by the reputational damage that can come by their close association with President Putin; second by the economic consequences at a moment when they are facing lower annual growth rates than they've experienced for more than three decades,"" Burns added.
""I think they're a little bit unsettled about the impact on the global economy. And third, I think they're a little bit unsettled by the way in which Vladimir Putin has driven Europeans and Americans much closer together,"" Burns said.
The United States has done ""intensive intelligence-sharing"" with Ukraine, Burns said.
Berrier said his ""low confidence"" assessment was that 2,000 to 4,000 Russian troops have been killed.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbor's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.
At the hearing, Democratic and Republican committee members praised the work done by the U.S. intelligence community ahead of the Russian invasion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The war in Ukraine has worsened a difficult period for women, who have seen major economic and social setbacks prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday.
Speaking via video link to a special Security Council meeting on International Women's Day, Georgieva said that women disproportionately bear the devastation of war but are the best hope for peace -- often as the first to bridge conflict divides.
""My heart goes to all the women bracing the horror of war, protecting their children, caring for the wounded, sacrificing for their countries, their communities, their families,"" Georgieva said. ""Today this is the fate of our sisters in Ukraine — we admire your courage, we share your pain, we stand with you.""
She said the conflict, along with the COVID-19 pandemic and other crises, are threatening to set back years of progress in gender equality.
""Take the pandemic. Globally, twice as many women as men lost their jobs due to the precarity of their employment, lower social protection, and often the burden of child care and unpaid work,"" Georgieva said.
Some 20 million girls in developing countries may never return to school in the pandemic's aftermath, which will likely significantly reduce their lifetime earnings potential.
Gender-based violence also has been on the rise in sub-Saharan Africa, and Georgieva said if countries in the region could reduce incidences to the global average, this could boost long-term economic output by some 30%.
""When women and girls can reach their full potential, they do better, economies do better, and that is to the benefit of everyone,"" she added.

The IMF is planning to present new strategies on fragile and conflict-affected states to its executive board on Wednesday, which will include gender inequality in identifying drivers of country instability, along with food insecurity, forced displacement and climate change, Georgieva said. 
When women participate in countries' decision-making processes, they help build more stable, resilient societies, Georgieva said, adding that women helped build peace processes from Northern Ireland to Colombia to Liberia in recent years.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A juror in Ghislaine Maxwell's sex abuse trial said on Tuesday that his failure to disclose that he had been sexually abused as a child on a pre-trial screening form was a ""huge mistake,"" but that he did not deliberately lie to get chosen for the jury.
Maxwell was convicted on Dec. 29 on five of the six counts she faced for helping the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse underage girls.
Her lawyers demanded a new trial after Juror No. 50 told media including Reuters that he shared with other jurors his history of sexual abuse during deliberations. He said in the pre-trial screening questionnaire that he had not been sexually abused.
U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan said the juror's statements provided evidence that he responded falsely on the questionnaire. She questioned the juror about his responses at a Tuesday hearing in Manhattan federal court. 
""This is one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made in my life,"" Juror No. 50, who testified without revealing his name, said in court. 
He testified that he had been abused by a stepbrother and the stepbrother's friend when he was 9 and 10 years old. He said that looking back on the question, he should have answered ""yes"" when asked whether he had ever been abused, but that the experience did not bias him. 
In explaining his incorrect response, the juror said he ""flew through"" the questionnaire. 
""This is a terrible excuse, but I really didn't think I'd be chosen,"" Juror No. 50 testified. ""I never thought I would be one of those 12.""
Nathan asked if he had hoped to be selected. 
""I did not hope to be on this jury,"" the juror said. ""If you're going to serve jury duty, it might as well be something that's interesting. But I did not set out to get on this jury."" 
Legal experts told Reuters that not all instances of jurors failing to disclose information are significant enough to merit a new trial, noting that cases where verdicts were overturned often involved jurors who deliberately misled the judge in order to get selected.
Nathan granted the juror immunity from prosecution. The juror's lawyer had previously said the juror would invoke his constitutional right to avoid self-incrimination and decline to answer questions at the hearing. 
The juror signed the pre-trial screening form under penalty of perjury, meaning he could have faced legal consequences if found to have lied.

At the close of the hearing, Nathan instructed both prosecutors and the defense to submit briefs about the juror's testimony before she rules on Maxwell's request for a new trial.
Maxwell, 60, faces up to 65 years in prison. Epstein died by suicide in 2019 at the age of 66 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges

LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) -Ukrainian civilians and foreign students clutching bags and rucksacks fled the besieged city of Sumy in buses and cars on Tuesday in the first successful ""humanitarian corridor"" opened since Russia's invasion.
Ukraine accused Russian forces of shelling one evacuation route - from Mariupol in southern Ukraine - but Sumy's regional governor said a temporary ceasefire had held long enough for at least two convoys of vehicles to leave the northeastern city.
The first evacuation convoy met a column of more than 160 Russian military vehicles coming towards them on the road, said Sumy Governor Dmytro Zhyvytsky in televised comments. 
""Our column stopped on the side of the road and let the vehicles through, then continued on its path,"" he said.
People stood patiently on the snowy ground in Sumy, waiting for the evacuation buses. Many had packed as many belongings as they could into a single bag, and some had their children with them. All were wrapped in warm winter clothes.
Around 1,000 foreign students were among the first wave of evacuees, Zhyvytsky said.
Some civilians were also evacuated from the town of Irpin near the capital Kyiv. There were no reports of them coming under fire in Irpin, two days after Reuters witnesses said residents trying to flee were caught in Russian shelling. 
But foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko said the evacuation route from Mariupol had been shelled and local officials said people had been unable to leave the city, which has been under fire without water or power for over a week.
""Ceasefire violated!"" Nikolenko wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""Pressure on Russia MUST step up to make it uphold its commitments.""
There were no immediate reports of any casualties and Nikolenko gave no other details. Russia did not immediately comment on his remarks. 
Civilians have been trapped by fighting since Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Humanitarian corridors from Mariupol failed on Saturday and Sunday, with each side accusing the other of continuing to fire.
Ukraine refused to use any humanitarian corridors offered by Russia that would have taken Ukrainians into Russian or Belarusian territory. 

Ukrainian officials say food, water and other supplies have been running low in some of the besieged cities, and some have warned of a ""humanitarian catastrophe"".
Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" to disarm its neighbour and denies targeting civilians.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Nearly 400 civilians have been killed in attacks in Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover, more than 80% of them by a group affiliated to Islamic State, a U.N. report shows, underscoring the scale of the insurgency faced by the new rulers.
It is the first major human rights report since the Taliban seized power from the former U.S.-backed government in August, triggering concerns in the West about a broader rollback of rights for women, journalists and others.
It covers the period from August 2021 to the end of February and said that 397 civilians were killed mostly in a series of attacks by the Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K) group.
More than 50 people with suspected ties to the extreme militant group had been killed in the same period, it said, with some tortured and beheaded and cast by the roadside. 
""The human rights situation for many Afghans is of profound concern,"" said Michelle Bachelet, High Commissioner for Human Rights, in a speech introducing the report to the top rights body in Geneva.
ISIS-K, which first appeared in eastern Afghanistan in late 2014, is thought to have spread in the wake of the Taliban takeover and is blamed for several suicide attacks in recent months, including one at Kabul airport last August.
In the same speech, Bachelet said that Taliban rulers had curtailed women's rights and freedoms. She called for women to be allowed to ""fully participate"" in public life.
Bachelet also referred to ""a number of disturbing cases of enforced disappearances"" of activists and protesters and expressed concern about restrictions on freedom of expression.
""I remain concerned by the progressive erosion of civic space,"" she said.
Under their previous rule from 1996 to 2001, the hardline Islamist Taliban barred women and girls from education. They say they have since changed.

The Geneva-based Rights Council is set to appoint a special rapporteur on Afghanistan to probe alleged violations by Taliban and others at the end of its current month-long session.
U.S. human rights ambassador Michele Taylor told the Council on Monday that this would be an ""important mechanism for documenting abuses"" and urged the Taliban to cooperate with its team.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey and Israel will seek to overcome years of animosity and insults when their presidents meet for the first time in more than a decade this week, expanding a recent Turkish charm offensive with regional rivals.
The two countries have traded accusations over Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories and Ankara's support for the militant Islamist group Hamas which governs Gaza. Diplomatic ties hit a low in 2018 when they expelled ambassadors.
Turkey's efforts to repair its frayed relations in the Middle East led President Tayyip Erdogan to announce in January that he had invited Israeli President Isaac Herzog for Wednesday's talks, which both sides say will explore ways to deepen cooperation.
Erdogan has said the visit will herald a ""new era"" and that the two countries could work together to carry Israeli natural gas to Europe, reviving an idea first discussed more than 20 years ago.
The head of the Israeli firm pumping gas from a giant field in the east Mediterranean said his company could supply Turkey if it provided infrastructure, though he did not comment on Erdogan's more ambitious idea to link it to Europe.
""Our position has always been clear. If you want gas, great. We are ready to give. You build the pipeline to us and we will supply gas,"" Yossi Abu, chief executive of NewMed Energy, told an investors conference two weeks ago.
Gas supplies from the Mediterranean could ease European dependence on Russian gas. Plans for a subsea pipeline from the east Mediterranean to Europe, excluding Turkey, have stalled after the United States expressed misgivings in January.
Turkey imports most of its energy but has announced a discovery of 540 billion cubic metres of natural gas in the Black Sea and hopes to extract it next year.
A TENSE DECADE
Although his post is largely ceremonial and any concrete steps towards rapprochement will require approval of Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, Herzog's visit marks a significant thaw in ties. 
The last visit by an Israeli president to Turkey was in 2007 and the last trip by a prime minister came the following year. Erdogan and Bennett spoke in November, the first such call in years.
Relations cratered in 2010 when Israeli commandos enforcing a naval blockade of Gaza killed 10 Turkish activists during a raid on the Mavi Marmara boat, which was carrying aid to the enclave.
Through the years of animosity, the countries have maintained trade, which stood at $6.7 billion in 2021, up from $5 billion in 2019 and 2020, according to official data. 

Turkey has hosted several senior officials from Hamas, which the United States and European Union have designated a terrorist organisation. Despite visibly toning down its criticism of Israel ahead of Herzog's visit, it has ruled out abandoning its commitment to supporting Palestinian statehood.
Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas political official in Turkey, told Reuters that ties between the group and Ankara were ""stable"" and that media reports about Turkey pressuring Hamas to rein in its criticism of Israel were ""unfounded and incorrect.""

SEOUL (Reuters) -Satellite imagery shows construction at North Korea's nuclear testing site for the first time since it was closed in 2018, analysts said on Tuesday, as a U.S. intelligence report warned the country could resume major weapons tests this year.
Images captured by commercial satellite on Friday showed very early signs of activity at the Punggye-ri site, including construction of a new building, repair of another building, and what is possibly some lumber and sawdust, specialists at the California-based James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) said in a report.
""The construction and repair work indicate that North Korea has made some decision about the status of the test site,"" the report said.
North Korea tested a record number of missiles in January, including its largest weapon since 2017, and appears to be preparing to launch a spy satellite. 
International monitors have also reported the North's main nuclear reactor facility at Yongbyon appears to be in full swing, potentially creating fuel for nuclear weapons.
North Korea's missile launches could be groundwork for a return to intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and nuclear bomb tests this year, the U.S. Directorate of National Intelligence (DNI) said in its annual Worldwide Threat Assessment.
The report did not mention Punggye-ri but said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un remains strongly committed to expanding the country’s nuclear weapons arsenal.
Punggye-ri has been shuttered since North Korea declared a self-imposed moratorium on nuclear weapons tests in 2018. Kim, however, has said he no longer feels bound by that moratorium with denuclearisation talks stalled since 2019..
At the time, North Korea said it was closing the site's tunnels with explosions, blocking its entrances, and removing all observation facilities, research buildings and security posts. It invited a handful of foreign media to observe the demolition, but refused to allow international inspectors, leading to speculation the facilities could be restored. 
In South Korea, where voters will elect a new president on Wednesday, the National Security Council said on Sunday it was paying particularly close attention to Yongbyon and Punggye-ri, without elaborating.
The CNS analysts said the changes at Punggye-ri occurred only in the past few days, and it is still difficult to conclude what precisely is being built or why.
""One possibility is that North Korea plans to bring the test site back to a state of readiness to resume nuclear explosive testing,"" the report said.
The CNS analysts cautioned the test site is many months, if not years, from being ready for new nuclear explosions.
""How long it would take North Korea to resume explosive testing at the site depends on the extent of the damage to the tunnels themselves, something we do not know with confidence,"" they wrote in the report. ""It is also possible that North Korea will resume nuclear testing at another location.""
Punggye-ri is North Korea's only known nuclear test site. It conducted six nuclear weapons tests in tunnels at the site from 2006 to 2017. North Korea's last and largest nuclear test appeared to trigger geological instability that has since caused multiple small earthquakes, but analysts and U.S. intelligence officials have said the site could likely be used again.
A Pentagon spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Marty Meiners declined to comment on matters of intelligence or commercial imagery analysis. 

""However, we have been very clear on the threat posed by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) missile programs, and our commitment to the defence of the ROK, Japan, and the U.S. homeland, and our commitment to uphold regional peace and stability,"" he said, using the initials of the official names of North and South Korea.
The United States says it is open to talks without preconditions, but North Korea says Washington and its allies must first stop their ""hostile policies.""

Zelenskiy, who has spoken to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on several occasions since Russia invaded his country, has made a number of impassioned speeches to Western leaders in the last week, asking for supplies and military support.
He will address the chamber at 1700 GMT when formal parliamentary business will be suspended. Lawmakers will be able to watch the speech on screens installed overnight, with 500 headsets providing a simultaneous translation in English.
Former world leaders including U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and Germany's Angela Merkel, have previously made speeches in other parts of the parliamentary estate on the banks of the River Thames, including in the ornate Royal Gallery or vast Westminster Hall.
""Every parliamentarian wants to hear directly from the president, who will be speaking to us live from Ukraine, so this is an important opportunity for the House,"" Speaker Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) Hoyle said in a statement.
""Thanks again to our incredible staff for working at pace to make this historic address possible.""
Ben Wallace, Britain's defence minister, told Sky News he expected the address to be ""incredibly powerful"". 

""President Zelenskiy is the spirit of Ukraine, which is young, which is liberal thinking, which is outward facing, which is European, and that's what Russia or President (Vladimir) Putin just doesn't understand,"" he said. 
Ukraine's ambassador to London was given a very rare standing ovation when he appeared in the chamber to observe Johnson answering lawmakers' questions last week.

KADUNA, Nigeria (Reuters) - Gunmen ambushed and killed at least 62 members of a volunteer vigilante group in Nigeria's northwestern Kebbi state, the head of the group and a police spokesman said, in the worst violence to hit the state since mid-January.
Many northwestern states in Nigeria have groups of volunteers who help defend villages and towns from armed gangs as the security forces are stretched fighting Islamist militants and the gangs, known as bandits.
Usman Sani, the head of the ""Yan Sa Kai"" vigilante group in Kebbi, told Reuters that his group had planned to attack bandits in the Sakaba area on Sunday night but someone tipped them off. 
""They lay in ambush, hid their motorcycles in the shrubs, circled us and opened fire from different directions,"" Sani, a retired soldier, said on Tuesday. He said 62 people had been killed.
Kebbi police spokesman Nafiu Abubakar confirmed the ambush but said he did not have details on how many people had been killed.
In January, dozens of gunmen on motorbikes ransacked a village and killed more than 50 people in Kebbi.
Gunmen have spread terror across the northwest, where they have kidnapped hundreds of school children and villagers for ransom.
The violence has compounded the problems in northern states, which are typically poorer than those in the south.

On Tuesday, U.S.-based analysts said commercial satellite imagery shows construction at North Korea's nuclear testing site for the first time since it was closed in 2018.
International experts have also reported that North Korea's main nuclear reactor facility at Yongbyon appears to be in full swing, potentially creating additional fuel for nuclear weapons. 
The DNI report, dated Feb. 7, and released ahead of a congressional hearing on Tuesday, said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un remained strongly committed to expanding his nuclear weapons arsenal and ballistic missile research and development.
It said the North Korea's continued development of ICBMs, intermediate range ballistic missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles showed the country's intention to bolster its nuclear delivery capability.
""In January, North Korea began laying the groundwork for an increase in tensions that could include ICBM or possibly a nuclear test this year - actions that Pyongyang has not taken since 2017,"" the report said.
""Flight tests are part of North Korea’s effort to expand the number and type of missile systems capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the entire United States,"" it added.
The DNI report said it based its assessment on information available as of Jan. 21.
A return by North Korea to ICBM or nuclear testing would be a massive additional headache for the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden, even as he grapples with the crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
Amid stalled denuclearization talks, North Korea has suggested it could resume testing nuclear weapons or ICBMs.

It tested a record number of missiles in January, including its largest since 2017, and appears to be preparing to launch a spy satellite. 
The United States and 10 other countries on Monday bemoaned the failure of the United Nations Security Council to condemn North Korea's missile launches this year, saying this eroded the credibility both of the council and the global non- proliferation regime.

LVIV/IRPIN, Ukraine (Reuters) - A Western ban on Russian oil imports may more than double the price to $300 a barrel and prompt the closure of the main gas pipeline to Germany, Moscow warned on Monday, as talks on Ukraine hardly advanced amid efforts to agree on civilian safe passage.
Russia's invasion, the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two, has created 1.7 million refugees, a raft of sanctions on Moscow, and fears of wider conflict in the West unthought-of for decades.
Sieges and the bombing continued as Kyiv rejected possible humanitarian corridors to Russia and Belarus, but said some limited progress had been made on agreeing logistics for the evacuation of civilians. 
Moscow would give the residents of the Ukrainian cities of Sumy and Mariupol the choice of moving elsewhere in Ukraine on Tuesday, setting a deadline in the early hours for Kyiv to agree, Russian news agencies reported.
Seeking to ratchet up the pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin, the United States said Washington and its European allies were considering banning Russian oil imports. Oil prices spiked to their highest levels since 2008.
""A rejection of Russian oil would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market,"" said Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, saying the price could more than double to over $300 per barrel.
U.S. President Joe Biden held a video conference call with the leaders of France, Germany and Britain as he pushed for their support on the ban.
But if need be the United States is willing to move ahead without allies in Europe, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Many countries on the continent are heavily reliant on Russian energy.
Germany last month froze the certification of Nord Stream 2 that was due to pipe gas from Russia to Germany. 
""We have every right to take a matching decision and impose an embargo on gas pumping through the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline,"" said Novak. 
The Russian economy, banking system, and currency have been under intense pressure as punishment for the assault on Ukraine. The country will be excluded from all of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)'s fixed income indexes, the bank said in the latest such development on Monday. 
TALKS 'NOT EASY' 
More than 1.7 million Ukrainians have fled to Central Europe since the conflict began on Feb. 24, the United Nations refugee agency said on Monday. 
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.
After the third attempt to ease the bloodshed at talks in Belarus, a Ukrainian negotiator said that although small progress on agreeing logistics for the evacuation of civilians had been made, things remained largely unchanged.
""As of now, there are no results that significantly improve the situation,"" Mykhailo Podolyak said.
Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky told journalists the talks were ""not easy"".
""We hope that from tomorrow these corridors will finally work,"" he said. 
Russia has proposed two corridors inside of Ukraine, according to Interfax.
Escape routes to Russia and Belarus, its close ally, were earlier called ""completely immoral"" by a spokesperson for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
A fourth round of talks are due soon, Russian negotiator Leonid Slutsky told Russian state television.
""Our president is not scared of anything, including a direct meeting with Putin,"" said Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba late on Monday.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Reuters Moscow would halt operations if Ukraine ceased fighting, amended its constitution to declare neutrality, and recognised Russia's annexation of Crimea and the independence of regions held by Russian-backed separatists.
French President Emmanuel Macron, who spoke with Putin multiple times last month in the run-up to the invasion, said he saw no impeding breakthrough.
""I don't think that in the coming days and weeks, there will be a real negotiated solution"", he said. 
FAILED EVACUATIONS
The general staff of Ukraine's armed forces said Russian forces were ""beginning to accumulate resources for the storming of Kyiv"", a city of more than 3 million, after days of slow progress in their main advance south from Belarus.
Outside the capital, attacks continued.
A Russian strike on a bread factory killed 13 in the town of Makariv in the Kyiv region, Ukrainian officials said. Reuters could not verify the details. Russia denies targeting civilians. 
In the encircled southern port city of Mariupol, hundreds of thousands of people remained trapped without food and water under regular bombardments.
Deputy mayor Sergei Orlov told CNN that authorities were ready to evacuate 6,000 people on Saturday but Russians had bombed buses that were to transport them. Moscow has accused the Ukrainians of blocking the planned evacuations.
In the eastern city of Kharkiv, police said the total death toll from the Russian bombardment was 143 since the start of the invasion. It was not possible to verify the toll.
In Irpin, people picked their way over the twisted ruins of a large bridge.
""It's like a disaster,"" a young woman leaving with her children told Reuters.
Ukraine said on Monday its forces had retaken control of the town of Chuhuiv in the northeast after heavy fighting and of the strategic Mykolayiv airport in the south. Neither could immediately be verified.
In a humanitarian update, the United Nations described one psychiatric hospital 60 km (40 miles) from Kyiv running out of water and medicine with 670 people trapped inside, including bedridden patients with severe needs.
U.S. congressional negotiators on Monday were nearing a deal on a bill to provide Ukraine with billions of dollars in emergency aid.
A senior U.S. defence official said Putin had now deployed into Ukraine nearly 100% of the more than 150,000 forces that he had pre-staged outside the country before the invasion.

Moscow has acknowledged nearly 500 deaths among its soldiers, but Western countries say the true number is much higher and Ukraine says it is many thousands.
Death tolls cannot be verified, but footage filmed across Ukraine shows burnt-out wreckage of Russian tanks and armour, and parts of Ukrainian cities reduced to rubble by Russian strikes.

Officials from the two countries discussed easing oil sanctions on the South American country but made little progress towards reaching a deal, five sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Sunday, part of U.S. efforts to separate Russia from one of its key allies.
""Last Saturday night a delegation from the government of the United States of America arrived in Venezuela, I received it here at the presidential palace,"" Maduro said in a broadcast on state media. 
""We had a meeting, I could describe it as respectful, cordial, very diplomatic,"" he said. 
The meeting lasted two hours, he said, without specifying the topics discussed or who the U.S. delegates were. 
Sources previously told Reuters the U.S. delegation was led by Juan Gonzalez, the White House's top adviser on Latin America, U.S. Ambassador James Story, as well as Roger Carstens, the United States' presidential special envoy for hostage affairs.
Earlier, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the purpose of the trip was to discuss a number of issues, including ""energy security"" and the cases of nine U.S. citizens who are in prison in Venezuela.

The talks will continue, Maduro said, without offering a date.
""As I said to the (U.S.) delegation, I reiterate all our will so that from diplomacy, from respect and from the hope of a better world, we can advance in an agenda that allows well-being and peace,"" Maduro said.

22,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 10:30PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Minneapolis public school teachers called a strike on Monday, their first for more than 50 years, leading the school district to cancel classes for 30,000 students beginning Tuesday until the work stoppage is resolved.
Some 4,500 teachers and support staff of the Minneapolis Federation of Teachers plan to form picket lines at school buildings on Tuesday morning and hold a rally and march in the afternoon.
""We are going on strike tomorrow for the safe and stable schools that our students deserve,"" Greta Callahan, teacher chapter president of Minneapolis Federation of Teachers, told a news conference after walking out of talks with district representatives.
""When you have thousands of people saying we will go without pay so that our kids can have the schools that they deserve, you know that something is wrong in the Minneapolis Public Schools,"" Callahan said.
Minneapolis teachers last went on strike in 1970 in an illegal strike that union leaders said ushered in badly needed reforms. 
Teachers are demanding better wages, mental health support and limits on class sizes, saying the Minneapolis Public Schools (MPS) district can afford it given the state of Minnesota's $9 billion budget surplus.
But the district says it is facing a $97.2 million budget shortfall for the coming fiscal year, and that the gap between what the union is demanding and what the district can afford is in the millions of dollars.
Enrollment has fallen by 3,000 students as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, resulting in less funding from the state, while the costs for running schools have increased, the district said in a fact sheet about the strike.
""MPS will remain at the mediation table non-stop in an effort to reduce the length and impact of this strike,"" the district said in a statement announcing the cancellation of classes.

But most of the corridors would travel through Russia or Belarus, something Ukrainian authorities have rejected in the past. 
Civilians leaving the cities of Kyiv, Chernigov and Kharkiv would travel to Russia, some via Belarus, Interfax news agency reported, citing a statement by a Russian committee charged with humanitarian coordination in Ukraine. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has rejected earlier proposals to evacuate Ukrainian citizens into what he has described as ""occupied territory"" in Russia and Belarus. 
People leaving the city of Sumy and Mariupol would, however, be given a choice of passage to Russia or to Ukrainian cities Poltava and Zaporizhia respectively, Interfax quoted the statement as saying. 

Ukraine has been given until 3 a.m. Moscow time (0000 GMT) to agree to the terms, Interfax said.

LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - At an animal shelter in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, Natalia Horobets bid an emotional farewell to her beloved pet cat Charly on Monday.
Horobets and her husband had fled their home in the eastern city of Kramatorsk as Ukrainian troops fought Russian invaders.
But after a difficult journey west on a packed train they finally decided to let their pet go, concluding that setting up a new life hundreds of miles from home would be hard enough without a hyperactive cat to care for.
""Our trip by train lasted for 40 hours,"" Natalia Horobets said in Lviv, which along with the rest of Ukraine's west has so far been largely untouched by the conflict. ""There were many people and we were afraid that he would be trampled.""
Rasma Krecia, a Latvian volunteer, is the rescuer hoping to take Charly and dozens of other pets across the border into Poland until the war is over.
""We’re going to try to take as many animals as we can out, back to Latvia, back to Europe, back to safety,"" Krecia said at the Home for Rescued Animals in Lviv, where she was loading up three vans with the first batch of dogs and cats.
She couldn't have remained in Latvia and done nothing, she told Reuters. ""If I have an opportunity, if I have a large van, if I can bring food here and take some animals back to safety, I can’t stay at home.""
The Lviv sanctuary previously dealt with wild animals and strays, but since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 it has taken in more animals from people fleeing the violence.
Now dogs, cats and even a pet rat jostle for attention alongside foxes and storks.
While Reuters was at the centre, a Lviv resident brought in half a dozen puppies that her friend had found in a box at the train station three days before, where thousands of internally displaced people pass through on a daily basis.
As Krecia prepared to fit cages to her vans, the Horobets family said their final farewells to their cat. 

“Charly, my little one, you will come back home, but you need to stay in a different place for now, you will be good there,” said Natalia Horobets.
Her husband Volodymir said they did not know what their future held: ""We hope that Ukraine will endure and win and we will come back home.""

""The United States appreciates the willingness of Saudi Arabia and other partners to support ongoing U.S. efforts toward a deliberate and thorough process focused on responsibly reducing the detainee population and ultimately closing of the Guantanamo Bay facility,"" the statement said.

According to a Guantanamo detainee profile maintained by the Defense Department, al-Qahtani was trained by al-Quaeda and sought unsuccessfully to enter the United States on Aug. 4, 2001 to take part in the Sept. 11 attacks.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Since the start of the war in Ukraine, Pope Francis has called out ""those who make war"", condemned violation of international law, spoken of people ""oppressed by bombs and fear"" and lamented Ukraine as a ""martyred country"".
But he has shied away from publicly using the words ""Russia"" or ""invasion"" in speaking publicly of the conflict, making him one of the few world leaders not to do so.
On Sunday he came closest to pointing a finger directly at Russia by implicitly rejecting Moscow's use of the term ""special military operation"" for its invasion of Ukraine.
""In Ukraine, rivers of blood and tears are flowing. This is not just a military operation but a war which sows death, destruction and misery,"" he said in his weekly address to crowds gathered in St. Peter's Square.
But again, the R-word and the I-word were notably absent.
""This incomprehensible obstinacy of his is not good,"" said an editorial on the Il Sismografo website, which specialises in Vatican and Catholic affairs.
""The rights of man, of peoples, of nations, are at play here,"" the editorial said, adding that the pope should publicly call out Russian President Vladimir Putin as the aggressor and appeal to Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill, who backs Putin.
But experts say naming and shaming are not part of the Vatican's diplomatic play book.
""These are the nuances that have been practised by Vatican diplomacy throughout the centuries,"" said Victor Gaetan, author of ""God's Diplomats"", a 2021 book about Vatican diplomacy.
""You always leave room for the next conversation, for the next dialogue,"" he told Reuters by telephone from Washington.
MEDIATION POSSIBILITY
On Sunday, the pope said ""the Holy See is willing to do anything to put itself at the service of peace"".
Ukraine has said it would welcome Vatican mediation and Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin has said it is willing to ""facilitate"" dialogue"".
While the pope has not been specific, top aides have been more direct. Parolin described the war as ""unleashed by Russia"", and Cardinal Leonardo Sandri, head of the Vatican department that oversees Eastern-rite Catholic Churches, called it an ""unjustified invasion"".
""Lower-level officials making stronger statements than the pope is a bit of a departure from tradition but it is apparently part of the strategy,"" Gaeten said.
On Feb. 25, a day after the invasion started, the pope, in an unprecedented gesture, went to the Russian embassy to the Vatican to talk to Moscow's ambassador. No details emerged.
One complication for the Vatican is its relations with the Russian Orthodox Church.
In 2016, Francis became the first pope to meet a leader of the Russian Orthodox Church since the great schism that split Christianity into Eastern and Western branches in 1054.
Both sides have declared a willingness to work towards unity but they are still far apart theologically and over what role the papacy would play in an eventually reunited Church.
Any direct criticism by the pope of Russia or Putin could set back relations by decades and thwart a second meeting between the pope and Patriarch Kirill that both sides had hoped to hold this year, diplomats say.
POTENTIAL RELIGIOUS MINEFIELD
Of 300 million Orthodox Christians in the world, about 100 million are in Russia and more than 30 million are in Ukraine, some of those in union with the Russian Orthodox Church.
There are also about 4.5 million Byzantine-rite Catholics in Ukraine who are in allegiance with Rome. They are heavily pro-West and Vatican sources say the pope is keen to avoid anything that could lead to religious strife.
When Kirill and the pope met in Havana in 2016, they issued a joint statement deploring any hostility in Ukraine and vowed that their churches would work for social harmony in the country.
But in recent years Kirill appears to have grown increasingly closer to Putin.
On Sunday, Kirill delivered an anti-West sermon praising the people of Donbass, the separatist region in Eastern Ukraine that is backed by Moscow. He lauded them for resisting what he called sinful Western practices, such as gay pride parades.
Last week Archbishop Stanislaw Gadecki, president of the Polish Bishops Conference, sent a public letter to Kirill asking him to tell Russian soldiers ""not to participate in this unjust war"", calling such a refusal ""a moral obligation"" before God.

Some are calling on the pope to use similarly strong language.

VIENNA (Reuters) -Iran and the United States must take a political decision within days to prevent the failure of indirect talks on reviving the 2015 nuclear deal after 11 months of negotiations rocked by a last-minute Russian demand of a sanctions exemption. 
The European Union's top envoy Enrique Mora, who coordinates the talks, tweeted: ""Just to clarify. There are no longer 'expert level talks.' Nor 'formal meetings.' It is time, in the next few days, for political decisions to end the #ViennaTalks. The rest is noise.""
Mora's Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post followed the departure of Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani on Monday for consultations in Tehran and a report in Iranian media that experts would further pursue talks in Vienna. 
In Washington, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters the United States and its allies are ""getting closer"" to a nuclear deal with Iran but ""important components"" still need to be decided, she said without elaborating.
Should the talks collapse, it could carry the risk of Tehran getting to within a short sprint of nuclear weapons and igniting a fresh war in the Middle East. It could also prompt the West to impose more harsh sanctions on Iran and further escalate world oil prices already strained by the Ukraine conflict. 
Parties involved in the talks between Tehran and world powers in Vienna had said last week that a deal was expected to be reached within days.
European negotiators from France, Britain, and Germany had already temporarily left the talks as they believed they had gone as far as they could go and it was now up to the two main protagonists to agree on outstanding issues, including the extent to which sanctions on Iran would be rolled back. 
Over the weekend Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov complicated matters when he said Moscow wanted a guarantee from the United States that its trade, investment and military-technical cooperation with Iran would not be hindered by sanctions imposed on Russia since it invaded Ukraine.
On Monday, Lavrov insisted on Moscow's demand by telling Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian in a phone conversation that the revived nuclear deal should not allow for any discrimination between participants. 
France on Monday warned Russia not to resort to blackmail over efforts to revive the deal. 
Oil prices hit their highest since 2008 on Monday amid market supply fears as the United States and European allies considered banning Russian oil imports and prospects for a swift return of Iranian crude to global markets receded. 
'TRYING IT ON'
Diplomats have told Reuters that several issues still needed to be resolved in the talks to revive the nuclear pact, under which Tehran limited its nuclear programme in return for relief from U.S., European Union and U.N. sanctions.
In 2018 then-U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned the nuclear pact and reimposed harsh sanctions that squeezed Tehran's oil exports.
Iran analyst at consultancy Eurasia group, Henry Rome, said the talks are ""certainly in a very delicate point"".
""I think the new Russian demand is poised to delay progress further,"" he said. 
While Tehran said it would not allow ""any foreign elements to undermine its national interests"", Iran's top security official, Ali Shamkhani, called on Washington on Monday to make political decisions.
""Priority of Iranian negotiators is to resolve remaining issues that are considered (a) ... red line. Rapid access to a strong deal requires new initiatives from all parties,"" Shamkhani tweeted.
A European diplomat said: ""The Russians are really trying it on and the Iranians aren't happy, although of course not saying too much publicly. We're trying to find a way through.""

Russia's concerns about the impact of Western sanctions on its dealings with Iran follow a push by senior Iranian officials for deeper ties since hardliner Ebrahim Raisi became president last year.
Iran's top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has called for closer ties with Russia due to his deep mistrust of the United States.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States and its allies on Monday urged Russia at the United Nations to allow safe passage to civilians in besieged Ukrainian cities and aid to areas of fighting, saying the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine was rapidly deteriorating.
Envoys from many countries including the United States, Ireland and France as well as U.N. aid chief Martin Griffiths sounded the alarm over the rapidly rising number of civilian casualties, including women and children and displaced people.
""We need Russia’s firm, clear, public and unequivocal commitment to allow and facilitate immediate, unhindered humanitarian access for humanitarian partners in Ukraine,"" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said at the U.N. Security Council meeting called to discuss the humanitarian crisis.
Russia had offered Ukrainians escape routes to Russia and Belarus, its close ally, early on Monday after weekend evacuation ceasefire attempts failed. 
""I don't know of too many Ukrainians who wish to seek refuge in Russia. This is hypocrisy,"" France's ambassador Nicolas de Riviere said.
More than 1.7 million people have fled Ukraine, many Western companies have pulled out and the West has imposed harsh sanctions on Russian banks and President Vladimir Putin.
Vassily Nebenzia, Russian envoy to U.N., accused Ukrainian authorities of not allowing civilians to flee.
Moscow, which denies targeting civilians, has vowed to press ahead with the campaign it launched on Feb. 24 and calls a ""special military operation"".
Griffiths, the U.N. aid chief, told the meeting all parties must take constant care to spare civilians, who should be allowed safe passage to wherever they would like to flee. Humanitarian corridors should also be established, he said.
""Civilians in places like Mariupol, Kharkiv, Melitopol, and elsewhere desperately need aid, especially life-saving medical supplies,"" he said.

Russian forces pressed on with their sieges and bombing of Ukrainian cities on the 12th day of the war. In the encircled southern port city of Mariupol, hundreds of thousands of people remained trapped without food and water under regular bombardments.
Russia's growing reliance on longer-range strikes on Ukrainian targets is increasing the number of civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure, the Pentagon said on Monday.

By Andrew R.C. Marshall
LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Michael Ferkol, who who once served as a supply specialist with engineer battalions in the U.S. Army, had been in Rome studying archaeology when he heard the Ukrainian president's appeal for foreign fighters.
Within days, Ferkol said, he presented himself at a military recruiting office in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, hoping to be taken on as a frontline paramedic.
""I told them I wanted to triage patients,"" said the 29-year- old, who has no combat experience. ""There was a Finnish guy there too, and he was like, 'I just want to kill Russians.'""
Ukraine has established an ""international"" legion for people from abroad and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has publicly urged foreigners to ""fight side-by-side with Ukrainians against the Russian war criminals"" to show support for his country. Last week, Zelenskiy said that more than 16,000 foreigners had volunteered, without specifying how many had arrived.
Some foreign fighters arriving in Ukraine say they are attracted by the cause: to halt what they view as an unprovoked attack in a once-in-a-generation showdown between the forces of democracy and dictatorship. For others, many of them veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, the Ukraine war also offers a chance to use fighting skills they felt their own governments no longer appreciated.
Reuters interviewed 20 foreign fighters or others involved in the effort, and some said that Ukraine is struggling to vet, equip and deploy them.
And alongside battle-hardened veterans of war, people are arriving with little or no combat experience, offering limited value in a war zone under constant, terrifying shelling by the Russian military. One man who identified himself as British military veteran referred to these recruits as ""bullet-catchers.""
A senior Ukrainian official in Lviv involved in processing newly-arrived foreign volunteers, Roman Shepelyak, said the system to receive, train and deploy foreign fighters was still in its infancy, and that the process would get smoother in the coming days. Ukraine's defence ministry declined to comment.
Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, calling it a ""special operation"" to demilitarize Ukraine and capture dangerous nationalists. Ukraine's armed forces are heavily outnumbered by Russia's but have mounted significant resistance.
Among those who have arrived to fight for Ukraine are dozens of former soldiers from the British Army's elite Parachute Regiment, according to an ex-soldier from the regiment. Hundreds more would soon follow, he said. Reuters was unable to corroborate those numbers. 
Often referred to as the Paras, the regiment has in recent years served in Afghanistan and Iraq. ""They're all highly, highly trained, and have seen active service on numerous occasions,"" the ex-soldier from the regiment said. The Ukraine crisis will give them purpose, camaraderie and ""a chance to do what they're good at: fight.""
Michael Ferkol said there were many people with Ukrainian ancestry in his hometown, Chicago. He wanted to go to Kyiv, the capital, ""and help out.""
""I'm a little nervous, to be honest,"" he said, making his way through crowds of refugees at Lviv train station on Saturday, hoping to board a train to the frontline. ""But at the same time, it's not about me. It's about the people that are suffering.""
'HAVE GUN WILL TRAVEL'
For some, travelling to Ukraine, even from far-away countries, was the easy part. Those who hadn't brought body armour, helmets and other equipment with them were struggling to source them in Ukraine, according to several fighters Reuters spoke to.
Some veterans were sharing information on equipment and logistics through invite-only Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or WhatsApp groups with names like ""Have Gun Will Travel."" These groups contain appeals for equipment, such as body armour and night-vision goggles, or for foreign veterans who are snipers or who can train Ukrainian soldiers in how to use sophisticated weapons that Western countries are sending.
With a vast mobilisation of Ukrainian men underway, the country has plenty of volunteer fighters. But there is a shortage of specialists who know how to use Javelin and NLAW anti-tank missiles, which professional soldiers train for months to use properly.
Even those with combat experience might struggle in Ukraine's war zones, warned a former British soldier, who asked to be identified by his nickname, Kruger. He said he had served in Afghanistan and trained other soldiers.
""If you're out here as a war tourist, this is not the place for you,"" he said. ""The realities of war, if you head out to the front, are going to be pretty overwhelming.""
Many of those arriving in Lviv end up at the semi-fortified offices of the Lviv regional administration, where their paperwork is checked by Shepelyak. He heads the region's department for international technical assistance and cooperation. He acknowledged the system for processing those offering to fight was still in its infancy.
On Friday, when Reuters visited, six foreigners appeared at Shepelyak's office, including a Polish military veteran called Michal, and a giant, heavily-tattooed Dutchman called Bert. Both men declined to give their full names.
More foreigners were arriving every day, Shepelyak told Reuters. ""If they have such a desire and persuasion to serve a foreign country, it matters. They are important.""
Shepelyak said he vetted their paperwork, but not their combat experience, which was evaluated at a military base outside Lviv where they were sent next. He added that those recruited into the Ukrainian army would be paid in line with other soldiers.
Other foreign fighters told Reuters they were bypassing the formal processes and heading straight for the eastern front, hoping to get weapons and orders from the Ukrainian military upon their arrival.
DELAYED DEPARTURES
The logistical issues have prompted some fighters to delay their arrival.
Anthony Capone, a wealthy healthcare entrepreneur in New York City, said he is providing funding for hundreds of ex-soldiers and paramedics who want to go to Ukraine. But he said he had delayed their departure ""to give the Ukrainian army another week to improve their enlistment process for those entering the volunteer corps.""
So far, according to Capone, only a ""small number"" had arrived in neighbouring Poland. Capone had posted on LinkedIn his message offering funding, thinking that 10 or 15 people would reply. ""Right now, I'm at about 1,000,"" he said.
Capone added he was only funding ex-soldiers whose military credentials he could verify, or paramedics who currently worked in an emergency trauma setting.
About 60% of those who had been in touch were American and 30% European, with the remainder hailing from at least 25 countries as far-flung as Colombia, Japan and Jamaica, Capone said. 
Most were ex-soldiers; the rest were emergency medics or critical care nurses. They're willing to ""defend a country they've never visited,"" said Capone, a specialist in computational learning theory.
The U.S. government has discouraged citizens from travelling to Ukraine to combat Russian forces. Some countries have issued stronger warnings, including Britain. Others, such as Canada or Germany, have cleared the way for their citizens to get involved.
A CONNECTION IN KYIV
In central Lviv on Thursday, a burly, Russian-speaking Canadian, who identified himself only as Sig, heaved bags of equipment into the back of a minivan he had bought in Poland and driven to Lviv.
He wore a flak jacket bristling with medical tools, and said he usually worked as a civilian paramedic.
Another of Sig's four-strong team was an American who said he was born in the former Soviet republic of Georgia and had fought Russians ""for generations.""
In Sig's bags were hundreds of kilograms of equipment, including medical supplies and military rations known as MREs, or meals ready to eat. Sig said his team planned to help train Ukrainian volunteers in Lviv for a day, before heading straight for the front. 
""I have a connection in Kyiv who will help us out,"" he said.
Standing outside the ticket hall of Lviv station on Sunday were a group of British men in military uniform, waiting for a train to Kyiv. They were in high spirits, often exchanging fist-bumps and handshakes with Ukrainian refugees who thanked them for fighting for their country.

They were led by Ben Grant, a strapping Englishman from Essex, who said he had served in Britain's Royal Marines and had just completed a stint as a security advisor in Iraq. He was unclear whether his men would be deployed independently or as part of a Ukrainian unit.
Of the Ukrainian soldiers, Grant added: ""They seem strong - really strong. I'm more than happy to fight next to them.""

(Reuters) -Bill Cosby avoided renewed legal jeopardy on Monday when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a bid by prosecutors to undo last year's ruling in Pennsylvania that overturned the 84-year-old actor and comedian's 2018 sexual assault conviction. 
The justices let stand the decision by a divided Pennsylvania Supreme Court that Cosby should never have faced the charges because a previous local district attorney had publicly promised in 2005 not to prosecute him, turning away an appeal by prosecutors. The state court's ruling freed Cosby after he spent nearly three years in state prison, angering sexual assault victims and their advocates.
Cosby was sentenced to three to 10 years in prison following his conviction on three counts of aggravated indecent assault for drugging and molesting Andrea Constand, a former employee of his alma mater Temple University, at his home in 2004.
He was the first celebrity to be convicted of sexual abuse since the #MeToo movement began exposing sexual misconduct among powerful men in Hollywood and beyond. 
Cosby is best known for his role as the lovable husband and father in the classic 1980s television comedy series ""The Cosby Show."" He also was an influential stand-up comedian.
His family-friendly reputation was shattered after more than 50 women accused him of sexual assaults spanning nearly five decades. Constand's allegations were the only ones against Cosby that were not too old to allow for criminal charges.
His lawyers argued on appeal that Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele should not have charged Cosby in 2015 in the Constand case because Bruce Castor, who previously held the job, had declined to file criminal charges and issued a press release announcing his decision. 
Steele on Monday said appealing to the Supreme Court in a bid to reinstate the conviction was the right thing to do, and expressed his appreciation to Constand.
""All crime victims deserve to be heard, treated with respect and be supported through their day in court. I wish her the best as she moves forward in her life,"" Steele said.
Cosby's attorney Jennifer Bonjean told Reuters: ""Although we are relieved to have this saga behind us, it is not the least bit surprising"" that the Supreme Court denied the district attorney's appeal, calling it ""patently frivolous."" 
The earlier refusal to prosecute meant Cosby could not avoid testifying in a civil case Constand had brought against him, which led to a multimillion-dollar settlement. That testimony, in which Cosby acknowledged giving sedatives to women, played a role in Steele's criminal case against Cosby.
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court in June 2021 ruled that the prosecution was fundamentally unfair because Cosby had relied on Castor's promise to his detriment, in violation of Cosby's right to due process of law under the U.S. Constitution. 
In appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court, Steele said the state court's ""dangerous precedent"" wrongly transformed a bare press release into an effective immunity that has ""paved the road for thousands of other defendants to raise this issue and to seek similar windfalls.""

Cosby's first trial ended with a hung jury in 2017, when jurors could not reach a unanimous decision on his culpability. He was convicted at a second trial after the judge let prosecutors call as witnesses five prior accusers - four more than in the first trial.
Prosecutors argued that Cosby's assault of Constand was a well-rehearsed offense he had honed over decades: befriending younger women and acting as a mentor, only to sexually assault them, often with the assistance of drugs.

Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson ""underscored their commitment to continue providing security, economic, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine,"" the White House said in a statement. 
NATO countries have ramped up their presence in the Baltic nations since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine and more troops and equipment are on the way, policy makers have said.
After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the White House slapped sanctions on exports of technologies to Russia’s refineries and the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which has never launched. So far, it has stopped short of targeting Russia’s oil and gas exports as the Biden administration weighs the impacts on global oil markets and U.S. energy prices.
The United States and European partners are exploring banning Russian oil imports, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday, but stressed the importance of steady oil supplies globally.

Two sources told Reuters on Monday the Biden administration was willing to move ahead with a ban on Russian oil imports into the United States without the participation of allies in Europe.
Oil prices have soared over the past week after the United States and its allies sanctioned Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization has confirmed at least nine people had died in 16 attacks on health care facilities in Ukraine since the start of a Russian invasion on Feb. 24, it said on Monday.
The WHO said the attacks https://extranet.who.int/ssa/LeftMenu/PublicReportList.aspx?start=2022-02-24&end=2022-03-07&countryList=229&typeList=0 took place between Feb. 24 and March 3. In addition to the nine deaths, 16 people were injured, including seven health workers.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Sunday that several attacks had occurred, without giving details, adding they were a violation of international humanitarian law.

The WHO gave no information on the perpetrators since its surveillance system has no mandate to collect information on them.

(Reuters) - U.S. immigration authorities released new policies on Monday that will make it easier for immigrant minors who are victims of parental abuse and neglect to qualify for green cards, finalizing changes first proposed more than a decade ago.
The rules from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) expand the pool of individuals who are eligible for ""special immigrant juvenile"" (SIJ) status and clarify the types of evidence that must be submitted to support an application.
The program created in 1990 allows immigrants under 21 to apply for permanent residency in the United States if a state court determines that they need protection and that returning to their home countries would be unsafe. Since 2010, more than 130,000 applications have been approved.
Immigrant advocates and attorneys have turned to the SIJ program as one avenue to offer young migrants who had come from violent pasts a path to legal residency in the United States. But some critics have criticized the program as a loophole that is too permissive and encourages more migration.
During the Trump administration, USCIS dramatically increased requests for documentation from applicants for SIJ status, drawing out many cases.
The agency also denied many petitions filed by applicants over the age of 18, reasoning that they were ineligible because state family courts lacked jurisdiction over them.
The rules adopted on Monday are designed to streamline the process, USCIS said, by making clear what types of documents are needed to prove eligible for SIJ status. They also make clear that any individual younger than 21 may apply for the program.

USCIS Director Ur Jaddou in a statement said the policies would help children who are abused or abandoned rebuild their lives in the United States. 
""These policies will provide humanitarian protection to vulnerable young people for whom a juvenile court has determined that it is in their best interest to remain in the United States,"" she said.

35,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 11:36AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Steady winds across Florida's Panhandle stoked a rash of wildfires on Monday that ignited in thickets of dead vegetation left in the wake of a 2018 hurricane, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of houses and a nursing home. 
The largest of the blazes, known as the Bertha Swamp Road fire, scorched 12,000 acres (4,800 hectares) and was 10% contained as it burned near communities east of Panama City, said Florida Forest Service spokesperson Joe Zwierzchowski. 
""We have another day of pretty steady winds pushing fire toward these communities,"" he said. ""Increased cloud cover, increased humidity should help tap down some of the fire behavior we have seen."" 
No injuries or fatalities have been reported.
Two smaller fires - the 840-acre (340-hectare) Adkins Avenue Fire and the 250-acre (100-hectare) Star Avenue Fire - were also burning to the east of Panama City, where more than a dozen homes were damaged over the weekend. The two fires were about 40% contained, Zwierzchowski said. 
The three fires have forced the evacuation of about 700 homes. A 120-bed veteran's nursing home in Panama City was also evacuated due to the smoke, he said. 
Dead vegetation and timber left behind from Hurricane Michael, which struck the Panhandle in 2018, has fueled the wildfires, Zwierzchowski said. 

The 72 million tons of thick vegetation left behind by the Category 5 storm has been dried by drought-like conditions in the area, which has not received significant rain in three months, he said.
""We have been bracing for this,"" said Zwierzchowski, noting that the some 600 miles (965 km) of fire line have been installed to prevent the spread of wildfires. ""Our worst-case scenarios have come to fruition.""

RIGA/VILNIUS (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken sought on Monday to reassure Washington's Baltic allies who fear President Vladimir Putin will not stop at Ukraine in trying to redraw the borders of Europe. 
Blinken spent the weekend in Ukraine's neighbours Poland and Moldova before visiting Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, NATO members that were once ruled from Moscow and fear they could face Russian aggression next. 
Addressing Blinken, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda warned that ""Russia's reckless aggression"" could lead to a ""third world war"". 
""Deterrence is no longer enough and we need forward defence here in place because otherwise it will be too late here, Mr Secretary. Putin will not stop in Ukraine if he will not be stopped,"" Nauseda said.
Russia calls the campaign it launched on Feb. 24 a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.
Blinken later met Latvia's Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics in Riga on Monday as well as the prime minister and president. Rinkevics called for a permanent presence of U.S. troops in the Baltic country.
""We have no illusions about Putin's Russia anymore, we don't really see any good reason to assume Russia might change its policy,"" Rinkevics told a joint news conference with Blinken.
Blinken said in Vilnius NATO was continuously reviewing its defence posture, including by looking at more permanent deployments, as Baltic countries have requested.
""No one should doubt our readiness, no one should doubt our resolve,"" he said.
The U.S. commitment to NATO's Article 5 guarantee of mutual defence between member states was ""sacrosanct"", Blinken added.
BATTLE DRONES
NATO countries have ramped up their presence in the Baltic nations and more troops and equipment are on the way, policy makers have announced. Some 400 U.S. troops from the First Armored Brigade Combat Team would be arriving in Lithuania in the coming days, Blinken said.
The Lithuanian government later announced an agreement to ramp up military spending this year, with additional funds to be spent on Javelin anti-tank weapons, battle drones, optical sights and other gear as well as upgrades to its military bases.
Lithuania also joined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in calling for an embargo on Russian energy. Blinken said on Sunday the United States and European allies were exploring banning imports of Russian oil.
""Energy sources which we import pay for the Russian military operation. We cannot pay for oil and gas with the blood of Ukraine,"" Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told a joint news conference with Blinken.
Russian gas cannot be easily replaced, however. Norway, Europe's second largest supplier, is already operating at maximum capacity, and Europe's existing LNG terminals have limited available capacity to absorb extra supply.

Blinken earlier told staff of the U.S. Embassy in Vilnius that Russia's invasion of Ukraine challenged basic principles designed to keep the peace between nations.
""It's important that people understand what's actually at stake and it goes beyond even Ukraine, beyond even the Baltic countries, beyond even Europe,"" Blinken said.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) -Ukraine sought an emergency order from the United Nations' highest court on Monday to halt hostilities on its territory, arguing that Russia - which boycotted the hearing - had falsely applied genocide law to justify its invasion. 
The hearing was held at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) without legal representation for Russia. 
""The fact that Russia's seats are empty speaks loudly. They are not here in this court of law: they are on a battlefield waging an aggressive war against my country,"" Ukrainian envoy Anton Korynevych said. 
The court said it regretted Russia's non-attendance. After Ukraine presented its arguments Monday the court said it would start deliberations and rule ""as soon as possible"".
Countries usually, but not always, follow the court's orders, which are legally binding. A spokesperson for the Russian Embassy in the Netherlands did not reply to a request for comment.
After the hearing Korynevych stressed that Russia's absence would not impact the proceedings and Moscow would have to heed any court orders. 
""They need to listen and they must listen to the court, under international law,"" he told reporters.
'NO EVIDENCE' OF GENOCIDE
Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Russia's ""special military action"" is needed ""to protect people who have been subjected to bullying and genocide"" - meaning those whose first or only language is Russian - in eastern Ukraine.
Russian-backed separatists have fought Ukrainian forces in two eastern breakaway regions of the country since 2014, with some 15,000 people killed, according to the government in Kyiv.
A leading association of genocide scholars has backed Ukraine and Western powers' view that Russia was misappropriating the term genocide to describe the treatment of Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine.
""There is absolutely no evidence that there is genocide going on in Ukraine,"" Melanie O'Brien, president of international Association of Genocide Scholars, told Reuters.
Russia's new invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24. Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians in the assault. The official U.N. civilian death toll is 406, including 27 children, though officials say the true toll is probably higher.
The case centres on the interpretation of a 1948 treaty on the prevention of genocide, signed by both countries. The treaty names the ICJ as the forum for resolving disputes between signatories.
Kyiv's legal team stressed on Monday that Moscow was violating and abusing the treaty by using it as a justification for war.
The world was witnessing Russia kill civilians with indiscriminate attacks, Oksana Zolotaryova of the Ukrainian foreign ministry, told the court.

""We don't know yet the true number of Ukrainians that Russia has murdered in the past 11 days. We can only guess how many more will be murdered in the next 11 days if this senseless aggression does not stop,"" she said, as she asked the court to grant the provisional measures. 
The ICJ is the highest court for resolving disputes between states, and while cases there usually take years, it has a fast-track procedure to look at requests for ""provisional measures"", to prevent a situation from worsening.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) -The Ukrainian envoy to Israel voiced frustration on Monday with its refusal to provide what his country deems defensive aid against Russia, donning a helmet at a news conference and asking rhetorically how such equipment could be regarded as lethal.
But Ambassador Yevgen Korniychuk also voiced gratitude for Israel's efforts to mediate between Russia and Ukraine, saying this outweighed any possible military assistance from it. 
While condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Israel has limited itself to humanitarian relief and kept up contacts with Moscow. Israel coordinates strikes against Iranian deployments in Syria with Russia's military garrison there, and is mindful of the big power's sway over nuclear talks with Tehran.
Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett held surprise talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday, casting the three-hour meeting as a peacemaking bid at which Iran was discussed too. The Kremlin has not commented. 
""Everyone must do everything, everything in their capacity to stop this terrible human tragedy, which no one thought we would see in our lifetimes,"" Bennett said in a TV interview, offering no more details on the Moscow talks.
Koriychuk said Bennett had pledged to try to mediate ""even if there is just one percent (chance) of success"".
""This is much more important than, for example, sales of weapons or munitions, et cetera, that we are still fighting (about) with the Israeli government,"" the diplomat said, adding that Kyiv understood Bennett's limitations on the aid issue.
Still, Koriychuk noted that Ukraine also had an unmet request for Israeli protective vests and helmets, one of which he stood to place on his head as he spoke.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) -Forty-nine mushers and their teams of huskies trotted through Alaska's largest city on Saturday to start the 50th annual running of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, an event transformed by climate change and commercialism since its humble beginnings.
The starting gate has been returned to downtown Anchorage, a year after the COVID-19 pandemic prompted organizers to launch the 2021 race from a secluded riverside spot north of the city and off limits to the usual crowds of spectators.
Contestants forged through unusually warm and sloppy
conditions on the first day of the run, with temperatures hovering between freeze and thaw. Wet snow soaked teams and spectators lining the city trail.
Fortunately for the mushers and dog teams more accustomed to crisp, cold weather, the 11-mile (17.7-km) Anchorage portion of
the race is merely ceremonial, with timed competition starting
on Sunday at Willow, about a 75-mile drive north.
The overall trail has been restored to its traditional 1,000-mile (1,600-km) distance from Anchorage to the Bering Sea gold-rush town of Nome after a COVID-forced shortening of the course last year. Still, several pandemic restrictions remain in effect.
Mushers, volunteers and fans gathered for this year's renewal of Iditarod festivities in Anchorage were instructed to mask up and take other precautions to prevent the spread of the lingering virus.
    The pandemic also forced one last-minute switch. Nic Petit, a top musher, had to pull out of the race after testing positive for COVID-19. Four-time champion Jeff King, who had planned to sit out this year's contest, then stepped in to drive Petit’s dog team to Nome.
King got the call from Petit on Tuesday afternoon. He said Petit is trusting him to manage “a really nice dog team.”
“I think he knows I know what I’m doing,” King said at the downtown Anchorage start area. 
    Other returning winners are Dallas Seavey, who claimed a record-tying fifth victory last year, and his father, Mitch Seavey, a three-time champion who holds the Iditarod speed record of eight days, 3 hours and 40:13 minutes.
The field also includes Pete Kaiser, who in 2019 became the first Native Yup'ik musher to win the race, 2018 champion Joar Leifseth Ulsom of Norway, and four-time winner Martin Buser.
Those and others should be contenders for this year’s title, said Leifseth Ulsom. “A whole bunch of them are really good teams,” the Norwegian said in the Anchorage starting area.
Seventeen of this year’s mushers are women. The Iditarod is one of the few high-profile sports evens where women and men compete on equal footing.
HUMBLE BEGINNINGS
The Iditarod has come a long way in the half century since it began in 1973 as a low-budget, novelty event that drew a field of all-amateur mushers and took the winner 20 days to complete.
Now, top Iditarod contestants are professionals with high-tech gear bearing sponsors' logos. Teams are tracked by global positioning satellite, and live coverage is beamed worldwide to audiences through internet streaming services. Winners typically reach the finish line in just nine days.
The modern race attracts major corporate backing, though in recent years, animal rights activists who condemn the race as cruel to the dogs have pressured some companies to drop support.
Climate change has wrought some of the greatest changes in the world's most famous sled-dog race, as it has for much of life in the far north.
Three times, most recently in 2017, unseasonably warm conditions forced the Iditarod to move its day-two restart - following the ceremonial Anchorage launch - much farther north, to Fairbanks.
In 2020, flooding swamped the ultra-thin Bering Sea ice that teams had to skirt near the end of the race. Three racers and their dogs had to be rescued from the coastal site only 25 miles (40 km) from the Nome finish line. Contestants who followed had to be rerouted farther inland to avoid standing water.
The course, though running at full length again this year, has still been altered somewhat, with checkpoints relocated to minimize contact with Native Alaska villages that remain vigilant against renewed coronavirus outbreaks because of scarce healthcare resources.

Organizers say such precautions are fitting for an annual race that honors a famed dog-sled relay run nearly a century ago to deliver diphtheria serum to Nome in 1925.
""Vaccinations and dogs and Iditarod go way back, to the beginning of the race,” said Paige Drobny, a musher from Cantwell, Alaska, who is promoting vaccination on behalf of her sponsor, a Fairbanks healthcare consortium.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand is scrambling to encourage its people to have more babies to arrest a slumping birth rate, offering parents childcare and fertility centres, while also tapping social media influencers to showcase the joys of family life.
The campaign comes as the number of births has dropped by nearly a third since 2013, when they started declining. Last year saw 544,000 births, the lowest in at least six decades and below the 563,000 deaths, which were also swelled by coronavirus-related fatalities.
While Thailand's demographic path is similar to other Asian economies like Japan or Singapore, as an emerging market relying on cheap labour and a growing middle class the implications for Southeast Asia's second-biggest economy are far more profound. 
""The data reflects a population crisis ... where the mindset towards having children has changed,"" said Teera Sindecharak, an expert on demography at Thammasat University. 
Senior health official Suwannachai Wattanayingcharoenchai told Reuters the government recognised a need to intervene. 
""We are trying to slow down the decline in births and reverse the trend by getting families that are ready to have children faster,"" he said, describing plans to introduce policies so that newborns get the full support of the state. 
The plans include opening fertility centres, currently limited to Bangkok and other major cities, in 76 provinces and also using social media influencers to back up the message, officials said. 
Such policies may come too late for people like Chinthathip Nantavong, 44, who decided with her partner of 14 years not to have children. 
""Raising one child costs a lot. A semester for kindergarten is already 50,000 to 60,000 baht ($1,520 to $1,850) and then it reaches millions later,"" she said, adding that other countries have better care facilities and welfare policies.
""SUPER-AGED SOCIETY"" 
Thailand is not alone in the region struggling with low fertility rates, but is less wealthy than some more developed countries that have been forced to rely on migrant workers to support their economies. 
Experts said it is hard to reverse a situation where social conditions have changed and attitudes towards having children are now coloured by concerns over rising debt and elderly care. 
Thailand is heading towards becoming a ""super-aged society"" where the number of people over 60 will account for more than a fifth of the population, academic Teera said. About 18% of Thailand's population is aged over 60. 
The ratio of working-aged to elderly people last year was 3.4, but by 2040 officials forecast it could be 1.7.
""The manufacturing sector will face productivity slumps ... so we have to develop skilled labour and adopt the use of automated technologies,"" the head of the state-planning agency, Danucha Pichayanan, told a recent business forum. Thailand is a major regional manufacturing sector for automotive and electronics.
Danucha also noted the demographic trend could also strain government finances and experts have said welfare for the elderly is not seen as sufficient even today, with monthly allowances of 600 to 1,000 baht.
""WE HAVE A CAT"" 
""It's become more difficult in deciding to have children,"" said Teera, noting in the last decade the economy had been sluggish, while living costs increased and income growth slowed.
Political division, rising debt and education costs were also major factors determining attitudes towards having children, and short-term remedies may not be enough, experts said.
Household debt has grown to nearly 90% of gross domestic product, from 59% in 2010, Bank of Thailand data showed. 
Thailand has also been rocked by political instability over most of the past two decades, with two military coups and large anti-government protests. 
But for many like Chinthathip, who has chosen not to have children, the expense remains the main issue.
""The middle class, office workers or people that are trying make ends meet think the same way,"" said Chinthathip.

""Right now we have a cat and it's not as costly as a child.""

Thousands of protesters chanted ""No to war!"" and ""Shame on you!"", according to videos posted on social media by opposition activists and bloggers. 
Dozens of protesters in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg were shown being detained. One protester there was shown being beaten on the ground by police in riot gear. A mural in the city showing President Vladimir Putin was defaced. 
Reuters was unable to independently verify the footage and photographs on social media. Russia's interior ministry said earlier that police had detained around 3,500 people, including 1,700 in Moscow, 750 in St Petersburg and 1,061 in other cities. 
The interior ministry said 5,200 people had taken part in the protests. The OVD-Info protest monitoring group said it had documented the detention of at least 4,366 people in 56 different cities.
""The screws are being fully tightened - essentially we are witnessing military censorship,"" Maria Kuznetsova, OVD-Info's spokeswoman, said by telephone from Tbilisi. 
""We are seeing rather big protests today, even in Siberian cities where we only rarely saw such numbers of arrests.""
The last Russian protests with a similar number of arrests were in January 2021, when thousands demanded the release of opposition leader Alexei Navalny after he was arrested on returning from Germany where he had been recovering from a nerve agent poisoning. 
Some Russian state-controlled media carried short reports about Sunday's protests but they did not feature high in news bulletins. 
Russia's RIA news agency said the Manezhnaya Square in Moscow, adjoining the Kremlin, had been ""liberated"" by police, who had arrested some participants of an unsanctioned protest against the military operation in Ukraine. 
CHURCH SUPPORT
RIA also showed footage of what appeared to be supporters of the Kremlin driving along the embankment in Moscow with Russian flags and displaying the ""Z"" and ""V"" markings used by Russian forces on tanks operating in Ukraine.
Patriarch Kirill, head of the Russian Orthodox Church, said Russian values were being tested by the West, which offered only excessive consumption and the illusion of freedom. 
Putin, Russia's paramount leader since 1999, calls the invasion, launched on Feb. 24, a ""special military operation"". He says it is aimed at defending Ukraine's Russian-speaking communities against persecution and preventing the United States from using Ukraine to threaten Russia.
The West has called his arguments a baseless pretext for war and imposed sanctions that aim to cripple the Russian economy. The United States, Britain and some other NATO members have supplied arms to Ukraine. 
Navalny had called for protests on Sunday across Russia and the rest of the world against the invasion.
About 2,000 people attended an anti-war protest in Kazakhstan's biggest city Almaty, according to videos posted on social media. Reuters was unable to independently verify the posts. 
The crowd shouted slogans such as ""No to war!"" and obscenities directed at Putin while waving Ukrainian flags. 

Blue and yellow balloons were placed in the hand of a statue of Lenin towering over the small square where the rally took place.
The Russian state polling agency VTsIOM said Putin's approval rating had risen 6 percentage points to 70% in the week to Feb. 27. FOM, which provides research for the Kremlin, said his rating had risen 7 percentage points to 71% in the same period.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea appears preparing to launch a reconnaissance satellite, a move that may prove as controversial as the nuclear-armed country's weapons tests because they use the same banned ballistic missile technology, experts say.
North Korea conducted a record number of missile launches in January, and has suggested it could resume testing of nuclear weapons or its longest-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) for the first time since 2017.
After a test of satellite-related systems during a missile launch on Sunday - the second such test in a week - some experts think it is just a matter of time before North Korea attempts to put a satellite in orbit.
Here's what we know about North Korea's race for space, and why it's so controversial:
HISTORY OF LAUNCHES
Since 1998 North Korea has launched five satellites, of which two appeared to have been successfully placed in orbit, including its last in 2016.
International observers said the satellite appeared to be under control, but there was lingering debate over whether it had sent any transmissions.
Experts at the time of the 2016 launch said that North Korea had used a three-stage rocket booster like the Unha-3 of previous launches, but that a new launch pad was clearly built for a larger rocket.
A senior official at North Korea's space agency said after the launch that it planned to put more advanced satellites into orbit by 2020 and eventually ""plant the flag of (North Korea) on the moon"". The country has not launched any more satellites since then, however.
During a party congress in January 2021, leader Kim Jong Un revealed a wish list that included developing military reconnaissance satellites.
DUAL-USE TECHNOLOGY
The United States and its allies called North Korea's latest tests of satellite systems clear violations of United Nations Security Council resolutions, which prohibit any development of technology applicable to North Korea's ballistic missile programmes.
North Korea has said its space programme and defence activities are its sovereign right.
At the time of the 2016 space launch, North Korea had yet to fire an ICBM. The satellite launch was condemned by governments in the United States and South Korea as a disguised test of ballistic missile technology capable of striking the continental United States.
""The obvious concern is that North Korea is testing ballistic missiles and only pretending to care about satellites,"" the U.S.-based monitoring program 38 North said in a report at the time.
The report said the Unha-3 system would be ungainly to use as a weapon because it required a fixed launching site and a long period for preparation, and predicted that North Korea would not develop an operational road-mobile ICBM until some time after 2020.
North Korea launched its first road-mobile ICBM the next year, and later test fired several more.

North Korea has not test fired an ICBM since 2017, but now officials in Washington and Seoul fear a new satellite launch could help the country further improve its ballistic missiles.
""In the future, if North Korea launches intercontinental ballistic missiles under the pretext of launching a satellite, it will face stronger pressure from the international community,"" Yoon Suk-yeol, the main conservative candidate in Wednesday's presidential election in South Korea, said in a statement after the latest launch.

The Philippines until now has had one of the world's lowest minimum ages of sexual consent, behind Nigeria's age of 11, according to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
A joint 2015 study by UNICEF and the Center for Women's Resources, a local non-governmental group, showed seven of 10 rape victims in the Philippines were children. 
One in five respondents age 13 to 17 reported experiencing sexual violence, while one in 25 experienced forced consummated sex during childhood, the study said.
Under the bill endorsed by Duterte, which is gender neutral, any adult engaging in sexual contact with anyone 16 or under would be committing statutory rape, unless the age difference between them was three years or less and sex was proven to be consensual, and neither abusive nor exploitative.
The exemption does not apply if the one of those involved was under 13. 
""We welcome this legal development and hope that it will help protect young girls from rape and sexual abuse,"" said Josalee Deinla, spokesperson of the National Union of Peoples' Lawyers, which provides legal help to poor and marginalised people in the Philippines.

Lawrence Fortun, one of the bill's main sponsors, described it as ""a major step forward"".
""I am elated that our collective efforts at pushing for stronger protection against rape and other forms of sexual abuse are advancing,"" he said in a statement.

IRPIN, Ukraine (Reuters) -Ukrainians fleeing the town of Irpin just outside Kyiv were caught in shelling by Russian forces on Sunday and forced to dive for cover, Reuters witnesses said.
Irpin, some 25 km (16 miles) northwest of the capital, has seen intense fighting in recent days. Russia's military is closing in on the Kyiv, which was home to around 3.4 million people before the invasion sparked an exodus of civilians.
Irpin residents scurried along pavements clutching children, luggage and pets as they made their way to waiting buses and cars that would take them further from the clashes.
Soldiers and fellow residents helped elderly men and women who were falling behind. Some people crouched down when explosions went off nearby, apparently from mortar rounds.
Reuters reporters did not witness casualties in the shelling, but several news outlets said that at least three people were killed - a woman and two children.
The New York Times published a photograph https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/03/06/world/06ukraine-briefing-top1/merlin_203332950_e825298f-392e-45f1-ae70-88638a43a640-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp it said was of four members of a family - a woman, a man and two children - lying on the ground in Irpin.
The caption said they were trying to flee when a mortar struck, and that the father, being tended to by Ukrainian soldiers in the image, was the only one still with a pulse.
Reuters could not independently verify what happened.
Ukraine's Interior Ministry said on Sunday it would continue the evacuation of civilians from Irpin after recent shelling of the town and its environs.
The State Emergency Service also said it was setting up tents to provide medical care to all those who needed it.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has driven more than 1.5 million people to flee to neighbouring countries in the fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War Two, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said on Sunday.
Millions more have been displaced internally, trying to get to the relative safety of western Ukraine.
BARRICADES AND TRENCHES
In Kyiv itself, Ukrainian soldiers bolstered defences by digging trenches, blocking roads and liaising with civil defence units as Russian forces bombarded the surrounding areas.
While the armed forces and civilian volunteers dug in, thousands of people continued to try to flee the city as fears of a full assault mounted.
Russia has concentrated much of its firepower on the south and east of the country since its assault began on Feb. 24, besieging cities including Mariupol and Kharkiv with shelling and air strikes and causing extensive damage and casualties.
Kyiv has been spared the worst of the fighting so far, but intense battles have raged in neighbouring towns and villages and Russia's defence ministry released footage on Sunday of some of its tracked military vehicles on the move near the capital.
Video provided by Ukraine's armed forces taken on Saturday in the Kyiv region showed Ukrainian efforts to defend the capital, with piles of sandbags and concrete slabs laid across a main road where Ukrainian soldiers checked passing cars.
A smaller road was blocked by metal ""hedgehog"" anti-tank barriers, and machine gun positions had been erected. Civilians who have vowed to join the battle to protect Kyiv stored dozens of Molotov cocktails.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" designed to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy remains in Ukraine and has called on his people to defend their country.
Kateryna Laskari, a production company executive, left her home city Kyiv soon after the invasion began.
She reached a small village 50 km (31 miles) away where her family has a house, and has stayed there with her three-year-old son, Simon, her pregnant sister, who is due to give birth in two weeks and their parents.

""Of course, I'm frightened as is everybody, but I have so many people I'm responsible for. I'm responsible for my family, I'm responsible for my business,"" she told Reuters via Zoom.
""But to tell the truth, I thought I would be even more frightened. Now I feel like a soldier. I feel that I have a lot of energy to just to fight, because I know that we will win.""

LVIV/KYIV, Ukraine (Reuters) -Fighting stopped about 200,000 people from evacuating the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol for a second day in a row on Sunday, as Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to press ahead with his invasion unless Kyiv surrendered.
Most people trapped in the port city are sleeping underground to escape more than six days of near-constant shelling by encircling Russian forces that has cut off food, water, power and heating supplies, according to the Ukrainian authorities. 
In a phone call with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, Putin said he was ready for dialogue to end the fighting but that any attempt to draw out talks would fail, according to the Kremlin. 
The suspension of what Moscow describes as a special operation, ""is only possible if Kyiv stops military operations and carries out well-known Russian demands,"" the Kremlin said in a readout of the Putin-Erdogan call. 
The civilian death toll from hostilities across Ukraine since Moscow launched its invasion on Feb. 24 stood at 364, including more than 20 children, the United Nations said on Sunday, adding that hundreds more were injured.
The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said most civilian casualties were caused by the use of ""explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes.""
Russia has launched about 600 missiles so far, according to a senior U.S. defense official. 
The general staff of Ukraine's armed forces said the Russians were ""beginning to accumulate resources for the storming of Kyiv"". 
Moscow has repeatedly denied attacking civilian areas.
In Irpin, a town some 25 km (16 miles) northwest of the capital Kyiv, men, women and children trying to escape heavy fighting in the area were forced to take cover when missiles struck nearby, according to Reuters witnesses.
Soldiers and fellow residents helped the elderly hurry to a bus filled with frightened people, some cowering as they waited to be driven to safety.
The invasion has drawn widespread condemnation around the world, sent more than 1.5 million Ukrainians fleeing from the country, and triggered sweeping Western sanctions against Russia aimed at crippling its economy. 
The Biden administration said on Sunday it was exploring banning imports of Russian oil, despite concerns the move would drive prices even higher. 
Oil prices have soared to their highest levels since 2008 and jumped 10% in early Asian trade on Monday. Russia provides 7% of global supply.
""War is madness, please stop,"" Pope Francis said in his weekly address to crowds in St Peter's Square, adding ""rivers of blood and tears"" were flowing in Ukraine's war.
Russian media said Putin also spoke by phone for almost two hours with French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron told Putin he was concerned about a possible amphibious attack on Ukraine's historic port city of Odessa, Macron's office said.
The United States does not believe such an attack is imminent, the senior U.S. defense official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
'NO TO WAR'
Anti-war protests took place around the world, including in Russia itself, where police detained more than 4,600 people, an independent protest monitoring group said. 
The interior ministry said 3,500 demonstrators had been held, included 1,700 people in Moscow and 750 in St Petersburg.
Thousands of protesters chanted ""No to war!"" and ""Shame on you!"", according to videos posted on social media by opposition activists and bloggers. Reuters was unable to independently verify the footage and photographs.
Demonstrations also took place in Western capitals as well as in India and Kazakhstan, after jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny called for worldwide protests against the war. 
In the besieged city of Mariupol, authorities had said on Sunday they would make a second attempt to evacuate some of the 400,000 residents. But the ceasefire plan collapsed, as it had on Saturday, with each side blaming the other.
""They're destroying us,"" Mariupol mayor Vadym Boychenko told Reuters in a video call, describing the city's plight before the latest evacuation effort failed. ""They will not even give us an opportunity to count the wounded and the killed because the shelling does not stop.""
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States has seen credible reports of deliberate attacks on civilians in Ukraine, adding that Washington was documenting them to support a potential war crimes investigation.
Moscow says it has no plans to occupy Ukraine.
The U.S. defense official estimated Russia has deployed about 95% of the combat forces it had staged outside Ukraine.
In the capital, Ukrainian soldiers bolstered defences by digging trenches, blocking roads and liaising with civil defence units as Russian forces bombarded areas nearby. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russian rockets had destroyed the civilian airport of the central-western region capital of Vinnytsia. Troops who committed atrocities against civilians would ultimately face punishment, he said.
""For you there will be no peaceful place on this earth, except for the grave,"" he said in a televised evening address. 
Russian forces opened fire at a protest against their occupation of the southern Ukrainian city of Nova Kakhovka on Sunday, wounding five people, Ukrainian news agency Interfax Ukraine said, citing eyewitnesses.
PLEA FOR MORE WEAPONS
Kyiv renewed its appeal to the West to toughen sanctions and also requested more weapons, including Russian-made planes.
Speaking on a trip to neighbouring Moldova, Blinken said Washington was considering how it could backfill aircraft for Poland if Warsaw decided to supply its warplanes to Ukraine.
Putin says he wants a ""demilitarised"", ""denazified"" and neutral Ukraine, and on Saturday likened Western sanctions ""to a declaration of war"". 
The West, which calls Putin's reasons for invading baseless, has expanded efforts to rearm Ukraine, sending in items from Stinger missiles to anti-tank weapons. But Washington and its NATO allies have resisted Ukraine's plea for a no-fly zone, saying it would escalate the conflict beyond Ukraine's borders.
Ukrainians continued to pour into Poland, Romania, Slovakia and elsewhere. The United Nations said over 1.5 million had fled in Europe's fastest growing refugee crisis since World War Two.
Western sanctions have pushed many companies to exit investments in Russia, while some Russian banks have been shut out of a global financial payment systems, driving down the rouble and forcing Moscow to jack up interest rates.
On Sunday, more companies cut ties with Russia:  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)., accounting giants KPMG and PwC, and video sharing app TikTok. 
But Chinese firms so far are staying put.

Ukraine's military said more than 11,000 Russian troops had been killed so far and 88 Russian aircraft shot down since the start of the invasion. Reuters could not corroborate the claim. Russia has not given regular updates on its death toll.
Tass news agency cited Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov as saying virtually the entire Ukrainian air force had been destroyed. In the last 36 hours alone, he said, Ukraine had lost 11 combat aircraft and two helicopters. Reuters had no way of corroborating the claim.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Hundreds of trucks, recreational vehicles and cars circled the outskirts of Washington on Sunday, aiming to slow traffic around the capital as part of a protest against pandemic restrictions.
The so-called ""People's Convoy,"" which originated in California and has drawn participants from around the country, is calling for an end to all pandemic-related restrictions. It was inspired by demonstrations last month that paralyzed Ottawa, Canada's capital city.
Leaders of the convoy said that on Monday they will again slowly drive the Beltway, a 64-mile highway that encircles the city, though details of when the action would take place were not known. 
Hundreds of vehicles gathered on Friday and Saturday at the Hagerstown Speedway, a racetrack in Maryland about 80 miles (129 km) northwest of downtown Washington. 
On Sunday morning, many left in convoy to drive two slow laps on the Beltway. They honked their horns as they set off, while onlookers waved American flags, according to a Reuters witness.
The convoy, more than 2 miles long, slowed traffic at points along the Beltway by late Sunday morning, but did not bring it to a standstill. It returned to the Hagerstown Speedway in the afternoon, according to messages on the convoy's Telegram channel.
The convoy's protest against vaccine requirements and other pandemic restrictions has been undercut in recent weeks as major U.S. cities have rolled back mask mandates and other measures against COVID-19 with infections and hospitalizations declining dramatically.
President Joe Biden, a Democrat, signaled in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday that the country was entering a new, phase of the pandemic without business lockdowns, school closures or other daily disruptions. 
At the racetrack on Friday night, one participant who described himself as the lead trucker told a cheering crowd he would drive his truck into the heart of the American capital.
""D.C., the government, whomever, can claim that they have all this opposition for us waiting in D.C.,"" the man said. ""But that flag on the back of my truck will go down to Constitution Avenue between the White House and the Washington Monument.""

U.S. federal law enforcement agencies have been coordinating with state and local authorities for weeks in preparation for the possible arrival of the convoy, according to one U.S. official who requested anonymity to discuss internal operations. 
A Feb. 26 U.S. Department of Homeland Security bulletin to law enforcement reviewed by Reuters said trucker convoys could hinder emergency responders depending on the size of the protest.

LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - More than 200 children evacuated from an orphanage in Ukraine's conflict zone arrived in the western city of Lviv on Saturday after a 24-hour train journey with their carers.
The 215 children, ranging from toddlers to teenagers, left their orphanage in Zaporizhzhia, in southeast Ukraine, on the day Russian troops attacked a nearby nuclear power station.
""My heart is being torn apart,"" said Olha Kucher, director of the Zaporizhzhia Central Christian Orphanage. Then she started sobbing. ""I'm sorry . . . I simply lack words. And I feel so sorry for these children. They're so young.""
As night fell and the temperature plunged, the children waited patiently on a platform at Lviv train station, the older ones looking after the young, while orphanage staff carefully counted them all.
The very young clutched cuddly toys. None of the children cried or complained.
Vladimir Kovtun, 16, said he felt safe now. ""It is terrifying to stay in Zaporizhzhia when air raid sirens go off and we must constantly hide in the basement.""
Wide-eyed and hand in hand, the children were led through a ticket hall mobbed with other Ukrainians. More than 65,000 refugees passed through the station on Friday alone, according to Lviv mayor Andriy Sadovy.
Then, as snow began to fall, the children boarded a fleet of buses bound for their new home in neighbouring Poland.
It would be several hours before they crossed the border. For Kucher, the orphanage director, the prospect of safety for her children after so fraught a journey unleashed a mix of emotions: sadness, relief and rage.

""We don't want to leave Ukraine - we love it,"" she said. ""But unfortunately we must leave.""
As the last of the children climbed on the buses, Kucher added: ""Putin is simply killing people . . . I don't understand why the Russian people can't believe that we're being bombarded - that we and our children are being killed.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Diplomats were working to ensure the release of seven-time WNBA All-Star player Brittney Griner after Russia said it had detained the player last month for possession of vape cartridges containing hash oil, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday.
The Russian Customs Service, without naming Griner, said on Saturday that it had detained an athlete in February after the player arrived at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport on a flight from New York.
Russian news agency TASS identified the player as Griner, citing a source. Griner's WNBA team, the Phoenix Mercury, said: ""We are aware of and are closely monitoring the situation with Brittney Griner in Russia."" 
A scan of the player's luggage revealed cartridges containing ""liquid with hashish oil"", and a criminal case has been opened carrying a possible sentence of five to 10 years in prison, the customs service said. 
It was not clear when in February Griner, who plays in Russia during the WNBA's winter off-season, was detained. The player is still in custody and an investigation is underway, the Russian Customs Service said. 
Griner, who won Olympic gold medals with the U.S. national teams in 2016 and 2021, ""has always handled herself with the utmost professionalism during her long tenure with USA Basketball,"" USA Basketball said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
At a joint press conference with Moldova President Maia Sandu on Sunday, Blinken said the Biden administration had assigned an embassy team to work on Griner's case. 
""There's only so much I can say given the privacy considerations at this point,"" Blinken said of Griner. ""Whenever an American is detained anywhere in the world, we of course stand ready to provide every possible assistance, and that includes in Russia.""
He added, ""We have an embassy team that’s working on the cases of other Americans who are detained in Russia. We’re doing everything we can to see to it that their rights are upheld and respected.""
Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 and Western nations' sweeping sanctions aimed at isolating Moscow, the United States on Saturday warned against travel to Russia and said its embassy there had limited ability to assist citizens.
LGBTQ rights advocates expressed particular concern for Griner in light of the fact that she is an openly gay woman being detained in a country that has a record of restricting LGBTQ rights.

""Our thoughts are with Brittney Griner, her loved ones, and her teammates during this terrifying ordeal,"" a spokesperson for Athlete Ally, an organization that advocates for LGBTQ rights in sports, said on Sunday. “Brittney has long been a powerful voice for LGBTQ+ equality. It’s critical that now we use our collective voice to call for her safe and swift return to her family.”
Griner's wife, Cherelle Griner, posted on Instagram on Saturday that she appreciated the prayers and support she had received following Brittney's detention. ""This message comes during one of the weakest moments of my life,"" she wrote. ""Please honor our privacy as we continue to work on getting my wife home safely.""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Israel will continue trying to mediate between Russia and Ukraine even if success seems unlikely, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said on Sunday after returning from surprise talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Ukraine has requested that Israel serve as intermediary, citing the government's good relations with both Kyiv and Moscow. Bennett's office said he had spoken three times over the weekend with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
In televised remarks to his cabinet, Bennett gave no details on his three-hour Kremlin meeting with Putin on Saturday, saying only that it had ""the blessing and encouragement of all parties"" - an allusion to the United States, among other powers.
""We will continue to assist wherever this is requested, even if the chances are not great,"" Bennett said. ""The moment there is even a small opening, and we have the access to all sides and the capability, I see it as a moral duty to make every attempt.""
The two leaders spoke again by phone on Sunday, the Kremlin said, and discussed Bennett's ""most recent contacts with leaders of a number of countries"".
In parallel, Bennett spoke with the leaders of Germany and France while his foreign minister, Yair Lapid, was due to meet U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday in Riga, according to Israeli officials.
Israel has condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine, expressed solidarity with Kyiv and sent humanitarian aid. But Bennett has not met Ukrainian requests for military assistance and has kept channels open to Russia, with which Israel coordinates its operations against Iranian deployments in Syria.
Some 90 children from a Jewish orphanage in the Ukrainian city of Zhytomyr were flown from Romania to Tel Aviv on Sunday. 
""I am Naftali, the prime minister of Israel,"" Bennett, who boarded the El Al plane after it landed, told one boy, kissing him on the head before leading him off the aircraft.
On Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Bennett said the group, accompanied by members of Chabad-Lubavitch, a worldwide Jewish religious movement, had been fleeing battles and shelling for more than a week.
Interior Minister Ayelet Shaked said Israel, which has a population of 9.2 million, was bracing for a ""very, very big wave"" of immigration sparked by the conflict. 
This could entail taking in more than 200,000 Ukrainians who are Jewish or have Jewish family links and more than 600,000 Russians in the same categories, she said.

An Israeli immigration official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, had a more modest forecast of an influx ""in the low tens of thousands"" from Ukraine and Russia.
In what local media have cast as a bid to prevent Russian oligarchs from fleeing to Israel to evade sanctions, the Israel Airports Authority said it had received instructions not to allow private jets to park for more than 24 hours.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Talks to revive Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers were mired in uncertainty on Sunday following Russia's demands for a U.S. guarantee that the sanctions it faces over the Ukraine conflict will not hurt its trade with Tehran.
Moscow threw the potential spanner in the works on Saturday, just as months of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington in Vienna appeared to be headed for an agreement, with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov saying the Western sanctions over Ukraine had become a stumbling block for the nuclear deal.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken sought to dispel talk of such obstacles on Sunday when he said that the sanctions imposed on Russia over Ukraine had nothing to do with a potential nuclear deal with Iran.
""These things are totally different and just are not, in any way, linked together. So I think that's irrelevant,"" Blinken said in an interview with CBS's ""Face the Nation"" show. He added that a potential deal with Iran was close, but cautioned that a couple of very challenging remaining issues were unresolved. 
Yet a senior Iranian official told Reuters earlier that Tehran was waiting for clarification from Moscow about the comments from Lavrov, who said Russia wanted a written U.S. guarantee that Russia's trade, investment and military-technical cooperation with Iran would not be hindered in any way by the sanctions.
""It is necessary to understand clearly what Moscow wants. If what they demand is related to the JCPOA, it would not be difficult to find a solution for it,"" said the Iranian official, referring to the 2015 nuclear deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
""But it will be complicated, if the guarantees that Moscow has demanded, are beyond the JCPOA.""
British, French and German diplomats who had flown home before Lavrov's comments to brief officials on the nuclear talks have not indicated when they might return to Vienna. 
Henry Rome, Iran analyst at consultancy Eurasia group, said reviving the nuclear pact without Russia was ""tricky but probably doable, at least in the near term"".
""If Russia continues to obstruct the talks, I think the other parties and Iran will have no choice but to think creatively about ways to get the deal done without Moscow's involvement,"" Rome told Reuters. 
On Sunday, Iranian negotiators met EU diplomat Enrique Mora, who coordinates the talks between Tehran and world powers. 
PRISONERS DILEMMA
Since the election of Iran's hardline president Ebrahim Raisi last year, senior officials have been pushing for deeper ties with Russia. 
Iran's top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, has publicly and privately been calling for closer ties with Russia due to his deep mistrust of the United States. 
The 2015 agreement, between Iran and the United States, France, Britain, Germany, Russia and Chin, eased sanctions on Tehran in return for limiting Iran's enrichment of uranium, making it harder for Tehran to develop material for nuclear weapons. The accord fell apart after President Donald Trump withdrew the United States in 2018.
The return of Iranian oil would help replace Russian barrels lost as the United States and its allies seeks to freeze out Moscow ,following the invasion and soften the impact on the West which is already struggling with high inflation.
U.S. negotiator Robert Malley has suggested that securing the nuclear pact is unlikely unless Tehran frees four U.S. citizens, including Iranian-American father and son Baquer and Siamak Namazi.
A senior Iranian official in Tehran said if Tehran's demands are met the prisoners issue can be resolved with or without a revival of the nuclear deal.

Iran, which does not recognise dual nationality, denies U.S. accusations that it takes prisoners to gain diplomatic leverage. In recent years, the elite Revolutionary Guards have arrested dozens of dual nationals and foreigners, mostly on espionage and security-related charges.
Tehran has sought the release of over a dozen Iranians in the United States, including seven Iranian-American dual nationals, two Iranians with permanent U.S. residency and four Iranian citizens with no legal status in the United States.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States has seen very credible reports of deliberate attacks on civilians in Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday, adding that Washington was documenting them to support appropriate organizations in their potential war crimes investigation over Russia's actions.
""We've seen very credible reports of deliberate attacks on civilians which would constitute a war crime,"" Blinken told CNN's ""State of the Union"" show. ""We've seen very credible reports about the use of certain weapons,"" he said.
""What we're doing right now is documenting all of this, putting this all together, looking at it and making sure that as people and the appropriate organizations and institutions investigate whether war crimes have been or are being committed that we can support whatever they are doing,"" Blinken added.
The U.S. embassy in Ukraine on Friday sent a tweet that attacking a nuclear plant is a war crime after Russian invasion forces seized Europe's biggest nuclear power plant in heavy fighting in southeastern Ukraine, triggering global alarm.
The State Department sent a message to all U.S. embassies in Europe telling them not to retweet the Kyiv embassy's tweet calling the attack a war crime, according to CNN, which said it reviewed the message.
Blinken did not address the embassy's tweet and the State Department declined to comment on whether the tweet reflects the overall position of the U.S. government on the issue.
Russia, which denies attacking civilian areas, calls the campaign it launched on Feb. 24 a ""special military operation,"" saying it has no plans to occupy Ukraine, which was once part of the Soviet Union under Moscow's sway but has now turned West seeking membership of NATO and the European Union.
Like all U.N. states, Russia and Ukraine are subject to the 1949 Geneva Conventions - which established legal standards for humanitarian treatment in war and outlawed deliberate attacks on civilians.
Now in its 11th day, Russian President Vladimir Putin's assault has uprooted more than 1.5 million people in what the United Nations says is the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War Two.
Images of cluster bombs and artillery strikes on Ukrainian cities this week have prompted the world's top war crimes prosecutor to launch an investigation, with the support of dozens of nations opposed to Russia's invasion.

In an interview with CNN's ""State of the Union"" show, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said an investigation is needed into whether Russia is committing war crimes in Ukraine.
""I think there needs to be a strong and clear investigation on this question,"" von der Leyen said.

CHISINAU, Moldova (Reuters) -U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday reassured Moldova’s leaders that the United States would rally international opposition to Russian aggression ""whenever and wherever"" it occurs. 
Speaking alongside Moldovan President Maia Sandu on a tour through eastern Europe in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Blinken also said that the United States supported Moldova's aspirations to join the European Union but that the process would be decided by the EU. 
Moldova says more than 230,000 refugees have crossed its border with Ukraine since the war began on Feb. 24, and 120,000 of those remain in the country of about 2.5 million people.
Asked what assurances Washington could give Moldova in light of Russia's aggression toward Ukraine, Blinken pointed to U.S. efforts to mobilize the international response that is isolating Russia and hurting its economy.
""Whenever and wherever that aggression might appear, we'll do the same thing,"" he said.
The United States is not committed to defend Moldova since the former Soviet Republic, like its neighbor Ukraine, is not a member of NATO. 
Sandu said her government was monitoring the situation in the breakaway region of Transnistria in Moldova’s east, where an estimated 1,500 Russian troops are based, but had not seen significant changes since Russia's assault began. The Russian presence, which dates back to Moldova's independence in the early 1990s, is illegal, she said.
""However, in this region, of course, there is no possibility for us now to feel really safe or secure,"" Sandu said, according to a live interpretation of her remarks.
Sandu is a former World Bank economist who came to power in 2019 and won a larger mandate in elections in July promising closer ties with the West. 
Moldova on Thursday formally applied to join the European Union, a move likely to rile Moscow.

Blinken said the United States was providing $18 million over the next few years to ""strengthen and diversify"" Moldova's energy sector. Moldova depends heavily on Russian gas.
""(Energy) independence and energy security is actually critical to maintaining one's sovereignty and independence,"" Blinken said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, with the aim to ""demilitarise"" and ""denazify"" its pro-Western neighbour and prevent Kyiv from joining NATO.
The West, dismissing that rationale as a pretext, has responded with harsh sanctions on Moscow and heavy military and other aid to Kyiv.
The TASS, RIA and Interfax news agencies quoted ""a representative of a competent body"" in Russia on Sunday as saying Ukraine was developing nuclear weapons at the destroyed Chernobyl nuclear power plant that was shut down in 2000.
Ukraine's government has said it had no plans to rejoin the nuclear club, having given up its nuclear arms in 1994 following the break-up of the Soviet Union. 

Shortly before the invasion, Putin said in a grievance-filled speech that Ukraine was using Soviet know-how to create its own nuclear weapons, and that this was tantamount to preparation for an attack on Russia.
He cited no evidence for his claim.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Senior U.S. officials traveled to Venezuela on Saturday for talks with President Nicolas Maduro's government, seeking to determine whether Caracas is prepared to distance itself from close ally Russia amid its invasion of Ukraine, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The trip, the highest-level U.S. visit to Venezuela in years, came as part of a U.S. effort to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some analysts also see U.S.-sanctioned Venezuela as a potential alternate source of oil supplies should Washington attempt to restrict Moscow's energy shipments.
U.S. and Venezuelan officials held a round of talks on Saturday but reached no agreement, the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity. It was unclear whether a further meeting would be held.
The visit, which involved senior White House and State Department officials, was first reported by the New York Times.
The White House and State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The U.S. government has largely shunned direct contacts with Maduro's socialist government in recent years.
The two countries broke off diplomatic relations in 2019 amid a campaign of U.S. sanctions and diplomatic pressure aimed at ousting Maduro, a longtime Putin ally.
The administration of former U.S. President Donald Trump and dozens of other countries deemed Maduro's 2018 re-election a sham and instead recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country's legitimate president.
But Maduro has retained power with the backing of country's OPEC member's military as well as Russia, China, Cuba and Iran.
President Joe Biden's administration has insisted it will not lift sanctions, including on Venezuela's vital oil sector, unless Maduro takes concrete steps toward holding free elections.
While Venezuela's oil exports have taken a major hit, Russian oil companies and banks have played a key role in helping Maduro and state-run oil company PDVSA evade U.S. sanctions and continue shipments.
The United States and its allies have come under growing pressure to further punish Russia for its military onslaught against Ukraine by sanctioning Russia's oil and gas exports, and the White House has said all options remain on the table.
Some commentators have suggested that easing sanctions on Venezuela could provide an alternate source of global energy supplies, thought critics say Maduro should not be allowed to benefit without changing his behavior.
Venezuela on Feb. 25 blamed the United States and NATO for the crisis in Ukraine, though it expressed ""worry over the worsening of the crisis"" there. Cuba and Nicaragua have also defended Putin's stance on Ukraine.
In a March 1 phone call, Putin and Maduro discussed the situation in Ukraine and talked about increasing a strategic partnership between Russia and Venezuela, the Interfax news agency reported, citing the Kremlin.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than a thousand large trucks, recreational vehicles and cars are gathering on the outskirts of Washington as part of a protest against COVID-19 restrictions that threatens to roll on the U.S. capital in the coming days.
The so-called ""People's Convoy,"" which originated in California and has drawn participants from around the country, is calling for an end to all pandemic-related restrictions. It was inspired by demonstrations last month that paralyzed Ottawa, Canada's capital city.
The convoy's message has been undercut in recent weeks as major U.S. cities have rolled back mask mandates and other measures against COVID-19, which has led to more than 950,000 deaths in the United States but has been mitigated with vaccines and therapeutics. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, signaled in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday that the country was entering a new, more controlled phase of the pandemic without business lockdowns or school closures. 
Still, more than 100 18-wheeler trucks amassed with other vehicles on Friday evening at the Hagerstown Speedway, a racetrack about 80 miles (129 km) from downtown Washington, according to Reuters witnesses. Drivers continued to stream into the parking lot on Saturday morning, one witness said.
A website for the protest said they did not plan to enter ""D.C. proper"" and social media posts suggested they could remain at the racetrack on Saturday. But one participant who described himself as the lead trucker told a cheering crowd at the racetrack on Friday night that he would drive his truck into the heart of the American capital.
""D.C., the government, whomever, can claim that they have all this opposition for us waiting in D.C.,"" the man said. ""But that flag on the back of my truck will go down to Constitution Avenue between the White House and the Washington Monument.""
A little more than a year ago, supporters of former Republican President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attack that left five people dead and more than 100 police officers injured.
U.S. federal law enforcement agencies have been coordinating with state and local authorities for weeks in preparation for the possible arrival of the convoy, said one U.S. official who requested anonymity to discuss internal operations. 
A Feb. 26 U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) bulletin to law enforcement reviewed by Reuters said trucker convoys could hinder emergency responders depending on the size of the protest.
The bulletin said federal law enforcement was not aware of any substantiated threats from domestic violent extremists, but that some extremists ""probably will be drawn to the event and could engage in premeditated or opportunistic violence.""
DHS said the possibility of an attack could be higher because COVID restrictions have been a ""key driver"" of domestic extremist violence over the last two years. Federal officials would be unlikely to see violent plotting in online public platforms beforehand due to the use of encrypted apps and private forums, it said.
Federal law enforcement is also cognizant of the need to respect the right to peaceful protest, the official said. 

On Friday evening, a woman from nearby Silver Spring, Maryland, who identified herself only as ""Dorothy"" said she opposed COVID-related restrictions and that the issue had caused divisions in her family and problems at work.
""I think our medical choices are private and we should not be required to disclose them to participate in everyday activities,"" she told Reuters.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - In just one day, Inga Sokolnikova filled two rooms in her beauty salon in New York City's Brighton Beach with donated diapers, clothes and medical supplies for her native country of Ukraine.
Donations poured in not only from Ukrainian and Ukrainian American residents of this diverse waterfront neighborhood in south Brooklyn, but also from Russians as well as Georgians, Uzbeks and Azerbaijanis.
""All the people from our part of the world, they all gather things, bring them here, without much thinking. They are spending their own money and they bring things here,"" said Sokolnikova, 48, fighting back tears as she recounted how Russian bombings in Kyiv forced her brother into a bunker for days. 
The war in Ukraine has shaken Brighton Beach, a neighborhood filled with Cyrillic signage where residents from Russia and a slew of former Soviet Union countries have been living side by side for decades following waves of immigration beginning in the 1970s, earning it the nickname Little Odessa. 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine less than two weeks ago has stirred complicated emotions, but many Ukrainians here said the community has come together to support them.
""There is no tension,"" said Yelena Makhnin, the executive director of the Brighton Beach Improvement District. ""If you're human you should be Ukrainian today."" 
Makhnin, 60, said she did not sleep for days as friends ensnared in the conflict flooded her phone with calls and texts. She leaned on her Russian husband of 14 years for support.
""He knows, he understands. He's not talking a lot about it to me,"" she said. ""But he comes, he sits next to me, he holds my hand all the time."" 
Irina Roizin, a 63-year-old Ukrainian American, worried about unfounded prejudice spreading against Russians, and she wondered whether she should rebrand the ballet school she founded in Brighton Beach almost 30 years ago.
The Brighton Ballet Theater describes itself as a ""school of Russian American Ballet,"" something Roizin hoped people would understand referred only to the teaching techniques advanced by celebrated Russian ballerina Agrippina Vaganova. 
""We cannot take Russian composers like Tchaikovsky out of our lives,"" she said, making a point of distinguishing the Russian people from their government. ""I don't want this war to make people angry at Russia the way COVID made a lot of people angry about China.""
Ukrainian flags hang from many businesses, and donation drives in support of Ukrainians have sprung up across the neighborhood and beyond. The Russian American Officers Association, which represents Russian-speaking officers in the New York Police Department, has set up donation boxes in station houses across the city, seeking first-aid kits, gauze, ibuprofen tablets and tourniquets to send to eastern Europe.
DONATION DRIVE 
In a room at the back of Brighton Beach's Guardian Angel Roman Catholic Church, women sorted through cardboard boxes and plastic bags filled with donations: ramen noodles, dried pasta, toothpaste, tampons, multicolored jumbles of clothing and at least one gas mask.
They planned to ship it to contacts in Poland who would help distribute it across the border in Ukraine. The effort was organized by parents and staff at a nearby Saturday school for Ukrainian children and parishioners at the church, where homilies can be heard in Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Polish and English.
Sergiy Emanuel, the church's multilingual priest, summoned up pictures on his phone sent by a friend in Zhytomyr, the Ukrainian city of his childhood, that showed a bombed-out school building. He said he had received calls of support and donations from people he knew to be of Russian origin from their accent.
""People are shy to say they're from Russia,"" he said. ""They say, 'Oh, we're from here.' They must be afraid to say they are from Russia. Why? Because of one crazy man?"" 

The women sorting the donations thought their efforts seemed modest. But it felt better than doing nothing and was a distraction from the limbo of worrying about family and friends in Ukraine. Several described the panic they felt when they tried calling a loved one and there was no answer.
""The worst is when here it's day and there it's night,"" said Iuliia Dereka, a 33-year-old teacher at the Saturday school. ""We just pray for them to wake up and give us a call.""

LVIV/KYIV, Ukraine (Reuters) -Russian President Vladimir Putin said Western sanctions were akin to war as his forces pressed their assault on Ukraine on Saturday for a 10th day and the IMF warned the conflict would have a ""severe impact"" on the global economy.
Moscow and Kyiv traded blame over failed plans for a brief ceasefire to enable civilians to evacuate two cities besieged by Russian forces. Russia's invasion has already driven nearly 1.5 million refugees westward into the European Union.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy made a ""desperate plea"" for eastern Europe to provide Russian-made aircraft to his country during a video call with U.S. senators on Saturday, said the chamber's majority leader, Chuck Schumer.
NATO, which Ukraine wants to join, has resisted Zelenskiy's appeals to impose a no-fly zone over his country, saying this would escalate the conflict outside Ukraine. But there is strong bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress for providing $10 billion in emergency military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine.
Putin said he wanted a neutral Ukraine that had been ""demilitarised"" and ""denazified"", adding: ""These sanctions that are being imposed are akin to a declaration of war but thank God it has not come to that.""
Ukraine and Western countries have rejected Putin's arguments as a baseless pretext for invading and have sought to squeeze Russia hard with swift and severe economic sanctions on its banks, oligarchs and others.
Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett met with Putin at the Kremlin on Saturday to discuss the crisis before then speaking to Zelenskiy, Bennett's spokesperson said. Israel has offered to mediate in the conflict, though officials have downplayed expectations for a breakthrough.
Ukrainian negotiators said a third round of talks with Russia on a ceasefire would go ahead on Monday, although Moscow was less definitive. Two previous rounds were unsuccessful and Zelenskiy has said Russia must first stop bombing.
""Together we will all rebuild our state,"" Zelenskiy told Ukrainians in a televised address Saturday evening. ""My confidence in this is reinforced by the energy of our resistance, our protest"".
NO EVACUATIONS
Earlier, the International Committee of the Red Cross had said planned civilian evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha were unlikely to start on Saturday. The city council in Mariupol had accused Russia of not observing a ceasefire, while Moscow said Ukrainian ""nationalists"" were preventing civilians from leaving.
Britain said the proposed ceasefire in Mariupol - which has been without power, water and heating for days - was likely an attempt by Russia to deflect international condemnation while it resets its forces.
The port of Mariupol has endured heavy bombardment, a sign of its strategic value to Moscow due to its position between Russian-backed separatist-held eastern Ukraine and the Black Sea Crimean peninsula, which Moscow seized from Kyiv in 2014.
Russia's Defence Ministry said its forces were carrying out a wide-ranging offensive in Ukraine and had taken several towns and villages, Interfax news agency reported.
In aerial combat near Zhytomyr, about 100 km (62 miles) west of Kyiv, it said, four Ukrainian Su-27 fighter jets had been shot down. Reuters could not independently confirm the report.
A United Nations monitoring mission said at least 351 civilians had been confirmed killed and 707 injured in Ukraine since the start of the invasion on Feb. 24, adding that the real figures were likely to be ""considerably higher"".
The number of refugees could rise to 1.5 million by Sunday night from 1.3 million now, the U.N. refugee agency chief said. 
Women and children, often numb with exhaustion, continued to pour into Poland and other neighbouring countries as well as into western Ukrainian cities such as Lviv.
""I've barely slept for 10 days,"" said Anna Filatova, arriving in Lviv with her two daughters from heavily bombed Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city near its eastern border with Russia. 
""The Russians want to flatten Kharkiv... We hate Putin.""
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on a visit to Poland, met Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba at the border amid tight security to discuss the provision of weapons and efforts to isolate Russia and cripple its economy.
Blinken also met refugees staying in a disused shopping mall in Poland, which has taken in the vast majority of the Ukrainians forced to flee their country.
'MY HEART IS BREAKING'
Russians, reeling from a 30% fall in the rouble's value in the past 10 days, money transfer curbs and the exit of Western companies from IKEA to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), expressed fear for their economic future.
""My heart is breaking,"" said one shopper, Viktoriya Voloshina, in the town of Rostov on Saturday. 
Another woman, Lidia, said: ""Today my family and I are leaving Russia.""
The International Monetary Fund said in a statement that the conflict was driving world energy and grain prices higher.
""The ongoing war and associated sanctions will also have a severe impact on the global economy,"" it said, adding that it would bring Kyiv's request for $1.4 billion in emergency financing to its board for approval as early as next week.
Russia's Foreign Ministry accused Britain of ""sanctions hysteria"" and vowed tough but proportionate measures against British interests in Russia. Britain plans to tighten its laws to facilitate a crackdown on Russian oligarchs in London.
Italian police have seized villas and yachts worth at least $153 million from four high-profile Russians put on an EU sanctions list, sources said on Saturday.
The conflict has also shaken international diplomacy over Iran's nuclear programme, one of the few areas where Russia and the United States had been working together to curb what the West suspects is an Iranian plan to develop nuclear arms.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Saturday the West's sanctions imposed on his country had become a stumbling block for clinching a nuclear deal with Iran. 
Russia also warned the EU and NATO again to stop the ""pumping of state-of-the-art weapons systems"" into Kyiv, citing the risk to aviation and other transport communications, ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said, according to RIA. 
Putin, in one of several decrees signed on Saturday, gave his government two days to draw up a list of nations engaged in ""unfriendly acts"" towards Russia, its news agencies reported. 
'FIGHTING FIERCELY'
Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said 66,224 Ukrainian men had returned from abroad to join the fight against Russia's invasion.
Ukraine's military said armed forces ""are fighting fiercely to liberate Ukrainian cities from Russian occupiers"", counter-attacking in some areas and disrupting communications.
In Kherson, southern Ukraine, the only regional capital to have changed hands during the invasion so far, several thousand people demonstrated on its main square on Saturday.

""Kherson is Ukraine,"" they chanted, demanding that Russian forces withdraw. 
Eyewitnesses cited by Interfax said Russian troops fired automatic rifles into the air in an unsuccessful attempt to disperse the crowd. The soldiers later left the city centre, the eyewitnesses said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea said it conducted ""another important"" test for reconnaissance satellite systems, state news agency KCNA reported on Sunday, a day after regional military authorities reported the launch of a ballistic missile from the country for the second time in a week.
The launch drew condemnation from governments in the United States, South Korea, and Japan, which fear the North is preparing to conduct a major weapons test in coming months. They see the North's satellite launches as thinly veiled tests of ballistic missile technology banned by United Nations Security Council resolutions.
North Korea's National Aerospace Development Administration (NADA) and the Academy of Defence Science conducted the launch ""under the plan of developing a reconnaissance satellite,"" KCNA reported.
It was the second such launch in a week to test satellite equipment, and the ninth missile launch this year.
""Through the test, the NADA confirmed the reliability of data transmission and reception system of the satellite, its control command system and various ground-based control systems,"" KCNA said.
Like the last test on Feb. 27, KCNA did not elaborate on the type of rocket used in the launch, but authorities in South Korea said it appeared to be a ballistic missile fired from an area near Pyongyang where its international airport is located.
South Korea's military said the North Korean missile reached a height of about 560 km (350 miles) and flew 270 km (170 miles).
Amid stalled denuclearisation talks, North Korea conducted a record number of weapons launches in January, and has suggested it could resume testing nuclear weapons or its longest range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) for the first time since 2017.
Saturday's test came just days ahead of a presidential election on Wednesday in South Korea, where officials are bracing for a North Korean attempt to launch its spy satellite into orbit in the near future.
""Any satellite launch would bring serious repercussions, as it's the same technology used to launch an ICBM,"" Lee Jong-seok, the top foreign policy advisor to ruling party candidate Lee Jae-myung, has told Reuters.

South Korea is also pushing ahead with plans for its own space launch vehicles, which are not banned by the UNSC.
It plans to test a solid-fuel space projectile this month as part of a project to deploy its own military surveillance satellites to monitor the North, Yonhap news agency reported.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Russia's demand for written U.S. guarantees that sanctions on Moscow would not harm Russian cooperation with Iran is ""not constructive"" for talks between Tehran and global powers to revive a 2015 nuclear deal, a senior Iranian official said on Saturday.
The announcement by Russia, which could torpedo months of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington in Vienna, came shortly after Tehran said it had agreed a roadmap with the U.N. nuclear watchdog to resolve outstanding issues that could help secure the nuclear pact. 
""Russians had put this demand on the table (at the Vienna talks) since two days ago. There is an understanding that by changing its position in Vienna talks Russia wants to secure its interests in other places. This move is not constructive for Vienna nuclear talks,"" said the Iranian official in Tehran, speaking to Reuters. 
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Saturday that the Western sanctions imposed over the war in Ukraine had become a stumbling block for the Iran nuclear deal, warning Russian national interests would have to be taken into account.
Lavrov said Russia wanted a written guarantee from the United States that Russia's trade, investment and military-technical cooperation with Iran would not be hindered in any way by the sanctions.
New U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine should not have any impact on a potential revival of the Iran nuclear accord, the U.S. State Department said.
""The new Russia-related sanctions are unrelated to the JCPOA and should not have any impact on its potential implementation,"" a State Department spokesperson said, referring to the 2015 deal by its formal name, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. 
""We continue to engage with Russia on a return to full implementation of the JCPOA. Russia shares a common interest in ensuring Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon. ""
When asked whether Russia's demand would harm 11 months of talks between Tehran and world powers, including Russia, Iran Project Director at the International Crisis Group, Ali Vaez, said: ""Not yet. But it’s impossible to segregate the two crises for much longer.""
""The U.S. can issue waivers for the work related to the transfer of excess fissile material to Russia. But it’s a sign that the commingling of the two issues has started,"" Vaez said.
Two diplomats, one of them not directly involved in the talks, said China also has demanded written guarantees that its companies doing business in Iran wouldn't be affected by U.S. sanctions.
Such demands may complicate efforts to seal a nuclear deal at a time when an agreement looked likely. All parties involved in the Vienna talks had said on Friday they were close to reaching an agreement.
The 2015 agreement between Tehran and major powers eased sanctions on Tehran in return for limiting Iran's enrichment of uranium, making it harder for Tehran to develop material for nuclear weapons. The accord fell apart after President Donald Trump withdrew the United States in 2018.
TIMETABLE FOR ANSWERS 
Meanwhile, Iran and the U.N. nuclear watchdog said they aimed to resolve a standoff over the origin of uranium particles found at old but undeclared sites by early June, aiming to remove an obstacle to reviving the 2015 deal.
The move was announced jointly by Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) during a visit to Tehran by IAEA chief Rafael Grossi, who had arrived on Friday to discuss one of the last thorny issues blocking the relaunching of the pact.
Later, Grossi said it is hard to imagine any agreement to revive the Iran nuclear deal being implemented if the IAEA's efforts to resolve open issues in Iran by June fail.
""My impression is that it would be difficult to imagine you can have a cooperative relationship as if nothing had happened if the clarification of very important safeguards were to fail,"" Grossi told a news conference in Vienna.
According to a timeline in the statement, Iran will provide ""written explanations including related supporting documents"" to unanswered IAEA questions on three sites by March 20 before other exchanges, after which Grossi ""will aim to report his conclusion by the June 2022 (IAEA) Board of Governors"", which begins on June 6. 
A major sticking point in the talks is that Tehran wants the question of the uranium particles to be closed. Western powers say that is a separate matter to the deal, which the IAEA is not a party to, several officials have told Reuters.
Grossi, who also held talks with Iran's foreign minister before returning to Vienna on Saturday, said, ""there are still matters that need to be addressed by Iran"". The IAEA has been seeking answers from Iran on how the uranium traces got there - a topic often referred to as ""outstanding safeguards issues"". 

Grossi's trip had raised hopes an agreement with the IAEA will potentially clear the way to reviving the nuclear pact. When he pulled the United States out, Trump also reimposed far-reaching sanctions on Iran. 
Since 2019, Tehran has breached the deal's nuclear limits and gone well beyond, rebuilding stockpiles of enriched uranium, refining it to higher fissile purity and installing advanced centrifuges to speed up output. Iran denies it has ever sought to acquire nuclear weapons.

POLISH-UKRAINIAN BORDER (Reuters) -U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba met on Ukraine's border with Poland on Saturday to discuss Western efforts to support Ukraine and isolate Russia during the current war, now in its 10th day.
Amid tight security, Blinken and Kuleba held talks in a tent on the border where refugees, mostly women and children, were also crossing with their belongings in rolling luggage and backpacks.
The two men walked on both sides of a painted line that appeared to mark the end of Polish territory. 
""The entire world stands with Ukraine, just as I am standing here in Ukraine with my friend, my colleague,"" Blinken said.
Kuleba added: ""I hope the people of Ukraine will be able to see this as a clear manifestation that we have friends who literally stand by us.""
The two discussed the provision of weapons to Ukraine and the campaign to isolate Russia internationally and damage its economy with sanctions, Kuleba said.
Ukraine will win its war with Russia eventually, he said, but its international supporters need to provide more help to end the conflict sooner.
Ukraine especially needs fighter jets and air defense systems, he said, adding that Stinger anti-aircraft weapons provided by Western nations were helping. Ukrainian forces downed three Russian aircraft on Saturday, he said.
""If they continue to provide us with necessary weapons, the price will be lower. This will save many lives,"" he said.
Kuleba said he saw no progress in talks with Russia on a ceasefire being held on Ukraine's border with Belarus, but ""we have to continue talking"". A third round is scheduled for Monday.
PRESSURE ON RUSSIA 'WILL GROW'
Blinken earlier met Poland's prime minister and foreign minister and visited a center hosting refugees.
The number of refugees could rise to 1.5 million by the end of the weekend from a current 1.3 million, the head of the United Nations refugee agency said on Saturday.
Blinken arrived in Poland from Brussels, where he met foreign ministers from the NATO alliance, the G7 grouping and the European Union on Friday to discuss the West's efforts to deter Russia through a programme of harsh sanctions.
Blinken said the sanctions were producing ""concrete results"", referring to the damage to Russia's economy in recent days. ""That pressure too will not only continue, it will grow until this war of choice is brought to an end,"" he said. 

NATO members are providing military aid to Ukraine, much of it passing through Poland. But it has declined Ukrainian demands to enforce a no-fly zone over the country, saying this could provoke a much broader and even more dangerous conflict.
Russia describes its actions as ""a special military operation"" whose aim is to disarm Ukraine, counter what it views as NATO aggression and capture Ukrainian leaders it calls neo-Nazis.

Without identifying Griner, a center for the female league's Phoenix Mercury, the Russian Customs Service said a player was detained in February after arriving at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport on a flight from New York.
Russian news agency TASS identified the player as Griner, citing a source. The Phoenix Mercury team, without elaborating, said: ""We are aware of and are closely monitoring the situation with Brittney Griner in Russia."" 
A scan of the player's luggage revealed cartridges containing ""liquid with hashish oil"", and a criminal case has been opened carrying a possible sentence of five to ten years in prison, the customs service said. 
It was not clear when in February Griner, who plays in Russia during the WNBA's winter off-season, was detained. The player is still in custody and an investigation is underway, the Russian Customs Service said. 
Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 and Western nations' sweeping sanctions aimed at isolating Moscow, the United States on Saturday warned against travel to Russia and said its embassy there had limited ability to assist citizens.
The Phoenix Mercury said: ""We love and support Brittney and at this time our main concern is her safety, physical and mental health, and her safe return home."" 

Griner, who won Olympic gold medals with the U.S. national teams in 2016 and 2021, ""has always handled herself with the utmost professionalism during her long tenure with USA Basketball,"" USA Basketball said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
""(Her) safety and wellbeing are our primary concerns,"" the group added.

74,"<span>Mar 05, 2022 11:30AM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Saturday that Western sanctions on Russia were akin to a declaration of war and warned that any attempt to impose a no-fly zone in Ukraine would lead to catastrophic consequences for the world.
Putin reiterated that his aims were to defend Russian- speaking communities through the ""demilitarisation and de-Nazification"" of the country so that Russia's former Soviet neighbour became neutral and no longer threatened Russia. 
Ukraine and Western countries have dismissed this as a baseless pretext for the invasion he launched on Feb. 24 and have imposed a sweeping range of sanctions aimed at isolating Moscow.
""These sanctions that are being imposed are akin to a declaration of war but thank God it has not come to that,"" Putin said, speaking to a group of flight attendants at an Aeroflot training centre near Moscow. 
He said any attempt by another power to impose a no-fly zone in Ukraine would be considered by Russia to be a step into the military conflict. Such a step he said would have catastrophic consequences for Europe and the world. 
The NATO military alliance has rejected Kyiv's request for a no-fly zone, on the grounds it would escalate the war beyond Ukraine into a far wider conflict, potentially pitting the United States against Russia.
'GOING TO PLAN'
Asked about reports that Russian conscripts had been used in Ukraine, Putin said none had been involved and said the military operation was going to plan. 
""There is not one conscript and we don't plan for there to be,"" Putin said. ""Our army will fulfil all the tasks. I don't doubt that at all. Everything is going to plan.""
That description was at odds with assessments from U.S. and British officials. British military intelligence said on Thursday that Russia's advance on the Ukrainian capital had made little progress and encountered staunch resistance.
Putin dismissed concerns that some sort of martial law or emergency situation could be declared in Russia. He said such a measure was imposed only when there was significant internal or external threat. 

""We don't plan to introduce any kind of special regime on Russian territory - there is currently no need,"" Putin said.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the West was behaving like a bandit by cutting economic relations over the conflict in Ukraine but that Russia was far too big to be isolated as the world was much larger than just the United States and Europe.

It said in a statement that failure to unambiguously condemn the remarks and take concrete measures ""will have a further devastating effect on Russian-American relations"", already in tatters following Western sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan was summoned to the ministry to be told that Graham's comment would be treated as a serious crime in Russia.

LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Thousands of women and children, many weeping and numb with exhaustion, arrived in Lviv in western Ukraine on Saturday as the state railway put on more trains to rescue people from fierce Russian attacks on eastern cities.
""I've barely slept for 10 days,"" said Anna Filatova, who had arrived with her two daughters from Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, near its eastern border with Russia. ""The Russians want to flatten Kharkiv. It was impossible to stay there anymore.""
Hundreds more people lined up in flurries of snow on the station forecourt, warming themselves on oil-drum braziers or lining up for hot food and drinks served by volunteers.
Many women were in tears or on the verge of tears, their weary children standing silently beside them. Others carried cats in baskets or pulled shivering dogs on leashes.
The longest line was for free buses to neighbouring Poland for women, children and older men. Men of fighting age are not permitted to leave Ukraine.
Other women shuffled with their children through a crowded tunnel leading to a platform where were four or five trains a day leave for Poland. But people were not being allowed to bring big luggage on board.
A train carrying soldiers, which Reuters was ordered not to photograph, set off in the opposite direction.
EVACUATION CORRIDORS
Russia said its units had opened humanitarian corridors to allow evacuation of civilians from the cities of Mariupol and Volnovakha in eastern Ukraine, encircled by its troops.
But officials in Mariupol said Moscow was not fully observing the limited ceasefire, and the International Committee of the Red Cross said it understood that evacuations would not start on Saturday.
Filatova said Kharkiv had been bombed and shelled constantly since Feb. 24, when the Russian invasion began.
Her daughters - Margarita, 18, and Lilly, 4 - still jumped at any loud noise. Her husband had stayed behind to fight.
She said her area had lost power and cellphone connections, and there were huge lines outside food shops.
She and her daughters had only a backpack each and a small plastic bag of snacks, and her eyes filled with tears as she spoke of how much they had left behind.
She was also defiant. ""The Russians thought Kharkiv would welcome them. But we hate them. We hate Putin."" 
She planned to rest in Lviv before heading to Poland and eventually Switzerland, where she could stay with relatives.
Nina Myronenko stood on Platform 3 with tears streaming down her face. ""Do you know any volunteers here who can help me?"" she asked passers-by, clutching her infant son Timofiy.
NUCLEAR POWER STATION 
She had arrived from Zaporizhzhia, on the Dnieper River, where on Friday Russian troops attacked Ukraine's largest nuclear power station, setting a training facility on fire.
The fire was extinguished, but fears of a nuclear incident caused panic.
Myronenko had squeezed onto a train with Timofiy and two plastic bags of possessions. ""You can't take a lot of luggage, because then you're taking up another person's place,"" she said.
During the night, there was shooting near the track and the train lights went out, she said. Passengers were told to turn off their phones.
Myronenko didn't have to. In her rush to leave home, she had forgotten hers, which was complicating her efforts to contact family and get help.
She said her brother, a defence volunteer, had been injured by shrapnel during a Russian attack. Her husband had also stayed in Zaporizhzhia to fight. ""If everyone leaves, who will protect Ukraine?"" she wept.
Dasha Murzhy had just arrived from Odessa, a port city on the Black Sea, with her two small boys. Tired and dishevelled, she tugged one son back from the platform edge, then perched the other on her suitcase.

Murzhy was smiling, but not because she was happy.
""I've got children so I'm not allowed to cry. I've got to stay positive for them.""

MEDYKA, Poland (Reuters) - Ukrainians fleeing into central European pleaded for Western nations to take tougher steps against Russia following Moscow's invasion that has created more than 1 million refugees.
At the Medyka crossing, Poland's busiest, along its roughly 500-kilometre (310-mile) border with Ukraine, refugees called for a no-fly zone over Ukraine -- something NATO powers have so far ruled out on the grounds it would risk escalating the conflict beyond Ukraine.
""Please close the sky,"" said Solomiya Zdryko, 18, who fled from Lviv in western Ukraine. ""I know that it's not possible for us to join NATO but at least close the sky because people are dying.""
""It's great that the whole world is watching us and supporting us, but it really needs to stop.""
The number of refugees could potentially rise to 1.5 million by the end of the weekend from a current 1.3 million, according to the head of the U.N. refugee agency, Filippo Grandi.
""This is the fastest moving refugee crisis we have seen in Europe since the end of World War Two,"" Grandi told Reuters in an interview.
Poland, whose Ukrainian community of around 1 million is the region's largest, has accepted nearly 800,000 Ukrainian refugees since the start of the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Paweł Szefernaker told reporters. More than 106,000 arrived from Ukraine in the last 24 hours, the highest figure since the war erupted.
Russia said its forces had stopped firing near two besieged Ukrainian cities on Saturday to allow safe passage to civilians fleeing fighting, but officials in one of the cities said Moscow was not fully observing the limited ceasefire.
Moscow says its invasion is a ""special operation"" to capture individuals it regards as dangerous nationalists and to counter what it views as NATO aggression, and has denied targeting civilians.
POLAND AND OTHER EU NATIONS
Most escaping Ukrainians have crossed into the European Union in eastern Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary and northern Romania.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that 140,000 people have crossed into his country since the start of the war. 
The government in Romania -- where nearly 200,000 Ukrainians have fled -- was expected to approve a decree on Saturday to use a government buffer fund to finance the costs of housing an average 70,000 people per day for 30 days. But it wants EU help too.
""I have stated very clearly that this effort Romania is making cannot be sustained without asking for European Commission help through its financial and support mechanisms,” Interior Minister Lucian Bode said.
Bulgaria plans to extend financial support of 40 levs per day ($22.36) per person for three months for those who file for protection, and to support hotel owners who have opened their facilities to host the refugees. Some 20,000 Ukrainians have entered Bulgaria, border police said.
WOMEN AND CHILDREN
With men of conscription age obliged to stay in Ukraine and help in the defence, it has been mostly women and children who have made the crossing.
Authorities and volunteers across central Europe have pitched tents to provide medical aid and process asylum papers at the borders, before helping Ukrainians find jobs and accommodation in bigger cities.
Officials said many of the refugees who have arrived so far had friends and places to go to but they worry further waves of Ukrainians would arrive with less and need more help.
Czech Interior Minister Vit Rakusan estimated 50,000 refugees from Ukraine had reached the Czech Republic as of Friday. The country does not share a border with Ukraine but expects to accommodate a large number of refugees. 
Prague turned its Congress Centre into a big assistance centre for refugees coming to the Czech capital, with the mayor asking for Ukrainian-speaking volunteers to help settle the new arrivals.
U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken met in Poland on Saturday with Polish leaders before travelling to the border. He praised Poland for its response to Russia's actions.
With Russian forces stepping up their attacks on Ukrainian cities, some refugees said that while they were grateful for the support they were getting, they wanted foreign powers to do more.
""They could do more only by closing the skies,"" said a 33-year-old woman who arrived from Lviv and who gave her name only as Olha. 

She broke down in tears when talking about family members she left behind in Ukraine. 
""But I think that all countries have helped Ukraine very much and I am very thankful for their help.""

Most of the civilian casualties were caused by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and from missile and air strikes, monitors from the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said.

""OHCHR believes that the real figures are considerably higher, especially in Government-controlled territory and especially in recent days, as the receipt of information from some locations where intensive hostilities have been going on was delayed and many reports were still pending corroboration,"" it said.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Chinese Premier Li Keqiang pledged on Saturday to advance peaceful growth in relations with Taiwan and ""reunification"", and said his government firmly opposes any separatist activities or foreign interference, drawing a firm rebuke from Taipei.
China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory, has increased military activity near the island over the past two years, responding to what it calls ""collusion"" between Taipei and Washington, Taiwan's main international backer and arms supplier.
Speaking at the opening of the annual meeting of China's parliament, Li said Beijing stands by the ""one China"" principle, which states Taiwan is part of China.
""We will advance the peaceful growth of relations across the Taiwan Strait and the reunification of China,"" he said. ""We firmly oppose any separatist activities seeking 'Taiwan independence' and firmly oppose foreign interference.""
""All of us, Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, should come together to advance the great and glorious cause of China's rejuvenation.""
Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council responded by saying China should focus more on addressing the real concerns of its people and promoting democracy rather than ""undermining international rules and order"".
""Taiwanese public opinion firmly opposes the political framework, military intimidation and diplomatic suppression imposed by China,"" it said. ""Democratic Taiwan is a force for regional peace and stability.""
Most Taiwanese people have shown no interest in being ruled by autocratic China.
Liu Guoshen, an expert on Taiwan as China's Xiamen University, said Li's wording was largely similar to previous years.
""No matter what games the United States or the Democratic Progressive Party play, they won't affect the resolve of the Chinese government on the line they have set for work on Taiwan,"" Liu added, referring to Taiwan's ruling party.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen was re-elected by a landslide in 2020 on a promise of defending the island's democracy and standing up to China.

China says Tsai wishes to push for Taiwan's formal independence, a red line for the Chinese government, which has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under Beijing's control, and has refused Tsai's offers of talks.
Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name.

China claims a large part of the disputed waterway, on which major shipping lanes lie, and has built artificial islands and airfields on some of its reefs and islets, to widespread concern in the region and in the United States.
In a statement late on Friday, the Hainan Maritime Safety Administration said the drills would start from the same day and last until March 15.
It provided coordinates for an area roughly halfway between Hainan's Sanya and the Vietnamese city of Hue. Sanya is home to a major Chinese naval base.
""Entering prohibited,"" it said in a Chinese and English language statement on its website.
Part of the area is well within Vietnam's 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone and Vietnam has previously criticised China for what it calls infringements on its sovereignty.
China's Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and neither did Vietnam's Foreign Ministry.
In 2014, tension between Vietnam and China rose to its highest levels in decades when a Chinese oil rig started drilling in Vietnamese waters. The incident triggered boat rammings by both sides and anti-China riots in Vietnam.

China routinely carries out military exercises in the South China Sea.
Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Brunei all also have competing claims.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) -A suicide bombing at a Shi'ite Muslim mosque during Friday prayers in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar killed at least 58 people and injured nearly 200, hospital officials said.
Islamic State claimed responsibility for the bombing in a statement, which would make it one of the biggest attacks carried out by the group inside Pakistan. 
An armed man who arrived near the mosque on a motorcycle opened fire when he was stopped by police, before forcing his way into a crowded hall and detonating his suicide vest, senior police official Haroon Rasheed said.
The attacker first shot at the police guards at the mosque's entrance, killing one of them, he said. ""The armed man entered the mosque and started firing on the worshippers and finally blew himself up,"" Rasheed added. 
Previously, police had said they were two men on the motorcycle. 
The attack is one of the deadliest in years on Pakistan's Shi'ite minority, which has long been targeted by Sunni Muslim Islamist militants, including Islamic State and Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistani Taliban. 
The Pakistani Taliban distanced themselves from the attack in a message sent to Reuters. 
Many of the injured were in critical condition, officials at the nearby Lady Reading Hospital said, updating the previous toll.
Sardar Hussain, who lost three relatives in the blast, said the mosque was the only place of worship for the Shi'ite community in Peshawar's old city. 
Attacks by Islamist insurgents had become an almost daily occurrence in Pakistan until the military launched a crackdown on militants in 2014. 
'PANIC SPREAD'
Worshippers at the mosque in Peshawar had gathered for Friday prayers, when congregations are usually the largest. 
""Panic spread among the worshippers when the firing started. I ran to save my life,"" one man, who did not give his name, told Reuters at a hospital where he was being treated for his injuries. 
""Suddenly a man came in and started firing... He shot many people (and) then closed his eyes and blew himself up. After that, I have no idea what happened,"" he said.
Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan condemned the bombing, according to his office. 
The attack comes as the Australian cricket team are touring Pakistan for the first time in over two decades and staying in Islamabad, 140 kilometres (87 miles) from Peshawar.

Pakistan recently started hosting international teams again after security concerns forced them to shift many of their high profile international events to the UAE. 
Following the blast, the Australian cricket coach Andrew McDonald said the team touring Pakistan will be guided by security experts.

LVIV, Ukraine/KYIV (Reuters) - Russia blocked Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and some other websites on Friday and passed a law that gave Moscow much stronger powers to crack down on independent journalism, prompting the BBC, Bloomberg and other foreign media to suspend reporting in the country. 
Moscow's attack on Ukraine, the biggest on a European state since World War Two, has created over 1 million refugees, a barrage of sanctions and fears of a global economic hit and wider conflict in the West unthought-of for decades.
Fighting was raging in Ukraine as Russian troops besieged and bombarded cities in the second week of an invasion that has isolated Moscow, which says its attack is a ""special operation"" to capture individuals it regards as dangerous nationalists. 
Kyiv, in the path of a Russian armoured column that has been stalled outside the Ukrainian capital for days, came under renewed assault, with explosions audible from the city centre. Europe's biggest nuclear power plant had also been seized. 
The southeastern port city of Mariupol - a key prize for the Russian forces - has been encircled and shelled. There is no water, heat or electricity and it is running out of food after five days under attack, according to Mayor Vadym Boychenko.
""We are simply being destroyed,"" he said. 
Putin's actions have drawn almost universal condemnation and many countries have imposed heavy sanctions as the West balances punishment with avoiding a widening of the conflict. 
Fighting back in the information war, Russia's parliament passed a law imposing a prison term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally ""fake"" news about the military. 
""This law will force punishment - and very tough punishment - on those who lied and made statements which discredited our armed forces,"" the chairman of the Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin said.
Russia is blocking Facebook for restricting state-backed channels and the websites of the BBC, Deutsche Welle and Voice of America. 
The BBC, Bloomberg News and other foreign media said they would temporarily suspend the work of their journalists in Russia while they assessed the situation.
A glut of global brands have halted operations or exited completely while shipping and supply chain issues have made it difficult to work in Russia. 
French luxury fashion house Chanel said on Friday it is halting all business in Russia while tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is suspending sales of its products and services. 
Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) said it was suspending shipments to Russia and donating $6 million to support humanitarian efforts. 
'DANGEROUS NEW ESCALATION' 
As the battle between Russia and the West escalates on a number of fronts, the United States has warned the conflict in Ukraine is a threat to the rules-based order. 
But at a meeting on Friday, NATO allies rejected Ukraine's appeal for no-fly zones, saying they were increasing support but that stepping in directly could make the situation worse.
""We have a responsibility... to prevent this war from escalating beyond Ukraine because that would be even more dangerous, more devastating and would cause even more human suffering,"" said NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy slammed the summit as ""weak"" and ""confused."" ""It was clear that not everyone considers the battle for Europe's freedom to be the number one goal,"" he said.
He will participate in a Zoom call with the U.S. Senate on Saturday. 
A humanitarian disaster is also unfolding, with more than one million people seeking refuge in western Ukraine and in neighbouring countries.
An attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, about 140 miles (225 km) west of Mariupol, brought the conflict to a perilous moment. 
As shells hit the area, a training building caught fire - triggering a spasm of alarm around the world before the blaze was extinguished and officials said the facility was safe.
The U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said the world had narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe.
The attack reflected a ""dangerous new escalation"" in Russia's invasion, she said during an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting, warning that ""imminent danger"" persisted and demanding assurances from Moscow that such an assault will not happen again.
An official at Energoatom, the Ukrainian state nuclear plant operator, told Reuters fighting had ceased and radiation levels were normal. But his organisation no longer had contact with the plant's managers or control over its nuclear material, he said.
International Atomic Energy Agency chief Raphael Grossi said the plant was undamaged from what he believed was a Russian projectile. Only one of its six reactors was working, at around 60% of capacity.
Russia's defence ministry also said the plant was working normally. It blamed the fire on an attack by Ukrainian saboteurs and said its forces were in control.
The plant and adjacent territory were now being guarded by Russian troops, Moscow's envoy to the United Nations said.
DEFENDING KYIV
Moscow denies targeting civilians in Ukraine and says its aim is to disarm its neighbour, counter what it views as NATO aggression and capture leaders it calls neo-Nazis. 
Ukraine and its Western allies call that a baseless pretext for a war to conquer a country of 44 million people.
More EU sanctions were coming, potentially including a ban on Russian-flagged ships in European ports and blocking imports of steel, timber, aluminium or coal, said Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney. 
The United States is weighing cuts to imports of Russian oil and ways to minimize the impact on global supplies and consumers as lawmakers fast-track a bill that would ban Russian energy imports entirely. 
In Kyiv's Borshchahivka neighbourhood, the twisted engine of a cruise missile lay in the street where it had apparently been downed overnight by Ukrainian air defences.
Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said an advance had been halted on the southern port of Mykolayiv. If captured, the city of 500,000 people would be the biggest yet to fall.
Russian forces have made their biggest advances in the south, where they captured their first sizeable Ukrainian city, Kherson, this week. Bombing has worsened in recent days in the northeast cities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv.
Ukrainians have been fleeing west, many crowding into Lviv near the Polish border.

James Elder of the United Nations children's agency said doctors in Lviv were preparing a system to identify children in case of mass casualties.
""A green dot means fine over here, a yellow dot means critical support. They are learning a black dot means the child won't make it,"" he said.

84,"<span>Mar 04, 2022 10:11PM ET</span>","WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine said that attacking a nuclear power plant is a war crime, after Russia on Friday seized a Ukrainian nuclear facility that is the biggest in Europe. 
The statement on the embassy's Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account went further than any U.S. characterization of Russia's actions in Ukraine since it launched its invasion on Feb. 24.
""It is a war crime to attack a nuclear power plant. Putin's shelling of Europe's largest nuclear plant takes his reign of terror one step further,"" U.S. Embassy Kyiv said in its post.
Russian invasion forces seized Europe's biggest nuclear power plant in heavy fighting in southeastern Ukraine, triggering global alarm, but a blaze in a training building was extinguished and officials said the facility was now safe.
Russia's defense ministry blamed a fire at the plant on a ""monstrous attack"" by Ukrainian saboteurs and said its forces were in control.
The State Department sent a message to all U.S. embassies in Europe telling them not to retweet the Kyiv Embassy's tweet calling the attack a war crime, according to CNN, which said it reviewed the message.
The State Department did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters asking if the Kyiv Embassy's tweet reflects the position of the entire U.S. government.
Rights groups have alleged violations of international war crimes law in Ukraine, including the targeting of civilians, as well as indiscriminate attacks on schools and hospitals.
On Wednesday, U.S. President Joe Biden stopped short of calling Russia's actions war crimes, saying, ""It's too early to say that.""
Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) on Friday declined to answer the question, saying he would leave that determination to the International Criminal Court.
""This just underscores how reckless the Russian invasion has been and how indiscriminate their targeting seems to be. It just raises the level of potential catastrophe to a level that nobody wants to see,"" Kirby said in an interview with CNN. 
""It is certainly not the behavior of a responsible nuclear power.""
Britain has publicly accused Russian President Vladimir Putin's government of war crimes.
The ICC, the world's top war crimes prosecutor, on the request of 39 member states, is investigating reports of cluster bombs and artillery strikes on Ukrainian cities..
Karim Khan, a British lawyer named as the chief prosecutor of the ICC last year, said the crisis in Ukraine is a chance to demonstrate that those committing war crimes would be held to account.

Intentionally targeting civilians and civilian objects is a war crime, a U.S. State Department spokesperson told Reuters, adding that it is backing the investigation, particularly Khan's efforts to preserve evidence of possible atrocity crimes.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has strongly denied claims that Russian forces have struck civilian infrastructure targets or residential complexes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden's administration can continue to rapidly expel migrant families caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, but should not send them anywhere they could be persecuted or tortured, a federal appeals court ruled on Friday.
The ruling by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit lets the government keep in place restrictions first implemented under Democrat Biden's Republican predecessor Donald Trump in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.
A group of affected migrants, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and other non-profit organizations, challenged the legality of the expulsion policy, known as Title 42, in court. 
The appeals court decided that the migrants covered by the policy likely ""have no right to be in the United States"" and that Biden's administration ""can immediately expel them."" 
It added that the administration ""cannot remove aliens to a country where their 'life or freedom would be threatened' on account of their 'race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion'"" or ""to a country where they will likely be tortured.""
The Justice Department declined to comment on the ruling.
Biden has fought to retain the Title 42 order, which was issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in March 2020 as a pandemic-related public health measure. Many in Biden's party have joined some health experts and pro-immigrant advocates in opposing the order, saying it unlawfully cuts off access to asylum and is not supported by scientific evidence.
Biden reversed some of Trump's hardline immigration policies after taking office in January 2021. But government data shows that his administration has expelled migrants more than a million times under the Title 42 order. The total number of migrants expelled under the policy is not clear because many have crossed the border more than once. Most of those expelled have been single adults.
The ruling raises the possibility of the U.S. government having to conduct screenings to determine whether or not a person caught crossing the border has a reasonable fear of persecution or torture if expelled.
Such screenings would make it difficult for the Biden administration to continue large-scale expulsions of families at the border, according to Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy analyst with the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigration group.
A federal judge ruled last September that the Title 42 policy could not be applied to families, but the Biden administration appealed that decision. 
Early in his presidency, Biden exempted unaccompanied children from the expulsion policy. But a federal judge in Texas ruled in a separate decision on Friday that the Biden administration could no longer grant such an exemption.
The Texas ruling, which is at odds with another U.S. District Court order in 2020 blocking expulsions of minors traveling alone when caught at the border, goes into effect in seven days, giving the Biden administration time to appeal.

Border arrests soared to record levels in 2021, Biden's first year in office, and could climb even higher this year, U.S. officials told Reuters in January. 
Republicans have made immigration a major focus heading into the Nov. 8 midterm elections in which they are seeking to regain control of Congress from Biden's party. Republican majorities in Congress could stymie Biden's legislative agenda.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -NATO on Friday rejected Ukrainian calls to help it protect its skies from Russian missiles and warplanes, wary of being dragged into Moscow's war on its neighbour, but Europe promised more sanctions to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy strongly criticised the decision, saying the alliance had given Russia the green light to continue its bombing campaign.
He had earlier appealed to NATO to set up a no-fly zone over Ukraine, which Russia invaded by land, sea and air on Feb. 24.
""We are not part of this conflict,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in denying Ukraine's request.
""We have a responsibility as NATO allies to prevent this war from escalating beyond Ukraine because that would be even more dangerous, more devastating and would cause even more human suffering,"" he said following a NATO meeting in Brussels.
Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, wants to join the European Union and NATO, moves which Moscow says threaten its security and influence. Russia has shelled residential areas and civilian infrastructure, as well as capturing two nuclear sites.
""Today there was a NATO summit, a weak summit, a confused summit, a summit where it was clear that not everyone considers the battle for Europe's freedom to be the number one goal,"" Zelenskiy said a televised address late on Friday.
""Today, the leadership of the alliance gave the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages, having refused to set up a no-fly zone.""
While the West condemned Putin, members of the 30-strong NATO are bound to defend each other in case of attack and wary of sinking into a war with nuclear-armed Russia. The EU threatened more sanctions but it was not clear what it could do. 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the alliance would defend ""every inch"" of NATO territory and that Moscow should not doubt Washington's resolve.
""Ours is a defensive alliance. We seek no conflict. But if conflict comes to us, we are ready,"" he said. 
""We'll continue to raise the cost for President Putin. Unless the Kremlin changes course, it will continue down the road of increasing isolation and economic pain.""
But the alliance - in which the United States, Britain and France are also nuclear powers - dashed Ukraine's hopes of immediate help Kyiv says could turn the tables in the war. 
""We should not have NATO planes operating over Ukrainian airspace or NATO troops operating in Ukrainian territory,"" Stoltenberg said.
MORE DEATHS, MORE SANCTIONS
Support for Ukraine so far has come in the form of the heaviest international economic sanctions against Russia to date, as well as arms supplies from NATO states.
On Friday, the West promised Ukraine more humanitarian aid, essential supplies and military support short of going to war.
In a day of intense diplomacy - if no obvious immediate results - the G7 countries said they would hold accountable those responsible for war crimes and refuse to recognise any Russian territorial gains. 
EU countries said more punishment was coming, after the bloc already cut several Russian lenders from the SWIFT banking system, curbed trade with Moscow and targeted some of the wealth held by Russian oligarchs in the West. 
The EU was looking at curbing Russia's access to the International Monetary Fund, officials said.
""It's Putin's war, and only Putin can end it,"" the top EU diplomat, Josep Borrell, said. ""If someone expects that sanctions can stop the war tomorrow, they don't know what they're talking about.""
Ukraine called on the West to freeze out all Russian banks. But it was not clear when and what more sanctions the EU could agree, given its reliance on Russian energy supplies, which think tank Eurointelligence said amount to $700 million daily.

Stoltenberg said the worst was yet to come as Russia was rolling out more heavy arms.
""The days to come are likely to be worse, with more deaths, more suffering and more destruction,"" he said.

(Reuters) - A growing number of Russians and Ukrainians are traveling to Mexico, buying throwaway cars and driving across the border into the United States to seek asylum, a trend that could accelerate as Russia's invasion of Ukraine has forced more than a million people to flee their homes.
U.S. border officials encountered about 6,400 Russians in the four months between October 2021 and January of this year, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data show. That's more than the roughly 4,100 apprehended during the entire 2021 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30. The jump is similar for Ukrainians, with a little more than 1,000 apprehended since October 2021 through January, compared to about 680 for all of the last fiscal year.
These migrants account for a slim fraction of the 670,000 apprehensions made by U.S. border agents in the first months of the 2022 fiscal year, CBP figures show. The majority of those stopped were from Mexico and Central America and were swiftly removed from the United States.
Yet almost all the Russians and Ukrainians have been allowed to remain while they pursue asylum claims, and their presence has been notable at border-area shelters aimed at helping newcomers.
Since June, Russians have consistently been among the top three nationalities arriving at a San Diego shelter, according to data published by the San Diego Rapid Response Network, a coalition of nonprofits, attorneys and community leaders. Last week, Ukrainians were the third most-common nationality among arrivals.
The CBP figures include only migrants who arrived before Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. But one current and one former border official who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity said there could be further increases as the fighting has intensified.
More than 1 million refugees have already fled Ukraine amid an onslaught of Russian tanks, troops and missiles that Russia has dubbed a ""special operation."" Most have headed to neighboring European countries. But the sheer speed and size of the exodus will exert tremendous pressure on these hosts and likely push some further afield.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, has cracked down on dissent at home by jailing anti-war protesters and closing independent news outlets. Powerful financial sanctions by Western countries are already hammering Russian citizens, adding to migration pressures there.
Would-be migrants from Ukraine and Russia are swapping tips on social media on how to make the journey to the U.S. southern border via Mexico to claim asylum.
Russian dissident Dmitriy Zubarev made that trek last year. A civil rights lawyer, Zubarev had worked on the presidential campaign of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who is currently jailed. Spooked by the growing crackdown on dissent, Zubarev fled after Navalny's organizations were labeled ""extremist"" by the Russian government.
Zubarev told Reuters he boarded a plane in June 2021 from Moscow to Cancun, Mexico, then flew to Tijuana at the U.S border where he boarded a minivan with 11 other migrants. As soon as he crossed over, he said he asked for asylum and was released to pursue his case. Zubarev currently resides in Connecticut. He predicted more Russians would follow.
""Repression is intensifying and the people coming out to protest the war are treated very harshly,"" Zubarev told Reuters. ""There will be more people trying to use refugee routes to escape the bad situation in the country.""
The Russian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Zubarev.
The Russian Embassy in an emailed statement said it was ""very concerned"" about what it characterized as ""detention"" of alleged Russian citizens at the U.S.-Mexico border near San Diego, and that it had contacted the U.S. State Department to verify their identities.
The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
U.S. President Joe Biden and his top officials have said they strongly support Ukrainians as well as Russians who have taken to the streets to protest the invasion.
But his administration so far is playing a secondary role to Europe when it comes to the refugee crisis, and has said it expects most fleeing Ukrainians to head to European nations.
The Biden administration on Thursday said it was granting temporary deportation relief and work permits to tens of thousands of Ukrainians already in the United States as of March 1.
At a congressional hearing on Wednesday, Representative Lou Correa, a Democrat from California, said he was taken aback by the number of Russian and Ukrainian migrants arriving by car when he visited the San Ysidro port of entry between San Diego and Tijuana about a month ago.
A border agent pointed out 20 cars that had been pulled over, saying they were full of Ukrainian and Russian migrants, Correa recalled.
""This problem is not going away,"" Correa said.
YOUTUBE, TELEGRAM TIPS
Under a pandemic-era U.S. policy known as Title 42, most migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border are rapidly expelled without a chance to claim asylum.
Those arriving on foot at official pedestrian crossings are usually turned back before they reach American soil. Vehicles are stopped less frequently.
Thus, some migrants are buying cheap cars in Mexico to enhance their chances of getting across the U.S. border to make their claims, according to former U.S. Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott. ""It's a way to jump the line,"" he said.
In December, CBP said 18 Russian migrants sped towards the San Ysidro port of entry in two cars. A CBP officer shot at the vehicles, striking one which collided with the other, according to a Dec. 14 CBP statement. Two of the migrants suffered minor head injuries, the agency said. At the same time, a third car carrying eight Russian nationals made it into the United States, the statement said.
Migrants who claim they've gained entry to the United States via Mexico are now sharing tips with hopefuls on Russian YouTube and through private group chats on secure apps like Telegram.
There they describe routes and share names and numbers of contacts who can help them procure cars. In a recent exchange in one Russian-language Telegram group, viewed by Reuters, a chat member said ""helpers"" charge at least $1,500 per person to provide a car. Another was trying to find a seat in a car for his Ukrainian mother.
Some Russians and Ukrainians have also tried crossing between ports of entry. In the early morning hours of Jan. 22 near Yuma, Arizona, a Reuters photographer saw a young Ukrainian couple with twin baby girls and a boy turn themselves over to U.S. border agents and ask for asylum.
Jessica Bolter, an immigration expert at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, said the relatively high approval rates for both Russian and Ukrainian asylum seekers in U.S. immigration courts could prove a lure for others.
Government data from the 2022 fiscal year show that about three-quarters of Russians and half of Ukrainians who had applied earlier for asylum were ultimately successful in court, though such cases can take years to process in the backlogged U.S. system.
The Mexico route is also attractive because it's relatively easy for Russians and Ukrainians to obtain visas to fly to Mexico as tourists, then head for the U.S. border, Bolter said. U.S. tourist visa requirements are much more stringent.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Monday that his country is committed to supporting Ukrainian refugees.
""We are not going to close the country,"" he said.
RISKS OF STAYING 'TOO GREAT'
Zubarev, the Russian dissident, said he was the deputy coordinator for Navalny's campaign headquarters in the city of Vladivostok in 2017. That year, agents from Russia's federal security service searched Zubarev's apartment, according to a complaint he filed with the European Court of Human Rights which was viewed by Reuters.
Zubarev said in an interview that when Navalny's movement was designated as extremist last year by the Russian government, ""my legs buckled from under me. I knew what would happen next,"" he said. ""It was just a matter of time before the risks to my personal safety became too great.""
Several of his fellow activists had traveled to the United States via Mexico before him, and shared the route they took, he said. After he arrived in Mexico, he took a couple of days to rest in a hotel in Cancun, before heading to the border. There, he connected with other Russians looking to cross into the United States.
Zubarev would not say how the group obtained the car, but Reuters spoke with an intermediary who has helped Russians find vehicles in Tijuana.
""It's different with them than other migrants, because they have more resources,"" the intermediary said.

After asking for U.S. asylum, Zubarev said he was detained for 53 hours in a frigid border station cell with about 15 other migrants.
After making his way to Connecticut, he dusted off his engineering background and started a business working with fiber optic cables as he waits for his case to be decided.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday reinstated convicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's death sentence for his role in the 2013 attack that killed three people and wounded more than 260 others, ruling in favor of the federal government.
In a 6-3 decision, the justices sided with the Justice Department's challenge to a 2020 federal appeals court ruling that had upheld Tsarnaev's conviction but overturned his death sentence. Because President Joe Biden's administration has imposed a moratorium on the death penalty in federal cases, Tsarnaev does not face imminent execution.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that Biden ""believes that Tsarnaev should be punished"" but also has ""grave concerns about capital punishment as implemented.""
The Supreme Court faulted the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on its findings that Tsarnaev's right to a fair trial under the U.S. Constitution's Sixth Amendment was violated and that the trial judge wrongly excluded certain evidence about a separate crime.
""Dzhokhar Tsarnaev committed heinous crimes. The Sixth Amendment nonetheless guaranteed him a fair trial before an impartial jury. He received one,"" conservative Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the court. 
The court's six conservative justices were in the majority, with its three liberals dissenting.
Biden as a candidate promised to work to pass legislation in Congress to eliminate the death penalty at the federal level and set incentives for states to do so as well, instead endorsing life sentences without probation or parole.
But his administration last year opted to proceed with an appeal initially launched by the Justice Department under his predecessor Donald Trump to defend Tsarnaev's death sentence.
""Legal rulings don't erase trauma and pain. Our focus today, and always, is on the hundreds of families that were deeply impacted and traumatized by this horrific act of domestic terrorism,"" Boston-based U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins (NYSE:ROL), the federal prosecutor in charge of the case, said in a statement.
In a dissenting opinion, liberal Justice Stephen Breyer agreed with the 1st Circuit that evidence about the separate crime, a 2011 triple murder in Waltham, Massachusetts linked to Tsarnaev's older brother Tamerlan, was improperly excluded.
Lawyers for Tsarnaev, who is 28 now and was 19 at the time of the attack, have argued that he played a secondary role in the bombing to his brother, who they called ""an authority figure"" with ""violent Islamic extremist beliefs."" As such, the evidence about another crime Tamerlan allegedly committed would be relevant, they argued.
""This evidence may have led some jurors to conclude that Tamerlan's influence was so pervasive that Dzhokhar did not deserve to die for any of the actions he took in connection with the bombings, even those taken outside of Tamerlan's presence,"" Breyer wrote.
""And it would have taken only one juror's change of mind to have produced a sentence other than death, even if a severe one,"" added Breyer, who in the past has questioned the death penalty's constitutionality.
The primary source of the evidence about the other murders, a man named Ibragim Todashev, was killed by an FBI agent in 2013 when he attacked officers during an interview.
The Supreme Court also found that the trial judge did not violate Tsarnaev's right to a trial in front of an impartial jury by failing to properly screen jurors for potential bias following pervasive news coverage of the bombings. 
CONVICTED ON ALL COUNTS
The Tsarnaev brothers detonated two homemade pressure-cooker bombs at the marathon's finish line on April 15, 2013, and days later killed a police officer. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died after the gunfight with police.
Jurors convicted Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in 2015 on all 30 counts he faced and determined he deserved execution for a bomb he planted that killed Martin Richard, 8, and Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu, 23. Restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29, was killed by the second bomb.
Marc Fucarile, who lost his right leg in the second blast, said the Supreme Court ""did the right thing"" and that the three dissenting justices ""should be ashamed."" Fucarile said he has no confidence Tsarnaev's death sentence will be carried out, especially under Biden's administration.
""He got what he deserves,"" said Fucarile, 43. ""I think we need to send a message: you can't just kill innocent people and set off bombs in crowds of people.""

Mikey Borgard, who sustained hearing loss and a brain injury in the attack, attended Tsarnaev's trial and opposes executing anyone. Borgard called the Supreme Court's ruling ""not only erroneous in its logic but shamefully lacking in its moral and ethical fiber.""
No federal inmates were executed for 17 years before Trump oversaw 13 executions in the last six months of his presidency.

ABU DHABI (Reuters) -The United States still needs other nations to take Afghans who fled their homeland last year, a senior U.S. State Department official said on Friday, six months after Washington's chaotic withdrawal as the hard-line Islamist Taliban took control.
Washington has been urging its partners to take Afghans who do not qualify to be resettled in the United States, while those who do are facing a lengthy, complicated immigration process.
""We have a call with international colleagues, with about 60 countries every week, and we always remind them of the importance of them participating in this international effort,"" the official told reporters on condition of anonymity.
""We had an international effort in Afghanistan for 20 years. Now we have to have an international effort for resettlement for Afghans that are coming out of Afghanistan.""
There are thousands of Afghans in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere who have been waiting months to be resettled.
The official made the remarks after visiting a transit facility for Afghans in the United Arab Emirates capital Abu Dhabi, where rare protests by hundreds of Afghans held there erupted last month, criticising the months-long resettlement process and calling to be immediately sent to the United States.
The official said an apology was offered to Afghans in meetings at the facility for how long it had taken and that the pace to get those eligible to enter the United States would pick up once all people there were documented, which was expected to happen shortly. 
There are about 12,000 Afghans held in UAE sites, of which several thousand will qualify to be resettled in the United States, the official said, while Afghans who did not meet the criteria but had travelled on several private chartered flights approved by the White House would also be resettled.
It is unclear which countries would take those without a path to the United States.
""We've had only very preliminary conversations with a few of our international colleagues,"" the official said.
Afghans later told Reuters they felt dejected after the visit by the official, who they said offered no clarity on their resettlement, including how much longer they will be there.
The official told media it was hoped that all Afghans in the UAE would be resettled by August but there was no way to be sure yet.
The United States has taken in 85,000 Afghans since the middle of last August when the West was withdrawing after two decades of war in Afghanistan and the collapse of the Western-backed government.
Diplomats say the prolonged resettlement was adding stress to already strained relations between the UAE and the United States, which are close security and economic partners.
""The Emiratis don't feel they are their responsibility and want them out,"" a European diplomat said, requesting anonymity.

The official acknowledged that the Emiratis were frustrated with how slow the process has been but said that hosting the Afghans was an initiative of the UAE and, unlike with other nations, there was no formal arrangement between Washington and the Gulf state. 
UAE authorities could not be immediately reached for comment.

TAIPEI (Reuters) -The United States should formally recognise Taiwan as a country, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday during a speech in Taipei, drawing a stern rebuke from China for his ""babbling nonsense"".
""The United States government should immediately take necessary and long overdue steps to do the right and obvious thing: that is to offer the Republic of China, Taiwan, America's diplomatic recognition as a free and sovereign country,"" Pompeo said in a speech organised by a Taiwan think tank.
Washington ended formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 when it recognised the People's Republic of China. 
While Taiwan's official name is the Republic of China, politicians often add ""Taiwan"" in their public comments.
""While the United States should continue to engage with the People's Republic of China as a sovereign government, America's diplomatic recognition of the 23 million freedom-loving Taiwanese people and its legal, democratically-elected government can no longer be ignored, avoided, or treated as secondary,"" Pompeo said.
The comments by Pompeo, considered a possible contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, cross a sensitive red line for China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under Chinese control. 
""Pompeo is a former politician whose credibility has long gone bankrupt. Such a person's babbling nonsense will have no success,"" said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin.
China says Taiwan is the most important and sensitive issue in its relations with Washington.
The Biden administration has declined to comment on Pompeo's visit to Taipei, and a spokesperson for the State Department, asked to comment on his call for Washington to recognise Taiwan, replied: ""As a general practice, we do not comment on the travel or comments of a private citizen.""
China placed sanctions on Pompeo when he left office at the end of the Trump presidency last year, angered by his repeated criticism of the country, especially its ruling Communist Party, and support for Chinese-claimed Taiwan.
He met Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen on Thursday, who bestowed a presidential honour on him.
China put sanctions on ""lying and cheating"" Pompeo and 27 other top Trump-era officials as President Joe Biden took office in January 2021.
Donald Trump's administration gave strong backing to Taiwan, despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties, including high-profile arms sales and visits by top U.S. officials to Taipei. 
China has stepped up its military and diplomatic pressure against Taiwan over the past two years, seeking to force the island to accept its sovereignty. 
Taiwan's democratically-elected government says it wants peace but will defend itself if attacked, and that only the island's people have the right to decide their future.

Pompeo said after Beijing's ""brutally successful takeover of Hong Kong,"" Chinese President Xi Jinping feels more powerful and ""won't be satisfied stopping at Hong Kong"".
""Taking over Taiwan, a necessary mission, is not only to boost Xi's egomaniacal claim of greatness, but indeed to solidify it,"" Pompeo said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday ruled in favor of the FBI in a case concerning discrimination claims by three Muslim men from California who accused the agency of conducting illegal surveillance on them after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.
The court unanimously overturned a lower court's 2019 ruling that said a federal law regulating government surveillance called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) trumped the state secrets privilege - a legal defense based on national security interests - that the government asserted.
The ruling means the case returns to lower courts for further litigation, with the claims made by the plaintiffs not yet dismissed.
The Supreme Court faulted the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' analysis, with Justice Samuel Alito writing that the FISA provision in question ""does not displace the state secrets privilege.""
The lawsuit accused the FBI of infiltrating mainstream mosques in Southern California and targeting Muslim Americans for surveillance because of their religion. It accused the FBI of engaging in religious discrimination in violation of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment by targeting Muslims, as well as violating the Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures. 
The plaintiffs are: Eritrean-born U.S. citizen Yassir Fazaga, an imam at the Orange County Islamic Foundation in Mission Viejo; native-born U.S. citizen Ali Uddin Malik, who attended the Islamic Center of Irvine; and Yasser Abdel Rahim, a U.S. permanent resident from Egypt who also attended the Islamic Center of Irvine. They are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and others.
The lawsuit focused upon a 14-month period in 2006 and 2007 when the FBI paid an informant named Craig Monteilh to gather information on Muslims as part of a post-Sept. 11 counterterrorism investigation. Monteilh met with Muslims in southern California, adopted a Muslim name and said he wanted to convert to Islam, according to court papers. Monteilh also recorded conversations and conducted surveillance, according to court papers.
The arrangement unraveled when Monteilh started making statements about wanting to take violent action. Community members reported him to the local police and obtained a restraining order against him, according to court papers.

A federal judge in 2012 dismissed the claims against the FBI, determining that they were barred under the state secrets privilege. The judge did permit claims accusing some individual FBI agents of violating the surveillance law.
The 9th Circuit ruled that the religious claims should instead be analyzed under a section of the FISA law that lets judges review the legality of surveillance. The 9th Circuit also allowed the unlawful search claims, not at issue before the Supreme Court, to move forward.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Images of cluster bombs and artillery strikes on Ukrainian cities this week have prompted the world's top war crimes prosecutor to launch an investigation, with the support of dozens of nations opposed to Russia's invasion.
Karim Khan, a British lawyer named as the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court last year, said the crisis in Ukraine is a chance to demonstrate that those committing war crimes would be held to account.
""I think the world is watching. The world expects better,"" Khan, 51, said on Thursday in his offices in The Hague, announcing he had dispatched an advance team of investigators and lawyers to the region.
""Any side that targets - directly targets - civilians or civilian objects is committing a crime.""
According to the United Nations, at least 249 civilians have been killed since Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine on Feb. 24, in the biggest military attack on a European state since World War Two.
Ukrainian emergency services have placed the civilian death toll nearly 10 times higher.
Like all U.N. states, Russia and Ukraine are subject to the 1949 Geneva Conventions - which established legal standards for humanitarian treatment in war and outlawed deliberate attacks on civilians. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has accused Russian troops of intensifying their bombardment of civilians in recent days, as the Russian forces laid seige to cities. An unprecedented 39 member states petitioned the ICC this week to open an investigation, including most European Union states and Britain, which publicly accused Russian President Vladimir Putin's government of war crimes.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov strongly denied this. 
""Russian forces are not launching any strikes at civilian infrastructure targets or residential complexes,” Peskov told Reuters on Tuesday. 
Moscow says it is conducting a ""special operation"" to demilitarize Ukraine and has in turn accused Kyiv of genocide against Russian speakers. Kyiv strongly denies this.
Past cases at the ICC and U.N. war crimes tribunals suggest that - despite the mounting civilian casualties - Khan's team faces a long and difficult process to prove violations of international humanitarian law in Ukraine and to prosecute those responsible.
Noting that his office is overstretched as it conducts 16 cases and trials worldwide, Khan himself acknowledged that the Ukraine investigation represents ""myriad challenges, opportunities and difficulties"".
    This week's request by member states enabled the ICC to open a fast-track inquiry on Ukraine after eight years of preliminary work on events dating back to Russia's annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014, but Khan said his office is scrambling for resources.
    ""We need everything,"" he said. ""From lawyers to investigators, to analysts and military experts, to forensics, language experts and psycho-social support.""
A successful prosecution requires meticulously documenting incidents and preserving evidence in a war zone. But, as the ICC does not command its own police force, it must rely on national governments for intelligence, the provision of evidence, and the detention of any suspects for transfer to The Hague.
Although neither Russia nor Ukraine are among the ICC's 123 member countries, Ukraine gave prosecutors authorisation to investigate crimes under the court's jurisdiction -- meaning that Russian or Ukrainian soldiers, military commanders and politicians could in theory be tried before the ICC for any war crimes committed.
    To qualify as a war crime, an act must be proven to have been deliberate or indiscriminate, said Juliette McIntyre, a law lecturer at the University of South Australia and a specialist in international courts and tribunals.
    ""There is obviously a lot of emotion involved when we see buildings being blown up, but international humanitarian law - or the law of war - doesn't absolutely prohibit harm to civilians or their property,"" McIntyre said. ""It tolerates some collateral damage."" 
PUTIN A TARGET?
Astrid Reisinger Coracini, lecturer at the University of Vienna Department of International Law, said one of the major challenges the ICC team faces is finding evidence to link crimes on the ground to leaders higher in hierarchy who gave orders. 
""And the higher it goes, the more difficult it becomes,"" she said. 
Since it opened its doors in 2002 to prosecute the gravest atrocities, the ICC has secured five convictions for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide from 38 defendants.
Several cases are ongoing; four suspects were acquitted, three died and 10 remain at large, including Sudan's former President Omar al-Bashir.
However, international tribunals have convicted numerous political leaders for war crimes, including Liberia's former president Charles Taylor.
Asked if the ICC could pursue senior politicians including Putin himself for any crimes committed in Ukraine, Khan did not directly respond but cited the Taylor precedent: ""It's very clear ... if crimes are committed - if there is evidence to support it - the writ of law will allow prosecution.""
British attorney Wayne Jordash, who represented high-level suspects at the U.N. tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, said ICC prosecutors should focus on Putin after his public comments and a recent live television appearance with his security team show ""he's fully in control"". 
Jordash added that Putin had a long history of intervention in Ukraine, dating back to the annexation of Crimea and support for rebel groups in the eastern region of Donbass.
""We have cluster bombs (in the current conflict). We have hitting of civilian targets, which cannot and do not look as though they are accidents,"" said Jordash, who has helped collect evidence of atrocities in Ukraine since 2014. ""Even if there wasn't sufficient (evidence) to move to an investigation before, there certainly is now.""
Russia has consistently denied backing the pro-Moscow rebels in Ukraine and says that Crimea voted to join Russia in a disputed 2014 referendum.
The use of cluster munitions - which experts told Reuters were fired on Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv on Monday - is not prohibited in itself because neither Russia nor Ukraine has joined a 2008 convention banning them.
    However, it could be a war crime if used in an indiscriminate attack or one intentionally targeting civilians, six experts interviewed by Reuters said, referring to the Rome Statute that established the ICC and defines the nature of the crimes it may try. 
SYRIA, CHECHNYA
Three experts interviewed by Reuters cited Russia's track record of conducting campaigns in civilian areas, including air strikes that hit hospitals in Aleppo, Syria, in 2016, and the 1999-2000 battle of Grozny during the Second Chechen War, which left the city destroyed.
Russia has denied indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets in Syria, Chechnya and now Ukraine.
    According to Human Rights Watch, among the most serious incidents in the last week that may violate the rules of war was a Russian ballistic missile carrying a cluster bomb that struck outside a hospital in the eastern town of Vuhledar on the first day of the invasion, killing four civilians and injuring 10.
    Amnesty International also reported an explosive weapon, which it described as likely an artillery shell, that hit a kindergarten in Chernihiv on Feb. 26.
Intentional attacks on schools and hospital facilities are expressly cited as war crimes under the Rome Statute, as are assaults on purely civilian areas with no military defences.
    In Kharkiv, officials told Reuters that dozens of civilians had died in Russian artillery barrages on residential areas this week.
    ""The Russian enemy is firing at entire residential areas of Kharkiv, where there is no critical infrastructure, where there are no Ukrainian army positions that the Russians could be targeting,"" town official Oleg Synegubov said. 
    Reuters was unable to independently verify the three incidents.   
Dr Carrie McDougall, senior lecturer at the University of Melbourne, said that even if prosecutors pursue Putin, 69, there was little chance he would stand trial in The Hague while he remains in office - which he could do until 2036 following a law introduced last year. 

But McDougall envisaged the scenario would shift if Putin loses power, given there is no statute of limitations on war crimes and no immunity possible.
""So Putin and the officials around him could be held responsible for any war crimes that are committed,"" she said. ""Whether it's in 5 years or 10 years or 15 years ... we're talking about the long arm of justice.""

BERLIN (Reuters) - Ukrainian refugee Anastasia said she has barely slept in the 90 hours it has taken her to flee to Berlin after Russian missiles started raining down on her hometown of Kharkiv, blowing out the windows of her flat.
Now the 31-year-old artist, who did not give her last name for fear of repercussions for her relatives left behind, is one of more than a thousand mainly women and children arriving each day in Germany via Poland to seek refuge.
""We left our home the moment the planes shot at our community and the glass in our windows broke,"" Anastasia said at Berlin's main train station, before taking the last train of her odyssey to stay with relatives in Munich.
""We have no stuff, we have no money, we have no anything now,"" she said, adding through sobs that she was afraid for the men of conscription age who were obliged to stay and help in the defense.
A million refugees have already crossed from Ukraine into the European Union in eastern Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary and northern Romania since the start of the Russian invasion, according to the United Nations.
And what started as a trickle in Germany has already grown into a steady flow of more than a thousand as railway operator Deutsche Bahn offers refugees free travel.
At the main train station, volunteers saying which languages they speak seek to orientate refugees upon arrival, recalling scenes from 2015, when more than a million people from the Middle East fled to Europe and Germany took in the bulk of newcomers.
One floor has transformed itself into a makeshift welcome center, with volunteers serving up hot food, handing out warm clothes and shoes and providing toys for children to play with.
GERMANS RALLY SUPPORT
Donation collection points for Ukrainians have sprung up around town in recent days as Berlin residents use messaging applications like Telegram to organize aid efforts.
In one corner of the station, some hold up signs offering accommodation in their homes as an alternative to state shelters.
""You feel sort of helpless, so I wanted to at least help someone to get a few nights good sleep,"" said Paulin Nusser, 26, a student living in a shared flat holding up a sign offering a couch for a few nights.
David Henning, 31, said he was giving over one floor of his hotel to refugees. So far, he had welcomed fleeing students who just needed one night's rest before continuing their trip as well as several mothers and children who needed a while to figure out their life.
Aid groups told Reuters the fact this war is within Europe means it has hit closer to home than those in the Middle East that sparked the 2015 crisis, fostering even greater willingness to help.
Meanwhile both they and the state are better organized to jump into action, thanks to that previous experience, while the bureaucracy is easier. EU interior ministers agreed on Thursday to grant temporary residency to Ukrainians sparing them from going through lengthy asylum procedures.

But that did not save them from trauma, said Ahmed Makhzomi, 31, who arrived from Iraq during the 2015 migrant wave and is now volunteering at Berlin's central station.
""I've lived through many wars, I know what it's like,"" he said. ""So I wanted to help in what way I could.""

The attack is one of the most deadly in recent years in Papua, a resource-rich area that has seen a simmering separatist conflict since being incorporated into Indonesia in 1969. 
Aqsha Erlangga, a military spokesman in Papua, said in a statement that armed groups had gunned down the eight people at the tower in the Puncak district and that one worker, who he said could be seen on CCTV pleading for help, survived.
Sebby Sambom, a spokesman for the separatist Free Papua Movement (OPM) in a statement said some of its members were responsible for the attack, and prior warnings had been issued to civilians to vacate an area that he said was a war zone.
""Those shot were members of the military and police,"" he said. 
Ahmad Mustofa Kamal, a police spokesman in Papua, said police believed that five armed groups were behind the incident in the early hours of Wednesday, in retaliation for attacks by security forces.
He told Kompas TV that police had warned civilians about the risk of violence in the area and although there were sufficient security personnel, there was always a threat. 
""We have to be careful because terror groups can do whatever they want, whenever they want,"" Kamal said.
In December 2018, the military wing of the OPM claimed responsibility for killing at least 16 construction workers and a soldier building a road in Nduga district.
The separatists said they viewed the construction workers as being members of the military and casualties of a war against the Indonesian government.
United Nations human rights experts this week called on Indonesia to hold an independent investigation into reports of ""shocking abuses"" targeting indigenous Papuans, including killings and enforced displacement. Indonesia rejected the call and said the Southeast Asian nation has already tackled the accusations.

TOKYO/SEOUL (Reuters) -Russia's seizure of a Ukrainian nuclear power plant has raised fears about access to radiation data, atomic experts said, although they stressed they did not see immediate radiological risks and a U.N. watchdog said its reactors were undamaged.
Russian forces captured the Zaporizhzhia plant - Europe's largest - after attacking it in the early hours of Friday, setting an adjacent five-storey training facility on fire, Ukrainian authorities said.
Russia has blamed the attack on the plant on Ukrainian saboteurs. 
In a press conference on Friday, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi said no damage had been done to the Zaporozhzhia reactors and Ukrainian staff continued to operate the nuclear facilities while Russian forces controlled the area.
The radiation monitoring system at the site was functioning normally and there had been no release of radioactive material, Grossi said.
Park Jong-woon, a professor at the energy and electric engineering department of Dongguk University, said he did not think there was an immediate radiological threat posed by the plant's seizure, but added Russia could disrupt public access to radiation data to sow confusion. 
""They can make people wonder, freak them out and spread fear,"" said Park, who worked at state-run power operators between 1996 and 2009, helping build nuclear reactors.
The fire at the Zaporizhzhia facility has since been extinguished but it had raised ""a very real concern"" about the potential for disaster, Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington D.C., said.
""For example, the prospect of a widespread fire, although that appears not to be the case, could disable the plant's electrical systems and lead to an event very much like Fukushima if cooling is not restored in time,"" he said.
More broadly, experts expressed worries about access to real time data necessary for gauging the radiation situation on the ground.
The official website for radiation readings at the Zaporizhzhia site was not immediately accessible as of Friday afternoon, Lyman said.
Since last week's takeover by Russian forces of Chernobyl - the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster and now a defunct power plant - monitoring of radiation levels there has been more difficult, according to Kenji Nanba, who heads Fukushima University's Institute of Environmental Radioactivity and has been involved in a joint research project with Ukrainian scientists.
He said an official Ukrainian website with hourly radiation measurements from Chernobyl's exclusion zone had been down for days and that another site had gradually lost most of its real-time readings.
Although the damaged Chernobyl reactor is stable and is covered under a large new containment structure, Nanba said it was still crucial for researchers like himself to track radiation data at the site to make sure there were no sudden changes. 

Elevated radiation readings were recorded near Chernobyl after it was taken over by Russian forces last week, but experts say those were most likely caused by military activity that kicked up irradiated dirt and earth into the air. 
The fourth reactor at Chernobyl exploded in April 1986 during a botched safety test, sending clouds of radiation billowing across much of Europe. Estimates for the numbers of direct and indirect deaths from the disaster vary from the low thousands to as many as 93,000 extra cancer deaths worldwide.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - Every year since 1973, Alaska has celebrated the virtues of perseverance and fortitude by hosting the Iditarod, a 1,000-mile (1,610-km) dog sled race across the state's frozen wilderness that pushes its participants to the limits of endurance. 
But Alaska is much less frozen than it was 50 years ago. The state has warmed at more than twice the global rate, altering the Anchorage-to-Nome race along with nearly every aspect of life in the far north.
""Alaska is a bit of a poster child for global warming,"" said Rob Urbach, chief executive of the Iditarod Sled Dog Race, which holds its traditional ceremonial start in Alaska's largest city on Saturday. 
Nearly 50 mushers and their dogs have registered to compete in the race.
The Iditarod has weathered numerous challenges over its history, including sharp criticism by animal-rights activists who have pressured corporate sponsors to drop their Iditarod support because they say the race is inhumane to the dogs.
With Anchorage bathing in near-record late-winter warmth, reminders of the changing climate will abound this year. Instead of fluffy snow, rain has drenched the area in recent days, leaving a coating of ice on streets and trails.
The National Weather Service has forecast more rain on Friday, along with temperatures climbing into the mid-40s Fahrenheit (around 7 Celsius). On Saturday, temperatures are expected to stay above the freezing point with more showers.
Luckily for the mushers and their dogs – who prefer to run in crisp, cold weather - the 11-mile (17.7-km) Anchorage portion of the race is merely ceremonial. Timed competition begins on Sunday, when teams are set to depart from Willow Lake, about a 75-mile (120-km) drive north of the city. 
So mushers and dogs will have the chance to adjust to conditions on Saturday without worrying about losing time, said Mark Nordman, the Iditarod's race director and marshal.
""Every one of these mushers can stop and take a lunch break,"" Nordman said during a media briefing on Wednesday. ""If it's too warm, they stop. It's a long way to Nome.""
CHANGES AND CHALLENGES
Over time, the changing climate has forced major adjustments. Three times, most recently in 2017, unseasonably warm conditions forced the Iditarod to move its restart much farther north, to Fairbanks.
In 2020, flooding swamped the ultra-thin Bering Sea ice that teams had to skirt near the end of the race. Three racers and their dogs had to be rescued from the coastal site only 25 miles (40 km) from the Nome finish line. Contestants who followed had to be rerouted farther inland to avoid the standing water.
The Iditarod has undergone other big changes since race founder Joe Redington Sr. mortgaged his house to fund the first race in 1973. That year, the winner reached Nome in 20 days, the budget was skimpy and the competition was so low-key that the event was sometimes likened to a 1,000-mile camping trip. 
""Obviously, we were content just to get to Nome,"" said Dan Seavey of Seward, Alaska, one of the mushers in the inaugural race.
Now many Iditarod mushers - like defending champion Dallas Seavey, Dan Seavey's grandson - are professionals. Equipment is high-tech, racers are tracked by GPS, fans around the world watch live coverage through on-demand streaming services and winners reach the Nome finish line within nine days. 
The race has also adjusted to the COVID-19 pandemic. Last year's race was converted to an out-and-back route of about 860 miles (1,384 km) that started and finished near Willow Lake, avoiding all the Native villages that lie along the trail.

This year's Iditarod is back on the traditional route to Nome, though some COVID-19 safety protocols remain in place, such as mandatory vaccines, testing and social distancing. The precautions, deemed necessary to protect vulnerable villages with sparse medical services, are appropriate for an event that honors an historic medical rescue mission to Nome, Urbach said.
""We are still channeling 1925, the Serum Run to Nome,"" he said, referring to the famous sled-dog relay that brought diphtheria medicine to the Bering Sea gold-mining town.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea's main nuclear facility is in full swing, a new report said on Friday, the latest evidence to highlight the challenges facing whoever wins next week's presidential election in South Korea.
With denuclearisation talks stalled, North Korea conducted a record number of missile launches in January. It appears to be preparing to launch a spy satellite in the near future, and has suggested it could resume testing of nuclear weapons or its longest range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) for the first time since 2017.
International monitors say that behind the scenes, North Korea also appears to be using reactors at its Yongbyon complex to produce fuel for potential nuclear weapons and an expansion of its nuclear production facilities.
""The activities observed in Yongbyon indicate ongoing fissile material production as well as the groundwork for further expansion,"" the U.S.-based 38 North project said in a report, citing commercial satellite imagery of the site. 
North Korea may now be close to inaugurating an Experimental Light Water Reactor (ELWR), though additional work would need to be done to expand capacity of a radiochemical laboratory, which reprocesses spent fuel for plutonium extraction, the report said.
""North Korea's plutonium production capacity could increase substantially,"" it concluded.
The report comes less than a week before South Korea's March 9 election to choose a new president to replace outgoing incumbent Moon Jae-in.
'MAJOR PROVOCATION'
Moon's efforts to broker a deal between North Korea and the United States have been stalled since 2019.
The United States has said it is open to talks without preconditions, but Pyongyang says talks are only possible after the United States and allies drop hostile policies.
""While (U.S. President Joe) Biden is focused on the Ukraine crisis, North Korea would be looking for a chance to recapture U.S. attention, and think the best strategy is to carry out a major provocation,"" said Kim Sung-han, a professor at Korea University. Kim is the top foreign policy aide for Yoon Suk-yeol, the conservative frontrunner in the presidential election.
Kim believes it's only a matter of time before North Korea breaks its self-imposed moratorium on testing ICBMs or nuclear weapons.
Yoon sparked controversy in South Korea by saying preemptive strikes may be the only way to counter North Korea's new ""hypersonic missiles"", designed to potentially evade missile defences.
If elected, Yoon would not pursue dialogue for the sake of dialogue, but would unveil a roadmap aimed at appealing to North Korea's own interests, Kim said.
""We have to create conditions where North Korea would make a rational choice, whether they stay out of talks and continue to suffer from the current sanctions and pressure, or whether they could bring a turning point for easing sanctions by having practical, working-level talks,"" he added.
Meanwhile aides to Lee Jae-myung, the candidate from Moon's Democratic Party, have said he would devise a roadmap where Washington can actually ease sanctions in phases when Pyongyang takes steps to dismantle its nuclear and missile programmes, with a so-called ""snapback"" clause designed to restore the sanctions if it backpedals.
Unless South Korea can persuade the United States and North Korea to return to negotiations, this year could see much higher tensions, said Lee Jong-seok, former unification minister and deputy national security advisor who advises Lee Jae-myung.

North Korea said a missile launch on Feb. 27 was for the development of a reconnaissance satellite system, and Lee Jong-seok said a full satellite launch could come soon after the election.
""Any satellite launch would bring serious repercussions, as it's the same technology used to launch an ICBM,"" he told Reuters.

(Reuters) - Florida's Republican-led Senate on Thursday gave final passage to a bill to ban abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, putting the state one step closer to adopting a gestational limit currently under review by the U.S. Supreme Court.
The state's House of Representatives, which also has a Republican majority, approved the measure last month on a party-line vote. 
Final legislative passage on a 23-15 vote in the Senate sent the bill to Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, who is expected to sign the measure into law.
""Governor DeSantis is pro-life and has voiced support for the concepts in this bill,"" his spokesperson, Christina Pushaw, said earlier in the day.
Enactment of the bill would significantly reduce access to late-term abortions for women across the U.S. Southeast, many of whom travel hundreds of miles to end pregnancies in Florida because of stricter abortion laws in surrounding states. 
The state currently permits abortions within up to 24 weeks of pregnancy without a mandatory waiting period, meaning a woman can terminate her pregnancy the day she arrives at a clinic.
Florida's measure, which would take effect on July 1, makes exceptions to the 15-week restriction only in cases when the mother is at risk of death or ""irreversible physical impairment,"" or if the fetus has a fatal abnormality. 
In a session on Wednesday, Republicans defeated an amendment that would have made exceptions for rape, incest and human trafficking.
Democratic lawmakers who supported the amendment asked their colleagues to focus on the emotional needs of pregnant victims of sexual assault. ""We're better than this,"" state Senator Victor Torres said.
The bill's sponsor, state Senator Kelli Stargel, defended the bill's exclusion of an exception for rape, saying she rejected the premise that a ""child should be killed because of the circumstances in which it was conceived.""
Republican lawmakers around the country have introduced bills mirroring a 15-week abortion ban enacted by Mississippi and now being weighed by the U.S. Supreme Court after lower courts blocked the measure as unconstitutional. Arizona's Senate and West Virginia's House passed similar 15-week abortion bans last month.
Some states have also sought to craft their own versions of a Texas law that bans abortion at six weeks and empowers citizens to sue people who assist women getting abortions past that point. Idaho's state Senate passed a Texas-style six-week abortion ban on Thursday, sending it next to the state House for approval.
During oral arguments in December, the Supreme Court indicated its willingness to allow Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban to stand. A ruling in Mississippi's favor would conflict with the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision establishing the right to end a pregnancy before the fetus is viable, typically around 24 weeks.
Besides seeking reinstatement of its abortion law, the state of Mississippi in Jackson Women's Health Organization v. Dobbs has asked the high court to overturn Roe altogether.

The Supreme Court's ruling is expected this spring. 
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Florida said a privacy clause in Florida's constitution that explicitly protects against government ""intrusion"" in residents' private lives would be grounds for a lawsuit challenging a 15-week abortion ban.

(Reuters) - A Kentucky jury on Thursday acquitted a white former detective of endangering neighbors of Breonna Taylor during a botched raid that killed the Black woman in her home, clearing law enforcement of all criminal liability in a case that rocked the United States in 2020.
Detective Brett Hankison, 45, whose stray bullets hit a neighboring apartment in the city of Louisville during the execution of a ""no knock"" search warrant after midnight, was the only officer charged in the case, with wanton endangerment.
Hankison could be heard sobbing behind his face mask as the verdict was read three times, one for each of the occupants of the neighboring apartment, according a Court TV reporter who was in the courtroom.
Relatives of Taylor who were in the gallery also wept, the reporter said.
The jury deliberated for about three hours after hearing closing arguments on Thursday at the conclusion of a one-week trial at Jefferson County Circuit Court.
The death of Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician who was unarmed, was one in a trio of cases that fueled a summer of protests against racial injustice and police violence two years ago, when the country was reeling from the still-new coronavirus pandemic.
The other cases resulted in guilty verdicts for the murders of two Black men in 2020: George Floyd in Minneapolis and Ahmaud Arbery in Brunswick (NYSE:BC), Georgia.
Those convictions had offered a measure of justice after Black activists and victims have said their protests against racial violence were largely ignored before the advent of cellphone video.
In this case, a grand jury cleared the two white officers who shot Taylor but charged Hankison for endangering neighbors in the adjacent apartment. A grand juror on the case later said Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron only presented the wanton endangerment charges against Hankison to the grand jury.
That meant the only trial to result from her death hinged on whether a police officer was justified in firing his weapon upon hearing a barrage of gunfire.
""Today's decision adds to the frustration and anger of many over the inability to find more accountability for the tragic events of March 13, 2020,"" Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said in a statement. ""I know that for many, justice has still not been achieved.""
Police wanted to search the home in connection with a drug investigation in which Taylor's ex-boyfriend was a suspect.
After police broke down Taylor's door, her new boyfriend, fearing a break-in and saying he did not hear police identify themselves, fired one shot from and handgun that wounded an officer. That officer and another returned fire, shooting 22 times.
In tearful testimony on Wednesday, Hankison said he mistakenly believed his fellow officers were coming under heavy fire. He shot 10 times from outside the apartment.
""I think it was absolutely the fact that he was doing his job as a police officer,"" defense attorney Stew Mathews told reporters after the verdict, according to the Louisville Courier Journal. ""The jury felt like, you go out and perform your duty and your brother officer gets shot, you've got a right to defend yourself.""
Taylor's mother, Tamika Palmer, left without commenting, the Courier Journal said. Taylor's family in 2020 won a $12 million wrongful death settlement from the city of Louisville.
Taylor's death at first drew little national attention but was thrust into prominence after a Minneapolis police officer killed Floyd by pinning a knee to his neck on May 25, 2020. 
Around then, video surfaced showing the February 2020 shooting death of Arbery after he was chased by three white men.

Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of murdering Floyd last year and sentenced to more than 22 years in prison. 
The three civilians charged in Arbery's death were convicted of murder in a state trial last year.

PARIS (Reuters) - French authorities seized four cargo vessels and one luxury yacht linked to oligarchs as the United States and other governments ramped up sanctions on Russia's super-rich on Thursday over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Customs officials seized the yacht of Rosneft boss Igor Sechin, who is on the U.S. and EU sanctions lists, before it attempted to flee a French Riviera port, the French finance minister said. 
At least five other superyachts owned by Russian billionaires are anchored or cruising in the Maldives, an Indian Ocean island nation with no extradition treaty with the United States, ship tracking data showed.
Washington, the European Union and others have said they will target the assets of oligarchs who have amassed fortunes and political influence under Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In a statement, Rosneft declined to comment on the French move, saying Sechin was unaware that any company linked to him owned the yacht. 
On Thursday, the United States imposed full blocking sanctions on another eight oligarchs and officials, as well as some of their companies and family members, over the invasion, which Putin has termed a ""special operation"" in Ukraine. 
""We want him (Putin) to feel the squeeze, we want the peoplearound him to feel the squeeze,"" White House spokeswoman JenPsaki told reporters.
A French official said as many as 510 people could be subject to asset freezes there. 
In Germany, a nearly $600 million luxury yacht owned by Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, also on the EU's sanctions list, was sitting in a Hamburg shipyard. A spokesman for Hamburg's economic authority said there were no plans for the yacht to be delivered to its owner, without providing further detail. 
He denied that the government had seized the more than 500-foot (150-metre) Dilbar superyacht. Forbes had reported on Wednesday that the Dilbar had been undergoing a refit in shipyards of Blohm + Voss and that the German government had frozen the asset.
While he has not been targeted for UK sanctions, Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich said on Wednesdayhe would sell Chelsea Football Club and promised to donatemoney from the sale to help victims of the war in Ukraine. 
TRACKING ASSETS 
In Britain, foreign minister Liz Truss vowed there was ""nowhere for any of Putin's cronies to hide."" 
Truss said Britain was working on a further list of individuals, amid criticism Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government is taking too long to target individuals linked to Putin who have homes and other assets in the country.
A government source said Britain could change the law to make it easier to impose sanctions.
The EU, the United States, Canada and Britain are pooling efforts to examine how oligarchs could find ways to bypass the sanctions and also to nail down the role of trust companies in holding assets, an EU official said on Thursday.
This task force will aim to close loopholes as they become apparent, the official said. 
READY TO FLEE? 
""Thanks to the French customs officers who are enforcing the European Union's sanctions against those close to the Russian government,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday after French customs seized the 88-metre (190-foot) Amore Vero (True Love) before it left port.
It was impounded in the Riviera port of La Ciotat and belongs to a company whose main shareholder is the Rosneft chief Sechin, a close ally of Putin, the finance ministry said.
The Amore Vero arrived on Jan. 3 and was due to stay until April 1 for repairs, the ministry said in a statement, adding that on Wednesday customs officers had noted that the yacht was ""taking steps to sail off urgently, without the repair works being over"".
French customs authorities so far have seized four cargo vessels that are linked to fortunes of Russian oligarchs, another French finance ministry official said.
In total, 510 persons or entities could be subject to asset freezes in France, added the official, who spoke to journalists on the condition of anonymity.
MALDIVES HAVEN?
Meanwhile, at least five superyachts owned by Russian billionaires appeared to have found temporary haven in the Maldives, a luxury holiday destination. The billionaires are either on existing sanctions lists or face calls to be added.
The superyacht Clio, owned by Oleg Deripaska, the founder of aluminium giant Rusal who was sanctioned by the United States in 2018, was anchored off the capital Male on Wednesday, according to shipping database MarineTraffic. 
The Titan, owned by Alexander Abramov, a co-founder of Russian steel producer Evraz, arrived on Monday. 
Three more yachts owned by Russian oligarchs were seen cruising in Maldives waters on Wednesday, the data showed. They included the 88-metre (288-foot) Nirvana owned by Russia's richest man, Vladimir Potanin.

Most of the vessels were last seen anchored in Middle Eastern ports. 
A spokesperson for the Maldives government did not respond to a request for comment.

BORODYANKA/LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Russia and Ukraine agreed on Thursday to the need for humanitarian corridors to help civilians escape Moscow's eight-day-old invasion, the first apparent progress in talks, as the United States added to Western sanctions on more oligarchs.
Thousands are thought to have died or been wounded as the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two unfolds, creating 1 million refugees, hits to Russia's economy and fears of wider conflict in the West unthought-of for decades.
Russian forces have continued to surround and attack Ukrainian cities, including Mariupol, the main port in the east which has been under heavy bombardment, with no water or power. Officials say they cannot evacuate the wounded. 
After talks at an undisclosed location, Russia said ""substantial progress"" had been made while the Ukrainian side pointed to an understanding on helping ordinary people, but not the results Kyiv had hoped for.
Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said a temporary halt to fighting in select locations was also possible.
""That is, not everywhere, but only in those places where the humanitarian corridors themselves will be located, it will be possible to cease fire for the duration of the evacuation,"" he said.
They had also seen eye-to-eye on the delivery of medicines and food to the places where the fiercest fighting was taking place. The negotiators will meet again next week, the Belarusian state news agency Belta quoted Podolyak as saying.
The West has responded to Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion with military support and by tightening the economic screws on the Kremlin and Russians. The fallout so far has included queues outside banks, a plunge in the value of the rouble and an exodus of foreign companies.
In a sign of business unease, Russia's second-largest oil producer Lukoil called for the conflict to end as soon as possible, saying it was concerned by the ""tragic events in Ukraine."" 
On Thursday, the United States and Britain announced sanctions on more oligarchs, following on from EU measures.
Included was Russian tycoon Alisher Usmanov, the founder of mining company Metalloinvest.
In Germany, his luxury yacht worth nearly $600 million was moored at a Hamburg shipyard. Hamburg's economic authority said there were no plans for the vessel to be delivered to its owner. 
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has also been hit with U.S. sanctions. Visa (NYSE:V) restrictions will be imposed on 19 Russian oligarchs, their family members and associates, the White House said. 
Sanctions have ""had a profound impact already,"" said President Joe Biden. 
1 MILLION REFUGEES
Kyiv and other major cities are still controlled by Ukraine but the United Nations said one million people have now fled, mainly seeking refuge in Poland and other neighbours to the west.
As shelling and rockets strikes continued, the government sought more military assistance, something some countries fear could provoke Russia and escalate the conflict. 
""How can partners who have not yet provided Ukraine with warplanes sleep, given children are sitting in basements under bombardment..?"" foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
The United States has warned the crisis is a threat to the rules-based order. 
It agreed on Thursday with India, Australia and Japan on the need to avoid a similar situation in the Indo-Pacific, where there is increased concern about China moving against Taiwan, a self-ruled island it claims.
But China, which abstained in a vote to reprimand Russia at the United Nations on Wednesday, is the largest shareholder at the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank which said on Thursday it was suspending all activities relating to Russia and Belarus. 
Only Belarus, Eritrea, Syria and North Korea voted with Russia but in Moscow, Putin brushed aside worldwide condemnation and hailed his soldiers as heroes.
""I want to say that the special military operation is proceeding strictly in line with the timetable,"" he said. 
Western military analysts believe a Russian battle plan that aimed for a swift advance and capture of Kyiv has faltered, forcing a change.
The main assault force - a huge convoy of tanks, artillery and logistics support - has been halted for days north of Kyiv.
In Washington, a U.S. defense official said Russian troops were still 25 km (16 miles) from Kyiv city centre. 
The official said they were also just outside Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city of 1.5 million people which has seen swathes blasted into rubble.
'GIVE ME A MOLOTOV COCKTAIL'
The fate of Kherson, a southern Dnipro River port, was not clear. Russian tanks had entered on Wednesday and it was reported to have been captured. 
But the U.S. official said Washington believed there was still fighting and it was not ready to say it had fallen. 
Russia has acknowledged nearly 500 of its soldiers killed since Putin sent his troops over the border on Feb. 24. Ukraine says it has killed nearly 9,000, though this cannot be confirmed.
Military analysts say Russia's columns are now confined to roads as spring thaw turns Ukrainian ground to mud. Each day the main attack force lies stuck on the highway north of Kyiv, its condition deteriorates, said Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C.
Emergency services in the eastern Chernihiv region said 33 bodies had been pulled from the rubble of a Russian air strike. Earlier, governor Viacheslav Chaus said at least nine people had been killed in an air strike that hit homes and two schools.
Two cargo ships came under apparent attack at Ukrainian ports. Six crew members were rescued at sea after an Estonian-owned ship exploded and sank off Odessa, and at least one crew member was killed in a blast on a Bangladeshi ship at Olvia. 
In Borodyanka, a town 60 km northwest of Kyiv where locals repelled a Russian assault, burnt-out hulks of Russian armour were scattered on a highway, surrounded by buildings blasted into ruins. 

""They started shooting from their APC towards the park in front of the post office,"" a man said in the apartment where he was sheltering with his family, referring to a Russian armoured personnel carrier.
""Then those bastards started the tank and started shooting into the supermarket which was already burned. It caught fire again. An old man ran outside like crazy, with big round eyes, and said 'give me a Molotov cocktail! I just set their APC on fire!'""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than a half dozen U.S. Secret Service officers on Thursday took two men into custody from a car in Washington's Georgetown neighborhood and removed what seemed to be an assault-style rifle from the vehicle, a Reuters witness said. 
The two men were handcuffed and separated, according to the Reuters reporter who witnessed the incident. The witness said the officers also pulled what appeared to be body armor components from the car. The vehicle was a black four-door Ford sedan with Indiana plates that said Marine Corps Veteran.
The Washington Post reported that the two arrested men told police they had driven from Indiana to volunteer to fight in the war in Ukraine. The spot from where they were arrested was near the Ukrainian embassy in Georgetown. The Secret Service and Washington police did not respond to a request for comment on the newspaper report.
A Secret Service spokesperson told Reuters that the two individuals were ""acting suspiciously"" near the vehicle in the area of Wisconsin Avenue and M Street, Northwest, and were arrested for possession of illegal weapons. The spokesperson did not elaborate further.
One of the suspects wore tan pants and a black hoodie, while the other wore a camouflage-style jacket and a baseball cap, according to the witness and photographs from the scene.
The Secret Service, which provides protection for the president, vice president and their families, said the arrested individuals, whose identities were not disclosed, were transported to a Washington police department facility for processing.
A law enforcement official told Reuters that there was no information to suggest that there was any danger or threat to any of the protectees of the Secret Service. The Secret Service's website says the agency had 41 people under its protection in fiscal 2020.

The incident occurred in the heart of Georgetown, an upscale neighborhood of shops and homes popular with tourists. The area is also home to many current and former government officials.
Police removed multiple military-style bags from the car, like duffles and packs, mostly Army green, and emptied their contents on the trunk and the street, video from the incident showed. Some items, including what appeared to be body armor plates, were laid on the ground and photographed by officers.

(Reuters) - Texas has appealed a judge's order that blocked the state from investigating the parents of a 16-year-old transgender girl for providing her with gender-affirming medical treatments that Governor Greg Abbott says are ""child abuse.""
The appeal notice, first posted online by the Austin American-Statesman newspaper, seeks to overturn a temporary restraining order issued on Wednesday by Travis County District Court Judge Amy Clark Meachum to halt the state's probe of the family.
Abbott last month directed the state's Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) to conduct such investigations, citing a non-binding legal opinion by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton that concluded some medical treatments used to help transgender youth transition away from their birth gender could constitute child abuse. 
President Joe Biden on Wednesday denounced Abbott's directive as a ""cynical and dangerous campaign targeting transgender children and their parents.""
Neither Paxton nor Abbott immediately responded to requests for comment from Reuters on Thursday. Paxton asked for an accelerated appeal from the state's Third Court of Appeals.
The adolescent involved was designated male at birth but identifies as female, and has taken puberty-delaying medications and hormone therapy as part of gender-affirming transitional medical care, according to the lawsuit brought by her parents. 
The teen's mother is an employee of the DFPS, the same agency that has been ordered to investigate her. She was placed on leave after inquiring what the governor's directive would mean for her family, according to the lawsuit, filed on the parents' behalf by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Lambda Legal.
Meachum in her order on Wednesday found the family faces ""imminent and ongoing deprivation of their constitutional rights, the potential loss of necessary medical care and the stigma attached to being the subject of an unfounded child abuse investigation."" 
The judge set a hearing for March 11 on a request for a broader injunction barring enforcement of Abbott's order against any family in the state, though the appeal could halt that proceeding.

The DFPS told Reuters on Tuesday that the agency has opened at least three child welfare inquiries subject to a Feb. 22 directive from Abbott ordering investigations of parents whose children undergo ""sex change"" procedures.
Abbott, a Republican running this year for a third term in office, is named as a defendant in the court challenge, along with DFPS and its commissioner, Jaime Masters.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Talks on reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal appeared to near a climax with talk of an imminent ministerial meeting as a U.N. report on Thursday showed Iran is most of the way to amassing enough enriched uranium for one bomb if purified further.
""We are close to a possible deal,"" Jalina Porter, the U.S. State Department's principal deputy spokesperson, told reporters but cautioned that unsolved issues remained and that time was of the essence given the pace of Iran's nuclear advances.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report showed Iran's stock of uranium enriched up to 60% fissile purity had almost doubled to 33.2 kg (110 pounds), which a senior diplomat said was around three-quarters of the amount needed, if enriched further, for a nuclear bomb according to a common yardstick.
The U.N. nuclear watchdog report was seen by Reuters as negotiators seek to resurrect the deal between world powers and Iran under which Tehran agreed to limit its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions that slashed its oil exports.
Global oil prices, which had surged to their highest levels in roughly a decade because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, steadied on expectations the deal may be restored, allowing more Iranian oil to flow into a tight market.
However, U.S., Iranian and European officials all said an agreement had not yet been struck even as some participants were upbeat.
""There are some issues that need to be finalised ... the outstanding issues are relatively small, but not yet settled,"" said Russia's envoy, Mikhail Ulyanov, who in public has been the most optimistic participant in the 11 months of talks. 
Ulyanov told reporters that he did not believe the talks would now collapse and a ministerial meeting - typically where a deal would be blessed - was likely but he could not say if it would be on Saturday, Sunday or Monday.
An Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson said more work was needed, however, and a White House official said there was ""no change"" from Wednesday, when it had said all sides were working to clarify the most difficult issues.
""Some relevant issues are still open and success is never guaranteed,"" Enrique Mora, the European Union diplomat coordinating the talks, wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""We are definitely not there yet.""
Another wild card is an effort by the IAEA to resolve questions about nuclear material that the Vienna-based agency suspects Iran failed to declare, another obstacle to reaching an agreement to revive the deal.
The IAEA has found particles of processed uranium at three apparently old sites that Iran never declared and has repeatedly said Tehran has not provided satisfactory answers.
Iran wants the IAEA investigation ended as part of an agreement but Western powers have argued that issue is beyond the scope of the 2015 deal, to which the IAEA is not a party.
IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi will travel to Tehran on Saturday hoping to agree on a process that would lead to the end of the investigation, potentially clearing a way for the wider agreement, diplomats said. 
Prime Minister Naftali Bennett of Israel, which opposes revival of the deal with its arch-foe Iran, said he spoke with Grossi about the unexplained traces. 
The agreement between Iran and world powers was designed to make it harder for Iran to accumulate the fissile material for a bomb, an ambition it has long denied.
Then-President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the deal in 2018, reimposing tough economic sanctions on Tehran. Iran responded by breaching many of the deal's restrictions.
Western powers have said Iran's nuclear progress may soon make the talks pointless, a possibility illustrated by the IAEA report. It showed Iran's stock of uranium enriched to up to 60% fissile purity rose by 15.5 kg to 33.2 kg (46 to 110 pounds).

A common yardstick is that 25 kg of uranium enriched to 90% is what is theoretically needed for one bomb.
How much is required in real life would depend on further processes the material would still have to go through to make an actual bomb, said the senior diplomat on condition of anonymity.

Heavy smoke was seen pouring out of the four-story building in a video posted by Montgomery County Fire and Rescue Service, which said the fire was now ""basically contained."" Officials have not yet determined the cause of the blaze.
Ten people were transported to the hospital, Montgomery County Fire and Rescue Chief Scott Goldstein told reporters at the scene. He described three to be ""serious injuries"" and the remainder to range from ""moderate to minor"" injuries
Several people remain unaccounted for, Goldstein added.
""Our focus is to remain here until everybody is accounted for,"" he said.
The apartment complex, about seven miles outside of Washington, had heavy structural damage, Goldstein noted.
Video showed the entire back half of one of the complex's buildings gone and the area blanketed in thick gray smoke. 
Maryland Governor Larry Hogan said state officials were in contact with Montgomery County authorities to offer assistance. 
""Please keep all those involved, including our first responders, in your prayers,"" Hogan tweeted. 
County emergency responders were summoned to the multiple-alarm fire midmorning on Thursday, Montgomery County Fire and Rescue spokesman Pete Piringer said earlier in a video statement online.
About 100 county firefighters responded to the scene, the county fire department said. District of Columbia Fire and EMS said in a tweet that they were sending several units to the area to assist.
""This is obviously a really tragic event,"" Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich told reporters, citing the fire's speed but noting that most residents were at work or school. He added that county officials would step in to offer shelter and other aid to residents of the apartments, which were affordable housing units.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that due to national security concerns two former CIA contractors cannot be questioned in a Polish investigation into the treatment of Abu Zubaydah, a suspected high-ranking al Qaeda figure who was repeatedly subjected to a type of torture called waterboarding.
The justices ruled 6-3 that Central Intelligence Agency contractors James Elmer Mitchell and John Bruce Jessen cannot be subpoenaed under a U.S. law that lets federal courts enforce a request for testimony or other evidence for a foreign legal proceeding. Zubaydah, 50, is one of 39 remaining detainees at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
The court found that the government could assert what is called the ""state-secrets privilege"" to prevent the contractors from being questioned in the Polish criminal investigation about their role in interrogating Zubaydah because it would jeopardize U.S. national security.
Poland is believed to be the location of a ""black site"" where the CIA used harsh interrogation techniques against him. Zubaydah lost an eye and underwent waterboarding - a form of simulated drowning - 83 times in a single month while held by the CIA, according to U.S. government documents.
The contractors' testimony ""would be tantamount to a disclosure from the CIA itself,"" Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in the ruling. 
""For these reasons, we conclude that in this case the state secrets privilege applies to the existence (or nonexistence) of a CIA facility in Poland,"" Breyer added.
The justices were divided on what exactly should happen, with six justices saying Zubaydah's request should be dismissed. Conservative Neil Gorsuch and liberals Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan said the case should be sent back to lower courts.
Gorsuch wrote a strongly worded dissenting opinion joined by Sotomayor saying that much of what the government claims to be a state secret is already widely known.
""There comes a point where we should not be ignorant as judges of what we know to be true as citizens,"" Gorsuch wrote.
""Ending this suit may shield the government from some further modest measure of embarrassment. But respectfully, we should not pretend it will safeguard any secret,"" Gorsuch added.
Zubaydah, who is Palestinian, was captured in 2002 in Pakistan and has been held by the United States since then without charges. He has spent more than 15 years detained at Guantanamo. 
David Klein, Zubaydah's lawyer, said that although the court ruled against his client, it left the door open to him filing an amended request that would not require disclosure of the site's location. That means ""there is a pathway for him to finally uncover the truth about what happened to him at the hands of the CIA during a critical part of his detention,"" Klein added.
The Justice Department declined to comment.
At the case's October oral arguments, some justices asked why the government would not let Zubaydah himself be questioned. The Justice Department later told the court it would agree to Zubaydah sending a declaration that could be used in the Polish investigation, although it would have to be reviewed first. Zubaydah's lawyers called that approach unacceptable.
Zubaydah was ""an associate and longtime terrorist ally of Osama bin Laden,"" the leader of the al Qaeda Islamist militant group killed by U.S. forces in Pakistan in 2011, according to a Justice Department filing.
The justices have turned away multiple cases brought by Guantanamo detainees challenging their confinement. Zubaydah's own case has been pending in lower courts for more than a decade.
The U.S. government has disclosed that Zubaydah was held overseas and interrogated using ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" but has not revealed locations. The European Court of Human Rights determined that Zubaydah was held in Poland in 2002 and 2003. 

The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2019 that Mitchell and Jessen could be subpoenaed, prompting the Justice Department to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Details of CIA activities were confirmed in a 2014 U.S. Senate report that concluded that the interrogation techniques were more brutal than originally disclosed and that the agency misled the White House and public about its torture of detainees captured overseas after al Qaeda's Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.

VIENNA (Reuters) - The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency will visit Tehran on Saturday, the agency confirmed on Thursday, raising the prospect of progress on one of the last thorny issues blocking a revival of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.
The visit by the U.N. nuclear watchdog's director general was reported overnight by the Nournews news agency affiliated with Iran's top security body as negotiators in Vienna seek to restore U.S. and Iranian compliance with the deal.
""Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi will travel to Tehran for meetings with senior Iranian officials on Saturday. They will discuss outstanding safeguards issues with a view to address(ing) them,"" the IAEA said in a statement.
A major sticking point in the talks is that Tehran wants the issue of uranium traces found at several old but undeclared sites in Iran to be closed even though Western powers say that is a separate issue to the deal, which the IAEA is not a party to, several officials have told Reuters. 
The IAEA has been seeking answers from Iran on how the traces got there - a topic often referred to as ""outstanding safeguards issues"".
""If Grossi's trip could help the agency and Tehran to reach a roadmap to resolve existing safeguard issues, it can help revival of the nuclear deal in Vienna,"" Nournews said in its report, without citing a source.
The IAEA has repeatedly reported that Iran has failed to give satisfactory explanations on the origin of the traces of processed uranium. Those traces suggest there was nuclear material there that Iran did not declare to the agency.
The report of Grossi's trip coincides with the final stages of negotiators trying to salvage the 2015 deal between six world powers and Iran that imposed restrictions on Tehran's nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.
Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said he spoke with Grossi ahead of his trip about the unexplained traces. Israel opposes a deal revival with its arch-foe Iran, which it sees as an existential threat were it armed with nuclear weapons.

Former U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the pact in 2018 and reimposed tough economic sanctions. That led Iran to breach many of the deal's restrictions, which were designed to make it harder for Tehran to obtain the fissile material for a nuclear bomb. Iran denies any such ambition.
Three Iranian officials close to the talks said a wide array of sanctions, including those keeping Iran from exporting its oil and those on Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Ebrahim Raisi, were to be removed if the 2015 pact was revived.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Andrew Adams, a veteran federal prosecutor in New York City who has experience handling cases involving Russian organized crime groups, will lead the Justice Department's new task force aimed at Russian oligarchs, Attorney General Merrick Garland said on Thursday.
""Together with our federal and international partners, we will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to investigate, arrest and prosecute those whose criminal acts enable the Russian government to continue its unjust war against Ukraine,"" Garland said in remarks to the American Bar Institute's National Institute on White Collar Crime.
Garland's announcement came one day after he unveiled the details about the new task force known as ""KleptoCapture,"" tasked with investigating and prosecuting sanctions violations. It will also seek civil and criminal forfeitures to seize assets obtained through unlawful conduct.
The task force name references the word ""kleptocracy"": a society whose leaders misuse their powers to accumulate wealth at the expense of those they govern.
The task force, to be run out of Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco's office, will be headed by Adams, who joined the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York in 2013 and has served as lead prosecutor on several prominent asset forfeiture and organized crime cases.
In 2015, Adams led a team that successfully recovered a rare Stradivarius violin that was stolen in 1980. In 2018, he led the prosecution of Razhden Shulaya, accused of running a Russian crime syndicate that sold stolen jewelry; rigged slot machines at casinos in Atlantic City and Las Vegas; and ran underground poker games in Brooklyn.
Shulaya, described as a Russian ""vor v zakone"", or ""thief-in-law"", was convicted at his racketeering trial and sentenced to 45 years in prison.
In late 2018, Adams became co-chief of the office's Money Laundering and Transnational Criminal Enterprises unit, according to his LinkedIn profile.
More recently, Adams has handled the first-ever prosecution under a new federal law allowing criminal charges against doping conspirators at athletic events involving U.S. athletes broadcasters and sponsors.

Adams' team in January charged Eric Lira with distributing drugs, including human growth hormone, to athletes participating in the Tokyo Olympics. The law enabling the prosecution, enacted at the end of 2020, is named for Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov, who exposed Moscow's state-sponsored doping.
Lira has not yet entered a plea. His lawyer, Mary Stillinger, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

BRUSSELS/BUDAPEST (Reuters) - European Union interior ministers gave unanimous backing on Thursday to a plan to grant temporary residency to Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion, which should come into force within days.
French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin described as ""important and historic"" the backing for a package that would offer Ukrainians rights similar to those of formal refugees for a year, and subject to possible renewal.
The protective measures will apply to Ukrainians and those who had long-term residency or refugee status in Ukraine, sparing them from going through lengthy asylum procedures.
EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson said almost 1 million people had already fled Ukraine, entering EU territory via Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary, but the EU had shown unprecedented unity and ability to act in the past few days.
""Today also, the ministers showed that on a topic that is very usually seen as being toxic or difficult, the migration issue,"" she told a news conference. 
The EU temporary protection mechanism was set up in the 1990s during the conflict in the former Yugoslavia to deal with mass influxes of displaced people. However, it has never so far been triggered.
The scheme proposed by the Commission will automatically grant those fleeing Ukraine a residence permit and access to employment, social welfare and housing for up to three years.
Those on short-term stays in Ukraine would be allowed into EU territory and would get help to make their way home.
Earlier, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's chief of staff had sown doubt by saying Hungary and its eastern European neighbours did not support the EU plan but favoured instead the existing EU asylum rules.

Darmanin said the Hungarian minister at the meeting had denied this was the case. A Hungarian government spokesperson said a solution was presented in the afternoon that was acceptable for everyone.
An EU diplomat said there appeared to have been a misunderstanding over the matter in Budapest, but there was unanimity at the ministers' meeting and the proposal was supported.

TORONTO (Reuters) - A three-week occupation of the center of Canada's capital last month resulted in part from police underestimating anti-government protesters by assuming they would leave within days, according to police sources and police leadership testimony.
That miscalculation was compounded by a reluctance to crack down on the demonstrators once they had become entrenched in downtown Ottawa, partly out of fear of escalation, a police source and multiple observers told Reuters. 
The protesters initially rallied opposition to COVID-19 vaccine mandates for cross-border truck drivers, but the blockade became a demonstration against government and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. 
Police in riot gear using pepper spray and stun grenades cleared the ""Freedom Convoy"" participants from Ottawa the weekend of Feb. 20, days after Trudeau invoked unprecedented emergency powers. 
""What they did ... they could have done on the first weekend. Their authorities were there, all along,"" said a source with knowledge of Ottawa Police operations who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to discuss them.
Two days before the convoy drove into town, Ottawa's Police Services Board held a special meeting where police leadership repeatedly told their civilian oversight board they expected the convoy to leave two days after their expected arrival, according to a video recording of the meeting.
Deputy Chief Trish Ferguson told the meeting police were ""well placed"" in terms of resources and they had built-in ""surge capacity"" to deal with the protests.
Ottawa Police declined to comment on whether there was a failure in leadership, citing a review into police response to the ""unlawful demonstration,"" and did not immediately respond to a question about whether they had the authority needed to clear the protesters when they first arrived.
In a police services board meeting before police cleared the occupation, interim chief Steve Bell said he thought the police response had been ""adequate and effective.""
""I wouldn't agree it's been a colossal failure of intelligence,"" Bell told the board. He would not say what advice led police to allow the vehicles downtown in the first place.
He acknowledged that police need to improve their intelligence gathering.
""We have to look at other, better ways to collect better, more timely information.""
The protests paralyzed downtown Ottawa. As they dug in, then-Police Chief Peter Sloly called for almost 2,000 additional officers from provincial and federal forces.
What residents called a permissive police attitude may have stemmed in part from a lack of respect for Sloly, who was unpopular among his rank-and-file, or from fear of riling up hostile protesters, two city councillors and two criminologists said.
""Once it got to the point that the protest bedded in ... officers might think, 'We were put in this by bad management,'"" said University of Ottawa criminologist Michael Kempa, who studies policing. 
""What has been described as ineffective leadership has led to low officer engagement. Low officer engagement has further eroded that leadership.""
But the police source said officers followed orders.
""In any large demonstration, they await a command decision. And that command decision comes from the executive level,"" he said. Ottawa police officers felt caught between a hands-off leadership approach and public anger at perceived inaction, the source added.
Sloly, who stepped down last month amid widespread dissatisfaction with police response, could not be reached for comment.
Sloly was an outsider who became Ottawa police chief in 2019 promising reform in part by repairing relationships with Black communities. He took flak from the police union when he suggested in September 2020 that systemic racism existed in the ranks.
Sloly ""didn't have a chance"" to win over his officers, said Eli El-Chantiry, a councillor and police services board member.
El-Chantiry was not on the board when he first spoke with Reuters but is now its chair after its previous chair was ousted.
Bell, the interim police chief, was asked at a board meeting last month, before the convoy was cleared, why the police response had been ""inadequate"" and whether officers were supporting the convoy, something he said they are investigating.

Ottawa Police would not tell Reuters how many officers are being investigated for complicity with the convoy.
Three members of the board resigned this week following reports one of them had attended the protests, although El-Chantiry said the member did so the first weekend and informed the board chair about it. The former member said he would issue a statement.

LONDON/DHAKA (Reuters) - An Estonian-owned cargo ship sank on Thursday off Ukraine's major Black Sea port of Odessa, hours after a Bangladeshi vessel was hit by a missile or bomb at a port east of Odessa, underlining the growing peril to merchant shipping after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Many shipping firms have suspended journeys to Black Sea ports and other terminals in Ukraine amid soaring recent insurance premiums for such voyages. At least three commercial ships have been hit separately by projectiles since Feb. 24 when Russia's invasion began.
Viktor Vyshnov, deputy head of Ukraine’s Maritime Administration, said six crew members from the Marshall Islands-flagged Helt were picked up by Ukraine's rescue service and taken to a hospital in nearby Chernomorsk after floating in cold water for many hours, but he had no further details.
The rescue was confirmed by Igor Ilves, managing director of the Helt's Tallinn-based manager Vista Shipping Agency.
Ilves had told Reuters earlier that two of the crew were in a life raft at sea, with four others unaccounted for at the time. He said the crew comprised four Ukrainian nationals, a Russian and a Belarusian.
""The vessel has finally sunk,"" Ilves said, adding it might have struck a mine.
There were no claims of responsibility for either event.
NATO's Shipping Center warned on Wednesday that there was ""a high risk of collateral damage on civilian shipping in the northwestern part of the Black Sea"", which included mines.
""There are several open source reports of civilian ships being hit directly or indirectly as a result of the acts of war in the northwestern Black Sea within Ukrainian territorial waters and adjacent international waters,"" NATO said. 
""Civilian shipping is encouraged to exercise caution and be on high alert in the area.""
CREWMAN KILLED 
Late on Wednesday, a missile or bomb struck a Bangladeshi-owned cargo ship in the Black Sea port of Olvia, killing one of its crew members. Efforts were underway to rescue the others from the vessel, its owner said on Thursday.
""The ship came under attack and one engineer was killed,"" Pijush Dutta, executive director of Bangladesh Shipping Corp, told Reuters. ""It was not clear whether it was a bomb or missile or which side launched the attack. The other 28 crew are unharmed,"" he said, without providing further details.
The Bangladesh-flagged Banglar Samriddhi had been stuck in Olvia since the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24, and was hit by a missile, a Bangladeshi foreign ministry official said.
Olvia is located in the Dnipro-Bug river estuary on the Black Sea coast, 15 km (nine miles) south of Mykolaiv and about 110 km (70 miles) east of Odessa.
Dutta of the Bangladesh Shipping Corp said separately the crew were evacuated by tugboat to a shelter in Olvia.
In the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka, the Russian Embassy said in an English-language statement on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page that the circumstances of the incident were “being established”. 
""We express deep condolences to the near and dear ones of the deceased. The Russian side bends every effort to ensure safe departure of the Bangladeshi ship from the port,"" it said.
Videos on social media showed crew members asking for help after the ship was hit. In one, the vessel's second engineer said the ship had been hit by a rocket, killing a crewmate. 
""We have no power supply. Emergency generator power supply is running. We are on the verge of death. We have not been rescued yet. Please save us,"" he said. 
In another video, another crew member, Asiful Islam Asif, said: ""Please rescue us.""
Dutta said he was aware of the videos but declined further comment.
Moscow has called its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" designed not to occupy territory but to destroy Ukraine's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists - a pretext rejected by Ukraine and the West as baseless propaganda.

VIENNA (Reuters) - The stock of enriched uranium amassed by Iran in breach of its 2015 nuclear deal is growing to the point that its most highly-enriched material is most of the way to a common bomb yardstick, a report by the U.N. nuclear watchdog showed on Thursday.
The amount in the quarterly International Atomic Energy Agency report to member states seen by Reuters comes as negotiators at talks on salvaging the 2015 deal say they are in the final stretch. Western powers have warned time is running out before Iran's nuclear progress makes the talks pointless.
The report showed Iran's stock of uranium enriched to up to 60% fissile purity had almost doubled, increasing by 15.5 kg to 33.2 kg (46 to 110 pounds). A senior diplomat said that is around three-quarters of the amount needed, if enriched further, for one nuclear bomb according to a common definition.
That definition - 25 kg of uranium enriched to 90% - is a theoretical yardstick and how much is needed in real life would depend on further processes the material would still have to go through to make an actual bomb, the senior diplomat cautioned.
The 2015 deal between Iran and world powers imposed restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions. 
Then-President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the deal in 2018, reimposing tough economic sanctions on Tehran. Iran responded by breaching many of the deal's restrictions, including a 3.67% cap on the purity to which it could purify uranium and a 202.8-kg limit on its enriched uranium stock.
That total stock of enriched uranium now stands at 3.2 tonnes, an increase of 707.4 kg on the quarter, the report showed. That is still less than the more than five tonnes the Islamic Republic accumulated before the 2015 deal but the highest purity it achieved then was 20%.
OBSTACLE
The report was one of two that are usually issued together, the other one being on unresolved issues around nuclear material that the IAEA suspects Iran failed to declare to the Vienna-based U.N. agency.
The IAEA has found particles of processed uranium at three apparently old sites that Iran never declared. The agency has been seeking answers from Iran but has repeatedly said Tehran has not provided satisfactory answers.
That issue is one of the main remaining obstacles to an agreement on reviving the 2015 deal, diplomats said. 

Iran wants the IAEA investigation ended as part of an agreement but Western powers have argued that issue is beyond the scope of the 2015 deal, to which the IAEA is not a party.
IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi will travel to Tehran on Saturday hoping to agree on a ""process"" that would lead to the end of the investigation, potentially clearing a way for the wider agreement, diplomats said. The second report has been withheld until then.

""Most of civilian casualties recorded from 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022 until 12 midnight on 2 March 2022 were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes,"" it said in a statement.

China placed sanctions on Pompeo when he left office at the end of the Trump presidency last year, angered by his repeated criticism, especially of its ruling Communist Party, and support for Chinese-claimed Taiwan.
Meeting Pompeo at the presidential office in Taipei, Tsai thanked him for his long-time support for Taiwan. 
""A visit from such a good friend as Secretary Pompeo attests to the strong Taiwan-U.S. friendship,"" she said. 
Tsai bestowed on him the Order of the Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon, one of Taiwan's top honours. Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is a previous recipient.
Pompeo, wearing a mask with U.S. and Taiwanese flags emblazoned upon it, said he was proud of his achievements while in office to try and normalise relations with Taiwan, including sending U.S. officials to visit.
""It is not provocative to say that one demands freedom. Indeed to walk away from these things demonstrate the absence of resolve,"" he said.
China put sanctions on ""lying and cheating"" Pompeo and 27 other top Trump-era officials as President Joe Biden took office in January 2021. 
Asked about his trip, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said: ""The relevant actions from Pompeo are despicable and inevitably a futile effort"".
China's top newspaper, the party's official People's Daily, weighed in with a commentary earlier on Thursday, calling Pompeo an ""extremely notorious"" anti-China politician who ""took pride in lying and deceit"" while in office.

The Donald Trump administration gave strong backing to Taiwan, despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties, including high-profile arms sales and visits by top U.S. officials.
China has stepped up its military and diplomatic pressure against Taiwan over the past two years, seeking to force the island to accept its sovereignty. Taiwan's democratically elected government says it wants peace but will defend itself if attacked, and that only the island's people have the right to decide their future.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted to reprimand Russia for invading Ukraine and demanded that Moscow stop fighting and withdraw its military forces, an action that aims to diplomatically isolate Russia at the world body.
The resolution, supported by 141 of the assembly's 193 members, passed in a rare emergency session called by the U.N. Security Council while Ukrainian forces battled to defend the port of Kherson in the face of air strikes and a devastating bombardment that forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee.
The text of the resolution deplores Russia's ""aggression against Ukraine."" The last time the Security Council convened an emergency session of the General Assembly was in 1982, according to the U.N. website.
Russia was joined by Belarus, which has served as a launch pad for Russian invasion forces, Eritrea, North Korea and Syria in voting against the resolution. Thirty-five members, including China, abstained.
While General Assembly resolutions are non-binding, they carry political weight, with Wednesday's vote representing a symbolic victory for Ukraine and increasing Moscow's international isolation. Even Russia's traditional ally Serbia voted against it.
""As 141 member states of the United Nations know, more is at stake even than the conflict in Ukraine itself. This is a threat to the security of Europe and the entire rules-based order,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters after the vote.
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the assembly that Russia was poised to intensify the brutality of its offensive and urged members to hold Moscow accountable for its violations of international law.
She cited videos of Russian troops moving heavy weapons into Ukraine, including cluster munitions and vacuum bombs, banned under international law.
""This is an extraordinary moment,"" she said. ""Now, at more than any other point in recent history, the United Nations is being challenged.""
""Vote yes if you believe UN member states – including your own – have a right to sovereignty and territorial integrity. Vote yes if you believe Russia should be held to account for its actions,"" she added.
Russia's U.N. envoy, Vassily Nebenzia, denied Moscow was targeting civilians and accused Western governments of pressuring assembly members to pass the resolution, whose adoption he said could fuel further violence.
He repeated Russia’s assertion its action was a special military operation aimed at ending purported attacks on civilians in the self-declared Moscow-backed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine.
Nebenzia charged that Ukrainian forces were using civilians as human shields and deploying heavy weapons in civilian areas.
Elaborating on China’s abstention, Beijing’s envoy, Zhang Jun, said the resolution did not undergo “full consultations with the whole membership” of the assembly.
""Nor does it take full consideration of the history and complexity of the current crisis. It does not highlight the importance of the principle of indivisible security, or the urgency of promoting political settlement and stepping up diplomatic efforts,” he said. “These are not in line with China’s consistent positions.”
China, which has grown increasingly close to Russia in recent years, says it will not participate in Western sanctions against Moscow.
""The evil will never stop. It requires more and more space,"" Ukraine's U.N. envoy, Sergiy Kyslytsa, said in urging passage of the resolution, calling it ""one of the building blocks to build a wall to stop"" the Russian offensive.

After nearly a week, Russia has yet to achieve its aim of overthrowing Ukraine's government. It has faced an unprecedented international backlash, especially from the West, whose sanctions have crippled Russia's financial system while giant multinational countries have pulled investments out.
Washington has imposed several rounds of sanctions, including against Russian President Vladimir Putin and the central bank, since Russia's forces invaded Ukraine in the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two. Moscow calls the assault a ""special operation.""

120,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 07:31PM ET</span>","KYIV/KHARKIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukraine's second biggest city, Kharkiv, suffered heavy bombardment on Wednesday as Russia's week-long invasion was denounced by the United Nations in a historic vote and dozens of countries referred Moscow to be probed for potential war crimes. 
The biggest attack on a European state since 1945 has caused over 870,000 people to flee, led to a barrage of economic measures against Russia, and stoked fears of wider conflict in the West unthought-of for decades.
The incursion has yet to overthrow the government in Kyiv but thousands are thought to have died or been injured and it could cause another deep hit to the global economy still emerging from the coronavirus pandemic. 
For Russians, the fallout has included queues outside banks, a plunge in the value of the rouble, and an exodus of international firms. As sanctions have tightened, Russian billionaires are moving their superyachts and the owner of Chelsea sold the soccer club. 
In Ukraine, the human toll was mounting in Kharkiv, a city of 1.5 million people, where bombing has left its centre a wasteland of ruined buildings and debris.
""The Russian 'liberators' have come,"" one Ukrainian volunteer lamented sarcastically, as he and three others strained to carry the dead body of a man wrapped in a bedsheet out of the ruins on a main square.
A U.N. resolution reprimanding Moscow was supported by 141 of the assembly's 193 members, passed in a rare emergency session, a symbolic victory for Ukraine that increases Moscow's international isolation.
""More is at stake even than the conflict in Ukraine itself. This is a threat to the security of Europe and the entire rules-based order,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters after the vote. 
An investigation into possible war crimes will immediately be opened by the International Criminal Court, following requests by 39 of the court's member states, an unprecedented number. 
The body will start collecting evidence for ""any past and present allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide committed"", prosecutor Karim Khan said in a statement. 
No one at Russia's foreign ministry was available for comment when contacted out-of-hours.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.
The Kremlin said its forces had taken the Black Sea port of Kherson, a southern provincial capital of around 250,000 people strategically placed where the Dnipro River flows into the Black Sea. Kyiv earlier denied this. 
Late on Wednesday, Kherson Mayor Igor Kolykhayev said Russian troops were in the streets and had forced their way into the city council building.
An explosion also rocked the Kyiv railway station during the night, where thousands of women and children were being evacuated. 
An interior ministry adviser said the blast was caused by wreckage from a downed Russian cruise missile, not a direct rocket strike. There were no immediate reports of casualties.
Diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis have so far failed.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow still sought Ukraine's ""demilitarisation"" and that there should be a list of specified weapons that could never be deployed on Ukrainian territory. Moscow opposes Kyiv's bid to join NATO.
A Ukrainian delegation had left for a second round of talks with Russian officials on a ceasefire after a first round made little progress on Monday, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak told Reuters.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Russia must stop bombing if it wants to negotiate.
DISPUTED DEATH TOLL 
The U.N. Human Rights Office said it had confirmed the deaths of 227 civilians and 525 injuries during the conflict as of midnight on March 1, mostly caused by ""the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area"". 
It cautioned that the real toll would be much higher due to reporting delays.
Russia's defence ministry said 498 Russian soldiers had died and another 1,597 had been wounded since the start of the invasion, the first time Moscow put a figure on its casualties. It said more than 2,870 Ukrainian soldiers and ""nationalists"" had been killed, Interfax news agency reported.
Ukraine said more than 7,000 Russian soldiers had been killed so far and hundreds taken prisoner.
The figures could not be independently verified.
After failing to swiftly take major cities and subdue Ukraine's military, U.S. officials have said they believe Russia will instead seek to encircle cities, cutting off supply and escape routes, then attacking with a combined force of armour, ground troops and engineers.
At least 25 people have been killed by shelling and air strikes in Kharkiv in the past 24 hours, authorities said.
Pavel Dorogoy, 36, a photographer who lives near the city centre, said Russian forces had targeted the council building, which was empty at the time, a telephone exchange, and a television tower.
""The Russians cannot enter the town so they're just attacking us from afar,"" he said. 
Moscow denies targeting civilians.
COMPANY EXODUS 
Russia's main advance on the capital - a huge armoured column, stretching for miles along the road to Kyiv - has been largely frozen in place for days, Western governments say.
The Kremlin's decision to launch war - after months of denying such plans - has shocked Russians accustomed to viewing Putin, their ruler of 22 years, as a methodical strategist. 
It has also prompted global firms such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) to join an exodus from Russian markets.
SWIFT, the dominant messaging system underpinning global financial transactions, said seven Russian institutions would be excluded from March 12.
Russia's rouble currency plunged to a new record low on Wednesday, a slide that will hit Russians' living standards, and the stock market remained closed. 
The central bank, itself under sanctions, has doubled interest rates to 20% and Fitch downgraded Russia's sovereign credit rating to 'junk' status.
Forbes reported that Germany had seized Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov's mega yacht in a Hamburg shipyard, while at least five superyachts owned by billionaires were anchored or cruising in Maldives, an Indian Ocean island nation that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, data showed.

Roman Abramovich said he would sell London's Chelsea Football Club after 19 years of ownership and donate the money to help the victims of the war. 
""I believe this is in the best interest of the club,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. prosecutors are offering immunity to a juror in Ghislaine Maxwell's sex trafficking trial, whose failure to reveal he had been sexually abused as a child has thrown the British socialite's conviction into doubt.
The offer disclosed on Wednesday is part of an effort to compel the juror to testify at a March 8 hearing before U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan.
Nathan, who oversaw Maxwell's trial, will look into whether the juror known as Juror No. 50 intentionally misled her and the parties by responding falsely on a screening questionnaire before trial that he had not been a sexual abuse victim.
In a letter to Nathan, prosecutors said they are seeking Department of Justice approval to let the juror testify under oath without fear of being criminally charged.
Todd Spodek, the juror's lawyer, said in a separate letter that his client would invoke his constitutional right against self-incrimination.
Maxwell had been convicted on Dec. 29 on five of the six counts she faced for helping the late financier Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse underage girls.
Her lawyers demanded a new trial after the juror told media including Reuters that he shared with other jurors his history of sexual abuse during deliberations.
While denying Maxwell's request, Nathan said the juror's statements provided ""incontrovertible evidence"" that he responded falsely on the questionnaire, denying the defense a chance to question him for bias. 
Juror No. 50, who identified himself to media by his first and middle names Scotty David, signed the questionnaire under penalty of perjury, meaning he could face legal consequences if he lied.
The juror told Reuters he did not recall how he filled out the form, but would have answered honestly.

In a separate letter on Wednesday, Maxwell's lawyer Bobbi Sternheim asked the judge to direct Spodek to explain why his client risked incriminating himself, and direct prosecutors to explain why the juror deserved immunity.
Maxwell, 60, faces up to 65 years in prison. Epstein died by suicide in 2019 at the age of 66 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges

KYIV (Reuters) - Sitting on a temporary bed set up along a gloomy underground passageway, expectant mother Alena Shinkar reads a book to try to stay calm.
The Ukrainian has been at a Kyiv maternity hospital since before the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24 waiting to give birth, but with the capital city under siege from rockets and missiles, her nerves are fraying.
""I should not be stressed now so I am trying to cool myself down, but of course it is terrible what is happening,"" she told Reuters in English.
""We are living in real hell. I never imagined that something like this could happen in the 21st century.""
She said she saw women who had just given birth by Caesarean section rushed from the wards to underground passageways to protect them from bombardment, with no time to rest in between.
Elsewhere in the facility, young mothers are treated by nurses and newborns rest in incubators or lie in parents' arms, being rocked back and forth.
Yula, who gave birth to a son, Mark, on Feb. 28, praised hospital staff for carrying on during a conflict that Russia describes as a ""special military operation.""
""We are safe here, the best personnel in the world, the best staff works here and we are very proud of them.""
Dmytro Govseyev, head of the maternity hospital, said most of his team had not left the premises since the invasion began a week ago.
""About 70% of staff stay here permanently, we take turns at work,"" he said. ""The only difference is that labour that normally takes about 10, 15 hours starts and then there may be an air raid alert and the women need to move to the shelter.""
Back underground, Shinkar recalls the moment the attack on Kyiv began.

""I woke up on Feb. 24 at 5 o’clock in the morning from the hit (rocket strike), I heard the explosion and women scream. The war started. And I could not believe. I thought it was some nightmare, but it is what it is. This is how we are living.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. military said on Wednesday it will postpone a scheduled test launch of a Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile, in a bid to lower soaring tensions after Russia announced it was putting its nuclear forces on high alert.
Russian President Vladimir Putin's weekend announcement on the heightened alert posture fanned fears that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could lead to nuclear escalation, with some European officials seeing it as veiled threat to the West.
Putin's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, was quoted on Wednesday warning that a Third World War would be a nuclear conflict, remarks that added to growing unease.
The Pentagon strongly condemned Russian rhetoric surrounding the world's most destructive weaponry and said it hoped its decision to delay its ICBM test would serve as an example to Moscow.
""We recognize, at this moment of tension, how critical it is that both the United States and Russia bear in mind the risk of miscalculation and take steps to reduce those risks,"" said Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX).
He said the decision to delay the test was meant to ""demonstrate that we have no intention in engaging in any actions that can be misunderstood or misconstrued.""
""We did not take this decision lightly, but instead to demonstrate that we are a responsible nuclear power.""
The nuclear-capable Minuteman III is key part of the American military's strategic arsenal and has a range of 6,000-plus miles (9,660-plus km) and can travel at a speed of approximately 15,000 miles per hour (24,000 kph). Missiles are dispersed in hardened underground silos operated by launch crews.
U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he was disappointed by the delay, adding that the test was critical to ensuring America's nuclear deterrent stayed effective. The Pentagon said the delay would have no impact.
Russia's defense ministry said on Monday its nuclear missile forces and Northern and Pacific fleets had been placed on enhanced combat duty, in line with an order the previous day from Putin.
Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that the order might have activated Russia's nuclear command and control system, essentially opening communication channels for any eventual launch order. Alternatively, he said it might just mean the Russians added staff to their nuclear facilities.
Still, the Biden administration has not confirmed any concrete actions by Russia's nuclear forces following the announcement, including potentially moving warheads out of storage or redeploying nuclear force personnel. 
President Joe Biden said on Monday that Americans should not worry about a nuclear war and Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday said his administration was comfortable with America's defense posture.

Kirby echoed those remarks.
""We remain confident in our strategic posture ... and our ability to defend the homeland and our allies and our partners remains fully intact and ready,"" Kirby said.

(Reuters) - Texas kicked off the U.S. midterm elections cycle with the first party nominating contests of the cycle that will determine control of Congress as well as the governors of 36 states.
Several races are headed to May 24 runoffs between two top finishers after no candidates won a majority of the vote. Here are results in key races:
ABBOTT, O'ROURKE FACE NOVEMBER MATCHUP
Republican Governor Greg Abbott handily fended off two more-conservative challengers, former Texas Republican Party Chairman Allen West and former state Senator Don Huffines. That sets up a Nov. 8 contest with former Democratic U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke, who had faced no serious competition for his party's nomination.
WILL PAXTON SURVIVE?
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has already won one re-election campaign since his indictment in 2015 on state securities fraud charges. This time around, he is headed to a May 24 runoff against state Land Commissioner George P. Bush, the grandson of former President George H. W. Bush, according to television network projections.
TRUMP LOYALTY TEST
Republican Representative Van Taylor comfortably won a second term in Texas' 3rd District in 2020, but was forced into a run-off contest on Tuesday against Keith Self, a former county judge. 
Taylor's vote to support the creation of an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters has attracted Republican opponents who accuse him of betraying the former president and his party.
Self has attacked Taylor for his vote, even though the measure failed in the Senate. House Democrats have launched their own Jan. 6 probe.
Taylor became more vulnerable to a challenge from the right, after redistricting made his suburban Dallas district significantly more conservative. 
A SUCCESSOR TO KEVIN BRADY
The race to succeed 13-term Congressman Kevin Brady in the heavily Republican 8th District, north of Houston, has split many of the state's top Republicans between two leading candidates.
Morgan Luttrell, a former Navy SEAL with the backing of Republican leadership, held a sizeable lead over Christian Collins, a conservative activist supported by the House's right-wing Freedom Caucus. 
Luttrell is supported by a political action committee with ties to Republican congressional leadership, as well as by Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, former Governor Rick Perry and U.S. Representative Dan Crenshaw. Luttrell is the twin brother of Marcus Luttrell, also a Navy SEAL, who wrote the bestselling memoir ""Lone Survivor.""
REPUBLICANS GAINING GROUND
The elongated 15th District, which stretches south from the San Antonio area to the Rio Grande, is held by Democrats but was already competitive in 2020 thanks to Trump's unexpected strength among Hispanic Texans before Republicans redrew the lines in last fall's redistricting to be more favorable to them. The incumbent, Vicente Gonzalez, decided to run for re-election in the neighboring 34th District, leaving half a dozen Democrats vying for the party's nod. 
The Republican front-runner is Monica De La Cruz, who narrowly lost to Gonzalez in 2020. The race could be the state's most closely contested congressional battle this fall.
DEMOCRATIC REMATCH
In the South Texas 28th District, Democrat Jessica Cisneros, a liberal backed by U.S. Representative Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez and the left-wing Justice Democrats, was headed for a run-off against nine-term incumbent Henry Cuellar, one of the most conservative Democrats in the House.
An FBI raid at Cuellar's house in January has given Cisneros a boost. The agency has not commented on the matter, and Cuellar, who has not been charged with a crime, has said he is confident he will be cleared of any wrongdoing.
PROGRESSIVE VICTORY
Greg Casar, a democratic socialist and former Austin city council member, beat out fellow Democrat Eddie Rodriguez after winning the support of high-profile liberals including U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren and Ocasio-Cortez.
The solidly Democratic 35th District stretches from San Antonio to Austin. Its Democrat incumbent, Lloyd Doggett, opted to run in the newly created 37th District based in Austin.
BLACK REPUBLICAN VETERAN

Wesley Hunt, a Black conservative and Army veteran, was the projected Republican winner in the 38th District, one of two new congressional seats created this year thanks to Texas' booming population. It stretches northwest from Houston and was drawn by Republicans to be safely conservative. 
Hunt, who narrowly lost to Democrat Lizzie Fletcher in 2020 in a race that earned national attention, had emerged as the leading candidate for Republicans with endorsements from Cruz and House Republican leaders.

Some survivors of the barrage by Russian forces sat silently where they could, staring at the carnage. Others helped rescue workers to search the rubble for anyone alive or dead, according to a Reuters witness.
The scenes in Ukraine's second-largest city this week were a reminder of the ferocity of the war in some parts of Ukraine.
While the outskirts of the capital Kyiv to the west have come under shell and missile attack, the fate of Kharkiv, which is geographically and culturally close to Russia, has so far been worse.
According to officials on Wednesday, in the last 24 hours at least 21 people have been killed and 112 wounded in the strategic eastern Ukrainian city, which lies just a few kilometres (miles) from the Russian border on major routes leading north to south and east to west.
Later in the day they said four more had died and nine were wounded as air and rocket strikes continued. Although under siege, Kharkiv has not yet fallen to Russian forces.
At the badly damaged apartment blocks, disbelief mixed with anger.
""They bombed the residential building, hit it with rockets. Many civilians died. I have videos of at least four dead people laying on the ground,"" said Vitaly Rybas, a local resident.
""A dead person is laying next to us. (Russian Foreign Minister Sergei) Lavrov and (Russian President Vladimir) Putin are ... bandits. They should be brought to justice.""
Pools of blood stained roads and pavements as workmen sifted through the wreckage. Firemen and volunteers carried out two bodies wrapped in blankets from the charred stairwells of an apartment block. People peered into craters left by bombs.
""The Russians are shelling us,"" said Svetlana, who did not give her surname. ""We are all scared. Why us? We are ordinary folk.""
'ATROCITY' AGAINST CIVILIANS
Fierce fighting outside Kharkiv has helped hold up the Russian advance, according to Ukrainian officials, who shared footage on the day the invasion began that they said showed destroyed or disabled Russian military vehicles and the body of a Russian soldier.
Reuters could not verify the images independently.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that the attacks on Kharkiv amounted to state terrorism, and described the capital Kyiv and Kharkiv as Russia's main targets.
Many Western governments have reacted with dismay to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and they hope that tough economic sanctions against Moscow will deter it from pressing ahead with what it calls a ""special operation"" to remove foes in Kyiv.
Events this week in Kharkiv, home to around 1.5 million people, have been singled out for special criticism. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday the scenes were reminiscent of Serbian shelling of Sarajevo in the 1990s.
""It has that feel to me of an atrocity committed deliberately against a civilian centre,"" he told a news conference in Estonia.
On Wednesday, long queues formed outside supermarkets and pharmacies as residents of Kharkiv emerged from homes and underground shelters to stock up on supplies.
""Everybody here is outraged,"" said Maria Zakharova. ""Our houses were bombed ... Us and our children ... We cannot even buy bread, can you see that?""

The day before, Russian forces struck at the heart of the historic city - the early capital of Ukraine after it was subsumed into the Soviet Union following World War One - hitting the regional administration building in central Freedom Square.
The blast gutted the imposing, Soviet-era structure and killed several people. In nearby streets, cars had crumpled under the weight of falling masonry. Outside a damaged shop, a Ukrainian and Russian flag fluttered side by side.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Democrat Beto O'Rourke won their parties' gubernatorial nominations on Tuesday, as the state's first-in-the-nation primary contests kicked off the race to the Nov. 8 general election.
Abbott, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, easily turned back several right-wing challengers. He is favored to beat O'Rourke, who is seeking to become the first Democratic governor of Texas in nearly three decades.
Texas voters were also selecting their parties' nominees on Tuesday for the U.S. House of Representatives. The results could offer clues about the mood of American voters ahead of the November elections that will determine control Congress for the rest of President Joe Biden's four-year term.
Progressive Democrats scored a victory when democratic socialist Greg Casar, an Austin city councilman, beat out fellow Democrat Eddie Rodriguez, a state representative.
Another liberal, Jessica Cisneros, was headed toward a run-off with incumbent Henry Cuellar, one of the House's most conservative Democrats. Both Casar and Cisneros campaigned alongside national progressive figures such as Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez.
Meanwhile, Republican state Attorney General Ken Paxton was headed to a May 24 runoff election against Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush, grandson of former President H.W. Bush, after failing to capture 50% of the vote.
Paxton, who had Trump's support, remains under a 2015 indictment for securities fraud and also faces a federal corruption probe. He has denied any wrongdoing.
The election was the first test of new Republican-backed voting restrictions passed in response to Trump's false claims of election fraud in his 2020 loss to Biden. 
There were no reports of major problems at polling places, following weeks in which several counties recorded large numbers of rejected mail-in ballots due to new identification requirements.
Texas Secretary of State John Scott said Harris County, home to one in six Texans, had informed his office that vote counting was delayed due to ""damaged ballot sheets.""
Midterm elections typically serve as a referendum on the sitting president, and Republicans are favored to win a majority in at least one of the two chambers of Congress that Democrats control by razor-thin margins. That would allow Republicans to block Biden's legislative agenda and launch investigations that could damage his administration.
ABBOTT PUSHES CONSERVATIVE AGENDA
Abbott has pursued increasingly conservative policies during his second term, including opposing COVID-19 vaccine and mask mandates. He also signed the most restrictive abortion ban of any U.S. state and is building a new barrier on the border with Mexico.
Last week, he instructed state agencies to consider medical treatment for transgender adolescents as child abuse, days after Paxton issued a legal opinion to that effect. While the full effect of the order remains unclear, transgender advocates decried the move as discriminatory and dangerous.
""Abbott has not left much room to the right of him for these competitors to gain any traction,"" said James Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas.
O'Rourke, a former congressman, is the state's most prominent Democrat after losing a close U.S. Senate race in 2018 and then mounting a brief campaign for president. The Democrat has attacked Abbott's handling of the state's power grid, which failed during deadly winter storms in February 2021. 
Among congressional races, Republican-backed redistricting has eliminated virtually every competitive district. Still, some contests gave early looks at how each party is navigating internal tensions. 
In the 8th District north of Houston, where Representative Kevin Brady is retiring, the Republican primary was seen as a proxy battle between the party's ideological poles.
Former Navy SEAL Morgan Luttrell, backed by House Republican leadership, held a sizable lead over Christian Collins, a conservative activist supported by the House's far-right Freedom Caucus. 
In the 3rd District north of Dallas, Republican Representative Van Taylor was forced into a run-off contest. He will face Keith Self, a former county judge who criticized Taylor for supporting a congressional investigation into the Jan. 6, 2020, assault on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters. 
For Democrats, the contest between Cuellar, the lone anti-abortion Democrat left in the House, and Cisneros could leave the party vulnerable to a Republican takeover of the chamber.
Federal investigators searched Cuellar's home recently, though details of the investigation are not clear and he has denied wrongdoing. If Cuellar loses the primary, Cisneros could be targeted by Republicans as being too liberal for Texas.
The 15th District, likely the most competitive in Texas in November after incumbent Democrat Vicente Gonzalez opted to run in a neighboring district, had a crowded field for both parties.

The Democratic contest will be decided in a runoff, while Republican Monica De La Cruz, who ran for the seat in 2020, won her party's nomination contest.
Republicans are hopeful they can flip the seat after Trump showed unexpected strength among Hispanic voters in 2020.

128,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 01:47PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said at the weekend that his nation's nuclear forces should be put on high alert, raising fears that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could lead to nuclear escalation.
Here is how Russia's chain of command would work in the event of a nuclear weapon launch.
WHO DECIDES TO LAUNCH RUSSIAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS?
A 2020 document https://archive.mid.ru/en/web/guest/foreign_policy/international_safety/disarmament/-/asset_publisher/rp0fiUBmANaH/content/id/4152094 called ""Basic Principles of State Policy of the Russian Federation on Nuclear Deterrence"" says the Russian president takes the decision to use nuclear weapons. 
A small briefcase, known as the Cheget, is kept close to the president at all times, linking him to the command and control network of Russia's strategic nuclear forces. The Cheget does not contain a nuclear launch button but rather transmits launch orders to the central military command - the General Staff. 
IF PUTIN GIVES THE NUCLEAR ORDER, WHAT HAPPENS?
The Russian General Staff file:///C:/Users/8011323/Downloads/FOIR1588.pdf has access to the launch codes and has two methods of launching nuclear warheads. It can send authorisation codes to individual weapons commanders, who would then execute the launch procedures. There is also a back-up system, known as Perimetr, which allows the General Staff to directly initiate the launch of land-based missiles, bypassing all the immediate command posts.
DID PUTIN'S 'HIGH ALERT' ORDER MAKE A LAUNCH MORE LIKELY?
Putin said at the weekend that the nation's nuclear forces should be put on high alert. The following day, Russia's defence ministry announced that its nuclear missile forces had been placed on ""enhanced"" combat duty.
The phrase enhanced, or special, combat duty does not appear in Russia's nuclear doctrine, leaving military experts puzzled over what it might mean.
Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that the order might have activated Russia's nuclear command and control system, essentially opening communication channels for any eventual launch order. Alternatively, he said it might just mean the Russians added staff to their nuclear facilities.
DO THE RUSSIANS HAVE RULES ON NUCLEAR LAUNCHES?
The 2020 doctrine presents four scenarios which might justify the use of Russian nuclear weapons:
-- the use of nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction against Russia or its allies;
-- data showing the launch of ballistic missiles aimed at Russia or its allies;
-- an attack on critical government or military sites that would undermine the country's nuclear forces response actions;
-- the use of conventional weapons against Russia ""when the very existence of the state is in jeopardy"".
WHAT NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES DOES RUSSIA HAVE?
The Federation of American Scientists https://fas.org/issues/nuclear-weapons/status-world-nuclear-forces estimates that Russia has 5,977 nuclear warheads, more than any other country. Of these, 1,588 are deployed and ready for use. Its missiles can be fired from the land, by submarines and by airplanes. Putin oversaw a coordinated test of Russia's nuclear forces on Feb. 19 shortly before ordering troops into Ukraine.

HAS RUSSIA EVER USED A NUCLEAR WEAPON IN WAR?
No. To date, the only use of nuclear weapons during conflict was the atomic bombs dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States in 1945, at the end of World War Two.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A new U.S. federal ""KleptoCapture"" task force will work to further strain the finances of Russia's oligarchs to pressure the country to cease its invasion of Ukraine, the Justice Department said on Wednesday.
The interagency law enforcement group will be dedicated to enforcing sanctions, export restrictions and economic countermeasures designed to freeze Russia out of global markets, Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.
The task force's name comes from the word ""kleptocracy,"" defined as corrupt individuals who misuse their powers to accumulate wealth at the expense of those they govern.
""To those bolstering the Russian regime through corruption and sanctions evasion: we will deprive you of safe haven and hold you accountable,"" said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. ""Oligarchs be warned: we will use every tool to freeze and seize your criminal proceeds.""
The task force will be run out of Monaco's office, and will be responsible for investigating and prosecuting violations of sanctions. It will use civil and criminal asset forfeiture laws to seize assets obtained through unlawful conduct.
Washington and its allies have sought to up the pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin and those closest to him to try to force an end to the assault on Ukraine, the worst attack on a European state since World War Two. More than 2,000 civilians have been killed.
The Justice Department has long had a team to track down assets belonging to kleptocrats from around the globe that are linked to crimes with an impact on the U.S. financial system, such as money laundering, sanctions evasion or foreign bribes.
The new task force will target the crimes of Russian officials and government-connected elites.
""Arrests and prosecution will be sought when supported by the facts and the law,"" the department said in its announcement. ""Even if defendants cannot be immediately detained, asset seizures and civil forfeitures of unlawful proceeds — including personal real estate, financial and commercial assets — will be used to deny resources that enable Russian aggression.""
On Tuesday night, President Joe Biden in his State of the Union speech assailed Putin for his country's attack on Ukraine and put Russian oligarchs and other government leaders he said were corrupt on notice that the Justice Department would be coming for their assets.
""We are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts, your luxury apartments, your private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains,"" Biden said.
The task force will be led by a veteran prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York who has experience investigating Russian organized crime and recovering illicit assets, the department said.

The department did not identify the prosecutor by name.
The task force will be staffed by agents and analysts from a variety of law enforcement agencies including the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service, the Secret Service, the Department of Homeland Security's Homeland Security Investigations, IRS-Criminal Investigations and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.

LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) -Russia is aiming to erase Ukraine, its history and people, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video on Wednesday as the seventh day of Moscow's invasion of its neighbour started with heavy shelling of the Black Sea port of Mariupol.
Moscow switched to strikes on Ukrainian cities on Tuesday and appeared poised for an advance on Kyiv as the West tightened an economic noose around Russia in retaliation.
But Zelenskiy, unshaven and wearing a khaki T-shirt, said the West's response was not enough, calling for more international support, including backing Ukraine's bid to join the European Union. 
""This is no time to be neutral,"" said Zelenskiy, whose defiant and emotional tone in regular video addresses have offered his country support and leadership in the war, which he said killed nearly 6,000 Russian troops so far. 
Referring to the Tuesday shelling in Kyiv next to Babyn Yar - the site of a World War Two massacre of tens of thousands of Jews by German occupation troops and Ukrainian auxiliaries - Zelenskiy said: ""This strike proves that for many people in Russia our Kyiv is absolutely foreign.""
""They don't know a thing about Kyiv, about our history. But they all have orders to erase our history, erase our country, erase us all.""
Ukraine's south-eastern Azov Sea port of Mariupol was under constant shelling and unable to evacuate the injured while Kherson, on the Black Sea to the west, was completely surrounded by invading Russian forces, local authorities said on Wednesday.

""We all died again by Babyn Yar. Although the world has promised again and again that it will never happen again,"" said Zelenskiy.
""Don't you see what is happening? That's why it is very important now that you, millions of Jews around the world, do not stay silent. Because Nazism is born in silence. Scream about murdering of civilians, scream about murdering of Ukrainians.""

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has often done away with the trappings of office in his dealings with the media - offering access to reporters who beat him at table tennis and holding lengthy peacetime press conferences in a food court.
On Tuesday afternoon, the extraordinary circumstances of his interview with Reuters and CNN were by necessity, not choice.
There was nothing playful about the former comic actor's message, and no theatrics in the unusual surroundings away from the imposing Bankova presidential building in the middle of the historic city of Kyiv.
Reuters reporters were driven to the venue in the capital in a van. The building appeared to be a non-descript, Soviet-era administrative office teeming with mostly young, heavily armed soldiers.
Sandbags blocked the bottom of windows, the blinds were pulled down and the bright lamps from television crews shone through the gloom. A Ukrainian flag and presidential standard were moved closer so they would appear in the background.
Zelenskiy and his entourage appeared along a corridor, and, after greeting journalists with a handshake and a smile, he stood on the first step of a small flight of marble stairs to deliver his message.
Unshaven and tired, but impassioned and gesticulating throughout, the 44-year-old urged the international community to do more to support Ukraine.
He wore an olive-coloured T-shirt, trousers and combat shoes, just as he has done throughout his social media appearances since the invasion began seven days ago.
This was a president at war, convinced he was the number one target of invading Russian forces that are encroaching on the capital. Asked about his daily regime, he replied: ""I work and I sleep.""
Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the ""special military operation"" last Thursday in a bid to disarm Ukraine, capture undesirable elements he says are running the country of 44 million and crush its hopes of closer ties to the West.

Mostly business-like and defiant, emotion did show through as Zelenskiy addressed the plight of Ukraine and its younger generation, and the fact that he had not seen his own children for two days.
Asked how long his country would hold out, Zelenskiy replied: ""We do not hold out, we fight, and our nation will fight to the end. This is our home, we are protecting out land, our homes. For the sake of our children's future.""

KYIV (Reuters) - Ihor Tkachenko, a computer engineer from Kyiv, is not able to sign up to the civil defence forces that have sprung up across Ukraine to help resist the Russian invasion.
With a severe limp he is unable to meet the physical requirements, but that has not stopped him staying in the capital along with many others. Tens of thousands of people have also fled to the relative safety of the west.
""My wife and daughter are safe and in a village in the Carpathians and I wanted to remain,"" the 43-year-old told Reuters on Wednesday, referring to the mountain range in the far west of the country.
""If they (the Russians) enter the city I can always throw a Molotov cocktail from my balcony,"" he added, standing amid debris strewn across the ground close to Kyiv's main TV tower which was struck in a deadly Russian attack the day before.
""I have a dog. It is a fearless beast, and we will die together.""
Wearing a blue tracksuit, Tkachenko surveyed the wreckage around him. Near the tower a gym was gutted by the force of the blast and exercise equipment still smouldered.
""This was not a military target, this was made to intimidate us,"" he added, carefully negotiating broken bricks and shards of timber and metal.
Led by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who has appealed to his people to repel invading forces and who remains in Kyiv to rally support, thousands of Ukrainians have vowed to take up arms and do what they can to protect their country.
Russian forces have bombarded cities including Kyiv and Kharkiv and have fought to seize urban centres, but local resistance has been strong and some military experts say Moscow has been taken by surprise.
Russian President Vladimir Putin says his troops have launched a ""special military operation"" in neighbouring Ukraine to remove a security threat.
Outside one of the huge apartment blocks built on the banks of the Dnipro river in Kyiv, Inna, a housewife, looked exhausted as she went to her local supermarket to stock up on food.
She said she had barely slept, interrupted by artillery fire northwest of the city.
""I am tired from constant crying, worrying and ... thinking what the hell are they doing in our country,"" she said.
""Honestly, I am on the verge of taking up a gun and going to the frontline. I will do whatever is needed to help.""

SIDON, Lebanon/AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian refugee Ahmad al-Hariri, who fled the war in his country for neighbouring Lebanon 10 years ago, spent the last decade hoping in vain to escape to a new life in Europe.
Watching European nations open their arms to hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians in less than a week, the father of three can't help but compare their fates. 
""We are wondering, why were Ukrainians welcome in all countries while we, Syrian refugees, are still in tents and remain under the snow, facing death, and no one is looking to us?"" he told Reuters in a refugee centre where 25 families are sheltered on the edge of the Mediterranean city of Sidon.
In the Arab world, where 12 million Syrians have been uprooted by war, critics ranging from Hariri to activists and cartoonists contrast the Western reaction to the refugee crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine with the way Europe sought to hold back Syrian and other refugees in 2015.
Some recalled images of refugees walking for days in harsh weather, or losing lives in perilous sea crossings as they tried to breach Europe's borders.
On Monday, four days after Russia launched its attack, the European Union said at least 400,000 refugees had entered the bloc from Ukraine, which has land borders with four EU states.
Millions more are expected and the EU is preparing measures which would offer temporary residence permits as well as access to employment and social welfare - a swift opening of its doors at odds with its response to wars in Syria and elsewhere.
By early 2021, 10 years after Syria's conflict erupted, EU states had taken in 1 million Syrian refugees and asylum seekers, of which Germany alone took more than half. Most of them arrived before a 2016 deal in which the EU paid billions of euros for Turkey to continue hosting 3.7 million Syrians. 
This time the welcome has been immediate.
""We have here not the refugee wave which we are accustomed to and we do not know what to do with - people with an unclear past,"" Bulgaria's Prime Minister Kiril Petkov said, describing Ukrainians as intelligent, educated and highly qualified. 
""These are Europeans whose airport has been just bombed, who are under fire,"" he said. Bulgaria has said it will help everyone coming from Ukraine, where there are about 250,000 ethnic Bulgarians.
Last year 3,800 Syrians sought protection in Bulgaria and 1,850 were granted refugee or humanitarian status. Syrians say most refugees only pass through Bulgaria to wealthier EU states.
Poland's government, which came under heavy international criticism last year for pushing back against a wave of immigrants crossing over from Belarus, mostly from the Middle East and Africa, has welcomed those fleeing the Ukraine war.
In Hungary, which built a barrier along its southern border to prevent a repeat of the 2015 influx of people from the Middle East and Asia, the arrival of refugees from neighbouring Ukraine has triggered an outpouring of support and offers of transport, short-term accommodation, clothes and food.
""RELATIVELY CIVILISED""
Hungary and Poland both say that refugees from the Middle East who arrive at their borders have already crossed other safe countries which have a duty to provide shelter.
Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto defended the different approaches. ""I must reject drawing comparisons between those fleeing war and those trying to get into the country illegally,"" he told a United Nations meeting in Geneva. 
The welcome has been eased by the fact that Ukraine is home to a large ethnic Hungarian community.
Ties like those have led some Western journalists to suggest that the humanitarian disaster in Ukraine is different to crises in Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan, because Europeans could relate more closely to the victims.
Their comments sparked a wave of condemnation on social media, accusing the West of bias. Clips of the reports were widely circulated and heavily criticised across the region. 
For instance, a television reporter on U.S. network CBS described Kyiv as a ""relatively civilised, relatively European"" city, in contrast to other war zones. Others said Ukraine was different because those fleeing were middle class or watched Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). 
The CBS reporter Charlie D’Agata apologised, saying he had been trying to convey the scale of the conflict. CBS did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.
Nadim Houry, executive director of the Arab Reform Initiative, said parts of the media coverage were disturbing and revealed ""ignorance about refugees from other parts of the world who also have the same aspirations as Ukrainians"".
FIGHTERS
Houry and other critics also say some governments are showing double standards on the issue of volunteers who want to fight in Ukraine against Russian forces. 
Britain's foreign minister Liz Truss on Sunday backed President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's appeal for people to join an international force to fight Russian troops. ""Absolutely. If people want to support that struggle, I would support them doing that,"" she told BBC television.
In contrast, British police warned Britons travelling to Syria to help the rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad eight years ago that they could be arrested on their return, saying they may pose a security risk to the UK.
The foreign office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Truss's remarks. Defence minister Ben Wallace said the situation was different to fighters who joined groups like Islamic State in Syria, but that the government would discourage people from going to Ukraine. 
While their sense of abandonment has been heightened by the Ukrainians' welcome in eastern Europe, several refugees in north Syria, Lebanon and in Jordan told Reuters responsibility for their plight lay with authorities closer to home.

Some say Arab countries should have done more to support the military struggle against Assad, which grew out of widespread popular protests against the president in 2011, and helped the refugees more. Apart from Syria's neighbours Jordan and Lebanon, Arab countries have taken in few of the war's displaced people.
""We do not blame European countries, we blame Arab countries,"" said Ali Khlaif, living in a tented camp near the northwestern Syrian town of Azaz. ""European countries welcome those from their people. We blame our Arab brethren, not the rest.""

TISZABECS, Hungary/KORCZOWA, Poland (Reuters) - Thousands of people fleeing fierce fighting in Ukraine streamed across central European border crossings on Wednesday as Russian troops bombarded Ukrainian cities and looked poised to advance on the embattled capital, Kyiv.
Western nations raced to supply humanitarian and military aid while piling pressure on a Russian economy already reeling under sanctions, with U.S. President Joe Biden warning Vladimir Putin that the Russian leader had ""no idea what's coming"". 
After initial Russian failures to capture major cities, Western analysts said Moscow appeared to have shifted tactics, including devastating shelling of built-up areas to subdue stubborn resistance.
The United Nations has estimated that more than 870,000 people have now fled Ukraine since the invasion began in what the UN Refugee Agency has warned looks set to become Europe's largest refugee crisis this century and displace millions.
Nearly a week into the invasion, which Putin has called ""a special military operation"", the flood of fleeing people showed few signs of easing.
At Tiszabecs, on Hungary's border with Ukraine, Julia from Kyiv cradled a baby heavily bundled against the cold and wearing a woollen cap with animal ears. She told of leaving behind her husband to fight, and of three friends who were killed in a missile attack the day she left.
""I spent the night in the basement and then we moved on foot to the railway station,"" the 32-year-old said. ""If there were no children with me I would have stayed with my husband.""
At a train station in Kosice, eastern Slovakia, Galia Ugolnikova, 35, from Kyiv, was heading to Poznan in Poland with her 5-year-old son, aiming to stay with friends of friends.
""On Thursday morning, we took our things, we had a bag ready - the most important documents, money,"" she said. ""We dressed our child, got into the car, and left with the first wave.""
With men of conscription age obliged to stay and help in the defence, her family is now separated by war. 
At the Korczowa border crossing, near the Ukrainian border in southeast Poland, European Council President Charles Michel sought to comfort a crying woman with a hug as he visited with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
The European Commission on Wednesday proposed granting temporary protection to those fleeing, including a residence permit and access to employment and social welfare, in legislation that would apply to all member states. 
""Our moral task - European task - is to be at the front line to support, Michel said. ""We will do everything possible to bring help."" 
RYE SOUP AND SIM CARDS
Across central Europe, where memories of Moscow's dominance in the wake of World War Two run deep, thousands of volunteers converged on the borders, bringing food, clothes and blankets.
Most refugees have crossed into the European Union - membership of which Ukraine aspires to - in eastern Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary and northern Romania. Authorities have pitched tents to provide medical aid and process asylum papers.
Michal Piech, a paramedic, is working at Medyka, Poland's busiest border crossing, treating ailments ranging from hypothermia to the mental strain of war. 
""We were completely overwhelmed,"" he said.
At the train station in Przemysl, a town of about 60,000 just west of Medyka, volunteers handed out cookies, beverages and sweets, as well as hot meals such as rye soup and schnitzel to the thousands awaiting onward transport across Europe.
Dozens of folding beds pitched temporarily inside offered rest for some, exhausted by long hours on war-time roads and long queues to cross the border. Others could make use of the free SIM cards and strollers on offer.
Local officials in Przemysl said they were working to set up humanitarian centres on the Ukrainian side of the border.
As the EU sought to absorb those displaced by a war on its doorstep, many train operators offered free travel for the refugees, and fees for crossing the Oresund bridge, connecting Denmark and Sweden, were waived for cars from Ukraine.
Low-cost carrier WIZZ Air said it would provide 100,000 free seats to refugees on short-haul flights leaving Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania in March.
About half of the refugees entering Poland are children and Polish public TV said it would stream shows in Ukrainian. 
In Poland, whose Ukrainian community of around 1 million is the region's largest, the government said more than 450,000 arrivals had crossed the border so far, while Romanian border police data showed 118,000 Ukrainians had crossed there. Hungary said more than 100,000 had arrived.
Among the fleeing Ukrainian women and children are many of the thousands of foreigners who were studying or working there. 
Around 250 Indian students who fled into Romania through the checkpoint at Siret spent Tuesday night in a sports gymnasium in the town of Voluntari, near the capital Bucharest.

""I have many Ukrainian friends left there and I'm really sad for them,"" said Aman Sharma, 20, an Indian medical student who fled from Chernivtsi in western Ukraine.
""My last words were 'take care'. I don't know if I'll be able to meet them again or not.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Early on Saturday morning, some 48 hours after Russian military forces had pushed into his country, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy put in a call from Kyiv to Brussels with a plea for military assistance.
During the Feb. 26 phone call with the head of the European Council, the body that represents the European Union’s member states, Zelenskiy provided an update on Russia’s advance. He said he was proud of his country’s efforts to stem the blitz so far but that he was worried about a dwindling supply of arms, a senior European Union official told Reuters.
Zelenskiy’s message, according to the senior official: Can you help us with weapons? Can you coordinate EU offers?
The Council president, Charles Michel of Belgium, responded by asking for a list of arms Ukraine needed, another senior EU official said. They said Michel then contacted Poland's prime minister to ask if his country would be the logistics hub for the equipment; Michel’s team drew up plans for a joint fund worth 500 million euros to finance the emergency arms, and shared Kyiv's wish list with EU governments. 
The first deliveries of arms began arriving in Ukraine over the weekend. 
Inside the futuristic glass Europa Building known as ""The Egg"", the Council’s headquarters in Brussels, officials were already working on an unprecedented slew of sanctions agreed by the EU's 27 member countries aimed at punishing Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. And they were lining up more.
But the move to help supply Ukraine weapons marks an even more historic precedent. It is the first time the EU - founded in the wake of World War Two with the purpose of upholding peace on the continent - has collectively provided arms to a third country. The EU's chief executive, Ursula von der Leyen, described it as a “watershed moment” when the bloc announced the weapons funding plan Sunday.
However, it brings with it the risk of further antagonising Russia, already seething with the West over sanctions. ""We know that it is a very thin line,” a third EU official said.
Michel was unavailable to comment, his office said. In public remarks Sunday, the Council president addressed the Ukrainian people, saying they were defending not only their democracy and freedom but that of the whole of Europe. “That is why we in the EU have a political and moral duty to rise to this historic challenge,” Michel said.
The two senior EU officials declined to detail the arms Zelenskiy requested. The EU, which is enabling the arms through a so-called European peace facility, has said it will fund 450 million euros of weapons and 50 million of non-lethal equipment. Arms provided or provided so far include anti-tank weapons and surface-to-air missiles from Germany and machine guns from Belgium. 
The Ukrainian and Polish governments didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. On Tuesday, Zelenskiy pressed the West for more assistance during a joint interview with Reuters and CNN. Speaking in a heavily guarded government compound, Zelenskiy urged NATO members to impose a no fly zone to stop the Russian air force.
Russia, which calls the invasion “a special operation,” has condemned the EU’s decision to fund the delivery of weapons to Kyiv. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said at a news briefing on Monday that Western arms supplies to Ukraine was “an extremely dangerous and destabilizing factor” and showed that Moscow was right to try to demilitarise its neighbour.
TURNING POINT
The war in Ukraine is the latest in a series of crises the EU has faced in recent years, including an influx of migrants and refugees, rising eurosceptic populism and Britain's acrimonious departure. Deep divisions remain, including an ideological rift between eastern and western Europe - particularly over the rule of law and democracy in Hungary and Poland - that poses an existential threat to the bloc itself.
On Russia, the EU has held back so far from imposing the most severe sanctions. It stopped short of curbing Russian energy imports, which account for around half of the country's export earnings. Some EU governments - including Germany - have been reluctant to add to the challenges for a post-pandemic recovery. Russia provides more than a third of Europe's gas imports and more than a quarter of its oil imports, and scarce energy supplies are already stoking inflation.
But the speedy moves to help supply arms to Ukraine and impose sweeping sanctions demonstrated an exceptional level of speed and unity in responding to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggression for an organisation that has long faced criticism for being dithering and quarrelsome.
After Putin formally recognised two breakaway Ukraine regions on Monday Feb. 21, the EU faced immediate public pressure to respond.
The following day, Germany, in an abrupt turnaround, halted the start-up of the Nord Stream 2 Baltic gas pipeline, designed to double the flow of Russian gas direct to Germany. A flurry of significant German U-turns followed over the next few days. Berlin promised a dramatic hike in military spending to above 2% of national economic output, and threw out a decades-long policy of not exporting arms to conflict zones with an announcement that Germany would supply Ukraine with anti-tank weapons and missiles.
A senior German government official said the big shift in Berlin’s thinking began when Russian started launching airstrikes on Ukrainian cities and advancing troops and tanks across the border on Thursday, Feb. 24.
That evening, Germany’s Chancellor Olaf Scholz - in office less than three months - gathered with the EU's other 26 leaders in Brussels for an emergency summit over dinner.
Many of them were under pressure from growing protests at home and hostile media commentary for pulling their punches on sanctions compared to Washington and London. The EU was notably drawing fire for its reluctance to cut Russia off from the SWIFT international payment system.
Michel, who chairs the bloc’s summits, had arranged for Zelenskiy to join the EU leaders’ emergency summit by video link from Kyiv. Dressed in army fatigues and speaking from what appeared to be a bunker, Zelenskiy appealed to European leaders to take the harshest measures they could against Russia, said the two senior EU officials. Zelenskiy’s concluding message, according to the second official: This may be the last time you see me alive.
""There was a stunned silence,"" said the first senior official. ""People were left speechless, some had tears in their eyes.""
His moving address prompted many in the room to question if the second package of sanctions they were meeting to approve was enough and whether events in Ukraine “meant we had to have the political courage to go further,” the first senior EU official said.
It was at that point, this official added, that support increased for more punitive measures such as cutting Russian institutions off from SWIFT, the dominant global payment system, and imposing personal sanctions on Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
HISTORIC MOVE
The EU leaders’ doubts about whether they were doing enough were echoed the next morning by former European Council President Donald Tusk, who publicly criticized the leaders for not going far enough with sanctions. ""In this war everything is real: Putin's madness and cruelty, Ukrainian victims, bombs falling on Kyiv,"" Tusk tweeted, adding that the EU’s sanctions were just a pretense.
By Monday, the EU had added to an array of financial, energy, export and travel bans beyond what was agreed at Thursday’s summit. These additional steps included a freeze on Russian central bank assets, the shutdown of EU airspace to Russia, and sanctions on a clutch of Russian tycoons. Most importantly, it had agreed to cut a number of Russian banks off SWIFT in a move aimed at harming their ability to operate globally.
Even Hungary, whose prime minister, Viktor Orban, has openly cultivated warm ties with Russia and President Vladimir Putin, supported the sanctions.
While much of this was coordinated with the United States and Britain, one senior EU diplomat said the speed and scope of Brussels’ response to the crisis was unparalleled in its history. By contrast, the EU took more than a year to impose several tranches of sanctions on Belarus after its president crushed protests following August 2020 elections. Those were ultimately less severe than those it targeted Russia with in less than a week.
""I am not sure we should use the words 'coming of age' but it's definitely a paradigm shift,"" said the senior diplomat, referring to critics who have long dismissed the EU as a “giant NGO.”
The EU has also quickly agreed to grant Ukrainians fleeing the war the right to stay and work in the bloc for up to three years. The proposal, due to be approved this coming Thursday, is the first time the EU had used a mechanism drawn up after the 1990s war in the Balkans. That move marked a stark contrast to the deep discord in 2015 over a flood of migrants from the Middle East, Africa and Asia that tore at the bloc’s cohesion.
Despite the extraordinary series of steps taken by the EU in just a few days, Zelenskiy is looking for more. On Tuesday, Zelenskiy urged European leaders to prove that they sided with Kyiv the day after Ukraine formally requested to join the EU. Any membership process will be long and difficult, even if it manages to avoid falling back under Moscow’s domination.

“Do prove that you are with us,” he said.

ZAHONY, Hungary (Reuters) - Russian software engineer Mikhail Liublin and his Ukrainian girlfriend travelled on trains and buses for five days to get to Hungary from Kyiv, hearing bombs go off en route and sometimes thinking they would not make it.
As they stood in the queue for tickets to get on a train to Budapest from the Zahony border crossing, the young couple kissed happily.
""Unlike all the other people here, I am from Russia. I lived in Ukraine for about a year,"" Liublin said. 
""It is insane. And Russia will pay for it, for many, many years, and Putin should be tried,"" he added, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
Putin ordered a ""special military operation"" last Thursday in a bid to disarm Ukraine, capture the ""neo-Nazis"" he says are running the country and crush its hopes of closer ties to the West. 
Several days into the invasion that has sparked massive international sanctions, the Russian military attempted to encircle and subdue Ukrainian cities with intensifying bombardments on Wednesday.
Liublin said he and his girlfriend, who declined to give her name, found it almost unbelievable that they had finally finished the long journey to Hungary, as almost every day there had been bombings or shootings. 

""It's going to be very difficult now, but hopefully, hopefully, it will work out and fingers crossed that Ukraine will stand its ground, and kindness and truth will win,"" the young man said with a huge smile. 
Shortly after, the couple jumped on the next train to the Hungarian capital city.

137,"<span>Mar 02, 2022 08:06AM ET</span>",,,,,,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, sanctioned by China when he left office at the end of the Trump presidency, arrived in Taiwan on Wednesday and almost immediately referred to it as a country, a highly sensitive red line for Beijing.
Taiwan's democratically elected government is not formally recognised by the Unites States nor most other countries, which maintain official ties only with China, whose ruling Communist Party views the island as Chinese territory, not a state.
Foreign leaders, even from Western countries that have offered strong support to Taiwan, rarely if ever call Taiwan a country, wary of angering China. 
""It is wonderful to be here. I've been looking forward to coming to visit with the people of Taiwan for a very long time,"" he told reporters in brief remarks upon arrival at the airport.
""I'm so much looking forward to my trip to meet with businesspeople, people from government, people all across your great nation,"" he said. 
Those words will likely be warmly welcomed in Taiwan.
President Tsai Ing-wen, who will meet Pompeo on Thursday, says Taiwan is an independent state called the Republic of China.
Taiwan vehemently rejects China's sovereignty claims, saying the People's Republic of China has never controlled the island and only its people can decide its future.
The Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the Chinese civil war to the communists.
The Trump administration gave strong backing to Taiwan, including high-profile arms sales and visits of top U.S. officials to Taipei. China, which has already condemned Pompeo's trip, put sanctions on ""lying and cheating"" Pompeo and 27 other top Trump-era officials as President Joe Biden took office in January 2021.

Tsai will give Pompeo a presidential award, the Order of the Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon, which according to the presidential office is a ""token of virtue.""
Earlier on Wednesday Tsai met with a group of former top U.S. security officials sent by Biden, who offered reassurances the United States stands firmly behind its commitments to Taiwan.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Tens of thousands of Sydney residents were ordered to evacuate in the night on Wednesday as major flooding hit the western fringe of the city of 5 million, with torrential rain continuing to batter Australia's east coast.
Thirteen people have been killed as the extreme weather has moved from Queensland state into New South Wales (NSW), submerging town centres, washing away homes and cutting power lines, the latest four deaths recorded in the worst-hit northern NSW town of Lismore.
Rivers in Sydney's west rose rapidly on Wednesday evening, prompting the night evacuation of suburbs along the Hawkesbury River, which reached major flood levels. 
Residents of Penrith, a large population centre downriver from the Warragamba dam, which began overflowing on Wednesday, were warned to prepare to leave. Authorities said inundation along the rising Nepean River at Penrith could exceed last year's flood, the worst in 60 years.
Earlier on Wednesday the bodies of two women aged in their 80s and a man in his 70s were discovered in their flooded homes in Lismore in the north of the state, and another man was found floating in the street in the town centre.
More deaths were expected as police check houses as waters recede. 
State officials also told of lucky escapes, including a 93 year old woman discovered floating on a mattress 20 centimetres from the ceiling in her Lismore home by a police officer passing by in a boat. 
The officer dove through a flooded window to rescue her on a ""boogie board"", a child's version of a surfboard, deputy state premier Paul Toole said.
The area's member of the state parliament, Janelle Saffin, 67, earlier recounted to media how she swam to safety as her home was submerged.
State Premier Dominic Perrottet, who flew over the flooded towns on Wednesday, said 17 local government areas had been declared disaster zones in an ""unprecedented situation"", and urged people in Sydney to evacuate if they are given the order by emergency crews.
The wild storm cell has been making its way down from Queensland state, into neighbouring New South Wales, and worsening rain was expected to hit Sydney in the early hours of Thursday.
The Bureau of Meteorology said Sydneysiders should brace for months of rain in a few hours. 
""Hundreds of thousands of people have been impacted by this event,"" the New South Wales emergency services minister, Stephanie Cooke, told broadcaster ABC. ""It is not over by any stretch of the imagination.""
The disaster raised questions about how prepared the country was for being at the forefront of severe climate change, one academic expert said.
""Despite decades of warnings from scientists about climate change, Australia is unprepared for the supercharged weather that it is now driving,"" said Hilary Bambrick, adjunct professor at Queensland University of Technology, who led the health impacts assessment for Australia's national climate change review.
Military helicopters airlifted stranded people from rooftops, while stranded motorists and animals were rescued from a bridge in northern NSW after fast rising waters submerged both ends. 
Cassie Skillings, who got stuck on the bridge along with her sister, niece and nephew, told radio station 2GB a resident rescued them in his boat.
""It was just mayhem, once shipping containers started hitting the bridge I called triple zero and they said there was nothing they could do,"" she said.

KYIV (Reuters) -Russia bombed a TV tower in Ukraine's capital on Tuesday and rained rockets on the city of Kharkiv as Moscow intensified its bombardment of Ukrainian urban areas in a shift of tactics after its six-day invasion stalled. 
A U.S. official said a miles-long armoured column bearing down on the capital Kyiv had not made any advances in the past 24 hours, frozen in place by logistics problems, short on fuel and food, and perhaps pausing to reassess tactics.
Russia's defence ministry urged Kyiv residents to flee and said it would strike unspecified areas used by Ukraine's security services and communications.
Speaking in a heavily guarded government compound in Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia must ""first stop bombing people"" before peace talks could make any headway.
In a joint interview with Reuters and CNN, Zelenskiy also urged NATO members to impose a no-fly zone to stop Russia's airforce, something the military alliance has ruled out.
As Zelenskiy, unshaven and wearing simple khaki clothes, spoke, news came that a Russian missile had struck a TV tower near the Babyn Yar Holocaust memorial site in Kyiv, killing at least five people.
Zelenskiy, who also spoke by phone for 30 minutes with U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday, said the artillery barrages on the eastern city of Kharkiv amounted to ""state terrorism"".
Biden and Zelenskiy discussed how Russia had intensified attacks on sites used by civilians, the White House said. The U.S. president is expected to highlight Western unity over Ukraine in his State of the Union address later on Tuesday.
'SHAMBOLIC'
President Vladimir Putin has drawn global condemnation and sanctions that have already sent the rouble into freefall and forced Russians to queue outside banks for their savings.
The West has imposed heavy sanctions on Russia to shut off its economy from the global financial system, pushing international companies to halt sales, cut ties, and dump tens of billions of dollars' worth of investments.
But nearly a week since Russian troops poured over the border, they have not captured a single major Ukrainian city after running into far fiercer resistance than they expected.
""Looking at the Russian operation so far, they're having tremendous problems with logistics and communications. The whole effort seems shambolic,"" Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at Washington's Wilson Center, wrote in a tweet.
Many Western military analysts fear that Russia will now fall back on tactics which call for crushing bombardment of built-up areas before trying to enter them. 
A senior U.S. defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said:
""One reason why things appear to be stalled north of Kyiv is that the Russians themselves are regrouping and rethinking and trying to adjust to the challenges that they've had.""
The Russians have been surprised not only by the scale of Ukrainian resistance but also by poor morale among their own forces, some of whom surrendered without a fight, the official said, without providing evidence.
Russia still has more forces to throw into the fight, though. 
Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said the ""special military operation"" would continue until it had achieved its goals, defined by Putin as disarming Ukraine and capturing the ""neo-Nazis"" he says are running the country.
Rocket strikes on Tuesday in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second biggest city, killed at least 10 people and wounded 35, Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said.
Human rights groups and Ukraine's ambassador to the United States have accused Russia of using cluster bombs and vacuum bombs, weapons condemned by many organizations. Moscow denies targeting civilians. 
Munitions experts who reviewed footage on social media of attacks on Monday said Kharkiv appeared to have been targeted by cluster bombs.
High-rise buildings, schools, and kindergartens were among the buildings destroyed in those strikes, Interfax Ukraine reported, citing Ukraine's defence ministry.
In the south, Russia claimed to have completely encircled Ukraine's Azov Sea coast. If confirmed, that would mean Russian forces invading from Crimea had joined up with separatists in the east and had cut off Ukraine's main eastern port, Mariupol.
Zelenskiy said Kyiv remained the main target. Some Kyiv residents have been sheltering in underground metro stations at night, there are long lines for fuel, and some products are running out in shops.
APPEAL TO EUROPE
In an emotional address to the European Parliament by video link on Tuesday, a day after he signed an official request to join the European Union, Zelenskiy urged the bloc to prove that it sided with Ukraine.
""Do prove that you will not let us go. Do prove that you are indeed Europeans and then life will win over death and light will win over darkness,"" he said.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a Geneva disarmament meeting via video link that Ukraine had been seeking nuclear weapons. He did not provide evidence other than saying ""Ukraine still has Soviet nuclear technologies and the means of delivery of such weapons.""
More than 100 diplomats walked out of the hall in protest as his speech began, underlining Russia's international isolation.
Ukraine's general staff said Russian losses included 5,710 personnel, 29 destroyed and damaged aircraft and 198 tanks, all figures that could not be verified. Russia has given no full account of its battlefield losses.
'I SAW WAR'
Moscow announced a ban on foreign companies selling assets to try to halt the flight of Western companies abandoning their Russian ties. Putin also issued a decree banning cash exports of foreign currency from Russia exceeding $10,000 in value. 
The rouble hit a record low on Tuesday, threatening the living standards of ordinary Russians.
Most effective among the sanctions so far have been those on Russia's central bank that prevent it from using its $630 billion foreign reserve war chest to prop up the rouble.
With energy prices soaring, the U.S. and its allies agreed Tuesday to release oil reserves as buyers avoid Russian suppliers.
More than 660,000 people, mostly women and children, have fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries such as Poland and Romania since the invasion began, the U.N. refugee agency said.

At the Hungarian border crossing Tiszabecs, a mother cradled a baby in her arms after a four-day drive from Kyiv.
""I saw war, I saw rockets,"" said her older son Ivan, 15, who looked exhausted after the journey. His father had stayed behind to fight.

(Reuters) -Texas held the United States' first primary nominating contests of 2022 on Tuesday, eight months before the midterm elections that will determine control of the U.S. Congress as well as the governors of 36 states.
Under Texas law, if no candidate earns a majority of the vote in any given election, the two top finishers head to a runoff on May 24. Here are some key races to watch:
ABBOTT, O'ROURKE FACE NOVEMBER MATCHUP
Republican Governor Greg Abbott handily fended off two more-conservative challengers, former Texas Republican Party Chairman Allen West and former state Senator Don Huffines. That sets up a Nov. 8 contest with former U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke, who had faced no serious competition for his party's nomination.
WILL PAXTON SURVIVE?
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has already won one reelection campaign since his indictment in 2015 on state securities fraud charges. This time around, he is headed to a May 24 runoff against state Land Commissioner George P. Bush, the grandson of former President George H. W. Bush, according to television network projections.
TRUMP LOYALTY TEST
Republican Representative Van Taylor comfortably won a second term in Texas' 3rd District in 2020, even though Trump barely outperformed Biden in the district. But Taylor's vote to support the creation of an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters has attracted Republican opponents who accuse him of betraying the former president and his party.
After redistricting, the suburban Dallas district is significantly more conservative in 2022, potentially making Taylor vulnerable to a challenge from the right. His leading rival is Keith Self, a former judge in Collin County who has attacked Taylor for his vote, even though the measure failed in the Senate. House Democrats have launched their own Jan. 6 probe.
A SUCCESSOR TO KEVIN BRADY
The race to succeed 13-term Congressman Kevin Brady in the heavily Republican 8th District, north of Houston, has split many of the state's top Republicans between two leading candidates.
Morgan Luttrell, a former Navy SEAL, is backed by a political action committee with ties to Republican congressional leadership, as well as Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, former Governor Rick Perry and U.S. Representative Dan Crenshaw. Luttrell is the twin brother of Marcus Luttrell, also a Navy SEAL, who wrote the bestselling memoir ""Lone Survivor.""
Christian Collins, a conservative activist, is supported by the campaign arm of the House's right-wing Freedom Caucus. 
REPUBLICANS GAINING GROUND
The elongated 15th District, which stretches south from the San Antonio area to the Rio Grande, is held by Democrats but was already competitive in 2020 thanks to Trump's unexpected strength among Hispanic Texans before Republicans redrew the lines in last fall's redistricting to be more favorable to them. The incumbent, Vicente Gonzalez, decided to run for reelection in the neighboring 34th District, leaving half a dozen Democrats vying for the party's nod. 
The Republican front-runner is Monica De La Cruz, who narrowly lost to Gonzalez in 2020. The race could be the state's most closely contested congressional battle this fall.
DEMOCRATIC REMATCH
The Democratic primary in the South Texas 28th District will be a rematch: Jessica Cisneros, a liberal backed by Representative Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez and the left-wing Justice Democrats, will again challenge nine-term incumbent Henry Cuellar, one of the most conservative Democrats in the House, after a close 2020 contest.
An FBI raid at Cuellar's house in January has given Cisneros a boost. The agency has not commented on the matter, and Cuellar, who has not been charged with a crime, has said he is confident he will be cleared of any wrongdoing.
PROGRESSIVE PUSH
The solidly Democratic 35th District, stretching from San Antonio to Austin, will also be a test of the party's left wing. Greg Casar, a democratic socialist and former Austin city council member, is backed by high-profile liberals including U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren and Ocasio-Cortez.
Casar faces several challengers, including state Representative Eddie Rodriguez. The incumbent, Democrat Lloyd Doggett, has opted to run in the newly created 37th District based in Austin.
BLACK REPUBLICAN VETERAN

One of two new congressional seats this year thanks to Texas' booming population, the 38th District stretches northwest from Houston and was drawn by Republicans to be safely conservative.
Wesley Hunt, a Black conservative and Army veteran who narrowly lost to Democrat Lizzie Fletcher in 2020 in a race that earned national attention, has emerged as the leading candidate for Republicans. He has been endorsed by Cruz, as well as House Republican leaders, though he faces several challengers.

141,"<span>Mar 01, 2022 10:06PM ET</span>","GENEVA (Reuters) -Canada has decided to refer the situation in Ukraine to the International Criminal Court (ICC) to probe alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity by Russian forces in Ukraine, its government said on Tuesday.
The office of the ICC prosecutor on Monday said it will seek court approval to open an investigation into alleged war crimes in Ukraine, just days after Russia's invasion of its neighbour.
""We are working with other ICC member states to take this significant action as a result of numerous allegations of the commission of serious international crimes in Ukraine by Russian forces,"" Canada's foreign minister Melanie Joly, said in a statement. 
""The ICC has our full support and confidence. We call on Russia to cooperate with the court.""
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"".

The referral by a member state will fast-track an investigation by allowing the prosecutor to skip having to seek court approval, and according to a diplomatic source will shave months off the process of starting an investigation. 
Joly earlier spoke to reporters in Geneva after taking part in a walk-out of a virtual speech by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to the U.N. Human Rights Council, and had said that the country would petition the ICC against Russia.

NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Mark Childress wrapped his black and gold sequin-studded robe tight against a cool night wind and surveyed the thousands of revelers gathering for the city's first Carnival (NYSE:CUK) parade in two years.
Childress, 64, has seen many Mardi Gras celebrations, but none quite like this year, with people ready to pop with pent-up joy as pandemic restrictions melt away. 
""It's pretty intense for early on in the Carnival weekend,"" Childress said Saturday night as the Krewe of Endymion crawled down a packed Canal Street on the edge of the French Quarter.
""A lot of tourists have already worn themselves out and they're lying in the gutter on Bourbon Street, which is only supposed to happen around Wednesday.""
After last year's false spring, when nascent hopes for emerging from the pandemic were dashed by the Delta and then Omicron variants of the coronavirus, many merrymakers on New Orleans' streets said it felt like a stepping out party from the plague.
""We're in a stronger place today as a nation with more tools to protect ourselves and our community from COVID-19,"" the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said at a media briefing on Friday to announce an easing of pandemic restrictions.
Louisiana, an early COVID hotspot, has seen cases, hospitalizations and deaths fall in recent weeks.
In New Orleans, Mardi Gras celebrations have been building for days, with plastic beads in gold, green and purples lining parade routes, piling up at curbs like leaves in the fall. Families and neighbors staked out spots early each morning, putting out camping chairs, barbecue grills and propane burners topped with massive pots for crawfish boils.
On Bourbon Street, which one smells before seeing, tens of thousands thronged each night, creating a gauntlet of spilt beer amid a smoky marijuana haze, conversation impossible given the competing din from night club audio systems. 
Brandon McDonald, a self-declared ""30-something"" visitor from Texas, had just shimmayed and sashayed his way through an impromptu block-long ""Soul Train"" dance line on Bourbon Street. Not a drop of his daiquiri was spilled as he hammed it up for the crowd, his feet moving to the rhythm of a one-man-band on the sidewalk tapping out a funky marching beat on snare and bass drums.
""The pandemic - the devil! - has tried to stop us, but the good Lord, he gonna make us all push through,"" McDonald said. ""I think we're emerging from a darkness and I really feel like this is a new beginning. Of course, the drinks really help.""
'BIGGER THAN THEMSELVES'
The past two years have made it clear how important traditions like Carnival, graduation parties and even spring breaks are, said Dr. Steven Taylor, a psychiatry professor at the University of British Columbia and author of the 2019 book ""The Psychology of Pandemics.""
""They are time markers, indicators of continuity,"" he said. ""They show us that life keeps going on, that life is stable because we have these rituals like Mardi Gras.""
The revelry in New Orleans is a show of human resilience and deep desire for connection, Taylor said. ""A lot of people are desperate to be caught up in something that is bigger than themselves and is positive for a change.""
That's exactly what Ashley White, 31, from Baton Rouge, was doing as she jumped up and down on St. Charles Avenue on Sunday, waving and yelling at the ""queen"" of the Mid City Krewe parade as it slowly rolled before tens of thousands of fans on Sunday.
This Carnival felt similar to the one in 2006, six months after Hurricane Katrina devastated the city, White said. ""Like then, we're coming out of something so dark and so damaging, but we're having this revival.""
Colby Reddin, 31, of Fort Collins, Colorado, was all decked up for his first Mardi Gras, wearing a vest of the traditional yellow, green and purple with oversized beads draped around his neck.

As the Krewe of Okeanos parade went by, he held up a bullseye poster challenging marchers to hit it with the beads and other trinkets tossed out at Carnival parades. Reddin said he was struck by how much he had missed something he saw in abundance on the streets of New Orleans: hugging.
""We haven't been hugging each other in like two years now,"" he said. ""It's all about that human connection, making connections between different cultures, different people coming together and having a great time.""

The collection of of online imagery was discovered in late 2019 when a New Zealand-based internet service provider raised the alarm, sparking a two-year long investigation dubbed ""Operation H.""
New Zealand's Department of Internal Affairs (DIA) the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Australian Federal Police, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Britain's National Crime Agency, Europol and INTERPOL worked together to identify and investigate individuals tied to the accounts.
""Many people who view material of this kind will go on to physically offend against children,"" Tim Houston, manager of the digital child exploitation team at DIA and lead investigator for Operation H, said in a statement.
""It is imperative that we are able to bring them to justice before they are able to do more damage.""
About 836 cases were investigated internationally and 146 children safeguarded, the DIA said. Forty-six people were arrested in New Zealand and hundreds more overseas, including in Britain, Canada, Spain and Slovenia. 
Britain's National Crime Agency said many of the 450 people it had arrested were working in positions of trust, including at primary schools and nurseries, law enforcement and medical industries, and some religious officials.
""This is not a victimless crime, every time this material is viewed, that child is revictimised,"" said DIA's Houston.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, gun rights advocates in the United States have sought to use the crisis to bolster their position on the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment to keep and bear arms, injecting a new element into the heated debate.
Arguments linking the invasion to gun rights have cropped up this week across social media, in a post by the National Rifle Association and during a legislative vote in the Georgia statehouse.
""What is happening in Ukraine proves the wisdom of our founding fathers in drafting the Second Amendment,"" the NRA said in a blog post on Monday, pointing to Ukrainians who have armed themselves to defend their country. 
Anti-gun violence advocates, however, point to increasing fire-arms deaths in the United States and say tighter regulations and fewer guns are what is needed.
Peter Ambler, executive director of Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said it was ""deeply irresponsible"" for gun rights advocates to tie their ""more guns everywhere"" advocacy to the Ukraine crisis. 
""The tyrannical actions of Vladimir Putin don’t erase the fact that 45,000 Americans died from gun violence in 2020, nor do they erase the urgent need for commonsense, popular gun violence prevention policies like background checks and funding for community violence intervention programs,” Ambler told Reuters.
Links between Ukraine and the Second Amendment began gaining traction after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday said weapons would be issued to citizens who were ready to defend the country from Russian forces 
U.S. Congress candidate Zach Nunn, an Iowa Republican and Air Force veteran who worked with the State Department in 2019 to help monitor Ukrainian elections, told Reuters the crisis underscored the importance of the right to bear arms. 
""In Ukraine today I would offer that a lot of people are waking up and saying that this is not only the best way to protect their country but to preserve what they hold dear in a democracy,"" Nunn said in an interview on Tuesday.
The terms ""Ukraine"" and ""#2A"" - shorthand for the U.S. Constitution's protection of the right to keep and bear arms - have been twinned on social media posts since the Russian invasion last week.
""Thank God the people in the Ukraine have the right to take up and bear arms against their aggressor. Thank God in the U.S. we have the #2A. #NRA,"" North Carolina's Republican Congressman Greg Murphy, M.D., said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
Ukraine was among the arguments wielded by Republicans to win a 34-22 vote in the Georgia state Senate on a concealed carry bill that split down party lines on Monday. 

""I would be willing to bet you today that 99 percent of the people of Ukraine would give anything that they have to have a Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms,"" Lindsey Tippins, a Republican state Senator, said in asking his fellow legislators to back the bill.
The ""constitutional carry"" gun law, which would allow legal weapons carriers in Georgia to carry a concealed firearm without applying for a permit, now goes to the Georgia House.

KYIV (Reuters) -Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday Russia must stop bombing Ukrainian cities before meaningful talks on a ceasefire could start, as a first round of negotiations this week had yielded scant progress. 
Speaking in an interview in a heavily guarded government compound, Zelenskiy urged NATO members to impose a no fly zone to stop the Russian air force, saying this would be a preventative measure and not meant to drag the alliance into war with Russia.
Zelenskiy, who has refused offers to leave the Ukrainian capital as Russian forces advanced, also said Ukraine would demand legally binding security guarantees if NATO shut the door on Ukraine's membership prospects.
Setting out his conditions for further talks with Russia, Zelenskiy told Reuters and CNN in a joint interview: ""It's necessary to at least stop bombing people, just stop the bombing and then sit down at the negotiating table.""
Just as he was speaking, news emerged that a Russian missile had struck a TV tower near a Holocaust memorial site in the Ukrainian capital, killing at least five people. Earlier on Tuesday, missiles struck the heart of the eastern city of Kharkiv.
IF NOT NATO, THEN GUARANTEES
Ukraine has received weapons shipments from NATO members to help withstand a full-scale military invasion unleashed by Russian forces last week, while the West has also introduced swingeing sanctions on the Russian economy. 
But Zelenskiy has urged the international community to do more, including imposing a no fly zone.
""This is not about dragging NATO countries into war. The truth is everyone has long since been dragged into war and definitely not by Ukraine, but by Russia - a large-scale war is going on,"" Zelenskiy said.
He said, however, that U.S. President Joe Biden had personally conveyed to him that now was not the time to introduce such a measure.
Ukraine has pressed NATO to accelerate its entry, a move fiercely opposed by Russia and cited as one of Moscow's reasons for launching its campaign.
""Our partners, if they are not ready to take Ukraine into NATO ... because Russia does not want Ukraine to be in NATO, should work out common security guarantees for Ukraine,"" Zelenskiy said. 
""This means that we have our territorial integrity, that our borders are protected, we have special relations with all our neighbours, we are completely safe, and the guarantors that give us security, they guarantee this legally.""
The 44-year-old president was unshaven and wore a simple khaki T shirt, trousers and combat boots for the interview, which took place in a building heavily guarded by the military.
FIGHT TO THE END
Russia has not made quick early gains or captured major cities in what it calls a special military operation against its neighbour.
While Ukraine has stood alone on the battlefield, it has pressed Europe to recognise that its own security is tied to that of the West.
""It is very important to know that if Ukraine falls, then all these (Russian) troops will be on the borders of your NATO member countries .... and you will be facing the same question there,"" Zelenskiy said.
He rued that Europe and the United States had ignored Kyiv's pleas for pre-emptive sanctions before the war started, but welcomed the impact they were now having on Russia. 
Zelenskiy said that Ukraine's allies had offered financing to prop it up during the war, but urged them to act quickly.
""We have a war every day, we need help every day,"" he said. ""There is not a lot of time for discussion.""
The president has remained in Kyiv to rally his people against the Russian invasion, now in its sixth day, posting social media videos and constantly reassuring the population that neither he, his family or closest officials have left. 
Asked about his daily regime, he replied: ""I work and I sleep."" He appeared emotional as he added that he had not seen his children for two days.
Asked how long his country would hold out, Zelenskiy said: ""We do not hold out, we fight, and our nation will fight to the end. This is our home, we are protecting out land, our homes. For the sake of our children's future.""

Children were dying, he said.
""We have something to defend, we are defending our right to live. And what are they (Russians) doing here? They don't understand our people, our state, our philosophy... They don't know anything here, they were sent here to kill and to die. Therefore we are stronger on our own land, and we will be stronger.""

Since the start of what Russian President Vladimir Putin has called ""a special military operation"" last week, Russian and Belarusian teams and athletes have found themselves frozen out from international competitions across sports.
Belarus has been a key staging area for Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
On Monday, the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) executive board recommended sports federations ban Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials from competing.
World Athletics responded by banning the two countries' athletes, support staff and officials from all events for the foreseeable future.
Its council also agreed to consider further measures, including the suspension of the Belarus Federation, at its scheduled council meeting next week. 
The Russian Athletics Federation has been suspended from World Athletics since 2015 due to doping violations, and its competitors have not been allowed to compete under the country's flag at international events.
World Athletics said the new sanction also included Russian athletes who had the Authorised Neutral Athlete (ANA) status in 2022. 
""Anyone who knows me will understand that imposing sanctions on athletes because of the actions of their government goes against the grain,"" said World Athletics President Sebastian Coe. 
""I have railed against the practice of politicians targeting athletes and sport to make political points when other sectors continue about their business.
""This is different as governments, business and other international organisations have imposed sanctions and measures against Russia across all sectors. Sport has to step up and join these efforts to end this war and restore peace. We cannot and should not sit this one out."" 
TENNIS BODIES TAKE ACTION 
The decision from the international governing bodies of tennis will allow men's world number one Daniil Medvedev, who is Russian, and women's number three Aryna Sabalenka, from Belarus, to continue to compete on tour.
The ATP and the WTA also decided to suspend the combined WTA-ATP event, which was set to be held in Moscow in October.
The ITF suspended the Russian Tennis Federation and Belarus Tennis Federation membership and withdrew their entries from all ITF international team competitions until further notice.
Ukraine's Elina Svitolina, who previously refused to play against Russia's Anastasia Potapova at the Monterrey Open, said she is likely to go ahead with Tuesday's match.
""I'm going to wear Ukrainian colours and for me this means a lot and that's going to be a special night for me,"" Svitolina told  ITV  (LON:ITV) News. 
MORE SPORTING SANCTIONS 
Formula One's governing body FIA said it would allow drivers from Russia and Belarus to compete under a neutral ""FIA flag"" after convening an extraordinary meeting of its World Motor Sport Council, adding that no Russian or Belarusian national symbols or colours would be permitted on cars.
""The FIA is watching the developments in Ukraine with sadness and shock,"" FIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem said. ""We condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine.""
The badminton federation (BWF) banned Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials from international competition from next Tuesday. 
However, the BWF said it is allowing Russian players to compete at two Para badminton tournaments in Spain this week as they have already arrived on location.
""These players, however, will compete as neutral athletes, with no national flags or anthems,"" the BWF added.
The global governing bodies for rowing, skiing (FIS), volleyball (FIVB), triathlon, canoe and shooting (ISSF) have also banned Russian and Belarusian athletes from international competitions until further notice.
""With immediate effect, no Russian or Belarusian athlete shall participate in any FIS competition at any level through the end of the 2021-2022 season,"" FIS said in a statement.
The decision came shortly after FIVB had stripped Russia of the men's world championship.
Cycling's governing body (UCI) banned Russian and Belarusian teams from events and withdrew all Russian and Belarusian events from the 2022 international calendar.
However, the UCI added that Russian and Belarusian riders can continue to compete as neutrals, for teams which are not from either country.
The International Mixed Martial Arts Federation suspended the membership of the Russian MMA Union and the Federation of Hand-to-Hand Fighting & MMA of Belarus.
German sportswear company Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) suspended its partnership with the Russian Football Union (RFS) with immediate effect on Tuesday.
Swimming's world governing body FINA said that Russian and Belarusian athletes could only compete as neutral athletes or neutral teams.
It added that the FINA Order awarded to Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2014 has been withdrawn.
Paralympic committees from the U.S. and Canada (CPC) said Russian and Belarusian athletes should not be allowed to compete at international sporting events, including the Beijing Paralympics which begins on Friday.
The CPC also urged the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) to ""consider revoking the memberships of Russia and Belarus"" from the IPC. 
The IPC will meet on Wednesday to discuss Russia ahead of the Beijing Games.
RUSSIAN OLYMPIC COMMITTEE CRITICISES IOC 
The Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) said it considered the IOC's recommendations as ""ethnic discrimination"".
""It is obvious for us that all decisions were made under strong pressure from outside from forces that are far from understanding the principles of integrity of the Olympic movement...,"" ROC said in a statement on Tuesday. 
""Now, some kind of consultations are scheduled, but only after the decisions have been made and even executed. It turns out that the opinion of athletes, our opinion, no longer matters."" 
On Monday, soccer governing bodies FIFA and UEFA suspended Russia's national teams and clubs, making it likely the country will be excluded from this year's men's World Cup and the women's Euro 2022 tournament.

UEFA on Tuesday allocated 1 million euros ($1.11 million) to charity initiatives focusing on children in Ukraine affected by Russia's invasion.

LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Warnings that pro-Russian ransomware gangs would snarl networks in Ukraine and its allies have so far failed to materialise amid disarray among the criminal underworld often behind such attacks and fears insurers would not pay out.
Conti, one of the most notorious Russia-based cybercrime groups known for using ransomware to extort millions of dollars from U.S. and European companies, announced its ""full support"" for the government of President Vladimir Putin last week - a position it later walked back as they themselves became victims of a leak.
""We do not ally with any government and we condemn the ongoing war,"" the group said in a later statement on its website.
Hours later, a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account called ""ContiLeaks"" appeared, and published what it said was internal chat records from the criminal group.
The secret chats were leaked by a Ukrainian cybersecurity researcher, according to Vitali Kremez, the chief executive of Florida-based cybersecurity firm AdvIntel, and Alex Holden, the founder of Wisconsin-based Hold Security. Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the material.
Kremez and Holden said they were both in touch with the researcher but that he did not wish to speak to the media because he was still in Ukraine.
According to Kremez, the researcher had access to the logs for some time but the trigger for going public was Conti's decision to swear allegiance to Moscow as Russian forces invaded Ukraine.
""He was offended by what they said,"" he told Reuters.
In the months leading up to Putin's invasion of Ukraine, Western intelligence agencies warned of chaos caused by a destructive ""spillover"" of any potential Russian cyberattacks on Ukraine's national infrastructure.
Last month, the Conti group was involved in high-profile attacks against KP Snacks, a maker of popular British savoury snacks, and at least one oil storage company that caused delays in some European oil shipments.
INSURANCE WOES
To be sure, U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner said top Russian hacking groups identified by the United States - the A Team as he called it - had not been used in a major cyberattack since the invasion. ""It does not appear that they've been activated,"" he told Reuters on Monday.
On Sunday, a second notorious ransomware gang called Lockbit, also believed by cybersecurity experts to have members in Russia, released a statement declaring their neutrality in the conflict with Ukraine.
""For us it is just business and we are all apolitical. We are only interested in money for our harmless and useful work,"" the group said on its website.
""We will never, under any circumstances, take part in cyber-attacks on critical infrastructures of any country in the world or engage in any international conflicts.""
One reason for that could be a loophole in cybersecurity insurance policies.
Experts and industry-watchers say the more sophisticated digital extortion gangs tend to focus on insured organisations because the victims already have a policy to make the payoff, making them less likely to bargain for a lower ransom or refuse to pay.
But insurance policies typically have exclusions for what is described as a ""force majeure event"" – such as an act of war.
The legal precedent around what exactly that means is still developing, but a cyberattack claimed by a gang aligned with a belligerent power like Russia could easily fall into that category, said Holden of Hold Security.
""In ransomware attacks, most companies call their ransomware insurer,"" he said. ""You can imagine that insurers would say, 'force majeure' or 'this is a case of warfare – we won't cover it'.""

There are other reasons too. Many gangs are laser-focused on making money and – even if their membership is not interested in leaving Russia – they are wary of attracting the negative attention that comes with openly allying with a hostile state.
""Our government would start designating them as enemy combatants or terrorists,"" Holden said.

KYIV (Reuters) - Volodymyr Zelenskiy swept to power three years ago promising to end a war with Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. He now faces a Russian invasion that could result in the overthrow of his government and the end of Ukrainian democracy.
As Russia rained missiles down on Ukrainian cities including Kyiv on Thursday, Zelenskiy appealed to all citizens to defend Ukraine, saying weapons would be given to all who wanted them.
""Russia treacherously attacked our state this morning, as Nazi Germany did during World War Two, "" Zelenskiy told Ukrainians in a national address.
""Russia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself and won't give up its freedom, no matter what Moscow thinks."" 
It is a disastrous outcome for Zelenskiy, a 44-year-old former comic actor whose increasingly insistent calls over the past two years for NATO to admit Ukraine, an ex-Soviet republic, have infuriated Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Moscow had demanded that NATO promise never to take in Ukraine, a country of huge geopolitical, historic and cultural importance to Russia, a demand rebuffed by the West. Putin on Monday rejected Ukraine's right to exist as an independent state, saying it is effectively part of Russia.
In recent weeks, Zelenskiy has drawn praise from Western leaders for his composure and his appeals to Ukrainians not to panic as Russia massed up to 150,000 troops near the border.
He also criticised foreign embassies and Ukrainian businessmen for leaving Ukraine for security reasons, and renewed his call for companies to stay put, saying they risked inadvertently helping Putin's efforts to destabilise Ukraine.
SERVANT OF THE PEOPLE
But Zelenskiy is an unlikely wartime leader. He shot to fame in a popular television series ""Servant of the People"" in which he played an honest school teacher who is elected president and outwits crooked lawmakers and shadowy businessmen.
Winning the presidency by a landslide in April 2019, he pledged to tackle the corruption that has blighted Ukraine's transition from communism to democracy. But Russia has always posed the biggest challenge to his aspirations to build a modern, democratic and stable European country.
His Servant of the People party - named after the TV series - won a big majority in a July 2019 parliamentary election and Zelenskiy initially pursued confidence-building measures with Russia in eastern Ukraine, including prisoner exchanges.
But that minor thaw did not last long. Russia, which in 2014 seized Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, continued to back armed separatists battling Kyiv's forces in the mainly Russian-speaking Donbass region of eastern Ukraine in a conflict that Zelenskiy says has claimed at least 15,000 lives to date.
Risking Moscow's ire, Zelenskiy courted Western leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden at talks in the White House on Sept. 1, 2021.
""Everyone should understand...that we are at war, that we are defending democracy in Europe and defending our country, and therefore you cannot just talk to us with phrases about reforms,"" Zelenskiy said a June 2021 interview.
""Every day we prove that we are ready to be in the (NATO) alliance more than most of the countries of the European Union.""
'A NEW FACE'
Zelenskiy rode a wave of public discontent with Ukraine's corrupt political elite to victory over wealthy businessman Petro Poroshenko in 2019.
Asked by Reuters ahead of that election how he differed from other presidential hopefuls, Zelenskiy pointed to his face, saying: ""This is a new face. I have never been in politics."" 
""I have not deceived people. They identify with me because I am open, I get hurt, I get angry, I get upset... If I'm inexperienced in something, I'm inexperienced. If I don't know something, I honestly admit it.""
But despite his promises to curb the influence of tycoons in politics, Zelenskiy has had to fend off suspicion that he is a puppet of Ihor Kolomoisky, an oligarch whose TV channel aired ""Servant of the People"".

Zelenskiy was also drawn unwittingly into U.S. politics after a phone call in which then-President Donald Trump tried to get him to investigate his Democratic rival Biden over business deals in Ukraine.
The Democrat-led U.S. House of Representatives impeached Trump after an inquiry concluded he had withheld military aid from Ukraine in order to influence Kyiv. Trump denied wrongdoing and the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate later acquitted him.

LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - The morning after Russian missiles rained down on Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy addressed the nation in his favourite style: the selfie video.
Unshaven, wearing a khaki jacket and flashing a smile, he told the nation that contrary to reports of him trying to flee, he was staying put in the capital. 
""Good morning to all Ukrainians! Lately there has been a lot of fake information online that I am calling on our army to lay down their arms and to evacuate. Listen. I am here,"" he said, in a video that received 3 million views on Instagram in an hour.
The setting was suitably eerie, with Zelenskiy standing in the morning light in front of the ""House with Chimeras"", an Art Nouveau landmark covered in otherworldly animal figures across the road from his presidential office in Kyiv. 
It has been an unlikely transformation for the 44-year-old, who was a comedian and actor with no political experience before he was elected as president in 2019 - except when he played a fictional president in a satirical TV series. 
At the beginning of the crisis, some Ukrainians on social media feared Zelenskiy was out of his depth against veteran Russian President Vladimir Putin, as Moscow massed troops on the border to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 
He had been criticised for taking public swipes at the United States and other friendly powers when he felt they were not being sufficiently supportive. 
But Zelenskiy's refusal to evacuate with Russian troops closing in on Kyiv and his calm presence in social media videos has won plaudits, even from self-described sceptics. 
""Whatever happens next, history will remember the simple physical courage Volodymyr Zelens’kyi displays in remaining in his capital, with his people, amidst a horrible invasion, knowing that he is its target,"" Timothy Snyder, a history professor specialising in Ukraine at Yale said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Olena Halushka, an activist at a well-known Ukrainian anti-corruption organisation, said on Twitter she had misjudged him. ""I couldn't imagine I'll be proud of him as the supreme commander. He is worthy of our incredible nation.""
THE PRESIDENT STAYS
Zelenskiy has been a prolific social media user throughout his time in politics, goading his rivals during the election campaign in 2019, snapping pictures and videos of himself at the gym, in his office or addressing the nation with instructions during the coronavirus pandemic.
Critics and political rivals have often sought to label him as a ""clown"" unsuited for high office.
Before 2019, he dressed up in buffoonish costumes on stage, performed song and dance acts and, as the fictional president on TV, drunkenly fell into a swimming pool after a meeting with the head of the International Monetary Fund. 
Now, he is posting videos trying to give reassurance.
In a previous selfie video, he stood on the street with his inner circle, showing them that his chief of staff, prime minister and closest advisers had also not left the capital.
His style stands in contrast with Putin, who has often kept even close officials on the other side of a long table during meetings during the coronavirus pandemic. 
Nassim Taleb, the best-selling author of the book ""The Black Swan"", compared Zelenskiy to the images that Putin has used in the past to project strength, including images of him riding bare-chested on horseback. 
""Putin the poseur on horseback is hiding in his remote bunker, while Zelenski, the former comedian, is risking his life on the frontline,"" he said.
On camera, Zelenskiy has spoken mainly in Ukrainian but also switched to Russian to address the Russian people, urging them to come out into the streets to protest the war.
Vyachslav Volodin, speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament, asserted on Saturday without evidence that Zelenskiy had fled to the western city of Lviv and that his self-recorded video appearances were in fact pre-recorded.

There was heavy fighting in several parts of the country on Saturday including clashes in the capital, and there have been media reports of Zelenskiy declining offers from foreign governments to be evacuated. 
Asked to comment on the reports, Zelenskiy's spokesman said: ""The president stays in Kyiv, the president stays with his people. No one will run away or drop weapons.""

(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday wrestled with the circumstances under which doctors can be convicted of operating as drug dealers under the cover of their medical practices to illegally distribute opioid painkillers and other dangerous narcotics.
The justices heard arguments in an appeal by two doctors, Xiulu Ruan and Shakeel Kahn, of lower court rulings upholding their convictions on narcotics violations and related crimes stemming from what prosecutors called the misuse of medical licenses to engage in drug trafficking.
Lawyers for Ruan, who practiced in Alabama, and Kahn, who practiced in Arizona and then Wyoming, complained to the justices that jurors convicted the doctors of unlawfully dispensing massive amounts of opioids through ""pill mill"" clinics without having to weigh whether they had a ""good faith"" reason to believe their prescriptions were medically valid.
Some of the justices questioned why jurors should be instructed to consider the doctors' beliefs at all about the medical validity of their prescriptions when determining if they violated a federal law called the Controlled Substances Act.
Chief Justice John Roberts asked ""how is that different"" than if police pulled over a driver on a highway for going over a 50-mile-per-hour (80 km) speed limit who then argued that the speed limit should be higher. The driver would still get ticketed, Roberts said.
There has been an increase in U.S. criminal prosecutions of doctors who have prescribed addictive pain pills amid a law enforcement push to combat an opioid abuse epidemic that has caused hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths over the past two decades.
The Supreme Court took up the doctors' appeals amid divisions in lower courts about the standard under which doctors could be convicted of violating the Controlled Substances Act for writing prescriptions outside the bounds of professional practice.
Eric Feigin, a U.S. deputy solicitor general arguing for the government, said accepting the doctors' arguments would upend the purposes of licenses issued by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration for doctors to prescribe dangerous drugs.
""They want to be free of any obligation even to undertake any minimal effort to act like doctors when they prescribe dangerous, highly addictive and, in one case, lethal dosages of drugs to trusting and vulnerable patients,"" Feigin said.
Ruan was sentenced to 21 years in prison and Kahn to 25 years in separate criminal prosecutions.
Prosecutors said Ruan, through a clinic in Mobile, issued nearly 300,000 controlled-substance prescriptions from 2011 to 2015 and accepted kickbacks from drugmaker Insys Therapeutics Inc to prescribe a fentanyl spray to patients.
Prosecutors said Kahn regularly sold prescriptions for cash and unlawfully prescribed large amounts of opioid pills, resulting in at least one patient dying of an overdose.
Lawrence Robbins, Ruan's lawyer, said that while jurors are free to disbelieve that a doctor had a good faith belief in the medical validity of their drug prescriptions, they should be instructed by courts to consider that defense before reaching a verdict.
Justice Samuel Alito said the Controlled Substance Act by his reading had no mention of such a requirement. 
""As for 'good faith,' I don't know where that word comes from at all,"" Alito said.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the statute's requirement of a ""legitimate medical purpose"" to prescribe controlled substances was vague and something ""on which reasonable people can disagree.""
Kavanaugh appeared open to instructing jurors to hear good faith defenses from doctors, saying jurors would almost certainly disbelieve them if they came in with ""some outlandish theory.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said on Tuesday that Russian ""crimes"" in Ukraine are mounting by the hour, with strikes hitting hospitals, schools and homes, and called for holding perpetrators accountable.
Moscow faced increasing isolation on Tuesday as President Vladimir Putin showed no sign of stopping an invasion of Ukraine, where fierce fighting and Russian bombardment have killed dozens and sparked a refugee crisis.
""Russian strikes are hitting schools, hospitals, and residential buildings,"" Blinken said in a video message to the U.N. Human Rights Council. ""Reports of Russia's human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law mount by the hour.""
Blinken said that the Geneva forum's urgent debate on Ukraine set for Thursday, where a resolution brought by Kyiv and allies would set up an international probe into violations, is an ""important step toward ensuring documentation and accountability"".
""We must take steps to hold the perpetrators accountable,"" he added, invoking the need to act out of respect for ""every victim of those crimes,"" he said.
The United States is looking closely at whether war crimes were committed during the Russian invasion of Ukraine and engaging with partners around the world on the issue, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Tuesday.
Uzra Zeya, U.S. Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights, told reporters in Geneva that Russia's invasion was ""resulting in a human rights and humanitarian catastrophe"".
""If they are intentionally targeting civilians or civilian objects, that would be a violation of international humanitarian law,"" she said.
Zeya denounced what she called ""the depravity of past Russian operations"", including in areas of Ukraine's Donbass region, saying they were marked by extrajudicial killings, abductions, unlawful detentions and torture. 
XINJIANG 'GENOCIDE'
Blinken's speech marked Washington's return as a voting member to the top U.N. rights body which the Trump administration quit in 2018 over what it called chronic bias against Israel and a lack of reform.
But he said that the Biden administration would continue to counter what he called the council's ""anti-Israel bias and the unfair and disproportionate focus on Israel"".

Blinken said that China ""continues to commit genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang"" against Muslim Uyghurs. He was referring to reports that some 1 million Uyghurs are detained in mass camps in the remote northwestern region, some subjected to forced labour, which Beijing denies.
He called for U.N. human rights boss Michelle Bachelet to release her office's report with findings on the situation.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -An Indian student was killed by shelling in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Tuesday, prompting New Delhi to step up demands for safe passage to evacuate thousands of its nationals trapped in the war zone. 
Invading Russian forces are trying to lay siege to Kharkiv, firing volleys of artillery that have killed civilians including children, Ukrainian officials say. 
Indian foreign ministry spokesman Arindam Bagchi said the ambassadors of Russia and Ukraine had been called in ""to reiterate our demand for urgent safe passage for Indian nationals who are still in Kharkiv and cities in other conflict zones."" 
In a post on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), he added that the ministry was in touch with the family of the student, who he did not name. 
Some 6,000 Indians remain trapped since Russia invaded the former Soviet republic last week, a government official briefed on the situation told Reuters.
In total, about 470,000 foreign nationals are stranded in Ukraine, including students and migrant workers, the U.N. migration agency said, urging neighbouring countries to grant them refuge if they try to flee.
An ally of Russia, India has not condemned Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, instead calling for both sides to cease violence.
Russia says its assault from the north, east and south of Ukraine is not aimed at occupying territory, calling it a special operation to demilitarise and ""denazify"" the country - a justification dismissed by Kyiv and the West as war propaganda.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday dismissed allegations of Russian strikes on civilian targets and said reports of the use of cluster and vacuum bombs were fake. He categorically denied that Russia had committed war crimes.
Peskov said, without providing evidence, that Ukrainian nationalist groups were using people as human shields.
SHELTER AND FOOD
Before the conflict began, Indians made up around a quarter of the 76,000 foreign students in Ukraine, by far the largest number, according to Ukrainian government data.
The Indian government has asked Indian pharmaceutical companies with operations in Ukraine and neighbouring countries to help the students with food, shelter and logistics, including facilitating their movement to border areas, the source added. 

The government has sent four ministers to neighbouring countries to assist in the rescue efforts. 
The situation in Kharkiv is of particular concern, a second government source told Reuters. An Indian team has been positioned in Belgorod, a Russian city about 70 kilometres (45 miles) away close to the Ukrainian border, but has been unable to evacuate citizens because of the fighting, the source said.

AMSTERDAM/LONDON (Reuters) - Multiple cluster bombs were fired on Ukraine's second largest city Kharkiv on Monday, two munitions experts said after reviewing footage posted on social media.
Reuters geo-located two separate videos that show thuds and flashes over a wide residential area in the city of 1.4 million in northeast Ukraine. Reuters was unable to obtain the original footage to confirm the time and date of the recordings, which were posted online on Monday.
Kharkiv has been the target of some of the worst aerial attacks since Ukraine was invaded by Russian forces on Feb. 24.
""Kharkiv appears to have been the target of multiple cluster munition attacks yesterday,"" said Sam Dubberley, head of the Digital Investigations Lab at New York-based Human Rights Watch. ""We have geo-located one showing what appears to be several civilian victims a short way away.""
Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former British Army officer and biological and chemical weapons specialist, agreed that cluster munitions were most likely used in Kharkiv.
    ""This does look very much like cluster bombs, and similar to those I’ve seen going off in Iraq and Syria,"" he said in an email to Reuters. ""The multiple explosions on impact of each warhead would suggest a cluster munition.""
Ukraine's ambassador to the United States accused Russia on Monday of attacking Ukrainians with cluster bombs and vacuum bombs, weapons that have been condemned by a variety of international organizations.
When asked about allegations that Russia was using cluster munitions and vacuum bombs, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: ""It's undoubtedly fake news."" Russian operations are focused on military targets, not civilian ones, he said. 
Russia and Ukraine have not joined the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions, which has been signed by 108 states. The treaty prohibits the use and stockpiling of this type of explosive, which scatters submunitions, or ""bomblets"".
Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov and Kharkiv region chief Oleg Synegubov said aerial attacks had killed or wounded dozens of civilians, including three children, in residential districts. 

""Four people left a bomb shelter to get water and were killed,"" Terekhov said. ""A family, two adults and three children, burned alive in a car.""
Reuters could not independently verify the casualty numbers.

Chief Executive Brian Officer Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia, the chairman of Airbnb.org, have sent https://news.airbnb.com/help-ukraine letters to leaders of Poland, Romania, Germany and Hungary offering help to house the refugees. The countries share borders with Ukraine.
At least 300,000 Ukrainian refugees have entered the European Union so far after Russia invaded the country and the bloc needs to prepare for millions more, senior EU and French officials have said.
Airbnb.org, which provides temporary stays for people during crisis, will work closely with governments to help address needs in each country including by providing longer-term stays.
The stays will be funded by Airbnb, donors to the Airbnb.org Refugee Fund and hosts of Airbnb.org.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -""Prove that you are with us,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the European Union on Tuesday, a day after Kyiv officially asked to join the bloc as it battles invading Russian forces.
EU lawmakers, many wearing #standwithUkraine T-shirts bearing the Ukrainian flag, others with blue-and-yellow scarves or ribbons, gave Zelenskiy a standing ovation as he addressed the European Parliament via video link.
""We are fighting to be equal members of Europe,"" Zelenskiy said in Ukrainian in a speech translated into English by an interpreter who spoke through tears.
""Do prove that you are with us. Do prove that you will not let us go. Do prove that you are indeed Europeans, and then life will win over death and light will win over darkness,"" he said. ""The EU will be much stronger with us.""
Zelenskiy has remained in Kyiv to rally his people against the invasion. As he spoke to EU lawmakers and top officials, a Russian armoured column was bearing down on Ukraine's capital.
""We are (with you),"" European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic said in response to Zelenskiy's appeal, saying the EU would provide Ukraine with weapons, on top of slapping unprecedented sanctions on Russia after it invaded Ukraine last week. 
""And we will be with you to rebuild your beautiful country after your victory,"" he said.
HARD TO JOIN EU
The presidents of eight central and eastern European nations on Monday published an open letter calling for Ukraine to be granted immediate EU candidate status and for the start of formal membership talks.
Ukraine is well aware, however, that any membership process will be long and difficult, even if it manages after the war to avoid falling back under Moscow's domination.
Charles Michel, the chairman of EU leaders, told the EU Parliament after Zelenskiy's speech that the bloc would have to seriously look at Ukraine's ""legitimate"" request to join.
But he added: ""It is going to be difficult, we know there are different views in Europe (about further enlargements).""
The European Parliament adopted a non-binding resolution - by 637 votes to 13, with 26 abstentions - calling for tougher sanctions ""aimed at strategically weakening the Russian economy and industrial base, in particular the military-industrial complex"". 
While Russian President Vladimir Putin ""recalls the most dreadful statements of 20th century dictators"", Zelenskiy is being ""heroic"", they said.
The European Parliament also urged EU leaders to be tougher on oligarchs and officials close to Putin, restrict oil and gas imports from Russia, ban Russia and its ally Belarus entirely from the SWIFT bank messaging system, and to close all EU ports to Russian ships or ships headed to or from Russia.
However, EU lawmakers rejected an amendment calling Russia a ""rogue state"".
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" aimed at ridding the country of leaders it characterises as ""neo-Nazis and drug addicts"".

European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said Putin's decision to invade Ukraine had had the effect of uniting countries against Russia.
""If Putin was seeking to divide the European Union, to weaken NATO, and to break the international community, he has achieved exactly the opposite,"" von der Leyen told the EU Parliament, a blue and yellow ribbon pinned to her jacket.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Western powers must enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine to stop an unfolding humanitarian catastrophe, an activist said on Tuesday in an impassioned plea to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to do more to help her country in the wake of Russia's military attack.
Johnson was taking questions from journalists at the British Embassy in Warsaw when Daria Kaleniuk, a Ukrainian activist from the NGO Anti-Corruption Action Centre told him that Ukrainians needed a no-fly zone.
""Ukrainian women and Ukrainian children are in deep fear because of bombs and missiles which are coming from the sky. Ukrainian people are desperately asking for the West to protect our sky,"" she said, her voice reverberating with emotion.
""Britain guarantees our security under the Budapest Memorandum so you're coming to Poland, you are not coming to Kyiv, prime minister .. because you are afraid.""
Britain, along with fellow nuclear powers the United States and Russia, is a signatory to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum under which Ukraine gave up its own atomic weapons in return for security guarantees.
In response, Johnson said that there was ""not enough that we can do as the UK government to help ... the way that you want.""
""The implication of that (no fly zone) is that the UK would be engaged in shooting down Russian planes, would be in direct combat with Russia. That's not something that we can do or that we've envisaged.""
Speaking to Reuters after the question-and-answer session, Kaleniuk condemned what she said was Britain's refusal to stand by the security commitments it made almost three decades ago and said a no-fly zone was essential in order to get humanitarian aid to central and eastern Ukraine.

""Ukrainian children are sitting in shelters in the bombardments and UK and the United States are saying sorry we will not go into war against Russia, we will not protect your sky ... because we are simply afraid of World War Three,"" she said.
""So what does this security guarantee mean? Nothing.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - With this week's U.N. climate science report laying bare the staggering economic costs and losses already faced from climate change, an inevitable question arises: who should pay?
Within U.N. climate negotiations, ""loss and damage"" refers to the costs countries are incurring from climate-related impacts and disasters - costs that disproportionately hit the world's poor and vulnerable who did least to cause global warming.
Drawing on more than 34,000 references from the latest scientific papers, the report released on Monday by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) confirmed that economic sectors from agriculture and fishing to tourism were already being damaged.
Extreme heat has fuelled crop losses. Rising seas have turbo-charged cyclones that have razed homes and infrastructure, slashing economic growth.
And as the bills mount up, poorer countries are left with even less to spend on heath, education and infrastructure – compounding suffering.
""It's an unending situation,"" said Anjal Prakash, a lead IPCC author and research director at the Indian School of Business.
The report is likely to intensify a years-long political fight over funding to pay for climate-linked losses, ahead of the next U.N. climate summit, COP27, in Eygpt in November.
Vulnerable countries for years have sought funding to help them shoulder these costs. So far, it hasn't arrived, and rich nations have resisted steps that could legally assign liability or lead to compensation.
The mention of ""loss and damage"" in the 2015 Paris Agreement came with the caveat that it ""does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation"".
Last November at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, poor countries called for a special ""loss and damage"" fund to be established, but the United States and other rich nations resisted. The delegates agreed to set up a U.N. body to help countries address loss and damage, and to continue discussions towards making ""arrangements"" for funding.
But there is no clarity on where the money would come from.
""We can't just create more talk shops when people are dying,"" said Harjeet Singh, senior adviser at Climate Action Network. He said COP27 needed to establish the funding facility that developing countries, including China, had called for at COP26.
Singh and other campaigners said the IPCC report – which has been approved by nearly 200 governments – could intensify pressure on the world's most powerful nations. 
""It will help us to say that science is clear, the impacts are clearer now. So you are accountable for this, and you have to pay for this,"" said Nushrat Chowdhury, a policy advisor at NGO Christian Aid.
ACCOUNTING FOR COSTS
The report's discussion of climate losses is bolstered by recent improvements in ""attribution science"", which allows scientists to confirm when climate change caused or worsened a specific extreme weather event.
Still, putting a number on the resulting losses remains contentious. For example, can climate-linked losses from a weather event be separated from losses caused by poor disaster planning? Can costs be counted for losses outside our economic systems, such as when nature is degraded or a community burial site is destroyed?
""We are still debating that in the scientific community,"" said another IPCC lead author Emily Boyd, a professor at Sweden's Lund University.
As climate disaster costs mount and U.N. negotiations remain stuck, some are considering other options.
""Liability and compensation have other avenues to be taken forward, which are courts,"" said Saleemul Huq, an adviser to the Climate Vulnerable Forum group of 55 countries.
Sophie Marjanac, lawyer at environmental law firm ClientEarth, said the IPCC report ""will generally support litigation"" to address climate change.
The legal avenue faces other obstacles, however.

Last year a federal appeals court rejected New York City's attempt to use state law to hold five oil companies liable to help compensate harm caused by global warming. The court said the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions should instead be addressed under federal law and international treaties.
""Challenges in climate change litigation are related to the law, not to do with the science,"" Marjanac said. ""The science has been clear, very clear for years.""

TISZABECS, Hungary/MEDYKA, Poland (Reuters) -Ukrainians arriving into the European Union on Tuesday described their frantic journeys to the border after leaving behind husbands and fathers to fight a Russian invasion and escaping their homes to the sound of shelling.
As a massive Russian convoy rumbles toward the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, the United Nations said more than 660,000 refugees had fled to neighbouring countries since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched what he has called ""a special military operation"" last Thursday. [L1N2V408B]
At the Hungarian border crossing Tiszabecs, a young mother cradled a baby in her arms as she and her son recounted watching rockets stream through the air before they drove for four days from the capital Kyiv.
""I saw war, I saw rockets,"" said 15-year-old Ivan, who looked exhausted and pale after the journey. The family, whose father stayed behind to fight, travelled in two cars carrying Ivan's three sisters, two aunts and grandmother.
New arrivals continued to pour across central European border crossings, with news of fierce fighting, civilian deaths and the massive Russian convoy stoking worries of those fleeing the war.
Across central Europe, authorities set up makeshift reception centres in tents where people could get medical aid and process asylum papers, while thousands of volunteers have driven to the borders with donations of food, blankets and clothes.
Most of the refugees escaping the war have crossed into the European Union from borders in eastern Poland, Slovakia and Hungary and in northern and northeastern Romania.
Poland, whose Ukrainian community of around 1 million is the region's largest, has welcomed a big chunk of the arrivals. Polish officials estimate around 400,000 people have so far entered from Ukraine.
The country's foreign minister Zbigniew Rau called for further sanctions on Russia if Moscow does not end its invasion in Ukraine, estimating that Poland might end up accepting one million refugees.
""WE HAVE NOTHING NOW""
At the Medyka crossing, Poland's busiest along its roughly 500-kilometre (310 miles) border with Ukraine, people huddled around a bonfire in freezing temperatures as they waited for buses to take them to reception centres. Discarded bottles, clothes and other items littered the road, and a few hundred people gathered near a local grocery store.
Also at the crossing was Ibrahima Sory Keita, who had arrived in Melitopol three weeks ago from Guinea to begin studies. 
Cities under siege across Ukraine are home to tens of thousands of African students studying medicine, engineering and military affairs. Thousands of Indian students are also trying to flee.
The U.N. migration agency estimated about 470,000 foreign nationals, including students and migrant workers, were stranded in Ukraine and urged neighbouring countries to grant them refuge if needed. 
Keita and a few friends raced to the border when fighting broke out, walking the final 45 kilometres on foot.
""Everything hurts right now,"" he said after crossing the border. ""I haven't had a chance to lie down for 4 days. I am shaking (from cold) and I need to sleep in a warm place.""
Some refugees were met by family members already working in the European Union who waited at the many border crossings, while local residents and officials across the region offered apartments and set up reception centres for temporary lodging.
Days of waiting to cross into the European Union also began to take its toll, with some new arrivals describing fuel shortages and lines moving only a kilometre a day.
""People are very tired physically and mentally in these queues,"" Tatiana Melychuk, 37, who fled from Ivano-Frankivsk with her two children. ""If someone breaks the rules people get aggressive.""
At some border crossings, queues on the Ukrainian side stretched back for kilometres.
Hungarian police reported that more than 60,000 people have arrived in the country since the Russian invasion while nearly 90,000 have entered Romania. 

In Budapest, a newly-arrived Ukrainian man in his 60s met by volunteer workers worried about his sons who stayed behind in Kyiv and wondered whether he would ever return to his home.
""I think this war will be very long in time,"" Amir, who did not want to give his last name, said at the Budapest train station. ""I left my house, my car, all of my profit in my life, I left all. We have nothing now.""

WARSAW/LONDON (Reuters) -Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned on Tuesday about the growing humanitarian crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, saying refugee numbers could reach millions, with possibly more than 200,000 coming to Britain to join family members.
Less than a week after Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, western leaders are looking at ways to help the hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians who have left their homeland.
Poland has estimated that about 350,000 people have crossed its border from Ukraine since last Thursday, while the European Union has emphasised the need to prepare for millions of refugees entering the bloc. 
""We will make it easier for Ukrainians already living in the UK to bring their relatives to our country. Though the numbers are hard to calculate, there could be more than 200,000,"" Johnson said during a visit to Warsaw. 
""(Russian President Vladimir) Putin's invasion has already cost hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes, and we must prepare for an even larger outflow, perhaps in the millions.""
Britain has 1,000 troops on standby to help the humanitarian response in Ukraine's neighbours, including Poland, Johnson said as he pledged up to 220 million pounds ($294.69 million) in emergency and humanitarian aid for Ukraine.
Interior minister Priti Patel told parliament the reunion criteria for Ukrainians would be widened to allow people living in Britain to bring parents, siblings, adult sons and daughters and grandparents to join them.
Visas for Ukrainian temporary workers in some sectors will be extended to allow them to remain in Britain until at least the end of this year, Patel added, and the government will also set up a humanitarian sponsorship route for Ukrainians who do not have family ties with Britain. 

Patel said the usual language requirements and salary threshold for people coming to Britain to join their family would be lifted, and Ukrainians would be allowed to work and access public services. 
""We will give them permission to enter the UK outside the usual rules for 12 months,"" she said. ""There is no limit on the numbers eligible under this route."" ($1 = 0.7465 pounds)

GENEVA (Reuters) -More than 100 diplomats from some 40 Western countries and allies including Japan walked out of a speech by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to the top U.N. human rights forum on Tuesday in protest over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The boycott by envoys from the European Union, the United States, Britain and others left only a few diplomats in the room including Russia's ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, Gennady Gatilov, who is a former deputy to Lavrov. Envoys from Syria, China and Venezuela were among delegations that stayed.
Lavrov was addressing the U.N. Human Rights Council remotely, after cancelling his visit due to what the Russian mission said on Monday were EU states blocking his flight path.
Neutral Switzerland also imposed financial sanctions on Lavrov on Monday, a measure of the international revulsion over an invasion Russia describes as a ""special military operation"" aimed at dislodging ""neo-Nazis"" ruling Ukraine. 
In his speech, Lavrov accused the EU of engaging in a ""Russophobic frenzy"" by supplying lethal weapons to Ukraine during Moscow's military campaign that began last Thursday. 
A Russian armoured column bore down on Ukraine's capital Kyiv on Tuesday and invasion forces fired rocket barrages into the centre of Kharkiv, the country's second largest city, on the sixth day of Russia's assault on its neighbour. 
'SHOW OF SUPPORT'
Among the diplomats who walked out, Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly and Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod joined Ukraine's ambassador Yevheniia Filipenko behind a large Ukrainian blue and yellow flag.
""It is a remarkable show of support for Ukrainians who are fighting for their independence,"" Filipenko told reporters.
Filipenko said there had been ""massive destruction to civilian infrastructure"" in Kharkiv, adding: ""The maternity wards are being attacked, civilian residential buildings are being bombed."" 
Russia denies targeting any civilian sites.
Canada's Joly said: ""Minister Lavrov was giving his version, which is false, about what is happening in Ukraine and so that's why we wanted to show a very strong stance together.""
Later on Tuesday Canada will petition the International Criminal Court over what Joly said were Russia's ""crimes against humanity and war crimes"". [L8N2V44MO]

She was referring to the Hague-based court where the office of the ICC prosecutor on Monday said it would seek court approval to open an investigation into alleged war crimes in Ukraine. 
The U.S. envoy to the Human Rights Council, Michele Taylor, said in a statement: ""This Russian war of aggression will have profound implications for human rights in Ukraine and Russia, and the leaders of Russia will be held accountable.""

LONDON (Reuters) -After some of Russia's richest oligarchs were cut out the global financial system, billionaires Mikhail Fridman and Pyotr Aven vowed to contest European Union sanctions imposed in retaliation for the invasion of Ukraine.
Russia's economy is facing one of the gravest crises since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union after the West imposed crippling sanctions on almost all of the Russian financial and corporate system following the Kremlin's order for a military operation.
Russian President Vladimir Putin says the ""special military operation"" is essential to ensure Russian security after the United States enlarged the NATO military alliance to Russia's borders and supported pro-Western leaders in Kyiv.
Some of the so-called oligarchs who built fortunes in the chaos of the 1990s, including Fridman, who was born in western Ukraine, have in recent days publicly called for peace.
But the EU on Monday slapped sanctions on both Fridman and Aven, long-term partners who earned billions of dollars from oil, banking and retail. Both said the EU's allegations were false and defamatory and that they would contest them.
""These sanctions are groundless and unfair,"" Fridman told reporters in English. ""I don't know if I will be sanctioned by the UK and U.S. - I hope it will not happen.""
Fridman, who is a UK tax resident, cast the war in Ukraine as a tragedy and said it should stop but refrained from saying more, citing the sensitivities of commenting on politics in Russia.
""For me that's a huge tragedy what is going on,"" Fridman said. ""The war should be stopped."" 
Fridman did not set out how he and Aven would go about contesting the EU sanctions. In a joint statement, Fridman and Aven they said they would ""contest the spurious and unfounded basis for the imposition of these sanctions - vigorously and through all means available to them.""
OLIGARCHS
Western leaders say sanctioning Russia's richest men puts pressure on Putin, though many oligarchs say the West is naive if it thinks Putin will listen to the views of businessmen, especially on matters of national security.
""Whatever happens with me will not have any impact on the political decisions in Russia,"" Fridman said. He questioned why Russians - just because they were Russian - should be prevented from doing business outside Russia. 
The EU said Aven ""is one of Vladimir Putin’s closest oligarchs"" and that Fridman had been ""referred to as a top Russian financier and enabler of Putin’s inner circle.""
Aven said it was wrong of the EU to say that he was an ""especially close personal friend"" of Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin. Fridman said it was untrue that he had “cultivated strong ties” to the administration of Vladimir Putin.
They denied any ""financial or political relationship with President Putin or the Kremlin.""
Fridman is the co-founder of LetterOne, or L1, which has long-term investments of more than 25 billion pounds ($33.5 billion) in the technology, energy, health and retail sectors.
Fridman and his partners also control Alfa Group, which includes Russia's top private bank Alfa Bank and its biggest food retailer X5 Retail Group.

He said there would be a ""petty drastic"" impact on the Russian economy with the rouble under pressure, inflation rising and incomes falling. ""It still will exist is my guess - I don't think the economy will disappear.""
Asked if Putin would face a popular backlash in Russia over the invasion, Fridman said: ""I just don't know.""

PARIS/VIENNA (Reuters) - Western powers and Russia have for almost a year worked closely to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, but the war in Ukraine is creating a sense of urgency to conclude talks before cooperation becomes impossible.
The stakes are high. Failure after 10 months of talks could carry the risk of Tehran getting to within a short sprint of nuclear weapons and igniting a fresh war in the Middle East. It could also see more harsh sanctions on Iran by the West and continued upward pressure on world oil prices already strained by the Ukraine conflict.
As Russian troops poured into and bombed Ukraine and Western powers responded with tough sanctions, the contrast with the talks in Vienna over the past week has been striking.
Mikhail Ulyanov, the ever-optimistic Russian negotiator, was posting videos and pictures on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) showing the ongoing co-ordination with the United States, France, Britain and Germany, even as he toed Moscow's line on Ukraine.
Western officials have repeatedly said that they have always been able to compartmentalise the Iran nuclear dossier because everybody had a common interest to avoid a major non-proliferation crisis.
That could be about to change, however, as pressure mounts on Moscow. 
""There's a good chance that a crisis of this magnitude will pollute not only the Iranian file, but many others,"" said a French presidential official.
""This is one of the many subjects on which the relationship with Russia is very severely, very significantly changed by the behaviour of President Vladimir Putin.""
STILL CIVIL, FOR NOW
All parties involved in the talks, which also include China, say progress has been made towards restoring the pact to curb Tehran's nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief. The 2015 deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), had fallen apart in 2018 when then President Donald Trump pulled out the United States.
But both Tehran and Washington have said there are still some significant differences to overcome.
Diplomats say Russia has been instrumental in shaping a compromise.
Three diplomats close to the talks emphasised that events in Ukraine had sped up efforts to conclude negotiations this week, fearing it would become more difficult to ignore events elsewhere.
""The longer that talks go on, the greater the chance that the conflict intercedes,"" said Henry Rome, Iran analyst at consultancy Eurasia. 
Diplomats say things have remained civil, but even a cursory look at social media shows that France's main negotiator is repeatedly calling out Russia, while warning Iran that it's playing with fire.
Speaking late on Friday, a senior U.S. State Department official said that, as best Washington could tell, it remained Russia's desire to negotiate a revival of the nuclear deal.
""We're not doing it as a favour to Russia. Russia is not doing it as a favour to us. We're working towards a goal that, on this issue, we appear to have a common interest in: reviving the JCPOA,"" the official said. 
IRAN OVERREACHING?
After a brief hiatus in the talks following what appeared to be a final Western offer, Iranian officials have seemingly returned with a tougher stance.
Analysts say the Ukraine crisis may have encouraged Iran to overplay its hand, thinking Washington would be keener to both avoid a second crisis and get Iran's oil back on international markets, where prices have risen above $100 a barrel.
""That's a miscalculation because the U.S. has sufficient bandwidth to deal with these issues simultaneously and it will take at least two months for Iran's oil to hit the markets in case there is a deal,"" Ali Vaez, Iran Project Director at International Crisis Group, told Reuters.
""So far tensions over Ukraine have not spilled into the Iran nuclear talks. But it's nearly impossible to segregate them for much longer.""
Ulyanov told reporters on Monday that the Ukraine situation has had no impact on the talks and Iranian officials have downplayed it for now. 
""These are two separate issues,"" a senior Iranian official told Reuters from Tehran.
""Of course time is running out and with what is happening in Ukraine, Russia might get busy with the crisis and then the West will be responsible for the failure of these talks.""
An Iranian security official in Tehran said that even if Russia were to change tack and try to torpedo talks, Iran would prioritise its national interest - the sale of oil and if possible a deal that would enable it. 
""Why should we sacrifice our millions of dollars in income because of an alliance with Russia?"" the official said. 
Should a deal be struck there could be technical implications. Russia is expected to ship excess enriched uranium out of Iran, but Western sanctions could impact that. 
""The conflict and sanctions may also introduce implementation risks surrounding Russia's role ... but those issues are likely manageable,"" said Eurasia's Rome.

A first test of whether Ukraine will derail cooperation could come on as early as Wednesday, when some of the protagonists will take a break from Iran to face off at an emergency meeting at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to discuss the security and safety of Ukraine's four operational nuclear power plants and various waste facilities, including at Chernobyl.
""It has to be this week,"" said a European diplomat of the urgency of reaching deal. ""Because we never know when there might be an escalation in Ukraine and then we're are no longer allies. Who knows, if the (IAEA) Board criticises Russia on Wednesday, the Russians could say 'To hell with the Iran deal'.""

LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - For millions of Ukrainians, the Russian invasion five days ago brought death, terror and uncertainty. For Mila Hadzieva, an IT manager in the western city of Lviv, it brought a searing clarity of purpose.
Hadzieva coordinates the hundreds of volunteers working 24/7 at Lviv's main distribution centre for humanitarian aid based in an art gallery in the shadow of a 19th-century palace. In better times, it milled with tourists.
Today, the gallery's halls throng with volunteers sorting the mountains of donated goods - clothes, food, medical supplies - into boxes for distribution to those in need.
They include hundreds of people waiting in sub-zero temperatures at Lviv's train station, hoping to board a rare train to nearby Poland, and hundreds more camped out in cars and buses along the congested road to the border.
""This is not just our fight,"" said Hadzieva, as news spread on social media of a devastating rocket strike in the war-torn eastern city of Kharkiv. ""We are shielding Europe. We are shielding democracy.""
She said Ukraine's supporters around the world now had ""the ultimate decision to make: Are we fighting together or not?""
In Lviv, a city of 700,000 famous for its architectural beauty and cultural heritage, residents interviewed by Reuters remained defiant but ready for the worst.
Air-raid sirens have gone off more than a dozen times since the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24, sending many rushing for basements and other shelters.
So far, no bombs had landed in Lviv, but nearby towns had been targeted. ""We don't know where and when the missiles might strike,"" said Hadzieva.
And many Leopolitans - as inhabitants of Lviv are known in English - were still preparing for the eventual arrival of Russian soldiers.
Non-essential shops remained largely closed in what felt to some like an edgy rerun of Lviv's pandemic shutdown in 2020. The sale of alcohol in shops and restaurants from 6 p.m. to midnight was banned from Monday because ""it is critical for everyone to stay focused,"" according to the city's media centre.
""WE WILL NEVER FORGIVE THEM""
Lviv is ringed by military checkpoints manned by soldiers which caused long tailbacks at night. A curfew runs from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.
One intersection in southern Lviv was fortified with concrete barriers, sandbags and car tyres, with the open space around it scattered with anti-tank ""hedgehogs"" made from scavenged metal.
Dozens of reservists in uniform lined up outside a nearby army base, many of them veterans of previous campaigns against Russia in Donbass. A poster outside the base read, ""Protecting the country is everyone's duty.""
Major Nazar Sobol welcomed the reservists, saying they would be briefed and given ammunition at the base, then deployed to halt any Russian advance.
He was not surprised that Russia's huge army had not subdued Ukraine's much smaller one. ""It doesn't matter how many you are,"" he said. ""It matters how prepared you are."" 
Asked about the mood of his soldiers, the major swore vigorously in Russian and grinned: ""We are very optimistic."" 

Back at Lviv's humanitarian aid centre, the same hope and defiance infused volunteers like Liliya Popovych, who until last week ran a local software company. She now sat between teetering boxes of canned food and sacks of potato.
""We will never forgive them,"" she said of the invading Russians. ""We will fight to the end. To the end. To the end.""

TAIPEI/BEIJING (Reuters) -A delegation of former senior U.S. defence and security officials sent by President Joe Biden arrived in Taipei on Tuesday on a visit denounced by China and happening in the midst of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The visit, led by one-time chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, comes at a time when Taiwan has stepped up its alert level, wary of China taking advantage of a distracted West to move against it.
Beijing claims the democratically governed island as its own and has vowed to bring it under Chinese control, by force if necessary. 
Mullen, a retired Navy admiral who served as the top U.S. military officer under former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, is being accompanied by Meghan O'Sullivan, a former deputy national security adviser under Bush, and Michele Flournoy, a former undersecretary of defense under Obama.
Two former National Security Council senior directors for Asia, Mike Green and Evan Medeiros, are also on the trip, which is intended to ""demonstrate our continued robust support for Taiwan,"" a U.S. official told Reuters.
The group touched down in a private jet at Taipei's downtown Songshan airport and were met by Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu. 
They will meet President Tsai Ing-wen on Wednesday, the same day former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will also arrive, though he is coming separately and as a private citizen.
China describes Taiwan as the most sensitive and important issue in its ties with the United States, and any high-level interactions upset Beijing.
""The will of the Chinese people to defend our country's sovereignty and territorial integrity is immovable. Whoever United States sends to show support for Taiwan is bound to fail,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said of the visit. 
Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang told reporters earlier on Tuesday that the trip showed ""the importance both of the Taiwan-U.S. relationship and Taiwan's position"" as well as the staunch U.S. support for the island.
""It's a very good thing,"" he added.
Their flight, from Washington via Anchorage, made an unusual arrival, flying down Japan's Ryukyu Islands before turning to approach Taipei from Taiwan's northeast coast and well away from China, data from flight tracking website FlightRadar24 showed.
The more normal approach path for their direction of travel is over the East China Sea.
On Saturday, a U.S. warship sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait, part of what the U.S. military calls routine activity but which China described as ""provocative"".
Wang went further on Tuesday, using even stronger terms.

""If United States is trying to threaten and pressure China with this then we need to tell them that in the face of the Great Wall of steel forged by 1.4 billion Chinese people, any military deterrence is but scrap metal,"" he said. 
""The gimmick of having a U.S. warship sail through the Taiwan Strait should be left to those who foolishly believe in hegemony.""

(Reuters) - When Russia invaded Ukraine last week, some of social media's youngest users experienced the conflict from the front lines on TikTok.
Videos of people huddling and crying in windowless bomb shelters, explosions blasting through urban settings and missiles streaking across Ukrainian cities took over the app from its usual offerings of fashion, fitness and dance videos. 
Ukrainian social media influencers uploaded bleak scenes of themselves wrapped in blankets in underground bunkers and army tanks rolling down residential streets, juxtaposed against photos of blooming flowers and laughing friends at restaurants that honored more peaceful memories of their hometowns.
They urged their followers to pray for Ukraine, donate to support the Ukrainian military and demanded Russian users in particular to join anti-war efforts.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which it has called a ""special operation,"" is the latest example of the central role TikTok has played in bringing news and current events to the app's large Gen Z audience. Its famed algorithm is known for serving trending content even if users do not follow certain people, allowing topics to quickly go viral among its 1 billion monthly users.
The app has become so influential in this conflict that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed to ""TikTokers"" as a group that could help end the war, in a speech https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/london-playbook/breaking-putin-bombs-kyiv-declares-war-blasts-rock-major-cities directed at Russian citizens. Some TikTokers picked up where the politician left off.
A Ukrainian travel blogger named Alina Volik, who has over 36,000 followers on TikTok, took a break from posting highlights of her trips to Egypt, Spain and Turkey, to upload videos of life in the invasion, of emergency backpacks filled with first aid supplies and of sealed windows to protect against glass shards in a blast. In TikTok videos posted on Monday, Volik also urged her international followers to watch her Instagram Stories to ""see the truth"" about Ukraine.
In an email to Reuters, Volik said she wanted to combat misinformation in the Russian news that the country's actions were a ""military operation"" rather than a war that is hurting Ukrainians.
Montages of residential buildings destroyed by missiles, empty grocery store shelves and long lines of cars piled up outside gas stations could be seen on the TikTok pages of top Ukrainian influencers.
""@zaluznik"" who has 2 million followers, posted one such montage on Sunday with the caption ""Russians open your eyes!""
Russian influencers have also taken to the app to share their reaction. Niki Proshin, who has over 763,000 TikTok followers, said in a video on Thursday that ""normal people"" in Russia do not support the war.
""None of my friends and none of the people I personally talk to supported today's events,"" he said, referring to the invasion of Ukraine.
On Monday, Russia's communications regulator Roskomnadzor demanded the app stop including military-related content in recommended posts to minors, saying much of the content was anti-Russian in character. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Online misinformation researchers warned that false information about the conflict were now mixed in with authentic ones and has spread widely on TikTok and other tech platforms including Meta Platforms's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's YouTube.
Footage of military simulator video game Arma 3, images of explosions from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the Gaza Strip, old footage of heavy firing and animations of flying aircraft have been shared on social media sites as if they depict the Russian invasion of Ukraine last week.
""We continue to closely monitor the situation, with increased resources to respond to emerging trends and remove violative content, including harmful misinformation and promotion of violence,"" a TikTok spokesperson said, adding that it works with fact checking organizations. 
Some Ukrainian TikTok users have made it a mission to share information and spread awareness with Western audiences. 
""I want people to understand this is not a joke, this is a serious situation that Ukrainians face,"" Marta Vasyuta, 20, said in an interview on Monday.

One of Vasyuta's TikTok videos showed what appeared to be a missile in the sky with the caption ""Kyiv 4:23 am."" It had over 131,000 comments by Monday as users flooded the video to offer their prayers and express disbelief.
""Never thought I would get WAR updates on TIKTOK,"" commented one user.

(Reuters) -The International Olympic Committee's executive board has recommended sports federations to ban Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials from competing in events following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The IOC said the executive board made the decision ""in order to protect the integrity of global sports competitions and for the safety of all the participants"" and that the body was acting with a ""heavy heart"".
The Russian Olympic Committee categorically disagreed with the IOC, saying the decision ""contradicts both the regulatory documents of the IOC and the (Olympic) Charter"".
""As a first step, we consider it necessary to send requests to international federations for an official response on the status of Russian athletes and their rights to participate in international competitions due to the fact that it is the... federations that have the authority to admit athletes to international competitions in the respective sport,"" the ROC said in a statement.
""For its part, the Russian Olympic Committee intends to consistently uphold the rights and interests of Russian athletes and provide all necessary assistance to our national federations to challenge discriminatory decisions of the relevant international federations.""
The statement from IOC comes shortly before the Winter Paralympics starts in Beijing on Friday. The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) will meet on Wednesday to discuss Russia ahead of the Games.
Following IOC's statement, soccer governing bodies FIFA and UEFA also suspended Russia's national and club teams from all competitions until further notice. 
Sports bodies across the world have already moved against Russia by refusing to host or play against teams from the country.
The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee and its athletes advisory council sought a complete ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials effectively immediately and inclusive of the Beijing Paralympics.
""As the world watches in horror while Russia brazenly attacks the innocent people and athletes of Ukraine, this is the only acceptable action to be taken until peace has been restored,"" the USOPC said in a statement late on Monday. 
IOC'S STATEMENT 'SMOKE AND MIRRORS' 
Athletes from Ukraine and other nations have urged the IOC and IPC to suspend Russia and Belarus ban their athletes from events immediately.
Global Athlete, an international athlete-led movement that aims to inspire change in world sport, said it was ""angry and appalled"" by the IOC's statement.
""The IOC has once again only made smoke and mirror recommendations and refuses to take action against Russia and Belarus,"" Global Athlete Director-General Rob Koehler told Reuters in a statement. 
""In addition, the Paralympics start in days and the International Paralympic Committee's silence and lack of action speak volumes that they are also aligned with Russia and favour politics over principles and Russian interests over athlete interests.
""Athletes are calling for all Russian and Belarusian athletes to be banned from the 2022 Beijing Paralympic Games. Athletes globally have lost confidence in the Olympic and Paralympic movements.""
The IOC also strongly urged federations to ensure that no athlete or sports official from Russia or Belarus would be allowed to take part under the name of Russia or Belarus. 
""Russian or Belarusian nationals, be it as individuals or teams, should be accepted only as neutral athletes or neutral teams. No national symbols, colours, flags or anthems should be displayed,"" the statement added. 
However, the board said that in very extreme circumstances, the board would leave it to the relevant organisations to effectively address the dilemma.
""In this context, the IOC EB considered in particular the upcoming Paralympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 and reiterated its full support for the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and the Games,"" the statement added.
OLYMPIC ORDER WITHDRAWN FROM PUTIN 
The IOC reiterated its recommendation not to organise any sports event in Russia or Belarus.
The IOC also said it had taken the ad hoc decision to withdraw the Olympic Order from all persons who currently have an important function in the government of the Russian Federation, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
The Olympic Order is the highest award granted by the Olympic movement and Putin was the recipient of a gold honour in 2001.
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko and Dmitry Kozak, deputy chief of staff of the presidential executive office, have also been stripped of their titles.
The IOC said it made the decision based on ""the exceptional circumstances of the situation and considering the extremely grave violation of the Olympic Truce and other violations of the Olympic Charter by the Russian government in the past"".

Ukraine's health ministry said on Sunday that 352 civilians, including 14 children, had been killed since Russia's invasion of the country last week. Belarus has been a key staging area for the invasion.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.

172,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 10:13PM ET</span>","KYIV/MOSCOW (Reuters) -President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the West to consider a no-fly zone for Russian aircraft over Ukraine on Monday after Moscow bombarded the country's second largest city, drawing new sanctions by the United States and its allies.
Russia faces increasing international isolation over its invasion of Ukraine, and hours of negotiations between the two sides on Monday failed to reach a breakthrough to halt the fighting. 
Ukrainian officials said Russian attacks in Kharkiv, a city of 1.4 million people, had killed civilians, including children. In a video address, Zelenskiy said it was time to block Russian missiles, planes and helicopters from Ukraine's airspace. 
""Fair negotiations can occur when one side does not hit the other side with rocket artillery at the very moment of negotiations,"" Zelenskiy said. He did not specify how and by whom a no-fly zone would be enforced.
The United States has ruled out sending troops to fight Russia and officials have voiced concern about further escalating tensions between the world's two biggest nuclear powers. 
""A no-fly zone would require implementation,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.
Such a move would require ""deploying U.S. military to enforce, which would be... potentially a direct conflict, and potentially a war with Russia, which is something we are not planning to be a part of.""
Western nations, united in condemnation of Russia's assault, have hit Russia with sanctions, with targets including President Vladimir Putin and his confidants.
But Putin has shown no sign of reconsidering the invasion he unleashed on Russia's neighbour last Thursday in an attempt to redraw Europe's security map and pull Ukraine firmly into its orbit. 
The Russian leader put Russia's nuclear forces on high alert on Sunday, though a senior U.S. defence official said Washington had still not seen any ""muscle movement"" following Putin's announcement.
Asked at the White House on Monday if Americans should worry about nuclear war, U.S. President Joe Biden said: ""No.""
But in a sign of souring relations, the United States expelled 12 Russian diplomats at the United Nations, citing national security concerns. Russia described the move as ""hostile.""
'IT'S A CRIME'
The Russian invasion - the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two - has failed to achieve the decisive early gains that Putin would have hoped for.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.
Kharkiv in Ukraine's northeast has become a major battleground. Oleg Synegubov, Kharkiv's regional administration chief, said Russian artillery had pounded residential districts even though no Ukrainian army positions or strategic infrastructure were there. At least 11 people were killed, he said.
""This is happening in the daytime, when people have gone out to the pharmacy, for groceries, or for drinking water. It's a crime,"" he said.
Kharkiv's mayor, Igor Terekhov, said four people had died after emerging from a bomb shelter to collect water, and that a family with three children had burned to death in a car. 
Earlier, Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said Russian rocket strikes on Kharkiv had killed dozens. It was not possible to verify the casualty figures independently. 
Moscow's United Nations ambassador, speaking in New York, said the Russian army did not pose a threat to civilians.
Images from the U.S. satellite company Maxar showed a Russian military convoy stretching over 17 miles (27 km) and moving closer to the capital, Kyiv, which remains under Ukrainian government control.
On Kyiv's streets, signboards normally used for traffic alerts showed the message: ""Putin lost the war. The whole world is with Ukraine."" 
Fighting also occurred around the port city of Mariupol, officials said, and Russian forces seized two small cities around a nuclear plant in southeast Ukraine, the Interfax news agency reported. 
CEASEFIRE TALKS
Talks between the two sides were held on the border with strong Russian ally Belarus - a launch pad for invading Russian troops.
Ukraine had said it wanted to secure an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian forces. The Kremlin declined to comment on its goals.
The meeting ended with officials heading back to capitals for further consultations before a second round of negotiations, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak told reporters.
""The Russian side, unfortunately, still has a very biased view of the destructive processes it has launched,"" Podolyak tweeted.
Russian delegation head Vladimir Medinsky told reporters: ""The most important thing is that we agreed to continue negotiating.""
The Western-led response has been emphatic, with sanctions that effectively cut off Moscow's financial institutions from Western markets. 
The United States imposed new sanctions on Russia's central bank and other sources of wealth on Monday, and many Western companies began to disentangle themselves from their Russian operations.
Over the weekend, some Russian banks were barred from the SWIFT international payments system.
The European Union placed new sanctions on Russian oligarchs and officials and some of its members urged the bloc to begin talks on Ukrainian accession. Zelenskiy signed a letter formally requesting EU membership, an emphatic statement of commitment to Western values. 
Putin dismissed the West as an ""empire of lies"" and replied to the new sanctions with moves to shore up Russia's crumbling rouble currency, which plunged 32% against the dollar before recouping about half of its losses. 
Russia's central bank cranked up its key interest rate to 20% from 9.5%. Authorities told export-focused companies to be ready to sell foreign currency.
WEAPON SUPPLIES
U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said at least 102 civilians in Ukraine had been killed since Thursday but the real figure could be ""considerably higher.""
More than half a million people have fled to neighbouring countries, according to the U.N. refugee agency.
Partners in the U.S.-led NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) defence alliance were providing Ukraine with air-defence missiles and anti-tank weapons, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said. 
The Kremlin accused the EU of hostile behaviour, saying weapons supplies to Ukraine were destabilising and proved that Russia was right in its efforts to demilitarise its neighbour.
But there was support for Ukraine from unexpected quarters.
U.S. technology firm Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) said it had provided threat intelligence and defensive suggestions to Ukrainian officials about attacks on a range of targets, and also advised the government about attempted cyberthefts of data.

And European soccer's governing body, UEFA, scrapped sponsorship by the Russian state gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) reported to be worth 40 million euros ($45 million) a season, and UEFA and the global federation FIFA suspended all Russian teams until further notice.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The 193-member United Nations General Assembly began meeting on the crisis in Ukraine on Monday ahead of a vote this week to isolate Russia by deploring its ""aggression against Ukraine"" and demanding Russian troops stop fighting and withdraw.
The General Assembly will vote this week on a draft resolution similar to a text vetoed by Russia in the 15-member Security Council on Friday. No country has a veto in the General Assembly and Western diplomats expect the resolution, which needs two-thirds support, to be adopted. 
While General Assembly resolutions are non-binding, they carry political weight. The United States and allies see action at the United Nations as a chance to show that Russia is isolated because of its invasion of neighboring Ukraine. 
The draft resolution already has at least 80 co-sponsors, diplomats said on Monday. More than 100 countries are due to speak before the General Assembly votes. 
French U.N. Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere said: ""No one can avert their gaze, abstention is not an option.""
Ceasefire talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials failed to make a breakthrough on Monday.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he hoped the talks would ""produce not only an immediate halt to the fighting, but also a path towards a diplomatic solution.""
He described Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision on Sunday to put Russia's nuclear deterrent on high alert as a ""chilling development,"" telling the General Assembly that nuclear conflict is ""inconceivable.""
Ukraine's U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya described Putin's order to put Russian nuclear forces on alert as ""madness."" 
""If he wants to kill himself he doesn't have to use a nuclear arsenal, he has to do what the guy in Berlin did in a bunker in 1945,"" Kyslytsya told the General Assembly, referencing Adolf Hitler's suicide. 
Guterres also warned about the impact of the conflict on civilians and said it could become Europe's worst humanitarian and refugee crisis in decades. 
""Although Russian strikes are reportedly largely targeting Ukrainian military facilities, we have credible accounts of residential buildings, critical civilian infrastructure and other non-military targets sustaining heavy damage,"" he said.
Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Russia's actions in Ukraine were being ""distorted."" He told the General Assembly: ""The Russian army does not pose a threat to the civilians of Ukraine, is not shelling civilian areas.""
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbor's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.
U.N. aid chief Martin Griffiths briefed the U.N. Security Council later on Monday on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine. France has said it plans to put forward a draft council resolution on aid access and the protection of civilians. 

""The scale of civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure, even in these very early days, is alarming,"" Griffiths told the council. ""Civilian children, women and men have been injured and killed.""
U.N. refugee chief Filippo Grandi said the U.N. agency is planning for up to 4 million refugees in the coming days and weeks.

(Reuters) - A Texas software developer and a cook in British Columbia are among dozens of Americans and Canadians answering Ukraine's call for foreign volunteers to fight Russia's invasion. 
With their governments refusing to send troops to Ukraine out of fear of sparking a world war, Americans and Canadians told Reuters they were inspired by Ukrainians' fierce resistance. Many believe their democratic rights at home may ultimately be jeopardized if they do nothing to defend Europe.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on Sunday for the formation of an ""international legion."" Some young volunteers traveled straight to Ukraine to enlist. 
Others were applying at Ukrainian embassies and consulates before quitting jobs or dropping out of university. 
The mobilization was taking place as Russian artillery bombarded Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, on Monday, the fifth day of conflict. 
""I feel guilty to not go,"" said Dax, 26, a veteran of the elite U.S. Army 82nd Airborne infantry division, who planned to deploy with other former U.S. military personnel. Like many volunteers, the Alabama native declined to give his full name amid discussion on social media of the need to keep their identities and movements secret for security reasons.
Canadian Bryson Woolsey quit his job as a cook on Sunday after seeing Zelensky's appeal. He has no military training and plans to buy a plane ticket to Poland, cross into Ukraine and volunteer for combat.
""I felt like I had to do something,"" said Woolsey, 33, of Powell River, British Columbia, who became restless as he watched images of wounded women and children in Ukraine. 
Canada's Foreign Minister Melanie Joly on Sunday told reporters it was up to individual Canadians to decide whether they wanted to join Ukraine's international brigade. A U.S. State Department spokesperson, in an email to Reuters, said U.S. citizens are urged not to travel to Ukraine.
Not all volunteers want to fight.
In Quebec, 35-year-old physician Julien Auger was preparing to leave his young family to become a medic with Ukraine's health ministry and provide ""neutral"" humanitarian aid.
""Global opinion and support is the key right now to solving the conflict,"" said Auger, a father of two who provides palliative care at a hospital in Saint-Jérôme. 
In online groups, military veterans warned volunteers who lacked combat training they were heading into a conflict where inexperience could be a liability for themselves and others.
That did not stop those like Tai B., 23, who studied journalism in New York.
""I'm not looking to be a hero, or a martyr, I just want to finally do something right,"" said Tai, who can cook, do basic mechanics and knows how to handle a firearm. He said he has contacted Ukraine's U.S. Embassy staff about enlisting in Zelenskiy's ""international legion.""
Hyde, a 28-year-old from the U.S. Midwest, said he was already in Kyiv and expected to start military training on Tuesday. 
""I cannot bear the thought of Europe once again being plunged into warfare,"" said Hyde, who described himself as a gun enthusiast and avid survivalist with no combat experience. He expects to be given a helmet, body armor, knee pads and eventually a rifle.

In Austin, Texas, a software developer said he would draw on his experience as a U.S. Army cadet to fight for Ukraine.
""If they're willing to defend democracy then I think those that benefit from a democratic society are duty-bound to support them,"" said the 25-year-old, who asked that his name not be used. ""I'm not telling my parents until I head to the airport.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration is expected to announce as soon as this week a plan to beef up its skeletal staffing in the U.S. embassy in Havana to restore visa processing for Cubans that had been largely suspended since the Trump era, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The deployment of additional consular officers to Havana, a result of President Joe Biden's ongoing year-long review of policy on communist-led Cuba, would mark an initial phase of easing strict limits on visas imposed under former President Donald Trump.
The State Department under Trump sharply scaled back embassy staff in 2017 following a spate of ""anomalous health incidents"" that came to be known as ""Havana syndrome."" The unexplained illnesses first affected U.S. employees in the Cuban capital and later cropped up in other parts of the world.
There have been no recent reports of incidents in Havana.
The drawdown all but halted visa processing for Cubans who in many cases seek to emigrate or travel to the United States to reunite with families. It coincided with Trump's rollback of a historic rapprochement that his predecessor, Barack Obama, oversaw between the United States and Cuba, Washington's old Cold War foe.
The two people familiar with the matter declined to be identified because they were not authorized to disclose details. One said the plan was expected to be announced as early as Thursday by senior U.S. diplomats in Havana.
A State Department spokesperson said the administration was committed ""to exploring options to ensure appropriate staffing at U.S. Embassy Havana"" while maintaining security. ""These options could include sending both temporary and longer-term personnel,"" the official added, declining to elaborate.
The Cuban government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
It was not immediately known how many staffers would be added and how soon they would arrive, but the sources said they would focus on a huge backlog of visa requests. There were more than 90,000 Cubans on the ""immigration waiting list"" as of November, according to the State Department's latest figures.
In the Trump era, the processing of Cubans' visas had been transferred to the U.S. embassy in Guyana, where few Cubans could afford to travel.
Assistant Secretary of State for the Western Hemisphere Brian Nichols told lawmakers during a Feb. 3 hearing that the administration would send ""temporary duty consular officers to Havana in the not-too-distant future"" but he did not offer any details.
REMITTANCES
Even with this week's expected embassy announcement, the Biden administration is not likely to provide any further clarity for now on any plans for easing the flow of remittances to Cuba that were severely restricted under Trump. Money sent by Cuban Americans to families on the island had served as a financial lifeline for them. 
""That decision is still on hold,"" one of the sources said.
Nichols testified last month that recommendations on remittances were in the White House's hands and ""we await their decision.""
Biden, who served as Obama's vice president, had promised during the 2020 election campaign against Trump to re-engage with Cuba's government.
But the Biden administration slapped sanctions on Cuban officials and security force in response to Havana's crackdown on protesters in July, and has since imposed further measures over Cuba's prosecution of hundreds of jailed protesters.

Biden officials are mindful that any easing of restrictions on Cuba could lead to political fallout from conservative Cuban Americans. The latter make up a large voting bloc in south Florida and mostly backed Trump's tough policies toward Cuba, helping him to win the important swing state last year.
But the resumption of visa processing at the embassy is less likely to spur a serious political backlash since a number of Cuban American lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have backed the idea.

The northeastern city, Ukraine's second largest, has become one of the major battlegrounds since Russia invaded Ukraine last week in the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two.
Synegubov said Russian forces were firing artillery at residential areas of Kharkiv where there are no Ukrainian army positions or strategic infrastructure.
""This is happening in the daytime, when people have gone out to the pharmacy, for groceries, or for drinking water. It's a crime,"" he said.
Eleven people were killed on Monday and dozens wounded, he said.
It was not immediately possible to independently verify the casualty figures. Earlier Interior Ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said Russian rocket strikes on Kharkiv on Monday had killed dozens of people.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation” that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.
On Sunday, Ukraine's health ministry said 352 civilians, including 14 children, had been killed since the beginning of the invasion.

VIENNA (Reuters) -Iran said on Monday efforts to revive a 2015 nuclear deal could succeed if the United States took a political decision to meet Tehran's remaining demands, as months of negotiations enter what one Iranian diplomat called a ""now or never"" stage. 
The stakes are high, since the failure of 10 months of talks could carry the risk of a fresh regional war, of more harsh sanctions on Iran by the West and of continued upward pressure on world oil prices already strained by the Ukraine conflict.
Iran's foreign ministry spokesman identified the remaining issues as: the extent to which sanctions would be rolled back, providing guarantees that the United States will not quit the pact again and resolving questions over uranium traces found at several old but undeclared sites in Iran.
All parties involved in the talks say progress has been made toward the restoration of the pact to curb Tehran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief, which the United States abandoned in 2018. But both Tehran and Washington have said there are still some significant differences to overcome.
""Reaching a good deal is possible,"" Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Saeed Khatibzadeh told a weekly news conference while saying Western powers had failed to take ""political decisions"" on the three issues.
France's foreign ministry said on Monday that it was urgent to conclude the talks this week.
Iran's lead nuclear negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani, who flew to Tehran last week for consultations about the final draft of the deal, met the European Union's Enrique Mora, who coordinates the talks in Vienna, on Monday.
Two sources close to the talks said Iran had submitted new demands, while continuing to insist on existing ones, including the removal of a U.S. foreign terrorist organisation (FTO) designation against Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC). 
""Iran's stance after Bagheri's trip to Tehran has become even more uncompromising,"" said one of the sources. ""They now insist on removal of sanctions on the IRGC and want to open issues that had already been agreed.""
Iran has previously said that removing the Guards from the terrorism list was under discussion. Iranian officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter.
The Guards is a powerful faction in Iran that controls a business empire as well as elite armed forces and intelligence services. Its 2019 FTO designation by Washington has caused further problems for Iran's sanction-hit economy. 
Tehran also insists the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) drop its claims about Tehran's nuclear work, objecting to last year's assertion by the U.N. nuclear watchdog that Tehran had failed to fully explain uranium traces at undeclared sites. 
CRUCIAL STAGE
Then-U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the pact in 2018 and reimposed tough economic sanctions. That led Iran to breach the nuclear limits of the deal, which was designed to make it harder for Tehran to obtain the fissile material for a nuclear bomb. Iran denies any such ambition. 
Diplomats said the negotiations have entered a crucial stage, given Iran's uncompromising policy in the talks and the other parties' involvement in the crisis over Ukraine. 
""It is now or never. If they cannot reach a deal this week, the talks will collapse forever,"" said an Iranian diplomat in Tehran. 
In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters, ""We are prepared to walk away if Iran displays an intransigence to making progress.""
Referring to Trump's reneging on the deal, Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson Khatibzadeh said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), ""US has already 'walked away' from JCPOA. We must make sure it won't happen again.""
Khatibzadeh put the onus on the White House to compromise, saying: ""A deal is at hand, if WH makes its mind. Iran is willing, but will not wait forever.""
Russian and Chinese diplomats in the talks offered hopeful, but ultimately ambiguous, assessments after leaving the Vienna hotel where they take place.

""We are very close, but additional efforts need to be taken in the days to come,"" Russia's Mikhail Ulyanov told reporters, predicting the talks would wrap up in early March but not saying whether they would succeed.
""It could be said that we have almost seen the light at the end of the tunnel,"" China's Wang Qun told reporters.

KYIV (Reuters) - When Russia invaded Ukraine last week, Max Karmazin said he and his friends fled Kyiv to the relative safety of the west of the country.
The Ukrainian has since changed his mind, and, after spending Sunday night with thousands of others in the city's metro system, where they have been sheltering from possible missile strikes, he plans to volunteer to fight in the war.
Russian forces far outnumber Ukraine's, but they have met with fierce resistance particularly in and around cities. Civilians have joined up with local defence forces to support troops in their attempt to repel Russia's advance.
""I tried to escape Kyiv with my friends a few days ago - we left for Berdychiv - that was our first point where we wanted to stay - and then probably move closer to Poland,"" he told Reuters in the capital.
""But I felt like I should stay, so I left my friends and returned to Kyiv. We spent the night in the metro station underground, and today we are trying to find these guys - local defence units - and we want to join.""
Karmazin is one of thousands of Ukrainians across the country who have heeded their president's call to take up arms and fight the Russians.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.
Men and women have joined territorial defence units in Ukraine and formed their own local militias. Men below the age of 60 have been stopped from leaving the country as hundreds of thousands seek to flee the fighting.
Karmazin said he was not afraid.
""I believe the world is on our side, and you know, we were attacked, it's not our aggression. So I believe we did nothing wrong and we only defend ourselves.""

Kyiv resident Alexi agreed.
""There is no need to raise any kind of panic, no need to start a hysteria,"" he said. ""People unite. Yesterday we were building barricades, blocking roads to limit the movement of enemy troops if anything happens.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden said on Monday Americans should not worry about a nuclear war after Moscow put its nuclear deterrent on high alert amid a barrage of Western reprisals over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
In response to a question about whether U.S. citizens should be concerned about a nuclear war breaking out, Biden said ""no."" He was responding to a shouted question at the end of an event at the White House.
White House officials said earlier in the day the United States sees no reason to change its nuclear alert levels at this time, a point press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated during her briefing with reporters.
""We are assessing President Putin's directive and at this time, we see no reasons to change our own alert levels,"" Psaki said.
Russia's defence ministry said on Monday its nuclear missile forces and Northern and Pacific fleets had been placed on enhanced combat duty, the Interfax news agency reported, in line with an order the previous day from President Vladimir Putin.
Psaki said the United States and the 30-member NATO alliance have no ""appetite or desire"" for conflict with Russia. ""Provocative rhetoric like this regarding nuclear weapons is dangerous, adds to the risk of miscalculation, should be avoided and we'll not indulge in it.""
Biden held a call with U.S. allies and partners on Monday, as a U.S. official said a nuclear war must never be fought. Joining the call with Biden were leaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Poland, Romania and the United Kingdom along with NATO's chief and top officials from the European Union.
A White House official told Reuters that Russia and the United States have long agreed that use of nuclear weapons would have devastating consequences. 
""A nuclear war cannot be won, and must never be fought,"" the White House official said. The White House also pointed out Russia has signed on to joint statements affirming a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.
Russian and Ukrainian officials met on the Belarusian border to discuss a ceasefire on Monday while invading Russian forces encountered determined resistance from Ukrainian troops and civilians on a fifth day of conflict. 
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation” that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. 

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has also triggered a Western economic and corporate response unprecedented in its extent and coordination. 
The United States on Monday blocked Americans from engaging in any transactions involving Russia's central bank, dealing a crushing blow to the country's economy.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -California, Oregon and Washington will cease to require face coverings in schools after March 11 as the latest COVID-19 surge ebbs, but mask mandates will remain for higher-risk settings such as hospitals and prisons, governors of the three states said on Monday.
The joint action, following similar moves announced recently by several East Coast states, including New York and New Jersey, comes after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday eased indoor masking guidelines for most of the nation.
The rollback of compulsory masking also highlights a growing inclination by political leaders in those states, all led by Democrats, to shift a pandemic-weary public from a health-crisis mode to policies that manage the virus as part of every day life.
Local governments and school districts will be free to keep their own mask mandates in place even after statewide requirements are lifted, the West Coast governors said.
""As we learn to live with this virus, we must remain vigilant,"" Oregon Governor Kate Brown said in the joint statement. 
The CDC's latest school guidance recommends masking only in communities with a ""high"" level of COVID-19 as the surge in infections and hospitalizations driven by the extremely contagious Omicron variant declines sharply. Its earlier recommendation advised masking in schools no matter the level of COVID transmission.
Compulsory face coverings have proven especially fraught and politically heated in public education, with Republican leaders in some states, including Florida and Texas, banning mask mandates in schools, while Democrats have tended to encourage masking.
Governor Gavin Newsom of California, the most populous U.S. state with some 6 million school children and 40 million residents overall, said masks will no longer be required in schools and child care facilities after March 11, but ""will be strongly recommended.""
Oregon and Washington are following suit. All three states said mask requirements would stay in effect for healthcare facilities, prisons, public transit, nursing homes and other settings where the risk of transmission remains particularly high.
""Masks are an effective tool to minimize spread of the virus and future variants, especially when transmission rates are high,"" Newsom said.
California ended mask mandates in most other indoor public spaces as of Feb. 16 for vaccinated individuals, and as part of Monday's action the unvaccinated will be free of mask requirements beginning on Tuesday.
New York Governor Kathy Hochul said on Sunday that her state will end its mask mandate for schools and childcare facilities on Wednesday, citing a steep drop in COVID-19 cases. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy announced earlier this month that his state would remove its school mask mandate on March 7.

Connecticut's mask mandate was due to end on Monday, while Delaware plans to keep its in place until March 31.
The United States has documented more than 950,000 COVID-related deaths since the pandemic began about two years ago.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States still has not seen any ""muscle movements"" following Russian President Vladimir Putin's weekend announcement that he was putting his nuclear forces on high alert, a senior U.S. defense official said on Monday.
But some former U.S. officials and experts caution that it would be a mistake to write off Putin's remarks as bluster, given the risk that Putin could decide to escalate to using nuclear weapons if he feels cornered over the war in Ukraine or if the war spills over into NATO.
Russia's defense ministry on Monday said its nuclear missile forces and Northern and Pacific fleets had been placed on ""enhanced"" combat duty, in line with an order the previous day from Putin.
The phrase special, or enhanced, combat duty appears to have stumped the Pentagon.
""It's not a term of art in what we understand to be Russian (nuclear) doctrine,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""So that's why we're analyzing it and reviewing it to try to understand what exactly it means.""
Leaders of the U.S. military, which built much of its intelligence collection architecture to spy on the Soviet Union, were not aware of Putin's decision until he made it publicly and, so far, there have not been big movements of weapons or forces to demonstrate what it means, the U.S. official said.
""I don't believe we've seen anything specific as a result of the direction that he gave, at least not yet, in terms of appreciable or noticeable muscle movements,"" the official said.
The United States closely monitors everything from Russian nuclear storage facilities to deployments of nuclear-capable bombers, missile forces and submarines. 
The White House said it saw ""no reason to change"" its nuclear alert levels at this time, and President Joe Biden assured Americans that they should not fear nuclear war.
The United States and Russia account for more than 90% of the world's nuclear weapons, but only a fraction of them are deployed, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.
Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation,"" has failed to achieve any obvious objectives five days after launching its invasion, with no cities under Russian control, no Russian dominance of airspace, and some Russian troops running out of fuel and supplies.
Putin is also confronting a wave of unprecedented economic and diplomatic isolation from the West, which is channeling hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons to Ukraine's military to fight Russian forces.
BACKED INTO A CORNER
Jon Wolfsthal, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama on arms control, said the United States had long been concerned about Russia's nuclear weapons.
""We have to be very careful about what we do and don't do when you have one country that is backed into a corner, has nuclear weapons and is actually talking about their possible use,"" said Wolfsthal, currently with Global Zero, which advocates eliminating nuclear arms.
Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Moscow and fierce Putin critic, wrote that it would be a mistake to dismiss Putin's message on nuclear arms.
""The people who know Putin the best -- people I know in Russia -- are worried about his recent nuclear statement. The people who know him the least are saying it's cheap talk,"" he wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
A 2020 Russian revision to its nuclear doctrine suggested it might launch a nuclear response during a broader range of circumstances, including attacks on nuclear command and control, CRS, a nonpartisan research arm of Congress said in a report.
Robert Soofer, a former Pentagon nuclear policy adviser during the Trump administration, played down the risk that Russia would use nuclear weapons to address battlefield setbacks in Ukraine.
""The only way this is going to become a problem is if the war spills over into NATO,"" said Soofer, now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.
Francois Heisbourg, a senior adviser at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), suggested Putin's threats should be taken seriously.

""People who say he is bluffing have only their gut feeling to rely upon. Whereas those who say he isn't bluffing can draw on a rich trove of circumstantial evidence,"" Heisbourg said.
""Because as far as Ukraine goes, he has not been bluffing. He doesn't do bluffing. He has been upfront in terms of what he wants.""

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States has expelled 12 Russian diplomats at the United Nations over national security concerns, U.S. and Russian diplomats said on Monday.
The U.S. mission to the United Nations described the Russian diplomats as ""intelligence operatives"" who had been ""engaging in espionage activities that are adverse to our national security."" 
""This action has been in development for several months,"" said U.S. mission spokesperson Olivia Dalton.
Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters the diplomats had been asked to leave by March 7. He said Russia would respond to the move ""because it's diplomatic practice."" 
Nebenzia then raised the issue at the start of a U.N. Security Council meeting on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, describing the U.S. move as ""hostile"" and a violation of its commitments as host of the U.N. headquarters in New York.
U.S. Deputy U.N. Ambassador Richard Mills responded: ""Those diplomats that have been asked to leave the United States were engaged in activities that were not in accordance with their responsibilities and obligations as diplomats.""

He said they had been asked to leave ""so they do not harm the national security of the host country,"" adding that the decision was taken in full accordance with the U.N. headquarters agreement.
The United States and its allies have already slapped sweeping economic sanctions on Moscow for its attack on Ukraine - the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two - and moved to ramp up military and other assistance.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States shuttered its embassy in Minsk and allowed non-emergency employees and family members to leave its embassy in Moscow on Monday as Russia pushed on with its invasion of Ukraine for a fifth day.
""We took these steps due to security and safety issues stemming from the unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces in Ukraine,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.  
A photo posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) by U.S ambassador to Belarus Julie Fisher on Monday showed mission staff lowering the American flag. All American staff have left Belarus, Fisher wrote in a tweet.
U.S. citizens in Belarus should also depart immediately, the State Department said in a separate travel advisory. Belarus is a strong Russian ally and has been a launch pad for the invading Russian troops.
The United States had already relocated its Ukraine embassy operations from the capital Kyiv to the western city of Lviv two weeks ago as Russian forces amassed at Ukraine's borders. 
The latest evacuations come after Russian President Vladimir Putin put Russia's nuclear deterrent on high alert on Sunday in the face of a barrage of Western reprisals for his war on Ukraine, which said it had repelled Russian ground forces attacking its biggest cities.
In a press briefing on Monday, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said these were not retaliatory measures. ""We deem these measures necessary because of the safety and security issues resulting from Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine,"" he said.
On Sunday, the U.S. State Department said American citizens should consider leaving Russia immediately on commercial flights, citing an increasing number of airlines canceling flights and countries closing their airspace to Russia.

Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation,"" on Monday barred airlines from 36 countries from using Russian airspace.

The Russian Olympic Committee categorically disagreed with the IOC, saying the decision ""contradicts both the regulatory documents of the IOC and the (Olympic) Charter"".
Ukrainian tennis player Elina Svitolina said she will not play against Russia's Anastasia Potapova in the Monterrey Open, and refused to play against any Russian or Belarusian players until tennis' governing bodies implement the IOC's recommendations.

The Cologne Carnival parade, at which clubs traditionally poke fun at Germany's politicians with colourful floats, was cancelled last week in favour of a ""peace demonstration"" after Russia invaded Ukraine in the biggest assault on a European country since World War Two.
Carnival is hugely popular in parts of western Germany, especially in Rhineland cities such as Cologne and Duesseldorf, where festivities peak on Shrove Monday - or ""Rose Monday"" - with tens of thousands attending street parades featuring comical or satirical floats.
Thousands of people flocked to the parade route on Monday, many wearing costumes in blue and yellow, the colours of Ukraine's national flag, and carrying signs reading ""Peace"" and ""Stop Putin"".

One float in the parade depicted Putin as a puppet master pulling the strings of Lukashenko, and another featured a dove speared by a Russian flag.
The rally follows several days of protests against the invasion in cities around the world, including in Russia where almost 6,000 people have been detained at anti-war rallies since Thursday, the OVD-Info protest monitor said on Sunday.

TISZABEC, Hungary/WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland sought to ease passage into the European Union on Monday for around quarter of a million Ukrainians waiting at European border crossings in freezing conditions after fleeing the Russian invasion of their country. 
With men of conscription age prevented from leaving Ukraine, groups of mainly women and children arrived at borders in eastern Poland, Slovakia and Hungary and in northern and northeastern Romania.
Wait times to cross borders ranged from a few hours at small crossings to several days at busier ones such as Medyka in Poland, where lines on the Ukraine side stretched back dozens of kilometres (miles).
""The queues are huge,"" said Polish prime minister's chief of staff Michal Dworczyk, who added border police were allowing in people without documents and that the government was talking with Ukrainian counterparts about simplifying procedures. 
""If we count the functioning border points there are certainly over a quarter of a million people at the borders,"" he said.
Another Polish official said Ukrainian border guards were slowing the flow of people as they sought to separate the men of fighting age.
""The system often freezes,"" Deputy Interior Minister Pawel Szefernaker told the wp.pl website.
The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv tweeted that Ukrainian border guards were waiving exit screening procedures for women and children to reduce wait times as snow began falling.
Romanian Interior Minister Lucian Bode said that with people queuing 20 to 30 hours on the Ukrainian side to get into Romania, it was crucial to agree on how to process their paperwork to shorten waiting times on the EU side as well. 
The head of a U.N. agency said on Monday that more than 500,000 people have fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries since the start of Russia's invasion last week. EU officials have said the war could displace 7 million people. 
The European Union is also preparing to grant Ukrainians who flee the war the right to stay and work in the 27-nation bloc for up to three years.
BORDER TOWNS
Crowds of people and cars have started to clog border towns such as Medyka, as refugees wait to be picked up. 
The mayor of Przemysl, Wojciech Bakun, appealed to Polish volunteers to stop showing up with cars to offer transport for newly arrived groups, saying traffic was becoming unmanageable.
As officials searched for ways to unclog bottlenecks, Ukrainians living in the European Union anxiously waited at border crossings to greet family members.
""We were waiting here three days and they were on the road for over four days,"" said Veronika Sahlikova Kufelt, who travelled from Germany to meet her nieces and grandmother at the Ubla crossing in Slovakia. 
In Hungary, in the Tiszabecs village nestled in a bend of the river Tisza, one Ukrainian refugee - Tanya - arrived at 4 a.m. with two children aged one and eight. 
As she waited for a friend to drive them to her husband in Lublin in southeastern Poland, cars with licence plates from Hungary, Italy and the Czech Republic came and went, ferrying refugees.
Her town of Kalush in western Ukraine had been relatively calm before she set off.
""Only sirens were wailing,"" Tanya said.
Poland, whose Ukrainian community of around 1 million is the region's largest, has welcomed many people escaping Ukraine. 
Polish border authorities said almost 327,000 have entered Poland since Feb. 24, with around 73,300 arriving on Monday.
At Medyka, Poland's busiest border crossing, officials loaded new arrivals into tour buses before ferrying them to a reception centre in the nearby town of Przemysl where friends, relatives and volunteers waited.
New arrivals huddled in blankets around fires as they waited in the snowy, cold weather to leave the reception centre.
""I took a train from Kyiv to Lviv to a point where the taxi put us,"" one Ukrainian woman said. ""I walked the last 50 kilometres.""
Across central Europe, authorities set up makeshift reception centres in tents where people could get medical aid and process asylum papers, while thousands of volunteers have driven to the borders with donations of food, blankets and clothes.

In the capital Warsaw, local authorities said local residents had listed some 2,500 apartments where refugees could stay.
In Romania where volunteers were trying to provide raincoats in snowy conditions, more than 74,000 Ukrainians have arrived since Feb. 24, with more than half departing for destinations in other countries, officials said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The first criminal trial of a person accused of taking part in the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol by Donald Trump's supporters opened on Monday, with a judge screening potential jurors for bias.
The defendant, Guy Reffitt of Texas, is one of about 750 people charged with taking part in the riot, which attempted to stop Congress from formally certifying Democratic President Joe Biden's election.
A guilty verdict for Reffitt could motivate other defendants who face felony charges to accept plea deals offered by prosecutors.
More than 200 people have pleaded guilty to criminal charges relating to the Capitol riot. The riot was fueled by Trump's false claims that his election loss was the result of fraud.
Reffitt faces charges of entering the Capitol grounds with a firearm as well as an obstruction charge because he allegedly threatened his teenage children with harm if they turned him in to authorities.
Reffitt's estranged son, now 19, turned him into the FBI. The son, Jackson, is expected to testify against his father at trial, prosecutors have said.
U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich asked several questions of a group of about 50 prospective jurors to determine whether they could be fair and impartial.
The jury selection process is expected to take all of Monday and possibly into Tuesday, and the trial could take more than a week.
Jurors were asked if they followed news coverage about the Jan. 6 attack and whether they have such strong feelings that they cannot be fair.
Friedrich said she would not strike prospective jurors who have read about the Jan. 6 attack, so long as they say they can be fair.
""They'll just have to show their opinion isn't fixed,"" the judge said, adding: ""Nobody comes into this court with a completely clean slate about Jan. 6 because it was so widely reported.""
One prospective juror, who identified himself as a program analyst for the U.S. Department of Defense, said he had sought out a range of perspectives about the Jan. 6 riots by listening to both CNN and Fox News and believed he could be fair.

Friedrich blocked some potential jurors who said they have such strongly negative feelings about the Jan. 6 attack that it would be difficult to remain neutral, including one man who said he lives two miles (3.2 km) from the Capitol and was afraid to leave his house during and after the attack.
If convicted of the most serious charges against him, Reffitt faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, though defendants rarely get the maximum sentence.

(Reuters) - Climate change is already disrupting billions of lives and humanity is not doing enough to limit the suffering, the United Nations climate science panel warned in a major report on Monday. 
Noting that nearly half the world's population was already vulnerable to increasingly dangerous climate impacts, the report calls for drastic action on a huge scale: A third to a half of the planet needs to be conserved to ensure future food and freshwater supplies. Coastal cities need plans to keep people safe from storms and rising seas. And more.
""Adaptation saves lives,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said with the report's release. ""As climate impacts worsen – and they will – scaling up investments will be essential for survival... Delay means death.""
The 3,675-page report, the latest in a series by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), details the global consensus on climate science. This report, however, focuses on how nature and societies are being affected and what they can do to adapt.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine overshadowed the release of the report and drove the sole Ukrainian author to leave the proceedings to take shelter, although a government representative did attend its final approval by nearly 200 nations.
British, Spanish and Egyptian officials said the report was a call to action. U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry lamented that too little has been done to adapt to climate change and said the report offered a ""blueprint for action"".
""Denial and delay are not strategies, they are a recipe for disaster,"" Kerry said in a statement.
TOUGH CHOICES
On nearly all counts, the report makes clear that climate change is impacting the world far faster than scientists had anticipated. Meanwhile, countries have failed to rein in planet-warming carbon emissions, which continue to rise.
""Unchecked carbon pollution is forcing the world's most vulnerable on a frogmarch to destruction,"" Guterres said in a video address Monday. ""The facts are undeniable. This abdication of leadership is criminal.""
While governments need to drastically curb their emissions to prevent runaway global warming, they can also work to limit suffering by adapting to the conditions of a warmer world, the report says. 
That will take a lot of money - to finance new technologies and institutional support. Cities can invest in cooling areas to help people through heatwaves. Coastal communities may need new infrastructure or to relocate altogether.
""The scale of transformation that we need is unprecedented in human history,"" said Zinta Zommers, a report review editor with the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
U.S. and European investment firms said the report was a wake up call to the huge risks climate change presents to the financial system and that most companies are not doing enough to adapt.
The report predicts disruptions to economies and food production will push millions into poverty. 
In some cases, the report acknowledges, the costs of adapting will be too high.
LIMITING WARMING 
The report's release three months after global leaders met at a climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, highlighted the urgency of efforts to contain global warming to within 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of pre-industrial temperatures.
Breaching that threshold will deliver irreversible damage to the planet, it says. And every increment of warming will cause more pain.
""Adaptation is not a get-out-of-jail-free card. There are limits to adaptation,"" said Maarten van Aalst, director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre and a report co-author. 
Limiting global warming to close to 1.5C may not prevent losses to nature, societies or economies, but will substantially reduce them, the report says.
Having already warmed 1.1C, the planet is expected to hit the 1.5C threshold within two decades.
""Our atmosphere today is on steroids, doped by fossil fuels. This is already leading to stronger, longer and more frequent extreme weather events,"" said Petteri Taalas, secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization.
Societies will fail to adjust well to a warming world if they aren't socially inclusive in tackling the task, the report warns. Solutions need to consider social justice and include indigenous populations, minorities and the poor, it says.
""It's the poor and most marginalized who are most vulnerable"" to climate change, said Timon McPhearson, an urban ecologist at The New School in New York and one of the report's 270 authors.
Losses and damage from climate-related events, such as storms or heatwaves, are already mounting.
In the decade up to 2020, highly vulnerable people in places such as Africa, South Asia and South America were 15 times more likely to die from floods, droughts or storms, the report said. 
Hundreds of plant and animal species have disappeared at a local level, and some altogether from the planet. Australia's Bramble Cay melomys rodent, for example, was driven to extinction by sea level rise, noted said IPCC co-author Brendan Mackey of Australia's Griffith University. And marine heatwaves are killing off swathes of the Great Barrier Reef. 

For people, time is running out to make the society-wide transformations needed, the report authors warn.
""There is a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future on the planet,"" said Hans-Otto Portner, co-chair of the IPCC working group that generated the report. ""We need to live up to this challenge.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - Ukraine and its allies on Monday called for a United Nations inquiry into possible war crimes committed by Russia during its military actions in Ukraine.
The United Nations Human Rights Council voted on Monday to accept Ukraine's request to hold an urgent debate on Thursday on Russia's invasion. A Ukrainian draft resolution will be considered at the urgent debate.
If adopted, a commission of three independent experts would investigate all alleged violations of international law in Crimea and the Donetsk and Luhansk regions since 2014 and in other areas of Ukraine since Russia's invasion last week.
Ukraine's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Yevheniia Filipenko, told the Human Rights Council: ""Russian forces attempt to sow panic among the population by specifically targeting kindergartens and orphanages, hospitals and mobile medical aid brigades thus committing acts that may amount to war crimes."" 
Sheba Crocker, U.S. ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, said in a statement to Reuters that Monday's vote to hold the debate showed Russia was totally isolated on the Council.
""Only 4 countries supported Russia’s position, clearly demonstrating the international community is united in condemning Russia’s egregious action,"" she said.
Russia's ambassador Gennady Gatilov said it had launched ""special operations to stop the tragedy"" in Ukraine's breakaway Donbass region, and that Russia's forces were not firing on civilian targets in Ukraine.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov cancelled his planned visit to Geneva to address the forum on Tuesday, which Moscow's mission said was ""due to an unprecedented ban on his flight in the airspace of a number of EU countries that have imposed anti-Russian sanctions"", but gave no specifics.
The cancelation coincided with neutral Switzerland imposing financial sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and Lavrov.
British minister of state Lord Ahmad called for a probe into alleged human rights violations by Russia.
""There are various discussions taking place here at the Human Rights Council on this investigative mechanism. There are other engagements that we are having, including with the ICC (International Criminal Court), to ensure there is accountability for those crimes that are being committed every hour, every day on the sovereign territory of Ukraine,"" he told Reuters.
He said Russia was increasingly isolated economically, politically and diplomatically.
""We will continue to work with our international partners to make sure that again a very clear message is given to Russia that there is a major cost economically for Russian institutions, Russian banks, that this invasion is going to be costly to them.""

Canada's Foreign Minister Melanie Joly told the U.N. rights forum: ""Allow me to convey something directly to the representative from Russia: Human rights are universal and can’t be manipulated to justify wars and crimes.""

KYIV (Reuters) - In the dingy basement of Ohmatdyt Children's Hospital in Kyiv, mothers and babies find what comfort they can on makeshift beds and blankets laid out on either side of the concrete aisle.
Older children who are too sick to go home or flee the capital with their families following Russia's invasion of Ukraine are also adjusting to life under siege, staying away from windows and lying in corridors on intravenous drips.
Staff, patients and their families share Ukrainians' sense of shock at being caught in a conflict few could have foreseen even a few days ago. Like others, their immediate focus is on survival.
""These are patients who cannot receive medical treatment at home, they cannot survive without medication, without medical treatment and medical workers,"" chief surgeon Volodymyr Zhovnir told reporters on Monday.
The biggest hospital of its kind in the country, Ohmatdyt normally has up to 600 patients, but that number is now around 200, he said during a media visit to the state-run clinic in central Kyiv organised by the government.
In a surgical ward, surgeons and nurses operated on a 13- year-old boy brought in by an ambulance after being wounded in the armed clashes.
So far four children have been treated for shrapnel and bullet wounds - victims of shelling in and around Kyiv and skirmishes between Russian and Ukrainian forces. One remains in serious condition.
Among the mothers at the hospital is Maryna, whose nine-year-old son suffers from a blood cancer that requires regular treatment.
Earlier on Monday, air raid sirens wailed across the largely empty streets of Kyiv warning of another possible missile attack by Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"".
""There are bombings, sirens, we have to go (downstairs),"" said Maryna. ""We also receive treatment here, medications we have, but we need more food ... basic stuff,"" she added, holding back tears as she spoke.
'WE NEED PEACE'
So far the hospital has been spared the bombardment that has reached the outskirts of the city, although staff said they have heard gunfire in recent days.
In the afternoon on Monday, a Ukrainian patrol fired several gun shots at unspecified targets in downtown Kyiv, according to a Reuters witness. There were no immediate reports of casualties.
Kyiv is girding for worse battles to come as Russian forces approach, and the entrance to the hospital was guarded by heavily armed police during the media visit.
In the underground bunker, dozens of children and their parents lay on mats, some in need of additional oxygen and others connected to drips.
Patients in intensive care who cannot be moved have been placed in relatively safe areas of the building. Children slept on chairs in reception areas; along one corridor, gold-coloured Orthodox icons were propped up against a railing.
The focus is also on the security of medical staff.
""We also must take care of personnel, because if they die or get injured, what do we do, who will treat patients?"" asked Valery Bovkun, a microsurgeon at Ohmatdyt.
Zhovnir, the chief surgeon, said the hospital had stockpiled enough medications for a month, but added that it needed food for newborn babies. 
""Of all things we need peace most ... all of this is the tip an iceberg ... people are, for example, asking me where to buy insulin for children, pharmacies are not open.""
And he worried as much about children who were not able to make it to the hospital as those who were stuck there.

The hospital normally treats six to seven children a day for common complaints such as appendicitis, but that number has dropped dramatically.
""They could not have vanished, they simply cannot come here,"" he said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea broke its silence on Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Monday, blaming the ""hegemonic policy"" and ""high-handedness"" of the United States and the West.
Ceasefire talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials began on the Belarusian border on Monday as Moscow faced U.S.-led economic sanctions four days after its invasion of Ukraine, which has been roundly denounced in the West.
In its first official statement on Russia's attack, the North Korean Foreign Ministry said that the West was guilty of ""abuse of power"". 
""The root cause of the Ukraine crisis totally lies in the hegemonic policy of the U.S. and the West, which enforce themselves in high-handedness and abuse of power against other countries,"" the North's official KCNA news agency said, citing an unnamed foreign ministry spokesperson. 
The dispatch came just a day after North Korea, engaged in stalled denuclearisation talks with the United States, fired a missile in what could be its first test after a record number of launches in January.
Washington has called for a resumption of talks on dismantling Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programmes, but North Korea has rejected the overtures, demanding U.S. ""hostile policy"" and ""double standards"" be dropped.
Pyongyang has also threatened to restart testing its longer-range missiles and even nuclear weapons.
The United States has vowed to introduce export controls designed to cut Russia off from semiconductors and other advanced technology crucial to its weapons development and biotechnology, and block some Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments system.
North Korea accused Washington and its allies of ""ignoring Russia's reasonable and legitimate demands"" for guaranteeing legally backed security assurances. 

They ""systematically undercut the European security environment by pursuing the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's expansion towards the east, including blatantly deploying attack weapons systems,"" KCNA said. 
""The reality proves once again that as long as the U.S. unilateral and double-dealing policy that threatens a sovereign country's peace and safety exists, there will never be peace in the world.""

""Dear citizens. We urge you to stop this madness, do not send your sons and husbands to certain death,"" the message read. ""Putin is forcing us to lie and is putting us in danger.""
The website of Russian state news agency TASS, along with news websites rbc.ru, kommersant.ru, fontanka.ru and iz.ru of the Izvestia outlet all suffered outages, with several displaying the message. 
Ceasefire talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials began on the Belarusian border on Monday as Russia faced deepening economic isolation four days after invading Ukraine.
Russia says its forces have intervened in Ukraine in a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise the country. The state communications regulator has warned local media outlets and foreign tech firms against what it says are false depictions of Russia's activities in materials published online.

""We have been isolated from the whole world, they have stopped buying oil and gas. In a few years we will be living like North Korea,"" the message continued. ""What is this for? So that Putin can get into the history books? It's not our war, let's stop him!""

(Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to resolve a dispute over the legality of decades-old federal requirements that give Native American families priority to adopt Native American children in a challenge pursued by a group of non-Native adoptive families and the state of Texas.
The justices will review lower court decisions that declared several key parts of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 unconstitutional. President Joe Biden's administration and several Native American tribes are defending the law, which aims to reinforce tribal connections by placing Native American children with relatives or within their communities. 
The U.S. Congress passed the 1978 law in response to concern over child welfare practices that had resulted in the separation of large numbers of Native American children from their families through adoption or foster placement, usually in non-Native American homes. Tribes and Native American advocacy groups have maintained that the child welfare law helps preserve their culture and family connections. 
The law set federal standards for removing children from their families and placing them for foster care or adoption, including requiring that ""preference"" be given to members of a child's extended family, other tribe members or ""other Indian families."" 
The plaintiffs in the case are three couples who sought to adopt or foster Native American children - Jennifer and Chad Brackeen, Nick and Heather Libretti, and Jason and Danielle Clifford - as well as Altagracia Socorro Hernandez, whose Native American biological child was adopted by the Librettis. They sued in federal court in Texas in 2018 alongside the states of Texas, Louisiana and Indiana. 
Among other claims, the plaintiffs said the statute racially discriminates against non-Native Americans, violating the Constitution's Fifth Amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law, and that it unconstitutionally directs the actions of state agencies in adoption matters. A federal judge ruled favor of the challengers on both claims in 2018. 
In a 325-page ruling last April, 16 judges sitting on the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals narrowed the judge's ruling, but affirmed the invalidation of certain parts of the law either by a majority vote or by an equally divided 8-8 margin. 
That ruling led to four appeals filed at the Supreme Court, including by the Biden administration and four Native American tribes to defend the law, and by Texas and the adoptive families challenging certain aspects of the 5th Circuit's ruling. 
The federal government said in legal papers that although the law has stemmed the widespread separation of Native American children from their families they are still more likely to be removed than other children.

Texas said the law forces upon the state a child custody regime based on race and that ""the high numbers of adoptions and fostering of Indian children are often a sign, not the cause, of the high risk of neglect, violence, gang activity, drug abuse, alcoholism and suicide among Indian children.""
The case is due to be heard during the court's next term, which begins in October, with a ruling due by June 2023.

(Reuters) - Climate change will deliver serious blows to all parts of the world, but not all regions face the same threats.
""We are all vulnerable,"" said University of Edinburgh researcher Peter Alexander, a lead author on Monday's report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
While the future of some countries may be dictated by melting ice or rising seas, others will contend mostly with raging wildfires and extreme heat. And just as the challenges vary across the global map, so too should communities' efforts to adapt. 
Here are some of ways climate change will impact each region if the world doesn't adapt:
ASIA
With Himalayan glaciers melting, water can pool behind rocky ridges to form lakes. When those rocks give way, water rushes down - putting downstream mountain communities at risk of sudden flooding. 
Mosquitoes that can carry diseases including dengue fever and malaria will spread to new parts of subtropical Asia, encouraged by warmer temperatures and heavy rains. 
And millions of people will be on the move. In 2019, more than 9 million people across Asia were forced by storms or flooding to flee their homes. 
AFRICA
Living on the world's hottest continent, Africans are at an especially high risk of suffering from heat stress. If global warming goes past 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, at least 15 additional people per 100,000 would die every year from extreme heat.
Africa's population will likely grow faster than any other during the 21st century, and many will be living in coastal cities. By 2060, more than 200 million people in Africa will be vulnerable to sea level rise. 
Nigeria's coastal capital, Lagos, will be the world's most populous city in 2100. ""High heat exposure combined with the urbanization process we are seeing right now in Africa... is a dangerous mix,"" said another IPCC lead author Winston Chow, an urban climate scientist at Singapore Management University.
CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA
The Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest and the thousands of diverse plants and animals it supports are highly vulnerable to drought and wildfires, made worse by farmers clearing trees for agriculture. 
Droughts, storms and flooding will worsen in parts of the Andes, in northeast Brazil and in parts of Central America. Coupled with geopolitical and economic instability, these impacts could lead to waves of migration. 
The mosquito-borne diseases zika, chikungunya, and dengue fever will make people sick. 
EUROPE 
The 2019 summer heatwave offered just a glimpse of what's to come for Europe if warming reaches 3C. At that stage, cases of heat stress and heat-related death will double if not triple compared with 1.5C, the report says. 
Beyond 3C, ""there are limits to the adaptation potential of people and existing health systems"". 
Damage from coastal flooding is projected to go far beyond sinking Venice, increasing at least 10-fold by the end of the century. 
And despite Europe's relative wealth, current adaptation measures are falling short. Scientists project continued heat deaths, crop failures, and water rationing during drought in Southern Europe in coming decades. 
NORTH AMERICA
Large wildfires will continue to burn forests and darken skies in the western United States and Canada, causing destruction of nature and livelihoods while contributing to air and water pollution. 
Even if global warming is kept to 1.5C, many parts of the United States will be at high risk from severe storms and hurricanes, in addition to rises in sea levels. These events will disrupt global supply chains and international trade.
And in the Arctic, melting sea ice, warming temperatures, and thawing permafrost will push many species to the brink of extinction. 
AUSTRALASIA
Australia's Great Barrier Reef and kelp forests will hit a hard adaptation limit beyond 1.5C, undergoing irreversible changes due to marine heatwaves. Tourism revenue will fall sharply. 

Extreme fires will hit southern and eastern Australia and parts of New Zealand. 
And as Australia's forests dry out, alpine ash, snowgum woodlands and northern jarrah forests will largely collapse.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden will send a delegation of former senior defense and security officials to Taiwan on Monday, a senior official of his administration said, a sign of support for the island claimed by China after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The visit, led by one-time chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, comes at a time when Taiwan has stepped up its alert level, wary of China taking advantage of a distracted West to move against it.
Beijing claims the democratically governed island as its own and has vowed to bring it under Chinese control, by force if necessary. 
Mullen, a retired Navy admiral who served as the top U.S. military officer under former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, will be accompanied by Meghan O'Sullivan, a former deputy national security advisor under Bush, and Michele Flournoy, a former undersecretary of defense under Obama, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Two former National Security Council senior directors for Asia, Mike Green and Evan Medeiros, will also make the trip, which is intended to ""demonstrate our continued robust support for Taiwan,"" the official told Reuters.
The delegation is expected to arrive in Taiwan on Tuesday afternoon and stay until Wednesday evening, during which time they plan to meet Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen, Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng and other senior officials.
Taiwan's presidential office confirmed the visit and meeting with Tsai, saying that its timing during the Ukraine crisis showed Taiwan-U.S. ties were ""rock solid"". 
The U.S. official declined to say whether the timing of the visit was influenced by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Taiwan said last week that former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who served under former President Donald Trump, would visit from March 2-5 and meet Tsai.
The Biden administration has declined to comment on Pompeo's visit, calling him a private citizen.
Referring to the delegation led by Mullen, the senior administration official said: ""The selection of these five individuals sends an important signal about the bipartisan U.S. commitment to Taiwan and its democracy, and demonstrates that the Biden administration's broader commitment to Taiwan remains rock solid.""
The official added that Washington would regard ""any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific.""
""The United States will maintain the capacity to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security or the social or economic system of the people of Taiwan,"" the official said. 
Mullen's delegation marks the first public visit of a group of former officials to Taiwan at Biden's behest since April 2021, when former U.S. Senator Chris Dodd and former Deputy Secretaries of State Richard Armitage and James Steinberg traveled there and met with Tsai, who Beijing accuses of seeking independence. 
The latest trip comes days after a U.S. warship sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait, the waterway between China and Taiwan. The U.S. military described its passage as routine but Beijing said it was ""provocative.""
The White House on Sunday called on China to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
But Beijing has largely steered clear of criticizing Moscow after Russian President Vladimir Putin and China's leader Xi Jinping announced an enhanced strategic partnership aimed at countering U.S. influence just weeks before the invasion. 
Under long-standing U.S. policy, Washington has only unofficial relations with Taipei and recognizes Beijing diplomatically. However, U.S. law requires it to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself and the Biden administration has vowed to continue Trump's and Pompeo's policy of stepping up engagement with the island.
Russia's attack on Ukraine has given added impetus to a growing debate about the longstanding and controversial U.S. policy of ""strategic ambiguity,"" under which Washington refuses to say explicitly whether it will defend Taiwan militarily in the event of Chinese attack.

Some U.S. lawmakers, including the Democratic chairman of the influential House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff, have urged greater clarity about the U.S. ""obligation"" to defend Taiwan amid stepped up Chinese military pressure, but proponents of existing policy say this could worsen the risk of conflict.
China's ambassador to Washington said in January the two super powers could end up in a military conflict if Washington encourages Taiwan's independence.

202,"<span>Feb 28, 2022 09:19AM ET</span>",,,,,,"HONG KONG/MANILA (Reuters) -A rapid spread in COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong has cast a spotlight on the plight of domestic helpers in the global financial hub after some were fired or made homeless by their employers when they tested positive for coronavirus.
Hong Kong has around 340,000 domestic helpers, most hailing from either the Philippines or Indonesia. Many families in the city depend on live-in helpers for housekeeping and to look after the elderly and children, with the minimum wage set at HK$4,630 ($593) per month.
Under Hong Kong law, migrant domestic workers must live with their employers, often residing in tiny rooms or sharing the bedrooms of the children they care for.
Reports from helper support groups and local media of these workers being kicked out or dismissed have triggered appeals from Philippine authorities for the Chinese-ruled city to protect and support the domestic workers.
The Hong Kong Federation of Asian Domestic Workers Unions told Reuters last week it had received more than 20 cases of domestic helpers who had tested positive for COVID being fired. 
Hong Kong's Labour Department has warned employers it is an offence to sack those infected. People who break the law could face a fine of up to HK$100,000. 
In an emailed response to Reuters, the department said it would investigate any wrongful dismissals.
""The government appeals to the employer to be compassionate and consider granting...(helpers) paid sick leave,"" it said, adding employers should also provide ""free and suitable accommodation as well as free medical treatment"".
Two domestic helpers who said they were abandoned by their employers and left on the streets after testing positive for COVID told Reuters they felt helpless and traumatised by the experience.
'DEPRESSED, HOPELESS'
""I was depressed, hopeless, and felt anxiety because I am in a foreign country,"" said one of the helpers, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. She said her employers gave her medicine, but told her to leave their home and find a shelter to stay at, so she did not infect the family. 
""All I was thinking about was where to get food and where to find a place to stay because it was very cold outside,"" said the woman, who has been working in Hong Kong as a domestic helper since 2005.
The other helper, who has been in Hong Kong for four years, said she felt discriminated against, and would now rather return to the Philippines than stay in Hong Kong. 
Both the helpers found shelter with HELP for Domestic Workers, a non-governmental organisation which provides shelter and basic supplies to those in need.
""At the moment, the supply is not keeping up with the demand. And given that there are so many mandatory testing notices, so many people that are testing positive, we are unable to find isolation facilities for everybody,"" said Manisha Wijesinghe, executive director of HELP for Domestic Workers. 
As the government grapples to contain the COVID outbreak, Hong Kong authorities have banned flights from nine countries, including the Philippines, and tightened entry restrictions, leading to a shortage of domestic helpers.
Many domestic helpers work long hours and are only allowed one day off a week, when they usually get together in parks and open spaces throughout the city. 
Hong Kong's public hospitals have been severely stretched, struggling to cope with an influx of COVID patients including the elderly, many of whom have resisted vaccinations. 
Since the start of the epidemic, Hong Kong has recorded more than 171,000 coronavirus infections and over 650 deaths, much lower than most major cities. 

Healthcare and isolation facilities are overwhelmed, with the government scrambling to build new units to deal with a surge in cases. 
""I was sitting in a taxi area while waiting for information on where I could go. I told myself I have to stay strong, I am alone and I don't have help. But at that time, I was already in tears,"" said one of the two domestic helpers, relating her experience. ($1 = 7.8142 Hong Kong dollars)

At least 400,000 Ukrainian refugees have entered the EU so far, EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson said. EU members Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary have land borders with Ukraine.
""We have to prepare for millions (to arrive in the EU),"" Johansson told a news conference after a visit to a border crossing between Romania and Ukraine.
Johansson said she was hoping EU interior ministers would agree as early as Thursday on a protection scheme for those fleeing Ukraine.
Ministers on Sunday asked Johansson to prepare proposals to trigger the EU temporary protection directive, drawn up after the 1990s war in the Balkans, but never used so far.
Designed to deal with mass arrivals of displaced persons in the EU, it provides for the same level of protection, for one to three years, in all EU states, including a residence permit and access to employment and social welfare.
Local volunteers and authorities helping Ukrainians arriving in Romania were ""showing solidarity in practice, showing that we are based on other values than (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and we are practising these values,"" Johansson said.
But she stressed that the exodus of Ukrainians concerns all of the bloc, with many fleeing the war already moving on from EU border countries to others which also have large Ukrainian communities, including Italy, Spain and Germany.

Speaking at a joint news conference with Johansson, Romanian Interior Minister Lucian Bode said that, with people waiting 20 to 30 hours on the Ukrainian side to get into Romania, it was crucial to agree on how to process their paperwork so that they would not have to wait hours on the EU side as well.
With men of conscription age prevented from leaving Ukraine, mostly women and children are arriving at the border in eastern Poland, Slovakia and Hungary and in northern and northeastern Romania.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said at a news briefing that Western arms supplies to Ukraine showed that Moscow was right to try to demilitarise its neighbour.
He said that many Russians were deeply pained by what was happening to their relatives in Ukraine, but blamed it on the actions of Ukrainian nationalists.
""The European Union is an association that is taking an unfriendly position towards us and taking measures that are not friendly, but hostile towards us,"" he told reporters.
Weapons supplies to Ukraine would become ""an extremely dangerous and destabilizing factor"" that would not help restore stability but could in the long run have much more dangerous consequences, Peskov said.
""This, once again, confirms that Russia was right about the measures that are being taken in order to ensure the demilitarisation of the country,"" he said.
The West has stepped up arms supplies to Ukraine to help it defend itself against the biggest invasion of a European state since World War Two. Moscow says it is engaged in a ""special military operation"" to protect civilians.
Peskov said, without providing evidence, that many Ukrainians were being used as human shields in what he called a crime by Ukrainian nationalists. He described them as victims of their country's propaganda.
""Not only in the presidential administration, but throughout Russia, the vast majority of the population has friends or relatives who live in Ukraine. Naturally, everyone's hearts are aching for what is happening to these relatives,"" he said.

He declined to comment on casualties suffered by Russian forces, referring the question to the defence ministry. 
He also declined to elaborate on President Vladimir Putin's instructions at the weekend for Russia's nuclear deterrence forces to be placed on a ""special regime"" of alertness, or to comment on whether there was a risk of confrontation between Russia and NATO.

(Reuters) - Russia has employed hundreds of powerful and precise ballistic missiles in the first days of its Ukraine attack, but analysts and U.S. officials say many Ukrainian defences remain intact - effects that countries around the world are watching closely.
The use of short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) is likely being watched closely as a real-world case study by China, North Korea, and other countries that have been developing increasingly advanced arsenals of such weapons in recent years. And Western governments who see Russia as an adversary are eager to gather data on the missiles' effects in combat.
Russia had fired more than 320 missiles as of Sunday morning, with the majority of them SRBMs, a U.S. official told reporters.
According to U.S. estimates, the initial hours of the Russian onslaught last week included more than 100 missiles launched from land and sea, mostly SRBMs but also cruise missiles and surface-to-air missiles.
That would make it the most intense SRBM bombardment between two territorial contiguous states in a conflict, said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
""What we’ve seen in Ukraine corresponds to how many military establishments in many countries, including China and North Korea, may think of using precision ballistic missiles in future conflicts,"" he said.
ACCURATE MISSILES
Russia most likely used its only SRBM in active service, the Iskander-M, said Timothy Wright, a research analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).
First used in combat in 2008 in Georgia, the Iskander is designed to confound missile defences by flying on a low trajectory and manoeuvring in flight to strike targets as far out as 500km with an accuracy of 2-5 metres, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).
""It is likely to be able to accurately target and destroy what it is being fired at,"" Wright said, adding that Russia appears to possess around 150 launchers, which can also fire cruise missiles. 
There also appears to be evidence that Russia has used the OTR-21 Tochka SRBM, which was believed to have been retired, he said. ""If these were in storage, Russia may have decided to put them to use, rather than scrap them.""
What the missiles targeted and how much damage they caused remains unclear amid the confusion of the developing war, but analysts said there appear to have been some strikes on Ukrainian air bases.
Iskander missiles launched from Belarus had hit an airport in Zhytomyr in northern Ukraine on Sunday, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister said.
""We see some damage at airports, and it looks fairly accurate,"" said Jeffrey Lewis, a missile researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS).
Some strikes by unknown weapons at air bases appeared relatively limited in scope, however, and in some instances potentially misplaced, such as hitting stored rather than operational aircraft, said Joseph Dempsey, a defence researcher at IISS.
Ukraine has the Cold War-era Russian-made S-300v anti-aircraft missile system, which also has anti-ballistic missile capabilities, Wright said. It is unclear whether any engaged the Russian missiles, and some S-300v vehicles appeared to have been destroyed by strikes, he added.
The U.S. official said on Sunday that there were indications that some Russian missiles experienced launch failures.
""It's not the majority,"" the official said. ""But we do believe that some number of their launches have not been successful.""
Russia has not demonstrated its full air and missile capabilities and will most likely increase its waves of strikes in the coming days to degrade Ukraine’s surviving defences, including anti-aircraft units that have shot down several Russian aircraft, the U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War said in a report.
""The Russian failure to comprehensively strike key Ukrainian assets is a surprising break from expected Russian operations and has likely enabled stiffer Ukrainian defence,"" the report said. 
Some of Russia's hesitancy could be due to a lack of real-time reconnaissance and targeting data, but given the number of static targets, a more likely explanation is a desire to minimize casualties among Ukrainians, said Dmitry Stefanovich, a weapons researcher at Moscow's Institute of World Economy and International Relations.
""While Iskander-M is a very capable and precise system, the probability of collateral damage, obviously, increases with the number and intensity of weapons used,"" he said. ""If any takeaway is relevant for other SRBM-owning states, it is that those can be employed in limited manner and cautiously, an all-in salvo is not the only option.""
GLOBAL IMPLICATIONS
As the heir to the former Soviet Union's substantial missile arsenal, Russia boasts the widest inventory of ballistic and cruise missiles in the world, according to CSIS.
But other countries are buying or developing their own new missiles, driven by security concerns and a desire to reduce reliance on other suppliers.
Before the decade is out, Asia in particular will be bristling with conventional missiles that fly farther and faster, hit harder, and are more sophisticated than ever before.
China is mass producing its DF-26 - a multipurpose weapon with a range of up to 4,000 kilometres - while the United States is developing new weapons aimed at countering Beijing in the Pacific.
Taiwan and Japan are also boosting their missile capabilities, as well as defence systems designed to counter missile threats.
South Korea's defence minister said on Monday the country would accelerate development of various ""long-range, ultra-precision, and high-power ballistic missiles... and possess overwhelming striking capabilities against strategic targets"" to counter North Korea's growing arsenal.
Although it hasn't tested its longest-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) since 2017, North Korea has rolled out a flurry of new SRBMs, including one that appears influenced by the Iskander's design.
Like the Iskander, North Korea's latest missiles - including ""hypersonic"" weapons tested in January - are designed to be faster and more manoeuvrable than older weapons, enabling them to potentially evade missile defences.
Analysts say that although such SRBMs can't reach the United States, they would likely be used in the first wave if a war broke out, striking nearby air defences, air bases, and other targets similar to the way Russia used its missiles in the ongoing invasion. 

""North Korean and (Chinese) militaries are taking copious notes right now,"" said Markus Garlauskas, a former U.S. intelligence officer on North Korea.

LONDON (Reuters) - As scientists readied for Monday's release of a sobering United Nations climate report, some worried it would be overshadowed by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
The report – described by U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres as ""an atlas of suffering"" – calls for concerted efforts by governments to prepare for a warmer world.
But few could ignore the plight of the sole Ukrainian report author, a botanist who described taking cover in a Kyiv bomb shelter during the final line-checking of a report for the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that took three years to put together. 
""The battles are taking place both outside the city and in the city, where Russian paratroopers appeared,"" Yakiv Didukh told Reuters, having spent the night taking refuge from his 11th floor apartment in Ukraine's capital.
""People are worried, but we do not panic,"" said Didukh, who works at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.
The invasion rattled participants of the virtual IPCC proceedings on Sunday morning, as political delegates and scientists held a final session after two weeks of negotiating the report's summary for policymakers. 
""The Ukrainian delegation spoke this morning at the final closing. I will not repeat what she said because I think I would become much too emotional trying,"" said IPCC lead author Daniela Schmidt during a Sunday briefing. 
When the invasion began last week, the Ukrainian delegation told IPCC organizers that they might pull out of the final document review if the internet or electricity went down, Schmidt said. The Ukrainians ""expressed how upset they are that this will distract from the importance of our report"".
Scientists at the meeting said the Moscow delegation also apologised on behalf of Russians opposed to the conflict. 
Authors expressed ""personal solidarity with the Ukrainian delegation"", according to Hans-Otto Portner, an IPCC report co-chair. 
Some worried the painstaking work and conclusions would end up being ignored. 
""We live in a world where there's constant competition for headlines,"" the other IPCC report co-chair, Debra Roberts, told Reuters. 

Others noted the report's gravity demanded attention. 
""You are looking at the survival of humanity and the survival of ecosystems as we know them,"" said lead author Philipus Wester, from the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development in Nepal.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey's pledge to block some Russian warships from passing through its waters to the Black Sea during the Ukraine crisis could help repair its ties with NATO, even as it risks reprisals from Moscow.
But a buildup of Russian ships waiting to make the journey will test Ankara's resolve over the next few days and show how far it is willing to go in tilting its uniquely delicate diplomatic balance between east and west.
Turkey changed its rhetoric to call Moscow's assault on Ukraine a ""war"" on Sunday - a move that would allow Ankara to use parts of an international pact to limit the transit of some Russian warships from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea.
That could curb Moscow's ability to build up its naval force attacking Ukraine's Black Sea Coast, though it all depends on the small print in the 1936 Montreux Convention.
The pact allows Turkey to limit naval transit of its Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits during wartime but has a clause exempting ships returning to their registered base.
At least four Russian ships are currently waiting on Turkey's decision to cross from the Mediterranean, Yoruk Isik, an Istanbul-based geopolitical analyst and head of the Bosphorus Observer consultancy, said.
Two of them - a frigate and a destroyer - have formally asked to make the journey as soon as this week, according to Isik and a senior Turkish official. Any of them claiming the Black Sea as their base could still make the journey, leaving Turkey with some wriggle room.
""Calling it a 'war' is a very big step,"" Isik told Reuters. ""Ankara didn't want to take this step and, with the language, is giving Moscow one last chance to stem aggression in Ukrainian cities.""
HIGH STAKES
The stakes are high for NATO member Turkey which has maritime borders and good ties with both Russia and Ukraine
A decided shift to the West could burnish its standing within NATO after Turkey's 2019 purchase of Russian S-400 missiles soured relations and triggered U.S. sanctions. 
Yet, any step too far may harm Turkey's already beleaguered economy after a currency crisis in December and an inflationary spiral. 
Russian natural gas accounts for 45% of Turkish imports, while Russians account for 20% of Turkey's tourists. 
Atilla Yesilada of GlobalSource Partners said Turkey's shift over the conflict was ""almost certain to draw the Russian wrath,"" and that this would be seen with bans on Turkish agricultural exports or provocations in Syria.
A separate official with knowledge of the matter said Turkey's government planned to take steps to boost the economy now that fallout from the conflict is being felt ""more and more by the day"". The lira briefly tumbled 5% last week as the attacks - which Russia call a ""special operation"" - began.
Meanwhile, Turkey's politicians have kept their own rhetoric measured. 
President Tayyip Erdogan has criticised the Western approach to Moscow including the use of sanctions, while also taking a sharp tone towards Russia, calling the invasion ""unacceptable"" and a ""heavy blow"" to regional security.
While forging close ties with Russia on energy and defence, Ankara has sold drones to Ukraine and inked a deal to co-produce more, angering Moscow. 
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu appealed to Russian and Ukrainian counterparts for a ceasefire and negotiations, which Erdogan has offered to host. 

Cavusoglu said on Sunday that ships returning to base in the Black Sea will be permitted passage and evaluated on a case-by-case basis. 
When it came to establishing the ships' all-important home station, he added: ""Everything should be transparent.""

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - The day before Russia invaded Ukraine, Iryna Kyrychenko and her husband went to sleep thinking they would take their two young daughters to visit their grandmother the next day. 
Instead, they woke up in their house in Kyiv to sounds of missile explosions, hastily packed some clothes, and fled. 
First they went to friends in a village nearby, then to a city in western Ukraine, then across the Romanian border, leaving Kyrychenko’s husband, who at 38 is of conscription age, behind.
Three days later, Iryna Kyrychenko, a 37-year-old operations manager at a tech company, and her two daughters, Xenia, 11 and Alisa, 7, reached the Romanian capital Bucharest, miles removed from a life in Kyiv she describes as ""very simple, very nice"".
Nearly 400,000 people had fled into central Europe by Sunday, with queues at border crossings stretching back for kilometres.
""When we were driving, some rockets exploded near us,"" she said about their journey in the room she booked at a budget hotel near Bucharest's main railway station. 
""It was really dangerous ... the kids right now are scared of airplanes here and if somewhere in the street there is a big noise, they are scared.""
She said the 500-km (300-mile) drive from the village not far from Kyiv to the city of Chernivtsi in western Ukraine near the northern Romanian border crossing of Siret took them 14 hours as not all petrol stations had fuel. 
Kyrychenko's husband drove them as close to the border checkpoint as he could, but the long line of vehicles meant she and her daughters went the last 6 km (4 miles) on foot. 
After a two-hour wait, they crossed into Romania on Friday morning, where they were met by volunteers carrying food, hot drinks and offers of transport and lodging. 
""The kids were full of food, snacks, some fruit, water, toys also,"" she said as Xenia played on a tablet near her. The teddy bears volunteers had given them were resting on the windowsill next to the school supplies they brought with them from Kyiv.
Her voice crumbled as she recalled how ""the children were crying because they left their father"".
After resting for a few hours at a volunteer's house, Kyrychenko, who is Russian Ukrainian, pressed on to Bucharest, where she now spends frantic hours on Telegram channels looking at pictures of her devastated home town and news of civilian buildings being hit, including a children's hospital. 
She is also helping her company colleagues as they too cross borders and make their way to Bucharest and Warsaw. 
""It's very hard to cross the border now, when we were crossing there were maybe 100-200 people, but right now it's maybe 3,000. It's a crowd, everybody is nervous, no water, they stay all night on the street with the kids, it's cold weather.""

Kyrychenko's mother, brother, elderly grandparents and mother-in-law are still in Kyiv and unable to leave. She said she will stay in Bucharest for now but could later move to Lisbon where her employer has an office.
""We're scared about our husbands, our brothers and other men who stay here,"" she said. ""Life in Kyiv before was very simple, very nice, we can say anything we want, we can do everything we want. Kyiv is very beautiful, very ancient city, I'm scared that they destroy it. We don't know how to go back.""

BERLIN (Reuters) -Russian President Vladimir Putin has inadvertently achieved what Western allies have long struggled to: get Germany to step up to its role as a major global power with an assertive foreign policy backed by a strong military despite its World War guilt.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced on Sunday a dramatic hike in military spending in view of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in what is being heralded as a historic speech that marks a paradigm shift in German foreign and defence policy.
Scholz said Germany from now on would invest more than 2% of economic output on defence up from around 1.5 % currently, after years of resisting pleas from NATO allies to do so, and set up a 100-billion-euro ($112 billion) fund to re-equip the military.
He also outlined plans to reduce Germany's dependence on Russia for half its gas needs, fomenting hopes Berlin could consider geo-strategic concerns more in all its trade relations.
""Putin's war"" marked a break in German foreign policy, he said, adding ""the requirement is as much diplomacy as possible without being naive"".
""This historic speech marks a sea change in German foreign policy,"" said Thorsten Benner of the Global Public Policy Institute (GPPi). ""It's a starting point for a further fundamental re-think as part of Germany's National Security Strategy that will also have to include challenges posed by China seen in tandem with Russia.""
Germany has for decades faced criticism for not playing a role on the world stage commensurate with its size as Europe's largest economy and overlooking geo-strategic concerns in its pursuit of economic opportunities. 
That stance came under intense scrutiny throughout the Ukraine crisis, leading some commentators, especially in top security ally the United States, to call Germany the weak link in the NATO western military alliance.
Successive German governments supported the construction of the Nord Stream 2 Baltic pipeline to pump gas from Russia directly to Germany despite Western allies' concerns it would undermine the security of traditional transit country Ukraine.
Berlin also last week resisted calls to cut Russia off the SWIFT global payments system as part of a Western sanctions package, saying it would then struggle to pay for Russian gas.
In a 180 degree turnaround, Scholz last Tuesday suspended Nord Stream 2 and on Saturday agreed to cut Russia out of SWIFT and said Germany would build up its coal and gas reserves and quickly make good on long-stalled plans to built LNG terminals.
Most policy shifts came after on Friday ""it became more obvious what Putin had done, and that we have to leave the old ways,"" a highly-placed German government source told Reuters.
""Saturday was also the moment when we and others in the European Union realized we have to do something on SWIFT because it became such a symbol,"" the source said. 
WAKE-UP CALL
Germany's military had long pleaded for more equipment and the army chief vented his frustration over the long-running neglect of military readiness on LinkedIn on Thursday a few hours after Russia invaded Ukraine. 
German forces were drastically scaled down after the end of the Cold War - with the number of battle tanks drawn down from more than 3,500 in the 1980s to 225 in 2015.
Later the forces were trained mainly for missions such as in Afghanistan where the adversary was poorly equipped and not an armed force with the most modern weapons. 
Germany's new three-way coalition vowed when it took office in December to pursue a more values-based foreign policy reflecting growing anxiety over the rise in authoritarianism worldwide and threats posed by strategic rivals like China.
However the coalition - which includes the Greens, borne out of the pacifist movement of the 1960s, and fiscally hawkish Free Democrats - did not commit to increasing defence spending to back up a more assertive foreign policy.
It also came under fire in recent weeks for refusing to deliver weapons to Ukraine given a German taboo on exporting arms to conflict zones.
All that changed too this weekend.
On Saturday Scholz said Germany would supply Ukraine with 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger surface-to-air missiles from its military stocks.
On Sunday he announced a 100-billion-euro new fund - worth twice last year's annual defence budget - to modernize its military, including to buy armed drones and new fighter jets.
""It is clear that we need to invest significantly more in the security of our country in order to protect our freedom and our democracy,"" he told an emergency session of the Bundestag lower house of parliament.
""We need planes that fly, ships that sail, and soldiers who are optimally equipped for their missions.""
Terry Anderson, who served as the U.S. defence attache in Berlin from June 2015 through July 2018, said the Russian invasion was clearly a ""humongous wake-up call"".
""They put so much stock in talking. But you know diplomacy without teeth behind it is not going to be effective,"" he said.

Tyson Barker, head of Technology and Global Affairs at the German Council on Foreign Relations, said: Germany just became a normal power""

BEIJING (Reuters) -China is willing to work with the United States on a G7-led global infrastructure plan and welcomes Washington to join its Belt and Road Initiative, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Monday.
The Group of Seven (G7) richest democracies, consisting of United States and its allies, proposed the Build Back Better World (B3W) initiative in June to help developing countries meet infrastructure needs, as they sought to counter China's growing influence.
""We are also willing to consider coordinating with the U.S. 'Build Back Better World' initiative to provide the world with more high-quality public goods,"" Wang said in a video message at an event for the 50th anniversary of the Shanghai Communique, which marked the normalising of relations between United States and China.
He said China is also open to the United States participating in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the Global Development Initiative, a call by Chinese President Xi Jinping in September for all countries to work towards sustainable development.
G7's B3W initiative is seen as an alternative to rival China's BRI, which was launched by Xi in 2013. More than 100 countries have signed agreements with China to cooperate in BRI projects like railways, ports, highways and other infrastructure.
Wang urged Washington to work with China in Asia-Pacific to build a ""family of openness, inclusiveness, innovation, growth, connectivity and win-win cooperation"", rather than turn the region into one of conflict and confrontation.

The Shanghai Communique, a document which marked the end of isolation between both countries and issued during then U.S. President Richard Nixon's historic visit to China, meant that two major powers with different social systems were willing to coexist peacefully, he said.
Wang reiterated a call for the United States to stop supporting independence for Taiwan, a self-ruled island China claims as its own.

KYIV/MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin put Russia's nuclear deterrent on high alert on Sunday in the face of a barrage of Western reprisals for his war on Ukraine, which said it had repelled Russian ground forces attacking its biggest cities.
The United States said Putin was escalating the war with ""dangerous rhetoric"", amid signs that the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two was not producing rapid victories, but instead generating a far-reaching and concerted Western response.
Less than four days after it started, the invasion has triggered a Western political, strategic, economic and corporate response unprecedented in its extent and coordination.
""With this war on Ukraine, the world will never be the same again,"" EU's foreign policy chief Josef Borrell wrote in an opinion piece in the Guardian newspaper. 
""It is now, more than ever, the time for societies and alliances to come together to build our future on trust, justice and freedom. It is the moment to stand up and to speak out. Might does not make right. Never did. Never will,"" he said.
The 27-nation European Union on Sunday decided for the first time in its history to supply weapons to a country at war. A source told Reuters it would send 450 million euros ($507 million) of weaponry to Ukraine. Borrell at a news conference said EU's support would include providing fighter jets.
The European Union's chief executive Ursula von der Leyen expressed support for Ukraine's membership in an interview with Euronews, saying ""they are one of us."" Ukraine, a democratic nation of 44 million people, won independence from Moscow in 1991 at the fall of the Soviet Union and has pushed to join the NATO Western military alliance and the EU, goals Russia vehemently opposes.
The rouble plunged nearly 30% to an all-time low versus the dollar early on Monday, after Western nations on Saturday unveiled harsh sanctions including blocking some banks from the SWIFT international payments system. On Sunday, the president of neutral Switzerland said he expected his government to follow the EU with Russia sanctions and freezing Russian assets.
NEGOTIATIONS
The Ukrainian president's office said negotiations with Moscow without preconditions would be held at the Belarusian-Ukrainian border. Russian news agency Tass later on Sunday cited an unidentified source as saying the talks would start on Monday morning.
As missiles fell on Ukrainian cities, nearly 400,000 civilians, mainly women and children, have fled into neighbouring countries, a U.N. relief agency said. Hundreds were stranded in Kyiv on Sunday waiting for trains to take them west, away from the fighting.
The capital remained in Ukrainian government hands, with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy rallying his people daily despite Russian shelling of civilian infrastructure.
The EU shut all Russian planes out of its airspace, as did Canada, forcing Russian airline Aeroflot to cancel all flights to European destinations until further notice. With flight options dwindling, the United States and France urged their citizens to consider leaving Russia immediately.
The EU also banned the Russian media outlets RT and Sputnik. 
Germany, which had already frozen a planned undersea gas pipeline from Russia, said it would increase defence spending massively, casting off decades of reluctance to match its economic power with military clout.
British oil major BP (NYSE:BP) BP, the biggest foreign investor in Russia, said it was abandoning its stake in state oil company Rosneft at a cost of up to $25 billion, shrinking its oil and gas reserves in half.
Several European subsidiaries of Sberbank Russia, majority owned by the Russian government, were failing or were likely to fail due to reputational cost of the war in Ukraine, the European Central Bank, the lenders' supervisor, said.
'NOT DETERRENCE BUT THREAT'
At least 352 civilians, including 14 children, have been killed and 1,684 people have been wounded, Ukraine's Health Ministry said. 
Putin, who has called the invasion a ""special operation"", thrust an alarming new element into play when he ordered Russia's ""deterrence forces"" - which wield nuclear weapons - onto high alert.
He has justified the invasion by saying ""neo-Nazis"" rule Ukraine and threaten Russia's security - a charge Kyiv and Western governments say is baseless propaganda.
On Sunday, he cited aggressive statements by NATO leaders and the raft of economic sanctions imposed on Russia by the West.
""Not only do Western countries take unfriendly measures against our country in the economic dimension - I mean the illegal sanctions that everyone knows about very well - but also the top officials of leading NATO countries allow themselves to make aggressive statements with regards to our country,"" he said on state television. 
Putin previously referred to his nuclear arsenal in a speech announcing the start of the invasion on Thursday, saying Russia's response to any country that stood in its way would be immediate and carry ""consequences that you have never encountered in your history"".
The EU's Borrell said Russia had clearly threatened a nuclear attack on countries supporting Ukraine after the invasion. ""We are afraid that Russia is not going to stop in Ukraine,"" he said.
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield, at the U.N. Security Council, urged ""Russia to tone down this dangerous rhetoric regarding nuclear weapons.""
A U.S. defence official said Washington was trying to assess what Putin's announcement meant, but that it increased the danger from any miscalculation.
Moscow acknowledged that Russian soldiers had been killed and wounded, but said its losses were far lower than those suffered by Ukraine, the Interfax news agency reported. Moscow has not released casualty figures.
In New York, the U.N. Security Council convened a rare emergency meeting of the U.N. General Assembly, or all the United Nations' 193 member states, for Monday.
Rolling protests have been held around the world against the invasion, including in Russia, where almost 6,000 people have been detained at anti-war protests since Thursday, the OVD-Info protest monitor said. 
Tens of thousands of people across Europe marched in protest, including more than 100,000 in Berlin.
BATTLE FOR KHARKIV
A Ukrainian state news agency said that Russian troops had blown up a natural gas pipeline in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, sending a burning cloud into the sky. 
Soon after, Russian armour rolled into Kharkiv, in northwest Ukraine, and witnesses reported firing and explosions. But city authorities said the attack had been repelled.
Reuters was unable to corroborate the information. 
Ukrainian forces also appeared to be holding off Russian troops advancing on Kyiv but the Ukrainian armed forces described Sunday as ""a difficult time"", saying Russian troops ""continue shelling in almost all directions"".

Satellite imagery released by the private Maxar Technologies (NYSE:MAXR) taken on Sunday showed a 5 km (3.25 mile) long convoy of Russian ground forces including tanks approximately 40 miles (64 km) away heading towards Kyiv. Reuters could not independently verify the images.
""We have withstood and are successfully repelling enemy attacks. The fighting goes on,"" Zelenskiy said in the latest of several video messages from the streets of Kyiv.

GENEVA/SYDNEY (Reuters) - In a sea of blue and yellow flags and banners smeared with blood red handprints, protesters around the world showed support for Ukraine on Saturday and called on governments to do more to help Kyiv, punish Russia and avoid a broader conflict.
Several hundred people marched through heavy rain in Sydney chanting ""Ukraine will prevail"", while protesters in Tokyo called for Russia to be expelled from the United Nations Security Council for the assault on its neighbour.
Thousands of people also took to the streets in Europe, with protesters - including many Ukrainians living abroad - in London, Nicosia, Berlin, Athens, Helsinki, Madrid and Milan draping themselves in flags and holding ""stop the war"" placards.
A rally that organisers estimated to number 20,000 people was held in the Swiss capital of Bern. The Ukrainian flag flew over the seat of the city council. 
Around 1,000 people protested outside the Russian embassy in Romanian capital Bucharest, expressing anger at Russian President Vladimir Putin for what they saw as an unprovoked attack on Ukraine. They chanted ""Putin the assassin"".
An activist smeared an embassy sign with red handprints that were a feature at rallies in several countries. A protester threw eggs before riot police intervened.
""Somehow, together with everybody, with all the countries in Europe and ... all the world, we need to stop"" Putin, said Abramov Kiril, a 33-year-old Ukrainian living in Romania who said the EU and NATO should help more.
""If they will not stop him in Ukraine he will go forward,"" said Kiril, who still has grandparents in southern Ukraine.
Some called for the Swiss government to take tougher action against Russia and Putin, who said he ordered the ""special operation"" not to occupy territory but to destroy Ukraine's military capabilities and capture what the Kremlin regards as dangerous nationalists. 
Moscow says it is taking care not to hit civilian sites.
In Istanbul, Ukrainians living in Turkey sang their national anthem and held banners with images of bloody handprints. 
""My family is in Kyiv region and they are attacking Kyiv today. I don't know what to do, what to think. I am calling them every 10 to 15 minutes,"" a protester who gave her name as Victoria said.
'SAY NO'
Hundreds of people demonstrated in the square in front of the United Nations headquarters in Geneva, carrying signs such ""Make Ukraine a member of NATO now"" and ""Say no to Putin"".
""I'm here because I'm extremely ashamed for my country of birth,"" said Valery Bragar, a native Russian who has lived in Switzerland for 15 years and is now a Swiss citizen.
The protests come on the heels of other demonstrations around the world in the past days. In Latin America, protesters joined rallies on Friday in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Peru, chanting ""Long live Ukraine"".
In Russia too, anti-war campaigners have defied warnings from the authorities to voice their anger. Police on Thursday detained more than 1,600 Russian protesters.
Several hundred Russian, Ukrainian and Japanese protesters gathered in the busy Shibuya shopping district in central Tokyo, many with their children and holding Ukrainian flags, chanting ""stop the war"" and ""stop Putin"" in Japanese and English. 
""I just want to say, 'Putin stop this, regain your sanity',"" said Hiroshi Sawada, a 58-year-old musician.

In India, some of the anger was directed towards NATO and the West. 
""The kind of aggression we are witnessing in Ukraine has been forced by U.S. through NATO and also the Russian military forces who have entered Ukraine. Both are responsible for this situation,"" student activist Neha said at a protest in New Delhi.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Russia's attack on Ukraine, which China refuses to condemn or even call an invasion, has sent Beijing into a diplomatic scramble to limit blowback while standing by a partner with which it has grown increasingly close in opposition to the West.
China has repeatedly called for dialogue, with Foreign Minister Wang Yi telling senior European officials in a flurry of telephone calls on Friday that China respects countries' sovereignty, including Ukraine's, but that Russia's concerns about NATO's eastward expansion should be properly addressed.
After one call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, China said Putin was willing to engage in ""high-level"" dialogue with Ukraine and the Kremlin later said Putin was ready to send a delegation to Minsk for talks with representatives of Ukraine.
The diplomatic overture follows an invasion some diplomats in Beijing believe came as a surprise to China, which did not tell its citizens to leave Ukraine ahead of time and which had repeatedly accused the United States of hyping the threat of a Russian attack.
This week Beijing, which bristles at criticism of its stance on Ukraine, would not directly address whether Putin told China he was planning to invade, saying Russia as an independent power did not need China's consent.
China's foreign policy is based on non-interference in the affairs of other countries, and it has yet to recognise Russia's claim to the Crimea region of Ukraine after its 2014 invasion.
""Their first reaction of denying there was an invasion was surprising to us,"" said a Western diplomat in Beijing who declined to be identified, given the sensitivity of the matter.
""It is a total contradiction with their long-standing positions on sovereignty, territorial integrity, non-interference.""
INTO THE FRAY
Three weeks ago, Putin met Xi hours before the start of the Winter Olympics in Beijing and they signed a wide-ranging strategic partnership aimed at countering U.S. influence and said they would have ""no 'forbidden' areas of cooperation"".
The attack on Ukraine, which counts China as its largest trading partner with two-way commerce totalling $19 billion and with which it had cordial diplomatic ties, came days after the Olympics ended.
""My sense is that their initial instinct was to follow the 2014 post-annexation of Crimea playbook which worked quite well for them, where they managed to basically stay out of the fray and fade a little bit into the back,"" said Helena Legarda, lead analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, in Germany.
Legarda said there was more geopolitical competition now than in 2014 and more scrutiny of China.
""People are watching a lot more carefully, and that 'We're not going to take sides, and we're going to fade into the background', is no longer a viable option,"" she said.
TEST OF EUROPEAN TIES
Beijing's relations with the United States have been deteriorating for years, and its diplomatic support for Russia could accelerate a decline in ties with western Europe, China's biggest export market, some analysts say, though others believe China has preserved room for manoeuver.
""We understand Russia, but we also have our own consideration,"" said Yang Cheng, a professor at Shanghai International Studies University, one of those to express surprise at Russia's attack.
""But it wouldn't be the case whereby our relations with the West will not be impacted at all.""
Late on Friday in New York, China abstained from voting on a draft U.N. Security Council resolution that would have deplored Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
The abstention, seen as a win by Western countries, was secured after a two-hour delay for last minute negotiations by the United States and others to secure China's abstention, diplomats said.
Only last month, Xi marked 30 years of ties with Ukraine, hailing the ""deepening political mutual trust"" between them. Ukraine is a hub in the Belt and Road Initiative, a sprawling infrastructure and diplomatic undertaking that binds China closer with Europe.

The Ukraine crisis creates uncertainty for China during a year in which it craves stability, with Xi expected to secure an unprecedented third leadership term in the autumn.
""This is a very unfavourable situation that an unprepared China has been dragged into by Russia,"" said Wu Qiang, an independent Beijing-based political analyst.

""U.S. citizens should consider departing Russia immediately via commercial options still available,"" said a security alert dated Feb. 27 on the web site of U.S. embassy in Moscow.
It has asked U.S. citizens to have ""a contingency plan that does not rely on U.S. government assistance.""
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two, has unleashed a barrage of Western reprisals, with U.S. and European governments imposing sanctions on Russian banks and financial institutions.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has called the attack a ""special operation"" through which he aims to demilitarise Moscow's southern neighbor.
The State Department has kept its travel advisory for Russia at ""Level 4: Do Not Travel"". On Feb. 20, the U.S. embassy in Moscow had advised Americans in the country to have an evacuation plan, citing the threat of attacks in Moscow and along the Russian border with Ukraine.

SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korea fired what could be a ballistic missile on Sunday, military officials in South Korea and Japan said, in what would be the first test since the nuclear-armed country conducted a record number of launches in January. 
South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff reported that North Korea had fired a suspected ballistic missile toward the sea off its east coast from a location near Sunan, where Pyongyang's international airport is located. The airport has been the site of missile tests, including a pair of short-range ballistic missiles fired on Jan. 16.
The missile fired on Sunday flew to a maximum altitude of around 620 km (390 miles) and to a range of about 300 km (190 miles), the Joint Chiefs of Staff said.
Analysts said the flight data did not closely match earlier tests, and suggested it could be a medium-range ballistic missile fired on a ""lofted"" trajectory.
""There have been frequent launches since the start of the year, and North Korea is continuing to rapidly develop ballistic missile technology,"" Japan's Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said in a televised statement. North Korea was threatening the security of Japan, the region and the international community, Kishi said.
The United States condemned the latest launch and called on North Korea to cease destabilising acts, but said the test did not pose an immediate threat, the U.S. military's Indo-Pacific Command said.
The United States, Britain, France and three other U.N. Security Council members plan to raise the latest launch during a closed-door council meeting on Monday, diplomats said.
North Korea's previous test was on Jan. 30, when it fired a Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile.
The largest weapon test-fired since 2017, the Hwasong-12 was reported to have flown to an altitude of about 2,000 km (1,200 miles) and a range of about 800 km (500 miles). That capped a month of mostly short-range missile launches in January.
ELECTION LOOMING
Sunday's launch came less than two weeks ahead of South Korea's March 9 presidential election and amid fears by some in Seoul and Tokyo that North Korea may push ahead with missile development while international attention is focused on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
""This launch comes as the international community is responding to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and if North Korea is making use of that situation, it is something we cannot tolerate,"" Kishi said.
South Korea's National Security Council convened an emergency meeting to discuss the launch, which it called ""regrettable,"" according to a statement from the presidential Blue House.
""Launching a ballistic missile at a time when the world is making efforts to resolve the Ukraine war is never desirable for peace and stability in the world, the region and on the Korean Peninsula,"" the statement said.
The leading conservative candidate, Yoon Suk-Yeol, said last week that North Korea could see the Ukraine crisis as ""an opportunity for launching its own provocation."" 
Candidates and analysts have noted that even before the invasion North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was overseeing an increase in missile tests as talks with the United States and its allies remain stalled. 
""Putin's War shapes almost all geopolitics right now, and should factor somewhere in Kim's calculus - but even 'taking advantage of distraction' seems to presume too much, since (North Korea) was already testing aggressively before the war,"" John Delury, a professor at South Korea's Yonsei University, wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
OLYMPIC LULL IN TESTING
China's representative on the Korean Peninsula, Liu Xiaoming, said on Sunday he spoke by phone with his U.S. counterpart, Sung Kim, and urged the United States to address North Korea's legitimate and reasonable concerns with greater attention, so as to create conditions for restarting dialogue.
""I pointed out that, under current situation, relevant parties should be cautious in words and actions, avoid stimulating each other, so as to prevent escalation of tension on the Korean Peninsula,"" Liu said on Twitter, without specifying when the phone conversation took place and without mentioning the latest test. 
North Korea, which has close ties to China, did not test any missiles during this month's Beijing Olympics. The 2022 Winter Paralympics begin in Beijing on Friday.
Complaining of unrelenting ""hostile policies"" from the United States, North Korea has suggested it could resume testing its longer-range missiles or even nuclear weapons.
Pyongyang has an ambitious schedule of military modernisation, and the Kim government's strength and legitimacy have become tied to testing ever-better missiles, said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul.
""North Korea is not going to do anyone the favour of staying quiet while the world deals with Russia's aggression against Ukraine,"" Easley said.

The United States has said it is open to talks with North Korea without preconditions, but Pyongyang has so far rejected those overtures, calling them insincere.
North Korea's ballistic missile launches are banned by United Nations Security Council resolutions, which have imposed sanctions on the country over its missile and nuclear weapons programmes.

Under the 1936 Montreux Convention, Turkey has control over the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits that connect the Mediterranean and Black seas and can limit the passage of warships during wartime or if threatened. 
Balancing its Western commitments and close ties to Moscow, Ankara has said the Russian attack is unacceptable but until Sunday had not described the situation as a war. 
""On the fourth day of the Ukraine war, we repeat President (Tayyip) Erdogan's call for an immediate halt of Russian attacks and the start of ceasefire negotiations,"" presidential spokesperson Ibrahim Kalin said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
Fahrettin Altun, Turkey's communications director, said ""we are witnessing yet another war in our region"", and repeated Erdogan's offer to mediate 
Kyiv has appealed to Ankara to block any more Russian warships from passing toward the Black Sea, from which Moscow has launched one of its incursions on Ukraine's southern coast. 

But Turkey's foreign minister said on Friday that Russia had the right under Montreux to return ships to their home base, which could limit any Turkish policy shift.
Turkey has cultivated good ties with both Russia and Ukraine. Any step too far against Moscow could harm its heavy energy and commodity imports and its tourism sector at a time of domestic economic turmoil.

By James Pearson and Raphael Satter
LONDON (Reuters) - Internet connectivity in Ukraine has been affected by the Russian invasion, particularly in the southern and eastern parts of the country where fighting has been heaviest, internet monitors said on Saturday.
Russian forces captured the southeastern Ukrainian city of Melitopol on Saturday, Russia's Interfax news agency reported, as Moscow launched coordinated cruise missile and artillery strikes on several cities, including the capital Kyiv.
Connectivity to GigaTrans, Ukraine's main internet provider, dropped to below 20% of normal levels before returning to higher levels in the early hours of Friday morning, according to internet monitoring organisation NetBlocks.
""We currently observe national connectivity at 87% of ordinary levels, a figure that reflects service disruptions as well as population flight and the shuttering of homes and businesses since the morning of the 24th,"" Alp Toker, director of NetBlocks, told Reuters.
""While there is no nation-scale blackout, little is being heard from the worst affected regions, and for others there's an ever-present fear that connectivity could worsen at any moment, cutting off friends and family,"" Toker said.
The Monash IP Observatory in Australia said that so far only the Obolonskyi district of Kyiv and central parts of Kharkiv, in Ukraine's east, showed clear signs of internet failure. 
Other anomalies might simply be due to some people moving away from their computers, for example by leaving cities, said Simon Angus, an associate professor of economics who serves as the observatory's director. 
Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials released more information about an alleged Belarusian cyberespionage operation they said was targeting personal email accounts belonging to Kyiv's forces.

In a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post, Ukraine's Computer Emergency Response Team said the hackers were targeting not just Ukrainians but also Poles, Russians, and Belarusians as well - including several Belarusian media organisations.

KYIV (Reuters) - Western allies announced sweeping new sanctions against Moscow on Saturday, including kicking key Russian banks off the main global payments system, as a defiant President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukrainian forces were repelling Russian troops advancing on Kyiv.
Seeking to ratchet up economic punishment for Russian President Vladimir Putin over his invasion of Ukraine, the United States and its European partners also said they would impose restrictions on Russia's central bank to limit its ability to support the rouble and finance his war effort.
The announcement came as fighting continued across Ukraine. Reuters witnesses in Kyiv reported occasional blasts and gunfire in the city on Saturday evening, but it was not clear exactly where it was coming from. The capital and other cities have been pounded by Russian artillery and cruise missiles.
Putin launched what he called a special military operation on Thursday, ignoring weeks of Western warnings and saying the ""neo-Nazis"" ruling Ukraine threatened Russia's security - a charge Kyiv and Western governments say is baseless propaganda.
Russia's assault is the biggest on a European state since World War Two and threatens to upend the continent's post-Cold War order. 
A U.S. defence official said Ukraine's forces were putting up ""very determined resistance"" to the three-pronged Russian advance that has sent hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing westwards, clogging major highways and railway lines.
""As Russian forces unleash their assault on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, we are resolved to continue imposing costs on Russia that will further isolate Russia from the international financial system and our economies,"" the Western allies said as they escalated their punitive response.
""We will implement these measures within the coming days,"" according to a joint statement from the United States, France, Germany, Canada, Italy, Britain and the European Commission. 
After initially shying away from such a move largely because of concern about the impact on their own economies, the allies said they committed to ""ensuring that selected Russian banks are removed from the SWIFT messaging system."" They did not name the banks that would be expelled but an EU diplomat said some 70% of the Russian banking market would be affected.
The move - which the French finance minister had earlier called a ""financial nuclear weapon"" because of the damage it would inflict on the Russian economy - deals a blow to Russia's trade and makes it harder for its companies to do business.
SWIFT, or the ""Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication"", is a secure messaging network that facilitates rapid cross-border payments, making it a crucial mechanism for international trade.
Sanctions on Russia's central bank could limit Putin's use of his more than $630 billion in international reserves, widely seen as insulating Russia from some economic harm.
The new measures will prevent Russia from ""using its war chest,"" according to Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, the European Union's executive. 
'THE FIGHTING GOES ON'
Clay Lowery, executive vice president for the Institute of International Finance, said the new sanctions ""will most likely exacerbate ongoing bank runs and dollarization, causing a sharp sell-off, and a drain on reserves.""
But because Russia's large banks are deeply integrated into the global financial system, new sanctions imposed on them, such as cutting them off from SWIFT, could have a spillover effect, hurting trading partners in Europe and elsewhere.
Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmygal said in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post early on Sunday: ""Thanks to our friends ... for the commitment to remove several Russian banks from SWIFT.""
The Kremlin said its troops were advancing again ""in all directions"" after Putin ordered a pause on Friday. Ukraine's government said there had been no pause.
""We have withstood and are successfully repelling enemy attacks. The fighting goes on,"" Zelenskiy said in a video message from the streets of Kyiv posted on his social media.
The crisis has galvanised the NATO Western military alliance, which has announced a series of moves to reinforce its eastern flank. While NATO has said it will not deploy troops to Ukraine, a string of countries are sending military aid.
U.S. President Joe Biden approved the release of up to $350 million worth of weapons from U.S. stocks, while Germany, in a shift from its long-standing policy of not exporting weapons to war zones, said it would send anti-tank weapons and surface-to-air missiles. 
Amid a barrage of cyberattacks blamed on Moscow, Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said his government will create an ""IT army"" to fight back. Kyiv already has quietly called on its hacker underground to help against Russian forces, Reuters exclusively reported. 
Fedorov also called on Saturday on SpaceX billionaire Elon Musk to provide Ukraine with the company's Starlink satellite broadband service. Musk responded on Twitter: ""Starlink service is now active in Ukraine. More terminals en route.""
Ukraine, a democratic nation of 44 million people, won independence from Moscow in 1991 after the fall of the Soviet Union and wants to join NATO and the EU, goals Russia opposes.
Putin has said he must eliminate what he calls a serious threat to his country from its smaller neighbour, accusing it of genocide against Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine - something Kyiv and its Western allies reject as a lie. 
A Ukrainian presidential adviser said about 3,500 Russian soldiers had been killed or wounded. Western officials have also said intelligence showed Russia suffering higher casualties than expected and its advance slowing.
Russia has not released casualty figures and it was impossible to verify tolls or the precise picture on the ground.
""We know that (Russian forces) have not made the progress that they wanted to make, particularly in the north. They have been frustrated by what they have seen is a very determined resistance,"" the U.S. official said, without providing evidence.
Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko said there was no major Russian military presence in the capital but that saboteur groups were active. Klitschko, a former world heavyweight boxing champion, later told Germany's Bild tabloid the city was ""nearly encircled"".
Authorities have handed thousands of assault rifles to residents and told citizens to make petrol bombs.
At least 198 Ukrainians, including three children, have been killed and 1,115 people wounded so far, Interfax quoted Ukraine's Health Ministry as saying.
Interfax later cited the regional administration in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, saying 17 civilians had been killed and 73 wounded by Russian shelling.
Moscow says it is taking care not to hit civilian sites.
U.N. refugee chief Filippo Grandi said more than 150,000 Ukrainian refugees have crossed into neighbouring countries - half to Poland and many to Hungary, Moldova and Romania.
Russia's Defense Ministry said its forces had captured Melitopol, a city of 150,000 in southeastern Ukraine. Ukrainian officials did not comment and Britain cast doubt on the report.

If confirmed, it would be the first significant population centre the Russians have seized.
Several European countries, including Russia's Baltic neighbours Lithuania and Latvia, said they were closing their airspace to Russian airliners. Germany said it was preparing to follow suit.

(Reuters) - Ukrainian tennis star Dayana Yastremska has fled her native country amid a Russian invasion and is now safe in France, the 21-year-old said in a social media post on Saturday. 
Yastremska, who has won three WTA titles and been ranked as high as world number 21, said she left Odessa with her younger sister with help from their parents. 
""Tired, but my sister and I are safe!"" she posted on Saturday in an Instagram story, which showed their arrival in Romania en route to France. 
""Thank you France. Ukraine stay strong. We miss you Home, Mum and Dad."" 
On Friday an Instagram post from Yastremska showed her and her sister sitting on luggage and wearing matching pink sweatpants and hoodies.
""After spending two nights in the underground parking, my parents made a decision at any cost to send me and my little sister out of Ukraine!"" she said in the Friday post.
""Mom, Dad, we love you very much, take care of yourself!!! I love you my country! Ukrainians take care of your lives.""
Ukraine is a force in women's tennis. Three Ukrainians are in the WTA top 100 and seven are in the top 200. Elina Svitolina, who has also been outspoken in support for her country amid the invasion, is the highest ranked Ukrainian at world number 15.

Thousands of refugees fleeing the invasion poured across Ukraine's western borders on Saturday, the third day of fighting, with many hoping to enter Poland, Slovakia, Romania or Hungary.
Russia's assault is the biggest on a European state since World War Two and threatens to upend the continent's post-Cold War order.

The embassy announced the conversation in a tweet and an embassy official told Reuters the conversation took place at about 4 p.m. (1500 GMT) but could disclose no further details.
""The Holy Father expressed his most profound pain for the tragic events happening in our country,"" the embassy said in the tweet.
The Vatican confirmed the call and in his own tweet Zelenskiy said he thanked the pope ""for praying for peace in Ukraine and a ceasefire. The Ukrainian people feel the spiritual support of His Holiness.""
The conversation took place a day after the pope made a surprise visit to the Russian embassy to relay his concern over Russia's invasion of Ukraine to Moscow's ambassador, in an unprecedented departure from diplomatic protocol.

The Russian ambassador denied an Argentine media report that the pope, 85, had offered the Vatican's mediation.
Also on Friday, the pope called Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk, leader of Ukraine's Eastern-rite Catholics who has vowed not to leave Kyiv and who has opened up his cathedral's basement as a bomb shelter. Shevchuk's Rome office said the pope told the archbishop ""I will do everything I can"" to help.

The U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet said the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Ralph Johnson was conducting a ""routine"" transit through international waters.
""The ship's transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the United States' commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific,"" 7th Fleet spokesperson Nicholas Lingo said in a statement. ""The United States military flies, sails, and operates anywhere international law allows.""
The Eastern Theatre Command of China's People's Liberation Army monitored the passage, which a spokesperson in a statement called a ""provocative act.""
Taiwan's Defence Ministry said the ship sailed in a northerly direction through the Strait, that its forces had monitored its passage and observed nothing out of the ordinary.
Taiwan is currently in a heightened state of alert due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, nervous that China may try to take advantage of the situation to make a move on the island though the government has reported no unusual Chinese manoeuvres.
Last year, U.S. naval ships transited the Strait roughly monthly. Saturday's sailing was the first since November.
China claims democratically ruled Taiwan as its own territory and has mounted repeated air force missions into Taiwan's air defence identification zone (ADIZ) over the past two years, provoking anger in Taipei.
Taiwan's Defence Ministry said that on Saturday eight Chinese aircraft - six fighters and two anti-submarine aircraft - flew into its ADIZ, to the northeast of the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands at the top end of the South China Sea.

Beijing calls Taiwan the most sensitive and important issue in its relations with Washington.
Like most countries, the United States has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is its most important international backer and arms supplier.

KYIV (Reuters) - Soldiers picking through charred debris scattered near the smouldering remains of a truck and a few civilians taking fresh air before a curfew were among scarce signs of life in Ukraine's capital on Saturday, after a second night of artillery barrages.
Russian forces have been pounding the centuries-old capital Kyiv and other cities with cruise missiles and shells since the start of an invasion on Thursday morning.
Many shops were closed, including those selling food, and the streets were empty except for a odd car - a contrast to the columns of vehicles choking roads in recent days as tens of thousands of residents fled west - and a few pedestrians pulling suitcases.
""I was smart enough to stock food for at least a month, we have everything,"" said Serhiy, a middle aged man who said he started buying extra groceries for his family well before the violence broke out. 
""I did not trust politicians that this would end peacefully,"" Serhiy said, taking a walk before a curfew that kicked in at 5:00 p.m. 
Four heavily armed soldiers manned a checkpoint near a government building. Amid reports of Russian saboteur groups in the city, passengers in cars were required to keep their hands in the open and show identification papers without sudden moves, a Reuters team reported. 
A missile hit a residential building and shelling and gunfire was heard early on Saturday across the city that is home to around 3 million people and was previously extensively damaged during a Nazi German assault in 1941.
Soldiers near a Kyiv train station inspected the still smoking remains of a truck that appeared to have been carrying ammunition and had scattered burnt shrapnel across a highway. Other soldiers dug trenches. 
One elderly man inspected the twisted wooden frames of the windows of his house, the glass blown out. He said he was worried a nearby metro station would be targeted. Soldiers stopped residents from entering the metro system, which will now be used for shelter from the fighting rather than for transport. 
MILITIAS
In addition to the regular soldiers, on the outskirts of the city, men armed with assault rifles and wearing yellow arm bands could be seen preparing to fight as Russian forces approached.
Some wore civilian clothes and carried hunting rifles, others apparently from neighbourhood militias and other reservist groups had camouflage outfits and professional equipment. 

Further out of town, Ukrainians lined up at gasoline stations and bank ATMs, despite government-imposed limits on petrol sales and cash withdrawals.
In Koncha Zaspa, just south of Kyiv, people lined up to collect water from a public pump and to buy food in a local supermarket.

MEDYKA, Poland/BEREGSURANY, Hungary (Reuters) -Refugees fleeing Russia's invasion of Ukraine poured across its western borders on the third day of fighting on Saturday, with more than 100,000 reaching Poland so far, many making the final stretch of their journeys to safety on foot.
As Russian forces pounded Ukrainian cities including the capital Kyiv with artillery and cruise missiles, fearful families thronged European Union borders hoping to enter Poland, Slovakia, Romania and Hungary.
Ukrainians already safely in the European Union waited anxiously at the borders for relatives to join them.
""The most important thing is that people survive,"" said Katharina Asselborn, wiping away tears as she waited at the Polish border for her sister, aunt and her three children from their home in Odessa. 
""I don't know what will happen next. They lost their own house. It's so terrible. The last 30 kilometres to the border they went on foot.""
At the Hungarian border town of Beregsurany, 69-year-old Ilona Varga crossed into the European Union on foot, leaving behind her home, shop and hopes she might soon return.
""My kids are telling me to move over to Hungary for good, and they are right,"" Varga said. ""But it is so hard to leave everything behind, I was born here, I grew up here, I have my work here, everything ties me here.""
At the same border post, 58-year-old Nataliya Ableyeva brought a stranger's two children to safety after border guards prevented their fighting-age Ukrainian father from crossing.
""Their father simply handed over the two kids to me, and trusted me, giving me their passports to bring them over,"" she said. On the Hungarian side, the two children were reunited with their mother.
At Medyka in the south of Poland, some 85 km (50 miles) from Lviv in western Ukraine, thousands of Ukrainians waited for officials to process them as refugees. A group of women dragging suitcases with small children sitting on them shouted ""Glory to Ukraine"" as they passed.
The lines grew during the day at the crossing point. Refugees sifted through bags of clothes, blankets and toys and other supplies left by the side of the road. Locals left donations of food for anyone who needed it and set up tables with hot coffee while children handed out sweets. 
""I arrived today at 3 a.m. and I am waiting for my wife,"" Taras, 25, told Reuters on the Polish side. ""She called me from the Ukrainian side and there is a 30 kilometre queue of cars and people. She said she does not know when she will cross.""
MOTHERS AND CHILDREN
Russian President Vladimir Putin launched what he called a special military operation before dawn on Thursday. 
The Polish government has reserved 70,000 hospital beds for the war wounded and prepared a train to transport the injured from Ukraine. More train wagons been loaded with humanitarian supplies for the Lviv region.
""If necessary, the train will go to Mostyka (just across the border) to pick up the injured and then travel to Warsaw where the injured...will be transported to specialist hospitals,"" Polish Interior Minister Andrzej Adamczyk said.
Czech railways sent special trains that arrived early on Saturday at the Polish border carrying Ukrainians living in the Czech Republic to meet family members who had escaped the war.
In the Slovak border town Ubla, officials put refugees in a local gymnasium where foldout beds and air mattresses filled a basketball court. The government also announced it would give financial aid to anyone sheltering refugees. 
The country's interior ministry said over the past 24 hours, authorities processed 10,526 people at the Slovak-Ukraine border. Before the conflict, they averaged 1,444 people daily.
A local official said the crisis on the borders was worsening, with more people arriving on foot, without money or food. 
""Families are divided at Ukrainian side – men are returned back for fighting. Mothers with children are coming here,"" Kosice region chief Rastislav Trnka said.
In Romania, the Orthodox Church housed refugees at a 15th century monastery. 
Arriving in the Romanian town of Sighetu Marmatiei, Natalia Zheltukahina spoke in disbelief about the conflict she had fled. 

""It's surreal ... It's nothing connected to the real life that we used to have and it's devastating,"" she said.
""I'm calling my mom and she tells me that it's quiet right now but they were shooting like half an hour ago ... And what's happening in Kyiv, that's - I mean, I love Kyiv so much and I just can't watch the news.""

LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - The morning after Russian missiles rained down on Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy addressed the nation in his favourite style: the selfie video.
Unshaven, wearing a khaki jacket and flashing a smile, he told the nation that contrary to reports of him trying to flee, he was staying put in the capital. 
""Good morning to all Ukrainians! Lately there has been a lot of fake information online that I am calling on our army to lay down their arms and to evacuate. Listen. I am here,"" he said, in a video that received 3 million views on Instagram in an hour.
The setting was suitably eerie, with Zelenskiy standing in the morning light in front of the ""House with Chimeras"", an Art Nouveau landmark covered in otherworldly animal figures across the road from his presidential office in Kyiv. 
It has been an unlikely transformation for the 44-year-old, who was a comedian and actor with no political experience before he was elected as president in 2019 - except when he played a fictional president in a satirical TV series. 
At the beginning of the crisis, some Ukrainians on social media feared Zelenskiy was out of his depth against veteran Russian President Vladimir Putin, as Moscow massed troops on the border to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 
He had been criticised for taking public swipes at the United States and other friendly powers when he felt they were not being sufficiently supportive. 
But Zelenskiy's refusal to evacuate with Russian troops closing in on Kyiv and his calm presence in social media videos has won plaudits, even from self-described sceptics. 
""Whatever happens next, history will remember the simple physical courage Volodymyr Zelens’kyi displays in remaining in his capital, with his people, amidst a horrible invasion, knowing that he is its target,"" Timothy Snyder, a history professor specialising in Ukraine at Yale said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Olena Halushka, an activist at a well-known Ukrainian anti-corruption organisation, said on Twitter she had misjudged him. ""I couldn't imagine I'll be proud of him as the supreme commander. He is worthy of our incredible nation.""
THE PRESIDENT STAYS
Zelenskiy has been a prolific social media user throughout his time in politics, goading his rivals during the election campaign in 2019, snapping pictures and videos of himself at the gym, in his office or addressing the nation with instructions during the coronavirus pandemic.
Critics and political rivals have often sought to label him as a ""clown"" unsuited for high office.
Before 2019, he dressed up in buffoonish costumes on stage, performed song and dance acts and, as the fictional president on TV, drunkenly fell into a swimming pool after a meeting with the head of the International Monetary Fund. 
Now, he is posting videos trying to give reassurance.
In a previous selfie video, he stood on the street with his inner circle, showing them that his chief of staff, prime minister and closest advisers had also not left the capital.
His style stands in contrast with Putin, who has often kept even close officials on the other side of a long table during meetings during the coronavirus pandemic. 
Nassim Taleb, the best-selling author of the book ""The Black Swan"", compared Zelenskiy to the images that Putin has used in the past to project strength, including images of him riding bare-chested on horseback. 
""Putin the poseur on horseback is hiding in his remote bunker, while Zelenski, the former comedian, is risking his life on the frontline,"" he said.
On camera, Zelenskiy has spoken mainly in Ukrainian but also switched to Russian to address the Russian people, urging them to come out into the streets to protest the war.
Vyachslav Volodin, speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament, asserted on Saturday without evidence that Zelenskiy had fled to the western city of Lviv and that his self-recorded video appearances were in fact pre-recorded.

There was heavy fighting in several parts of the country on Saturday including clashes in the capital, and there have been media reports of Zelenskiy declining offers from foreign governments to be evacuated. 
Asked to comment on the reports, Zelenskiy's spokesman said: ""The president stays in Kyiv, the president stays with his people. No one will run away or drop weapons.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden on Friday nominated federal appellate judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to become the first Black woman to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, saying it was time for America's top judicial body to reflect ""the full talents and greatness of our nation.""
Biden picked Jackson, 51, for a lifetime job on the high court to succeed retiring liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, setting up a confirmation battle in the closely divided Senate. Jackson's nomination fulfills a campaign promise Biden made two years ago to the day to deliver the historic appointment. 
Biden appeared at the White House with Jackson and Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black person to hold that office after he chose her as his 2020 running mate. 
""For too long, our government, our courts haven't looked like America. I believe it's time that we have a court that reflects the full talents and greatness of our nation with a nominee of extraordinary qualifications,"" Biden said.
Biden called Jackson a ""proven consensus builder, an accomplished lawyer, a distinguished jurist,"" adding that he ""looked for someone like Justice Breyer who has a pragmatic understanding that the law must work for the American people.""
If confirmed, Jackson would join the liberal bloc on an increasingly assertive court that has a 6-3 conservative majority, including three justices appointed by Biden's Republican predecessor, Donald Trump.
Jackson paid tribute to Biden for ""discharging your constitutional duty in service of our democracy with all that is going on in the world today,"" apparently alluding to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
She thanked God ""for delivering me to this point in my professional journey. My life has been blessed beyond measure. And I do know that one can only come this far by faith.""
Jackson has served since last year on the influential U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit after eight years as a federal district judge in Washington and earlier working as a Supreme Court clerk for Breyer. Jackson would become the sixth woman to serve on the Supreme Court, which currently has three female justices. 
Biden noted Jackson's family ties, with both her parents being former public school teachers and two uncles and a brother having worked in law enforcement. Another uncle served a prison sentence for drug-related offenses.
Biden, who took office last year, is sagging in opinion polls, with 43% of U.S. adults approving of his job performance in a Reuters/Ipsos poll. Any political benefit for Biden with the historic nomination could be diluted by the Ukraine crisis.
As a White House hopeful in early 2020, Biden pledged to nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court at a time when his candidacy was in trouble. Support from Black voters subsequently helped hand him a victory in the South Carolina Democratic primary, propelling him to further victories that secured him his party's presidential nomination.
Biden's party needs Black voters, women and other key members of its political base to turn out for November midterm elections that could change the balance of power in Washington.
Democrats, which control the evenly split 100-seat Senate thanks to Harris's tie-breaking vote, could confirm Jackson with no Republican votes if they remain united. They hope to move the nomination on a timetable similar to the single month that Republicans used for Trump's third appointee, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in 2020. [nL1N2U62A6]
Biden urged the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is due to hold confirmation hearings, to move promptly. Democrat Dick Durbin, the committee's chairman, said it would ""begin immediately"" to move forward. A hearing date has not yet been announced.
Other contenders for the nomination included South Carolina-based federal judge J. Michelle Childs and California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger.
Former President Barack Obama, who first appointed Jackson to the federal judiciary in 2013 and considered her for a 2016 Supreme Court vacancy, called Biden's nominee ""an excellent choice,"" writing on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that she ""understands that the law isn't just about abstract theory. It's about people's lives.""
REPUBLICAN CRITICISM
Top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell called Jackson ""the favored choice of far-left dark-money groups that have spent years attacking the legitimacy and structure of the court itself."" McConnell previously signaled that if Republicans regain the Senate majority in the Nov. 8 midterm elections, he could block any further Biden Supreme Court nominees.
The Senate voted 53-44 last year to confirm Jackson after Biden nominated her to the D.C. Circuit - the third time it has voted to confirm her to a job. Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM), one of three Republicans who voted for Jackson last year, signaled a change of tune on Friday, saying her nomination showed ""the radical Left has won President Biden over yet again.""
At Jackson's confirmation hearing last year, Republicans questioned her on whether race plays a role in her approach to deciding cases. She said it did not. 
Democrats lack a working majority after Democratic Senator Ben Ray Lujan had a stroke. He is expected to recover in time to vote on Jackson. 
Jackson, who was raised in Miami and attended Harvard Law School, earlier in her career represented criminal defendants who could not afford a lawyer. She was part of a three-judge panel that ruled in December against Trump's bid to prevent White House records from being handed over to a congressional panel investigating last year's Capitol attack.

While Jackson would not change the court's ideological balance - she would be replacing a fellow liberal - her nomination enables Biden to refresh its liberal wing with a much younger jurist who could serve for decades. Jackson's nomination gives Biden a chance to shore up support among women, minorities and liberals ahead of the midterm elections. 
The Supreme Court will rule in the coming months in cases that could curb abortion rights and expand gun rights. If confirmed, Jackson would be on the court in its next term, when it is due to hear a case that could end affirmative action policies used by colleges and universities to increase the number of Black and Hispanic students.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russia vetoed a draft U.N. Security Council resolution on Friday that would have deplored Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, while China abstained from the vote - a move Western countries view as a win for showing Russia's international isolation.
The United Arab Emirates and India also abstained from the vote on the U.S.-drafted text. The remaining 11 council members voted in favor. The draft resolution is now expected to be taken up by the 193-member U.N. General Assembly.
""We are united behind Ukraine and its people, despite a reckless, irresponsible permanent member of the Security Council abusing its power to attack its neighbor and subvert the U.N. and our international system,"" U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said after Russia cast its veto.
Russia is a Security Council veto power, along with the United States, China, France and Britain.
China's abstention comes just weeks after Beijing and Moscow declared a ""no limits"" partnership, backing each other over standoffs on Ukraine and Taiwan with a promise to collaborate more against the West.
Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia thanked the Security Council members who did not support the draft, which he described as anti-Russian. 
""Your draft resolution is nothing other than yet another brutal, inhumane move in this Ukrainian chessboard,"" Nebenzia said after the vote. 
There was a rare round of applause in the Security Council chamber after Ukraine's U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya held a moment of silence during his statement to remember those killed. 
""I'm not surprised that Russia voted against. Russia is keen on continuing its Nazi-style course of action,"" he said.
'RUSSIA ISOLATED'
The U.N. vote was delayed two hours for last minute negotiations by the United States and others to win China's abstention, diplomats said. 
The council softened the language in its resolution to say it ""deplores"" Russia's ""aggression against Ukraine"" from ""condemns,"" while a reference to Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which deals with sanctions and authorization of force, was removed along with a reference to ""the president.""
Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine as the U.N. Security Council met in New York late on Wednesday to try and defuse weeks of mounting tensions.
""Make no mistake. Russia is isolated. It has no support for the invasion of Ukraine,"" Britain's U.N. Ambassador Barbara  Woodward  (NASDAQ:WWD) told the council after the vote.
The draft Security Council resolution demanded that Russia ""immediately cease its use of force against Ukraine"" and ""immediately, completely, and unconditionally withdraw  all of  its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.""
The draft also demanded that Russia reverse its recognition of two separatist states in eastern Ukraine as independent.
""It is a matter of regret that the path of diplomacy was given up. We must return to it. For all these reasons India has chosen to abstain on this resolution,"" India's U.N. Ambassador T.S. Tirumurti told the council.
UAE Ambassador Lana Nusseibeh said her country supported the draft resolution's emphasis on abiding by international law and the U.N. Charter and was committed to the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of all U.N. member states. 

Standing outside the Security Council chamber, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: ""We must never give up.""
""It is important to remember that the U.N. is not just the chamber behind me. It is tens of thousands of women and men around the world,"" he said. ""Standing, delivering, extending a lifeline of hope.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden's selection on Friday of Ketanji Brown Jackson as the first Black woman U.S. Supreme Court nominee immediately thrusts the federal appeals court judge into the center of America's debate over race.
Of the 115 people who have ever served on America's top judicial body, all but three have been white, only two have been Black and both of those were men. Biden and many leading fellow Democrats have sought to make the case that naming a Black woman is long overdue, but some leading Republicans have accused him of discrimination for refusing to consider any men or any non-Black women for the job. 
""If you're a white guy, tough luck. If you're a white woman, tough luck. You don't qualify,"" said Senator Ted Cruz, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee that is set to hold confirmation hearings for Jackson. Fellow Republican Senator Roger Wicker called Biden's promise to nominate a Black woman ""affirmative racial discrimination.""
During a White House appearance on Friday with Jackson, Biden noted that her parents grew up in the era of segregation ""but never gave up hope that their children would enjoy the true promise of America."" Biden called Jackson ""extremely qualified"" and also cited the need for ""a court that reflects the full talents and greatness of our nation."" 
Biden chose Jackson over two other leading candidates: Leondra Kruger, who serves on the California Supreme Court; and Michelle Childs, a South Carolina-based federal judge. 
Race has been a divisive issue for America since its founding, including the past enslavement of and legal discrimination against Black people. Divisions have persisted.
In a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted in October, about six in 10 Republican respondents said they agreed with a statement that white people were under attack in America. One in six Democrats agreed. About half of Republicans said U.S. minorities were treated fairly, compared to one in five Democrats.
Naming a Black woman to the court is a sign that America is making progress in addressing racism, said Fatima Goss Graves, chief executive of the National Women's Law Center.
""When the court starts its session next year, a Black woman will be seated for the first time,"" Graves said. ""Her presence will remind this country of the progress that is possible and will begin the job of shattering stereotypes that constrict Black women in leadership at all levels.""
The percentage of America's population that is white is continuing to decline, according to U.S. census figures. Counting everyone living in the United States, the population is 61.6% white, 18.7% Hispanic and 12.4% Black, with smaller percentages for other minority groups.
Debates over race have spilled over into the Supreme Court itself, with conservative justices expressing skepticism about policies to remedy past racial discrimination.
Race will loom large over the Supreme Court's next term, which begins in October. If confirmed by the Senate, Jackson would replace retiring liberal Justice Stephen Breyer and would participate in cases in which race is front and center. The current court, which has a 6-3 conservative minority, includes one Black justice, conservative Clarence Thomas.
One major case could end affirmative action policies used by colleges and universities in their admissions processes to increase their enrollment of Black and Hispanic students to achieve campus diversity. 
The justices will also decide Alabama's defense of a Republican-backed map of U.S. House of Representatives districts that a lower court found was drawn to minimize the clout of Black voters in the state. The eventual ruling could further weaken the landmark Voting Rights Act, enacted in 1965 during the tumult of the U.S. civil rights movement to protect minority voting rights that had been violently suppressed for years, especially in southern states like Alabama.
Biden's nominee has to be confirmed by the Senate, which is divided 50-50 between the two parties, by a simple majority vote. Democrats control the chamber because Vice President Kamala Harris can cast a tie-breaking vote.
'AN INSPIRATION'
For some Americans, the nomination carries profound meaning.
Kimberly Peeler-Allen, co-founder of Higher Heights for America, a group that promotes Black women in leadership, compared it to the appointment of Thurgood Marshall in 1967 as the first Black justice. Thomas was the second. 
""To see someone like you ... is an inspiration for millions of others,"" Peeler-Allen said.
Democratic U.S. congressman Jim Clyburn, who was instrumental in 2020 in convincing Biden to commit to naming a Black woman to the court, emphasized the message such an appointment would make. It would tell every child growing up in modest circumstances ""you've got just as much of a chance to benefit from the greatness of this country as everybody else,"" Clyburn told the CBS program ""Face the Nation.""
""That's the kind of conversation I had with candidate Biden way back when he was running for president,"" Clyburn added.
Harris, who serves as the first Black U.S. vice president after Biden picked her as his 2020 running mate, emphasized the importance of the court reflecting all viewpoints when rendering decisions.
""The idea that there would be a Black woman on the court is about ensuring that this court makes decisions in a way that reflect the experiences of all Americans,"" Harris told Telemundo.
Conversely, James Ho, a Republican-appointed judge serving on a New Orleans-based federal appeals court, gave a speech on Feb. 15 defending a legal scholar who had suggested in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post that Biden's Supreme Court nominee would be a ""lesser black woman."" 
Ho criticized the use of racial preferences in hiring, student admissions and judicial appointments, adding that the ""first step in fighting racial discrimination is to stop practicing it.""
Such reactions to Biden's pledge reflect growing differences between Democrats and Republicans on questions of civil rights, according to John Sides, an expert in U.S. politics and public opinion at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.
""Attacks on Biden's plan are consistent with a political landscape in which Democrats believe in taking affirmative steps to remedy racial inequality while Republicans see those steps as illegitimate,"" Sides said.
Racial tensions have simmered in the United States in recent years particularly in light of incidents such as the 2020 murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer and Donald Trump's 2017-2021 presidency when critics accused him of pursuing policies built around ""white grievance.""
Debates have flared around the country over initiatives to increase workplace racial diversity, racial sensitivity training and the teaching of U.S. history and race relations in public schools. Some parent groups and Republican legislators have accused public school boards of teaching ""critical race theory,"" an academic framework primarily used in law schools to analyze racism in U.S. law and institutions.
With the Senate confirmation process looming, attacks on Biden's nominee may carry risks for Republicans.

""Anybody we are talking about is likely to be qualified - and Republicans would understand that attacking in personal ways wouldn't be good for the party and wouldn't be helpful,"" said Gregg Nunziata, a former Republican Judiciary Committee staffer.
Nunziata noted that some Republicans already have used ""unfortunate phrasing that has reflected badly on them.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - David Collie, a Fort Worth, Texas, man whose bid to hold police liable for shooting him in the back and leaving him paralyzed was blocked by the legal doctrine known as qualified immunity, has died at age 38.
The cause of death has not been determined, according to the Tarrant County Medical Examiner's office, pending the outcome of an autopsy.
Paralyzed from the waist down after the 2016 shooting, Collie suffered from pressure wounds, infections, post-traumatic stress disorder and bouts of severe depression. His mother, Pamela McCloud, said his condition deteriorated in recent weeks as he nearly stopped eating and refused wound care and other treatments.
""David said, 'I'm tired, I can't go through it no more, I can't go through it no more.' He said that a lot,"" McCloud added.
Collie's shooting and subsequent lawsuit against the police were detailed in ""Shielded,"" a multipart Reuters series that revealed how qualified immunity, created 50 years ago by the U.S. Supreme Court, has made it increasingly difficult to hold police accountable when they kill or seriously injure people. The doctrine is meant to protect government employees from frivolous civil lawsuits.
The Reuters series, which won the 2021 Pulitzer Prize for explanatory reporting, has been cited often in calls to abolish or restrict qualified immunity after the May 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer and incidents like it prompted widespread demands for reform to reduce police violence against Black people.
Collie's violent 2016 encounter with police and his subsequent lawsuit paralleled other cases that have fueled protests for racial justice and policing reform in recent years. The outcome of Collie's case illustrated the core finding of the Reuters investigation that a series of Supreme Court rulings have turned qualified immunity into a nearly impenetrable legal shield for police who engage in violent behavior.
On a hot summer night, Collie, who was Black, was walking across the parking lot of his Fort Worth apartment complex to visit friends when police officers, who were searching for two Black suspects in a robbery involving tennis shoes, spotted him.
As the officers shouted commands at Collie, he continued to walk away, pulling his hand from his pocket to point, he later said, to where he was going. That was when officer Hugo Barron shot him in the back, puncturing one of his lungs and severing his spine.
Barron later said he thought Collie was reaching for a gun. Collie was carrying no gun and had nothing to do with the robbery.
Collie's paralysis cost him his job and derailed his plans to return to college. Barron was not disciplined or charged with any wrongdoing. In a federal lawsuit, Collie accused Barron of excessive force, a civil rights violation under the U.S. Constitution.

Barron said he was entitled to qualified immunity because the force he used was reasonable, given the threat he perceived in the moment. The federal district judge hearing the case agreed. A federal appellate court, in upholding the lower court's ruling, said Collie was ""in the wrong place at the wrong time."" Collie's case was finished.
The Fort Worth Police Department declined to comment on Collie's death. Barron still works as a patrol officer for the department.

(Reuters) - A Russia-based cybercrime group, known for using ransomware to extort millions of dollars from U.S. and European companies, vowed on Friday to attack enemies of the Kremlin if they respond to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
In a blog post, the Conti group said it was announcing its ""full support"" for the government of President Vladimir Putin. On Thursday, the Russian military invaded neighboring Ukraine from the north, east and south, in the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two. 
""If anybody will decide to organize a cyberattack or any war activities against Russia, we are going to use our all possible resources to strike back at the critical infrastructures of an enemy,"" the Conti blog post read. 
Ukraine has been hammered by digital intrusions and denial-of-service attacks both in the run-up to and during the Russian invasion. 
Reuters reported on Thursday that the Ukrainian government has called for volunteers from country's hacker underground to help protect critical infrastructure and cyber-spy on Russian troops.
""A portion of actors involved with Conti ransomware are based in Russia and some criminals operating from there already have documented ties with Russian intelligence apparatus,"" said Kimberly Goody, a director with U.S. cybersecurity company Mandiant. 
She said the Kremlin had benefited in the past from its relationships with cyber criminals, ""and even if not outright directed to take action, these actors could conduct 'patriotic' operations independently."" 
Brett Callow, a threat analyst at New Zealand-based cybersecurity company Emsisoft, noted that Conti has made ""big and outrageous"" claims before. But he recommended U.S. companies keep a close eye on their cyber defenses as cyberattacks in Ukraine could spill out abroad. 
First detected in 2019, Conti has since been blamed for ransomware attacks against numerous U.S. and European companies.

In those incidents, Conti hackers invaded networks and encrypted data, disrupting operations and demanding payment to restore access. Among the victims were a federal court in Louisiana and a New Mexico hospital, according to research https://blog.emsisoft.com/en/37866/ransomware-profile-conti by Emsisoft. 
In May, the FBI said Conti was responsible for attacks on 16 U.S. medical and first response networks, Reuters previously reported.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - After her mother and sister died within 30 days from heart disease, Stephanie Johnson made it her mission to fight against the killer often brought on by high blood pressure.
    Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and the No. 1 killer of Black women, with an annual toll of nearly 50,000, according to the American Heart Association (AHA).
Nearly half of Black women aged over 20 have heart disease, but most are unaware of the risks.
    Johnson created Release the Pressure (RTP), a coalition to raise awareness among Black women.
    ""African Americans, Black Americans are 30% more likely to die from heart disease than non-Hispanic whites,"" said Johnson, American Medical Association's vice president of communications and product strategies.
    ""High blood pressure increases the risk of heart disease because the heart is working harder,"" explained Dr. Peggy Roberts, founder and chief executive of Trust Women's Healthcare.
    Stroke, heart attack, aneurysm and heart arrhythmia are major risks. Stress from racism can raise blood pressure.
""On top of all the social stressors that we have to deal with being Black in America, it's too much,"" Johnson said.
    Nutritionist Coach Gessie Thompson, founder of TheDetoxNow.com, nearly died in 2020 after her blood pressure spiked from stress. She is providing digital heart health kits and helping with RTP's goal to send out 100,000 free validated blood pressure cuffs to Black women by 2027.
Home testing can be more accurate than in a doctor's office where nerves and other factors can skew a reading.
Despite years of headaches and multiple miscarriages, Nichola Hamilton, 38, only knew she had high blood pressure on her first visit with Dr. Roberts. She got a reading of 160 over 100. Less than 120 over 80 is considered normal but pressure above 130/80 requires focused treatment.
    ""It's really important that we have the information as a community to be able to advocate for ourselves,"" said Dr. Aletha Maybank, chief health equity officer and senior vice president of the American Medical Association.

After weeks of warnings from Western leaders, Russian President Vladimir Putin unleashed an invasion of Ukraine from the north, east and south on Thursday that was the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.
Weeks before the invasion, China and Russia announced a strategic partnership, and so far Beijing has stayed clear of condemning Moscow's actions.
Wang said the current situation in Ukraine was not something Beijing wished to see and that it would welcome direct dialogue between Russia and Ukraine as soon as possible. 
""China firmly advocates respecting and safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries,"" Wang said, according to a statement from China's Foreign Ministry. ""This equally applies to the Ukraine issue."" 
Wang held separate calls with British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, European Union foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell and a French presidential adviser.
""Given five consecutive rounds of NATO's eastward expansion, Russia's legitimate security demands should be taken seriously and properly addressed,"" Wang said, according to the statement.
The U.N. Security Council was expected to vote on Friday on a resolution condemning Moscow's invasion.

Russia is expected to veto the measure, and Wang said China historically had opposed Council resolutions that applied sanctions or the use of force. He said the Council should seek to ease tensions, ""not fuel them.""
U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday said any country that backed Russia's onslaught in Ukraine would be ""stained by association,"" and Washington has said Chinese firms will face consequences if they seek to help Moscow evade export controls imposed by Western countries.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is playing a secondary role to European nations as thousands of refugees flee Ukraine, providing emergency aid but signaling that Europe should be their primary destination.
As Russia invaded Ukraine this week, the United States dispatched disaster experts to the region to assess the need for humanitarian assistance and urged neighboring countries to keep their borders open to refugees.
President Joe Biden's administration last year launched a mass evacuation of vulnerable Afghans as the U.S. military withdrew from Afghanistan, but expects Europe to take the lead in helping Ukrainians on the ground.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Thursday that the United States was prepared to accept refugees but stressed that ""most, if not the majority"" of fleeing Ukrainians will want to go to Europe and that some countries neighboring Ukraine ""have expressed an openness to it.""
Tens of thousands of Ukrainians, mostly women and children, crossed into Poland, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia on Friday as Russian missiles pounded the capital Kyiv.
Ukrainians can travel to the European Union without a visa for up to 90 days, an immediate pathway to refuge, according to the Migration Policy Institute (MPI), a Washington-based think tank.
Political parties in both the United States and Europe have sparred over accepting refugees in recent years. 
U.S. Republicans have pushed for more immigration restrictions as they seek to take control of Congress in November elections.
The best outcome for displaced Ukrainians would be to return home safely, said Melanie Nezer, a spokesperson for HIAS, a resettlement agency formerly known as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. 
In the near term, refugee groups have urged the Biden administration to provide additional funding to Eastern European countries receiving Ukrainians and organizations in the region.
Up to 5 million people could flee, United Nations aid agencies said on Friday, adding that at least 100,000 people are already uprooted in the country and fuel, cash and medical supplies are running low.
Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has urged Biden to grant deportation relief and work permits to Ukrainians already in the United States through a program known as Temporary Protected Status (TPS).
Psaki said a decision would be made through a deliberative process involving multiple U.S. agencies and that she could not predict the outcome.

At St. Nicholas Cathedral School, a Ukrainian Catholic school in Chicago, principal Anna Cirilli said the school community is praying for peace, with many hoping that refugees can be supported in neighboring countries and can quickly return home.
""Most of the families want to stay in their own country,"" she said.

(Reuters) - The addition of Ketanji Brown Jackson will not change the grip that Harvard and Yale Law alumni hold on the U.S. Supreme Court.
President Joe Biden on Friday nominated Jackson, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 1996, to replace retiring Justice Stephen Breyer, another Harvard Law alumnus. If she is confirmed, eight of the nine sitting justices will be from Harvard or Yale Law - four from each school.
Harvard and Yale’s dominance has prompted handwringing for years. 
Both Representative Jim Clyburn, a Democrat, and Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM), a Republican who sits on the Judiciary Committee, said before Jackson’s nomination that Biden should pick someone without an Ivy League pedigree.
“Everybody doesn’t have to be from Harvard and Yale,” Graham said last month on the CBS “Face the Nation” program. 
Amy Coney Barrett, a 1997 graduate of the University of Notre Dame Law School, is the sole sitting justice without a law degree from Harvard or Yale. Barrett was appointed by former President Donald Trump after the 2020 death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who transferred from Harvard to Columbia in her final year of law school.
University of Tennessee law professor Benjamin Barton, a Supreme Court expert, said the concentration of Harvard and Yale law graduates creates a bench that's out of touch with the country.
""It's not a track where you get broad life experience,"" he said.
It is also a relatively recent phenomenon. Between 1902 and 1950, about 16% of confirmed justices came from Harvard or Yale Law, according to an analysis by Patrick Glen of Georgetown Law. That percentage steadily increased until the 1986 confirmation of Harvard Law graduate Antonin Scalia, after which only Ginsburg and Barrett joined the court without either Yale or Harvard diplomas. 

Glen points to the failed 2005 nomination of Harriet Miers as a possible factor. She was criticized for her law degree from much lower-ranked Southern Methodist University, among other perceived shortcomings. 
“A president may believe he will have an easier time selling a nominee from Harvard or Yale based on the cultural renown that both schools share,” Glen wrote.

MEDYKA, Poland/SIGHETU MARMATIEI, Romania (Reuters) -Tens of thousands of Ukrainians, mostly women and children, crossed into Poland, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia on Friday as Russian missiles pounded the capital Kyiv and men of fighting age were told to remain.
Many waited for hours in freezing conditions to leave Ukraine after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion, with lines of cars snaking for several kilometres towards some border crossings.
In Poland, which has the region's largest Ukrainian community of about 1 million people, authorities said wait times to cross the border ranged from 6 to 12 hours in some places.
At Medyka in the south of Poland, some 85 km (50 miles) from Lviv in western Ukraine, roads were packed with cars, police directing traffic, and people hugging loved ones after they arrived on the Polish side. An internet map site showed a third of the way congested with heavy traffic at one point on Friday.
""It is only women and children (coming through) because for men it is forbidden. We leave all our fathers, men, husbands at home and it feels like shit,"" said Ludmila, 30. When asked if she was worried about her husband, Ludmila broke down in tears.
Ukrainian rules restrict men aged 18-60, who could be conscripted, from crossing the borders.
Marta Buach, 30, from Lviv, said her husband was not allowed to cross with her at Medyka. ""In Lviv it is ok but in other cities it is really a catastrophe. Kyiv was shelled, other small cities were shelled, we were hearing bombing everywhere,"" she said.
U.N. aid agencies say the war could drive up to 5 million people to flee abroad, with up to 3 million heading to Poland alone. They said fuel, cash and medical supplies were running low in parts of Ukraine.
At least 100,000 people are already uprooted in Ukraine after fleeing their homes since Russia launched its attacks, the U.N. refugee agency said. 
European Union interior ministers will discuss the fallout of the crisis on Sunday. Germany has already said the bloc will accept anyone escaping the violence.
""We need to do everything to accept without delay the people who are now fleeing the bombs, the tanks,"" Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters as she arrived for a separate meeting with her EU counterparts in Brussels. 
Border authorities said 35,000 people had entered Poland from Ukraine since Thursday, while in Romania, roughly 19,000 Ukrainians had arrived in two days.
Poland's deputy interior minister Paweł Szefernaker said Ukrainian bus drivers were unable to drive across the border as conscription-age men were being held back.
Michał Mielniczuk, a spokesman for the southern Polish region of Podkarpackie, said temporary accommodation was being offered to people arriving.
""The vast majority continue on to other places throughout Poland after receiving a warm meal,"" he told the PAP news agency.
BLOOD DONATIONS, MEALS
On the border with northern Romania, women were crying as they bid goodbye to male loved ones, setting off to cross into Sighetu Marmatiei, a remote town on the banks of the Tisa river, a Reuters witness said. 
Long queues had formed as cars waited to board a ferry over the Danube river into Isaccea, a town between Moldova and the Black Sea, local media in Romania showed.
Slovak authorities urged people to donate blood and set up hospitals with 5,380 beds assigned for the army or NATO use.
Across central Europe, on NATO's eastern flank, volunteers were putting up messages on social media to organise housing and transport for people arriving from the borders.
Activists were setting up food and hot drink distribution points and vets were offering to take care of pets.
Authorities in Poland and Romania lifted pandemic quarantine rules for those arriving from outside the EU and, from Friday, Ukrainians could get COVID-19 vaccinations in Poland.

Hungary said it would open a humanitarian corridor for citizens from third-party countries like Iran or India fleeing Ukraine, letting them in without visas and taking them to the nearest airport at Debrecen. 
Bulgaria started issuing passports to its citizens in Kyiv who needed travel documents and had sent four buses to the Ukrainian capital to evacuate people. Some 250,000 ethnic Bulgarians live in Ukraine.

""If anyone would like to stay there I can share the keys. There is cold running water and electricity."" 
Another Facebook group, 'Aid to Ukraine' has gained close to 104,000 members since it was set up by Polish entrepreneur Marta Lisowska a day earlier.
Lisowska told Reuters her mother's death had prompted her to help people, and she soon hoped to welcome refugees into her old flat in Gdansk, on the Baltic coast.
Her friend Witold Wodzynski, who helps manage the group along with his wife Sylwia, said Ukrainians had been positively surprised that so many Polish people wanted to help.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives committee investigating former President Donald Trump's removal of classified documents from the White House has expanded its probe of the Republican's handling of records, according to a letter made public on Friday.
Representative Carolyn Maloney, the Democratic chair of the House Oversight Committee, wrote to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) asking for more information about what she described as ""what appear to be the largest-scale violations of the presidential records act since its enactment.""
In a letter to David Ferriero, archivist of the United States, Maloney asked that NARA provide by March 10 information including a detailed description of the contents of boxes recovered from Trump's Florida home. She also demanded information about any records transferred that Trump had destroyed or attempted to destroy, after reports that aides had discovered documents in a White House toilet during his presidency.
The letter, dated Feb. 24, also asked NARA to provide by March 17 documents and communications related to the use of personal messaging accounts for official business by officials in the Trump administration.
The National Archives had confirmed in a letter to Maloney last week that it had found classified materials in the boxes Trump took with him to Florida. It said in an emailed statement on Friday that it had received the letter and would respond appropriately, including in accordance with the Presidential Records Act.
Maloney’s committee has been looking into the handling of records by Trump, who left office in January 2021. Trump has denied wrongdoing since it was discovered that he had brought 15 boxes of presidential documents to his home in Florida, rather than handing them over to the National Archives, as required by law.
""The American people deserve to know the extent of what former President Trump did to hide and destroy federal records and make sure these abuses do not happen again,"" Maloney said in a statement.
The U.S. Presidential Records Act requires the preservation of memos, letters, notes, emails, faxes and other written communications related to a president's official duties.

The Washington Post first reported this month that some of the documents taken to Trump's home and subsequently returned to the Archives were marked as classified, which could intensify the legal pressure Trump or his aides could face.
The U.S. Justice Department has not announced whether it has opened an investigation.

BRUSSELS/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's invasion of Ukraine looks designed to take Kyiv and create a land corridor south to the Black Sea, splitting the country into two, military analysts and former officials said, echoing the view of Ukraine's generals.
President Vladimir Putin may still seek some form of control over the entire country, they said, as he strives to stop Ukraine ever joining NATO. He is also not guaranteed victory. A senior U.S. defence official said on Friday that Russia was facing more resistance than it expected, not least in its advance on Kyiv.
The tactics of the advancing Russian troops point to a ""flanking movement"" from Ukraine's weakest points - its northern border with Belarus, and in the south Crimea, which Russian annexed eight years ago, with its huge naval base.
Such a strategy, if successful, could allow Moscow to control eastern Ukraine including its seaboard directly while reducing western Ukraine to a vassal state, and in turn reduce the financial costs of a long-term occupation, experts say.
""I think that now they (the Russians) are aiming at creating a land bridge all the way to Moldova,"" said Konrad Muzyka, director of the Poland-based Rochan consultancy.
Russian tanks and forces began their invasion on Thursday through the eastern Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, and from the south in Tavriya, while missile strikes and bombing from Belarus began an advance towards Kyiv from the north, according to the Ukrainian military.
According to a Ukrainian defence ministry broadcast posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Thursday, military movements so far suggest that the Kremlin's goal is to ""block Kyiv, create a land corridor to the occupied Crimean peninsula and self-proclaimed Transnistria"". 
In 2014, Russia not only seized Crimea but also backed rebels who set up separatist administrations in Donetsk and Luhansk, in the largely Russian-speaking Donbass region of eastern Ukraine.
It also has troops in Transnistria, a Russian-speaking breakaway province of Moldova.
Joerg Forbrig, at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin, said Russian troops could ""try to gain control of a very large part of Ukraine, which will include those territories that would make a land corridor between the between the three territories they control already"".
'UKRAINIANS WOULD RESIST'
Ukraine's armed forces have so far denied Putin a rapid advance on Kyiv. ""As long as the Russians don't have control of the airspace, they won't be able really to make their armoured thrust into Ukraine count,"" said Jamie Shea, a former NATO official now at the Friends of Europe think-tank.
Russian missiles pounded Kyiv on Friday. Moscow claimed to have captured the Hostomel airfield northwest of the capital, a potential staging post for an assault on Kyiv. 
U.S. officials believe Russia's initial aim is to topple Ukraine's pro-Western president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
""Putin doesn't want Donbass or Donetsk – he wants all of Ukraine, but he does not have to occupy the entire country to reach that goal. He will aim to decapitate the Ukrainian state,"" said retired German general Hans-Lothar Domroese.
Defence experts pointed to the huge expense for Russia of a military campaign in Ukraine, a former Soviet state of 44 million people slightly smaller than Texas.
""The Soviet Union spent so much money having its troops in eastern Europe, and they were they were willing participants as communist regimes. Ukrainians would resist any Russian government,"" said Elisabeth Braw at the American Enterprise Institute think tank in Washington.
It is also unclear how a protracted war with many Russian casualties would be perceived at home, even when Putin does not tolerate dissent. Police detained more than 1,800 anti-war protesters across Russia on Thursday.
Putin could seek an arrangement for western Ukraine - where most people speak Ukrainian rather than Russian as their first language - similar to the one Moscow has with Belarus, where Russia has helped long-time president Alexander Lukashenko suppress opposition and dissent.
Carlo Masala, professor for International Politics at Bundeswehr University Munich, said Russia had so far not tried to send troops to western Ukraine in numbers. 

""The Russian military build-up, no matter if it is 160,000 or 200,000 troops, is not enough to occupy Ukraine for any long period of time,"" he said.

Serbia, led by Vucic, is performing a delicate balancing act between its European aspirations, partnership with NATO and its centuries-old religious, ethnic and political alliance with Russia. 
But as tensions between Russia and the European Union over Ukraine are rising, Serbia is under pressure to harmonise its foreign policy with that of the EU, which it aims to join, and introduce sanctions against Moscow, among other things. 
""They (Russia) were the only country not to have imposed sanctions against us in the 1990s,"" Vucic said after a National Security Council meeting. 
""They also supported our territorial integrity in the United Nations. We must not forget that,"" Vucic said, referring to Russia's stance on Serbia's former province of Kosovo whose independence Moscow refuses to recognise. 
However, Vucic said the National Security Council concluded the Republic of Serbia considers ""very wrong the violation of territorial integrity of a number of countries including Ukraine."" 
Serbia has put its gas and oil sectors in Russia's hands.
In 2008 the Balkan country sold a majority stake of its oil company to Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) Neft. Gazprom is the majority stakeholder in the country's sole gas storage facility. 
In return, Russia has been blocking membership of Serbia's former province Kosovo in the United Nations. 
Serbia lost control of Kosovo after a NATO bombing campaign in 1999 to halt killing of ethnic Albanians by Serb forces during a two-year counterinsurgency. 

Vucic said the National Security Council decided that Serbia will stop all military drills with foreign troops to preserve military neutrality. 
He said Serbia will take legal action against its citizens who fight abroad.

The Federal Intelligence Service (BND) confirmed that Bruno Kahl had been in Ukraine on Wednesday for ""urgent talks"" but had to change his departure plans after the invasion began.
""Because of the outbreak of hostilities and the closure of Ukraine's airspace, the President had taken the land route back,"" the BND said in a statement on Friday, which did not mention the part special forces had allegedly played.
""This was a difficult and lengthy journey because of the streams of refugees going in the same direction. He is back in the European Union and is expected in Berlin today.""

Bild newspaper quoted sources as saying that Kahl had been in Ukraine to pass on important information in person. Kahl, a former politician rather than a career secret agent, had missed an earlier evacuation of German diplomats. He was now in Poland.
Massive flows of refugees fleeing the advancing Russian army have resulted in queues of many hours at Ukraine's borders with its western neighbours.

262,"<span>Feb 25, 2022 12:13PM ET</span>",,,,,,"KABUL (Reuters) - As students return to universities across Afghanistan this month, law major Waheeda Bayat will not be among them.
The 24-year-old was looking forward to resuming her course at the private Gawharshad University in Kabul, but amid an economic collapse that has dragged millions of Afghans into poverty, she cannot afford to go back.
""I'm so happy to see my university,"" she said, walking past her old campus on a recent sunny day.
""But I wish I could continue my studies, wish I could spend time with my classmates and teachers, and wish I could go to the library to study.""
Although the hardline Islamist Taliban are allowing women back into colleges - girls and women were banned from education the last time they ruled - Bayat must focus instead on providing food and shelter for her family of nine.
An abrupt halt to most aid to Afghanistan after the Taliban seized power in August has plunged the country into crisis.
Kabul parks have become shanty towns as people from rural areas seek aid; malnourished newborns fill hospital wards; up to 97 percent of Afghans could be living below the poverty line by the second half of 2022, the U.N.'s development agency has said.
The impact on women has been disproportionately large.
Data show women have lost jobs at a higher rate than men in recent months - some were thrown out of work due to Taliban restrictions in the immediate aftermath of their conquest - and some rights won over 20 years of Western-backed governments have been reversed.
Bayat used to fund her studies from her job at a local media network, where she earned 12,000 Afghanis ($132) a month.
But after she and her mother lost their jobs, Bayat manages only 8,000 Afghanis making traditional clothes with her sisters - money that must stretch to support the whole family.
""We are worried that Waheeda can't continue her studies,"" her mother, Marzia, told Reuters in their three-bedroom home in the west of the capital. ""She is a hard-working girl. I wish I could find some money so that (she) could continue.""
The Higher Education Ministry did not respond to questions about the impact of the economic crisis on women's studies and what restrictions, if any, would be imposed on female students as they returned to class.
WOMEN HIT HARD
There are no official figures to show how many Afghans - men or women - have abandoned college due to economic pressures. Among women, the rate of attrition appears to be high.
Reuters spoke to 15 female university students around the country including in Kabul, Herat in the west and Nangarhar and Laghman in the east, eight of whom said they were dropping out due to financial difficulties.
Three more said they faced challenges, forcing them to cut class times and to consider leaving.
""The humanitarian crisis is a women's rights crisis,"" said Heather Barr, associate women's rights director at Human Rights Watch. ""Women and girls have been disproportionately affected by the economic crisis.""
She said that both the Taliban's treatment of women and the international community's failure to address the economic crisis were to blame.
For some students, the relatives who once supported their education are no longer able to.
""I wanted to serve my people ... but now I cannot continue,"" said Mahtab, a psychology student in Herat, who gave only her first name out of concern for her family's safety.
Her older sister once funded her studies, she said, but she lost her job in the communications department of the ousted president's office.
When she was recognised by the Taliban as having taken part in women's protests after they stormed back to power, the sister decided to flee the country for fear of reprisals.
The United Nations and some governments have raised alarm over reprisals against women's rights activists, including the disappearance of several in recent months. The Taliban have said they are investigating the disappearances. 
Some women planning to return to classes at public institutions, which re-open in Kabul on Saturday having resumed on Feb. 2 in other regions, worry that men and women will be segregated, subject choices limited and burqas made compulsory.
In some parts of the country, where universities have already reopened, such practices were already in place, reflecting the more conservative norms of the area.
In others, including relatively liberal centres like Kabul and Herat, there is still uncertainty over rules for women in class and on campus.
""If the Taliban force me to wear a burqa, I would rather stay home than go to university,"" said 20-year-old psychology student and Kabul resident Anahita.
TURNING BACK TIME
The expansion of women's rights, particularly in urban areas, was held up as one of the main achievements of Western military and financial intervention in Afghanistan after the U.S.-led war that toppled the last Taliban government in 2001.
Until then, in addition to the education ban, almost all jobs were off limits to women and they could only leave home when accompanied by a male relative and wearing an all-enveloping burqa.
Significant investment in girls' schools and targeted measures at universities such as reserving seats for women in law and engineering, female dormitories and child care centres, saw thousands of women pursue degrees.
Female enrolment was around 24% of the total signed up at public universities in 2020, according to figures from the World Bank-funded Higher Education Development Program, roughly 21,000 women. Many more study at private institutes.
Sanctions on some senior Taliban members, alongside concerns over human rights and the lack of inclusivity in the government, have effectively cut it off from international funding and from billions of dollars of Afghan central bank reserves held abroad.
The Taliban has described Washington's plans for the $7 billion in assets frozen on U.S. soil as an ""injustice"" to the Afghan people.
The United Nation's development agency predicts that Afghanistan's annual per capita income could fall to $350 in 2022 from $508 in 2020.
Some data show the crisis hitting women hard. Afghan female employment levels slumped by an estimated 16% in the third quarter of 2021, according to an International Labour Organization report, compared with 6% for men.
Bleak job prospects are a concern for many female university students.
Economy Ministry spokesman Abdulrahman Habib said the suspension of foreign aid to Afghanistan had hit funding for organisations supporting women, leading to job losses.
""The ministry of economy has prepared a policy that supports businesswomen,"" he said. ""We will do our best to provide all ... they need to encourage them and support them in restarting their activities and businesses.""
He added that there were women working for the Taliban government without problems.
Roma Gul, a third-year political studies student in the eastern province of Nangarhar, faces daunting odds to complete her course.
Her part-time teaching job barely covers the 3,000 Afghanis in monthly transport fees she has to pay to get between home, work and campus. It left only 1,000 Afghanis a month to for books, stationery and contributions to her family's rent.

Her job finishes at 1 p.m. each day, meaning she has to rush to campus to get to the last two hours of class, after missing the morning session. But she is still grateful university has re-opened.
""I am determined to finish school despite the problems,"" she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Ketanji Brown Jackson, the federal appeals court judge picked by President Joe Biden https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-announce-us-supreme-court-pick-friday-white-house-sources-2022-02-25 to become the first Black woman on the U.S. Supreme Court, brings a diverse set of experiences to the bench, including a stint representing low-income criminal defendants.
Jackson, 51, served early in her career as a Supreme Court clerk for Justice Stephen Breyer, whose retirement https://www.reuters.com/world/us/liberal-us-supreme-court-justice-stephen-breyer-retire-media-reports-2022-01-26 announced in January created a vacancy on the nation's top judicial body. Biden last year appointed Jackson to an influential Washington-based appellate court after she served eight years as a federal district judge.
As a member of the federal judiciary, Jackson has earned respect from liberals and conservatives alike and is well-connected in Washington's legal community. Progressives favored her nomination over the other leading candidates: South Carolina-based U.S. District Court judge J. Michelle Childs and California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger. 
The Senate voted 53-44 last year to confirm Jackson as a member https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/jackson-ketanji-brown of the U.S. Court of the Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where she has authored two majority opinions including one favoring public sector unions that challenged a regulation issued under Republican former President Donald Trump that restricted their bargaining power.
She was part of a three-judge panel that ruled in December against Trump's bid to prevent White House records from being handed over to a congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack by a mob of his supporters. The Supreme Court subsequently declined https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-spurns-trump-bid-keep-capitol-attack-records-secret-2022-01-19 to block that decision. 
Jackson also was part of a three-judge panel that refused last August to block the Biden administration's COVID-19 pandemic-related residential eviction moratorium, a decision later overturned by the Supreme Court.
Catherine Stetson, a Washington lawyer who has appeared before Jackson in court many times, said the nominee has all the qualities of a good judge: ""She is practical and intuitive and curious and courteous and always impeccably prepared.""
'PRESIDENTS ARE NOT KINGS'
The Senate confirmed Jackson in 2013 after Democratic former President Barack Obama nominated her as a Washington-based federal district judge. In one of the high-profile cases she handled in that role, Jackson ruled that Trump's former chief White House lawyer, Donald McGahn, had to comply with a congressional subpoena for testimony about potential Trump obstruction of a special counsel investigation.
""The primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that Presidents are not kings,"" Jackson wrote. 
The ruling was appealed and, after Biden took office, a settlement was reached. McGahn testified behind closed doors. 
Jackson in 2019 blocked Trump's plan to expedite removal of certain immigrants and in 2018 ruled against his administration's proposal to make it easier to fire federal employees - decisions later reversed by the D.C. Circuit.
Biden pledged during the 2020 presidential campaign to appoint a Black woman to the Supreme Court. It has had only two Black justices, both men: Clarence Thomas, appointed in 1991 and still serving, and Thurgood Marshall, who retired in 1991 and died in 1993. 
During her April 2021 confirmation hearing for her current job, Jackson said her background, both personal and professional, would ""bring value"" to the bench, though she rejected suggestions by Republican senators that race could affect her rulings.
""I've experienced life in perhaps a different way than some of my colleagues because of who I am,"" Jackson said.
Jackson would become the sixth woman ever to serve on the Supreme Court, joining current members Amy Coney Barrett, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, the retired Sandra Day O'Connor and the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
'PROFESSIONAL VAGABOND'
Biden has sought to bring more women and minorities and a broader range of backgrounds to the federal judiciary.
Jackson was raised in Miami and attended Harvard University, where she once shared a scene in a drama class with future Hollywood star Matt Damon, before graduating from Harvard Law School in 1996.
Jackson in 2017 described herself as a ""professional vagabond"" earlier in her legal career, moving from job to job as she sought a work-life balance while raising a family. She and husband Patrick Jackson, a surgeon, have two daughters.
She worked from 2005 to 2007 as a court-appointed lawyer paid by the government to represent criminal defendants who could not afford counsel. Among her clients was Khi Ali Gul, an Afghan detainee at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The United States sent him back to Afghanistan https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/605325 in 2014 when she was no longer involved in the case.
Jackson worked from 2002 to 2004 for Kenneth Feinberg, the lawyer known for overseeing compensation programs including one for victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.
She had two stints at the U.S. Sentencing Commission, which issues guidance to judges on criminal sentencing.
Jackson in 2020 paid tribute to Breyer during a virtual conference in which they both participated, saying he ""opened doors of opportunities"" not just through his judicial decisions but by hiring a diverse group of law clerks.
""As a descendant of slaves,"" Jackson added, ""let me just say that, Justice (Breyer), your thoughtfulness in that regard has made a world of difference.""

Republican former House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, whose brother-in-law is her husband's twin brother, is among Jackson's fans.
""Now our politics may differ,"" Ryan said at her 2013 Senate confirmation hearing, ""but my praise for Ketanji's intellect, for her character, for her integrity, it is unequivocal.""

BOSTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's enforcement activities have dropped sharply since 2018, as criminal fines and civil penalties paid by polluters dropped to new lows, a Washington watchdog group said Friday in a report.
Annual EPA enforcement activity, including criminal investigations and inspections, declined by about half between fiscal 2018 and 2021, from the average for 2002 to 2017, according to a study by the Environmental Integrity Project.
Civil penalties in 2018-2021 were at least 28% lower than during 2002-2017, while criminal fines declined 49%, after adjusting for inflation, the nonprofit group said.
The EPA said, in a statement, that even with past budget reductions, the agency has continued vital enforcement work. 
""Last fiscal year, EPA secured commitments of more than $8.5 billion to return facilities to compliance,"" the EPA said. ""This commitment is the highest amount in four years and 28% of those commitments were to address noncompliance in communities with environmental justice concerns.""
Eric Schaeffer, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project and a former EPA director of civil enforcement, said budget cuts have hurt the EPA's capacity to enforce the country's environmental laws.

Since fiscal 2010, when the EPA had an annual enacted budget of $10.3 billion and a staff of more than 17,000 people, the agency's resources have dwindled. But under the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden, spending is up, $9.2 billion in fiscal 2021, with plans to add more than 1,000 full-time employees in the current fiscal year, for a total of about 15,300, according to EPA figures.
Meanwhile, the number of criminal cases opened (123) and polluters charged (105) in the 2021 federal fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 were at their second lowest levels in the past two decades, while fines and years of incarceration were at their lowest, Schaeffer said.

""(Uranium) enrichment ... continues with a maximum ceiling of 60%, which led Westerners to rush to negotiations, and it will continue with the lifting of sanctions by both 20% and 5%,"" the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, Mohammad Eslami, was quoted by the semi-official news agency Fars as saying.
The 2015 deal restricts the purity to which Iran can enrich uranium to 3.67%, far below the roughly 90% that is weapons-grade or the 20% Iran reached before the deal. Iran is now enriching to various levels, the highest being around 60%.
Eslami did not elaborate or explain how 20% enrichment would be acceptable under the 2015 nuclear deal which Iran has been trying to revive through indirect talks with the United States.
Iranian officials had told Reuters earlier that Iran had agreed to suspend its 20% and 60% enrichment if an agreement is reached in the Vienna talks to salvage the 2015 pact
Separately, a senior Iranian cleric said earlier that ending Iran’s economic isolation by lifting banking and oil trade sanctions was Tehran's most important demand in talks with world powers in the Austrian capital Vienna. 
Iran on Wednesday urged the West to be ""realistic"" in the talks, as its top negotiator returned to Tehran for what might be final consultations ahead of a possible accord following months of indirect talks with the United States.
""Our negotiators... do their best to ensure the nation's interests, and know that the final point is the lifting of all sanctions, especially on banking and trade,"" Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami said at Friday prayers in Tehran.
""If these sanctions are not lifted, it is as if there were no talks,"" state media quoted him as saying. 
The general content of sermons delivered at Friday prayers is set by the office of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say on Iran's nuclear policy and all other matters of state. 
After 10 months of talks in Vienna, progress has been made toward the restoration of the pact to curb Tehran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief, but both Tehran and Washington have cautioned that still there are some significant differences to overcome.
A majority of Iran's hardline-led parliament demanded in a letter last week that the United States should guarantee that they would not abandon a restored agreement. The assembly has not voted on the letter.

A senior Iranian official has told Reuters that Iran has shown flexibility by agreeing to ""inherent guarantees"" that the U.S. administration will not quit an agreement, as Washington says it is impossible for President Joe Biden to provide the legal assurances Iran has demanded. 
Iran insists on the immediate removal of all sanctions imposed under former U.S. President Donald Trump in a verifiable process, including those imposed under terrorism or human rights measures.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. Senator Chris Coons, who chairs the Senate subcommittee that oversees foreign aid, said on Friday he would support an emergency spending bill of $10 billion or more to address the crisis following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""It would be a wild guess on my part, but I would be supportive of an emergency supplemental of at least $10 billion, if not more, to meet these vital security and humanitarian needs,"" Coons told a call with journalists just after returning from a weeklong trip to Europe.
Listing issues, including millions of refugees who may flood into other countries, the cost of enacting and enforcing sanctions, humanitarian support for Ukraine and military support for Ukraine and NATO states in eastern Europe, Coons said, ""So $10 billion is probably on the low end, because I'm not factoring in what may be a robust defense-side request.
""There is strong enthusiasm to provide ongoing resupply and training and whatever other covert and overt support is necessary and appropriate for the Ukrainian resistance,"" he said.
Coons stressed that he would not support shifting billions from existing programs to cover Ukraine-related costs, given the ongoing global coronavirus health crisis and international food insecurity issues, funding for which needs to be replenished.
Coons is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee subcommittee that handles funding for diplomatic and aid programs.Departing from recent party divisions, both President Joe Biden's fellow Democrats and opposition Republicans have expressed strong support for sharp increases in military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine, with some calling for passage of an emergency supplemental spending bill as soon as next week.

The Biden administration has not yet said how much money it would like Congress to appropriate for the crisis.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Ukrainians in the United States are making donations, sending money to relatives and mulling how they could get family out of a war zone, as they call on President Joe Biden and the wider world to do more to thwart Russia's invasion.
Around 1 million people in America are of Ukrainian descent with communities dotted around the country, including in Los Angeles, where hundreds have demonstrated against Moscow's attack.
The Los Angeles diaspora boasts churches, both Catholic and Orthodox, a culture center, delicatessen and other businesses run and used by people both born and raised in Ukraine, alongside their descendents. 
Holding a Ukrainian flag and wearing a sweatband and clothes in the blue and yellow of her native land, Oryssia Prokopovych, 57, who has been in the United States for decades, said she was doing whatever she can to help. 
""I'm sending money to support the medical groups in Ukraine so they can buy necessary things for people that will be wounded because there are already casualties,"" she said during a protest.
Her relatives in the west of the country did not want to leave, a message received by other diaspora Ukrainians Reuters spoke with, but she said that it could yet be necessary. 
""They are close to the Polish border,"" she said, referring to the city of Lviv, where the United States and others moved their embassy staff as fears grew about their safety in Kyiv.
""In the worst case, they possibly can go to Poland and then we will think about moving them to the States,"" she said. 
The logistics of leaving a country when roads are choked with traffic trying to flee, airports are closed, and the financial system has been hit by cyberattacks are ridden with obstacles. 
""A lot of my friends and family stay over there right now because it is hard to leave,"" said Olga Zimakova, 31, an aesthetician, who was born in Ukraine and now lives in America. ""Right now, it's hard to get money out of the bank."" 
Others are resigned to their inability to fly out and are eying what they can do from the other side of the world to help.
""Maybe in the near future ... we will send some things and we will help our families,"" said a 37-year-old who gave his name as Andrew, his young child strapped to him in a baby carrier.
With family in Ukraine and Russia, Thursday's invasion brings back memories of past expulsions, which have hit peoples in the former Soviet Union for many decades in the past.
""The Soviet regime in the 1940s, 1950s, sent out my family from Crimea,"" said Andrew. ""They are native Crimeans. My grandmother, she married a Russian guy ... so my mother is half Crimean and half Russian.""
Crimea, which was part of the Soviet empire until the early 1990s, was controlled by the Ukrainian government until 2014, when it was annexed by Russia. 
'SANCTIONS ARE A JOKE' 
After President Vladimir Putin recognized two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine as independent earlier this week, Western nations applied more sanctions but wanted to stop an invasion by holding back the strictest measures as a deterrent. 
""I think they need to go all-out. Everything they can right now,"" said Lily Berg, 41, a software engineer, who said she was attending a protest for the first time in her life. 
""If they just tighten little by little it's not going to do enough.""
The Biden administration has announced new sanctions and sweeping export restrictions, hammering Russia's access to global exports of goods from commercial electronics and computers to semiconductors and aircraft parts. 
But for some Ukrainians in Los Angeles, the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two prompted them to draw parallels with Adolf Hitler's invasions across the continent and said the world's response to Russia's leader must be stronger.

""Sanctions is a joke for Putin,"" said Ivan Galt, 26, who runs an appliance repair businesses and has been in the United States for six years. ""He already announced war to the world. How can you stop Hitler only by blocking his banks?""
""We need big military support. We need guns to defend our country.""

KORCZOWA, Poland (Reuters) - As Ukrainian refugees throng border crossings to flee the Russian invasion, war veteran Dmytro Dovzhenko is headed in the opposite direction from Poland to rejoin his military unit.
The 40-year-old, who fought in Donbass in 2014, told Reuters on Friday that he had left his wife and two children behind and was among some 700 former Ukrainian soldiers in Poland he estimated were returning home to fight.
""My family wasn't too happy about me leaving,"" said Dovzhenko, wearing his military fatigues and a large signet ring inscribed ""Loyal Forever"" from his marine unit in Ukraine. 
""I hope to come back to my family. If I don't return, I hope everything will be alright.""
Russia has launched an all-out invasion of Ukraine by land, air and sea. Thousands of Ukrainians have begun arriving in neighbouring central European countries.
With missiles pounding the Ukrainian capital on Friday and Russian forces pressing their advance, Dovzhenko cut a calm figure as he smoked a cigarette and prepared to drive across the border on his way into battle. 
""Others are either in Ukraine or they are on their way to Ukraine,"" Dovzhenko, who runs a foundation for Ukrainian veterans across the European Union, said on the side of the highway. ""Lots of cars are going back."" 
The former soldier has lived in Poland since 2019 but has prepared for weeks to return home at a moment's notice if Russia invaded.
The Ukrainian Ministry of Veterans has said there were no statistics on how many veterans from the conflict that started in 2014 were abroad. But there are 420,000 people registered as having once defended Ukraine.

Dovzhenko said he did not know how many veterans across Europe would return but he predicted thousands of former soldiers would find a way home to face Russian troops. 
""To the beginning of Ukraine and the beginning of the war, we drive,"" said Dovzhenko before honking his car horn and driving off to cross the border. ""I hope I will be back and I hope Russia will be destroyed.""

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - With marine heat waves helping to wipe out some of Alaska’s storied salmon runs in recent years, officials have resorted to sending emergency food shipments to affected communities while scientists warn that the industry’s days of traditional harvests may be numbered. 
Salmon all but disappeared from the 2,000-mile (3,200-km) Yukon River run last year, as record-high temperatures led to the fish piling up dead in streams and rivers before they were able to spawn. A study published Feb. 15 in the journal Fisheries detailed more than 100 salmon die-offs at freshwater sites around Alaska. 
Those losses meant that, even as temperatures were milder in 2021, the Yukon River salmon runs remained so anemic that both Alaska and Canada were forced to halt their salmon harvest to ensure enough fish survived to reproduce for another year.
""Alaska is known for salmon and being cold,” said Vanessa von Biela, a U.S. Geological Survey research biologist and lead author of the study on the 2019 die-offs. Now “we have basically the problems that have been known for a long time at the lower latitudes.""
The collapsed Yukon River salmon harvests delivered financial blows to both commercial fishers and indigenous communities, which traditionally stockpile the fish as a year-round food staple. 
Commercially, the river’s salmon fishers altogether earned a mere $51,480 for their 2020 harvest, before the harvest was canceled in 2021. By comparison, they earned $2.5 million in 2019 and $4.67 million in 2018.
Last month, the U.S. commerce secretary declared a disaster for the Yukon River fishery for both years, making federal relief funds available.
The state sent emergency fish shipments last year from the more plentiful salmon in Bristol Bay and elsewhere. 
Scientists mostly have blamed ocean warming, with a series of heat waves in the Bering Sea and North Pacific Ocean from 2014 to 2019 affecting salmon living in the sea before their return to spawning grounds.
While the heat waves have passed, their effects have not, said fisheries scientist Katie Howard with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. “We’re still seeing the residual effects,” she told a state legislative committee in Anchorage earlier this month.
Climate change may also be affecting salmon diets, with young salmon possibly filling up on nutrition-poor food like jellyfish as warmer waters in the Bering Sea drive away the more nutritious zooplankton the fish eat normally.
“In my opinion, the salmon are starving with climate change,” said Brooke Woods, the chair of the Yukon River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission from the Athabascan village of Rampart.
But the impact on freshwater habitats is also getting a closer look.
Previous research led by von Biela on the rivers, streams and lakes where salmon spend their early and late life stages, the team found that Chinook salmon show heat stress at temperatures above 18 Celsius (64.4 Fahrenheit), and start dying above 20C.
Alaskan Yukon water temperatures in the past ranged between 12C and 16C, with Canadian monitoring sites upriver measuring even cooler waters. But in 2019, temperatures on the Alaskan side were above 18C for 44 consecutive days, the February study found.
The warming impact can be muted by climate-driven glacier runoff, which feeds cooler water into rivers and streams.

Scientists expect salmon will gradually shift to new areas within Alaska, with profound effects for people who depend on the fish for their livelihoods, diet and culture.
“Salmon will find a way,” von Biela said. “But it is going to be hard for communities that are in places where there might not be salmon anymore.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Russia's invasion of Ukraine brought no pause to partisan squabbling in the U.S. Congress on Thursday, as some Republicans blasted Democratic President Joe Biden's handling of the crisis and called on him to ""change course"" in his response.
Some Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives blamed Biden for failing to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin from sending forces into Ukraine and called on the U.S. president to take a stronger position on the largest conflict in Europe since World War Two.
""There's no doubt that weakness leads to war,"" Representative Brian Mast, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a Thursday morning tweet. ""Putin once said the collapse of the Soviet empire was the 'greatest geopolitical catastrophe' of the past century for Russia. For America, President Biden may be the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of this century.""
The invasion of Ukraine followed months of Russian military buildup along the country's borders, leading to frantic diplomacy and sanctions from the United States and NATO that failed to prevent the incursion. Biden plans an address to the nation at 12:30 p.m. EST (1730 GMT).
The criticisms represented a further fraying of the dictum that partisan politics should stop at the water's edge, a view which Republicans voiced at the outset of the Cold War in the late 1940s. 
""There used to be a grace period to see how the commander in chief handled things. ... It seems Biden was not given much room to maneuver,"" said a former chief of staff to a Republican member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
A more moderate message came from Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who called Biden's withdrawal from Afghanistan a signal of American weakness for Putin. But he also called for political unity going forward. ""We're all together at this point, and we need to be together about what should be done,"" said McConnell, who urged Biden to impose full and crippling economic sanctions on Russia and stand ready to supply Ukraine with the weapons necessary to inflict maximum damage on Russian forces. 
'WHERE'S BIDEN?'
Other Republicans kept up the political attack on Biden.
""Almost 12 hours since Vladimir Putin declared war on Ukraine and the only response we've gotten from Biden is a Zoom call. Where's Biden? He's the leader of the free world. It's time to start acting like it,"" Representative Carlos Gimenez wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Biden spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as the invasion began late on Wednesday, convened his National Security Council on Thursday, and met with his counterparts from the Group of Seven allies to map out more severe responses.
""The president must change course or our deterrent posture will continue to collapse, chaos will continue to spread and eventually no one will trust America's promises or fear America's power,"" said Representative Mike Gallagher, a member of the House Armed Services Committee. 
Former President Donald Trump -- who even out of office remains the most powerful voice in the Republican Party -- had threatened during his four years in office to leave NATO, calling the military alliance ""obsolete."" He withdrew the United States from international agreements -- including the Paris Climate Accord, which it has since rejoined -- and pulled out of a pact in which Iran had curbed its uranium enrichment program, a possible pathway to nuclear arms, which is now being renegotiated.
Trump, who has expressed admiration for Putin, described the Russian leader's actions leading up to invasion as ""genius,"" ""smart"" and ""pretty savvy.""
The response among congressional Republicans -- blaming Biden, calling for stronger sanctions and warning against any use of U.S. troops in Ukraine -- largely mirrored the sentiments of Republican voters, as lawmakers approach the Nov. 8 midterm elections that will determine the balance of power in Congress ahead of the 2024 presidential election. 
Only 34% of Americans -- including just 12% of Republicans -- approved of the way Biden was handling the crisis in the run-up to the invasion, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Tuesday and Wednesday.
Twenty-five percent of Republicans polled said Biden was primarily to blame for the conflict, with 46% saying Putin was primarily to blame. Nearly one in five was unsure who to blame.

Senator Mitt Romney, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a moderate voice in his party, offered broader criticism that also blamed U.S. responses to Russia by former Presidents Barack Obama and Trump while evoking the Reagan era's tough posture against the former Soviet Union.
""Putin's impunity predictably follows our tepid response to his previous horrors in Georgia and Crimea, our naive efforts at a one-sided 'reset,' and the shortsightedness of 'America First.' The '80s called' and we didn't answer,"" Romney said in a statement.

The earliest known protest occurred outside Russia's embassy in Washington around 1 a.m. EST (0600 GMT) on Thursday, only three hours after President Vladimir Putin said he had launched his military operation.
Local news reports showed dozens of protesters in the U.S. capital waving Ukrainian flags and chanting ""Stop Russian aggression!""
In London, hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Ukrainian and some weeping, gathered outside Downing Street, home to the prime minister, urging Britain to do more.
""We need help, we need someone to support us,"" said one. ""Ukraine is too small and the pressure is too big.""
In Paris, one demonstrator told Reuters: ""I feel that we are in a very dangerous moment for the whole world.""
In Madrid, Oscar-winning Spanish actor Javier Bardem, nominated for another Academy Award this year, joined about a hundred protesters outside the Russian embassy.
""It is an invasion. ... It violates Ukraine's fundamental right to territorial sovereignty, international law, and many other things,"" Bardem said.
A giant flag was carried through Manhattan's Times Square by a crowd of several hundred protesters.
In the Swiss capital Bern, hundreds gathered, holding Ukrainian flags and chanting ""Peace for Ukraine!"".
Agapi Tamir, 28, one of a few dozen members of Greece's Ukrainian community who staged a protest in Athens, said: 
""The only thing we believe is that a miracle will stop all this awful and frightening thing that is happening at this moment.""
A small demonstration in Geneva, organised by the Nobel Peace Prize-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) outside the U.N. European headquarters, condemned what the group said was Putin's threat to use nuclear weapons.
Other demonstrations were held in Beirut, Tel Aviv, Dublin and Prague.
Also in Dublin, a Russian double-eagle crest beside the gate of the Russian embassy was defaced with red paint.
More protests were scheduled for later in the day in the U.S. cities of Houston and Denver, according to social media posts.
In Russia itself, protesters defied an official warning that explicitly threatened criminal prosecution and even jail time for those calling for or taking part in protests.

Hundreds rallied in cities including Moscow, St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg, chanting slogans such as ""No to war!"" and holding up makeshift signs.
By 1939 GMT, police had detained no fewer than 1,667 people in 53 cities, the OVD-Info rights monitor said. Six hundred were arrested in Moscow alone, the Tass news agency reported.

Russian President Vladimir Putin signed decrees on Monday to recognise the two breakaway regions as independent states before ordering a full-blown invasion of Ukraine.
The ministry said in a statement the sides would discuss Russian military operations in Ukraine, as well as the opening of the embassies of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic in Moscow. They will also discuss the opening of Russian diplomatic outposts in the two regions. 
Russian-backed separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, collectively known as the Donbass, broke away from Ukrainian government control in 2014 and proclaimed themselves independent ""people's republics"".

Putin authorised ""a special military operation"" against Ukraine on Thursday to eliminate what he called a serious security threat to Russia. He said his aim was to demilitarise Russia's southern neighbour.
Ukraine said its capital Kyiv and other parts of the country were struck by Russian missiles in the early hours of Friday. A senior Ukrainian official said Russian forces would enter areas just outside Kyiv later on Friday.

ST. PAUL, Minn. (Reuters) - Three former Minneapolis police officers were found guilty by a federal jury on Thursday of depriving George Floyd of his civil rights by failing to give aid to the handcuffed Black man pinned beneath a colleague's knee.
The jury also found that the conduct of officers Tou Thao, 36; J. Alexander Kueng, 28; and Thomas Lane, 38, during the arrest on May 25, 2020, caused Floyd's death, a finding that can affect the severity of their sentence. 
It is a rare instance of police officers being held criminally responsible for a colleague's excessive force. All three men were convicted of denying Floyd's constitutional right to medical care while in police custody. 
Thao and Kueng were also convicted on a charge of denying Floyd's right to not face excessive force by failing to stop their colleague Derek Chauvin from kneeling on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes. Chauvin was convicted last year in a state court of Floyd's murder.
Thao, Kueng and Lane will remain free on bail pending their sentencing hearing, which has yet to be scheduled. Prosecutors have not yet said what sentence they will request, but the men may face years in prison. 
""This is just accountability,"" Philonise Floyd told reporters after the verdict was read. ""It could never be justice because I can never get my brother back.""
The verdict marked a second victory this week for prosecutors in the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, coming just two days after a jury in Georgia found three white men guilty of federal hate crimes in the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, a young Black man who was gunned down while running through a mostly white neighborhood. 
""That's historic for our country, because oftentimes officers kill Black and brown men and women, and we get little to no consequences,"" said Brandon Williams, George Floyd's nephew. ""A lot of times we don't even get charges, let alone convictions."" 
KILLING SPARKED PROTESTS
Federal prosecutors argued in the U.S. District Court in St. Paul that the men knew from their training and from ""basic human decency"" that they had a duty to help Floyd as he begged for his life before falling limp beneath Chauvin's knee.
Floyd's killing sparked protests in cities around the world against police brutality and racism.
It also led lawmakers to propose such measures as restricting chokeholds, banning ""no-knock warrants,"" and legislating to curtail the U.S. Supreme Court doctrine known ""qualified immunity"" that limits lawsuits over police use of excessive force. 
Those proposals were included in the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed in the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives last year. Philonise Floyd on Thursday again urged lawmakers to pass the measure that has stalled in the Senate, where Democrats are unlikely to get the necessary Republican votes.
Chauvin, who is white, was sentenced to 22-1/2 years in prison last year after a state murder trial. Although race was not part of the state or federal charges, Chauvin's conviction was seen as a landmark rebuke of the disproportionate use of police force against Black Americans. In December, Chauvin pleaded guilty to the federal charge of violating Floyd's rights.
Under Chauvin's plea agreement, federal prosecutors will seek a 25-year sentence, concurrent with his state prison sentence. His three former colleagues are also due to stand trial in Minneapolis in June on state charges of aiding and abetting Floyd's murder.
BYSTANDER VIDEO
Widely seen cellphone video showed Thao stood steps away from Floyd, rebuffing the demands by horrified onlookers that Chauvin get off Floyd's neck. Kueng and Lane were to Chauvin's right, pinning down Floyd's buttocks and legs.
All three testified in their own defense. Each acknowledged they knew they had a duty of care to people in their custody. But they and their lawyers told jurors they did not realize at the time that Floyd was in dire need of medical aid or that Chauvin's use of force was excessive.
Prosecutors repeatedly played videos showing Floyd's distress was plain to bystanders, including children and an off-duty firefighter, who shouted that Floyd was passing out and begging the police to check his pulse.
The three defendants all described deferring to the authority of Chauvin, the most senior officer at the scene with 19 years at the Minneapolis Police Department.
Kueng and Lane, who first handcuffed Floyd on suspicion of using a fake $20 bill in a nearby store, also noted they were rookies only a few days out of training, which lasted more than a year. Thao had been on the force for eight years.

Medical experts have testified that Floyd almost certainly would have survived the arrest if he had been rolled onto his side once the officers restrained him, as the officers acknowledged they had been taught to do.

LONDON (Reuters) -Russia intends to take the whole of Ukraine but the Russian army failed to deliver it main objectives on the first day of President Vladimir Putin's invasion, British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said on Friday. 
Russia launched its invasion by land, air and sea on Thursday following a declaration of war by Putin, in the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.
Missiles pounded the Ukrainian capital on Friday as Russian forces pressed their advance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy pleaded with the international community to do more, saying sanctions announced so far were not enough.
""It's definitely our view that the Russians intend to invade the whole of Ukraine,"" Wallace told Sky.
Putin says Russia is carrying out ""a special military operation"" to stop the Ukrainian government from committing genocide against its own people - an accusation the West calls baseless. He also says Ukraine is an illegitimate state whose lands historically belong to Russia.
Wallace cast Putin, Russia's paramount leader since 1999, as illogical. 
""I certainly think he has gone full tonto,"" Wallace said. ""No-one else in their right mind would do what we are seeing on our telly screens today.""
Russia says Western leaders are gripped by Russophobia and that the United States and its allies have been plotting to undermine Russia for decades. 
BLOOD AND MONEY 
Wallace said the Russian army had failed to deliver any of its key objectives, directly contradicting the Russian defence ministry which said it had achieved all of its main aims on the first day of the military operation. 
""Contrary to great Russian claims, and indeed President Putin's sort of vision that somehow the Ukrainians would be liberated and would be flocking to his cause, he's got that completely wrong, and the Russian army has failed to deliver, on day one, its main objective,"" Wallace said. 
Russia, Wallace said, had lost more than 450 personnel so far. 
After Britain unveiled its toughest sanctions yet on Russia, Wallace said London was pushing reluctant allies to cut off Russia from the SWIFT global interbank payments system.
""We would like to go further, we'd like to do the SWIFT system,"" he said. ""If not every country wants them to be thrown out of the SWIFT system, it becomes difficult.""

British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) is now avoiding Russian airspace for overflights and cancelled its flight to Moscow on Friday after Prime Minister Boris Johnson banned Russia's flagship airline Aeroflot from Britain, CEO Luis Gallego said.
Britain has prohibited all scheduled Russian airlines from entering British airspace.

It was unclear whether the aircraft was manned or whether it could be a missile. Kyiv municipal authorities said at least eight people were injured when the object crashed into an apartment block.
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Kyiv had come under a missile attack.
""Horrific Russian rocket strikes on Kyiv,"" he wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""Last time our capital experienced anything like this was in 1941 when it was attacked by Nazi Germany.""
A series of explosions were heard in Kyiv earlier, which Herashchenko said were the sounds of air defences firing at the aircraft. Further explosions could be heard just before dawn, a Reuters witness said.

Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Thursday and Kyiv has reported dozens of casualties and hundreds of wounded. 
Authorities said intense fighting was under way on Friday morning in the city of Sumy in the country's northeast, while a border post in the southeastern Zaporizhzhya region had been hit by missiles, causing deaths and injuries among border guards.

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - When Russia attacked Ukraine, the nearest naval vessel of a major NATO ally was in the Mediterranean. The last such ship from a major naval member of the Western military alliance left the Black Sea – an area roughly the size of California bordering Russia, Ukraine and NATO members Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania – over a month ago. 
A French warship completed a tour in early January and no major NATO naval ally has patrolled its waters since, according to Turkish maritime website Turkishnavy.net, which tracks the movements of foreign warships. Meanwhile, 16 ships from Russia's naval fleets, including missile ships and vessels capable of landing tanks, had sailed into the Black Sea, according to Turkishnavy.net and Russian defence ministry statements. 
As NATO scrambles to respond to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a major exposed flank is the Black Sea. Despite a stated resolve to deter Russia, the alliance has failed to prevent it from building a presence in the area.
A key reason: divisions among members over whether to challenge Russia’s navy in the area, resulting in a lack of a coherent and meaningful Black Sea NATO strategy, according to Reuters interviews with diplomats, intelligence officials and security sources from NATO members as well as military strategists, retired military commanders and shipping industry officials.
That includes reluctance by some NATO members, notably Turkey, to agree to maritime patrols to avoid provoking Moscow, they said. Other factors are budget constraints and the existence of other priorities among some major NATO allies, they added.
Russia’s Black Sea naval presence, which provides both military and economic leverage over Kyiv, had been disrupting Ukraine’s maritime trade even before the invasion. Ukraine’s ports have seen traffic fall sharply in recent weeks, according to commercial ship data reviewed by Reuters. Following Thursday’s attack, Ukraine suspended operations at its sea ports.
""It's like a boa constrictor around Ukraine's neck, squeezing and squeezing and squeezing,"" said retired U.S. Admiral James Foggo, who commanded U.S. and NATO fleets in Europe for almost a decade until 2020. ""NATO needs a maritime strategy.""
Ukraine is not a NATO ally, and the alliance is not treaty-bound to protect it. 
On Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the assault on Ukraine included Russian naval forces as well as from the air and ground. Speaking to news media, he said NATO had more than 120 allied ships “from the high north to the Mediterranean” and more than 100 jets at high alert.
NATO did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this article. It has previously denied neglecting the Black Sea. Earlier this month, Stoltenberg said Black Sea security is of ""vital strategic importance"" to the alliance. Three of NATO’s members plus two close partners, including Ukraine, have coastal borders.
NATO has focused on boots on the ground. It plans to deploy land combat units totaling around 4,000 troops to Black Sea countries Romania and Bulgaria as well as Hungary and Slovakia, which border Ukraine. In addition, the United States is sending nearly 3,000 extra troops to Ukraine neighbors Poland and Romania.
Prior to Thursday’s invasion, Russia had amassed more than 150,000 troops on Ukraine’s borders, including in the Black Sea area, the United States has said.
Russia, which has demanded an end to NATO's eastward expansion, launched airstrikes on Ukrainian cities while advancing troops and tanks early Thursday. Putin said he authorised military action to defend against what he said were threats emanating from Ukraine, a democratic state of 44 million people.
Moscow, which asserts NATO should stay out of waters it claims as its own, had said the recently arrived ships were part of a pre-planned movement of military resources. Russia has long complained about what it has called a dangerous increase in military activity by the United States and its allies in the Black Sea - activities that NATO has said are purely defensive. 
NATO’s naval response to Russia also has implications for the West's ability to assert its interests elsewhere, such as the South China Sea, where Beijing claims sovereignty.
""If, with the whole world watching, we cannot deter the Kremlin, I don't think the Chinese will be terribly impressed about what we say about Taiwan or the South China Sea,"" said retired U.S. General Ben Hodges, who commanded U.S. Army forces in Europe from 2014 until 2017 and who met Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv in early February.
‘CREEPING MILITARIZATION’
The warmer waters of the Black Sea in contrast to the Arctic have been critical to Russia since at least the 17th century. ""Going back to Peter the Great, Russia has always been concerned as a land power about its lack of maritime access, particularly year round ice-free access,"" said retired British Vice Admiral Duncan Potts.
Moscow’s annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014 allowed it to begin what one Western intelligence official described as the ""creeping militarization"" of the Black Sea. Russia took over or sank many of Ukraine’s navy vessels stationed in the Black Sea port of Sebastopol.
Russia’s military presence in Crimea and the modernization in recent years of key Russian naval fleets has “shifted the military balance in the Black Sea region in its favour,"" said analyst Stephen Flanagan at the RAND Corporation think tank in the United States. Moscow currently has 18 major warships in the Black Sea, said Flanagan, giving it “a formidable force to conduct various operations against Ukraine.”
Meanwhile, the presence of NATO warships in the Black Sea has fluctuated. According to Turkishnavy.net, U.S. naval forces spent around 180 days in the Black Sea last year, up from less than 60 days in 2016 but down from over 200 days in 2014. Non-littoral NATO allies deployed 31 ships to the area in 2014, that dropped to 14 in 2016 before rising again to 31 last year, according to an independent database run by a Ukrainian think tank, the Monitoring Group of the Black Sea Institute of Strategic Studies and BlackSeaNews.
The last big allied destroyer, the U.S. Navy guided-missile destroyer USS Arleigh Burke, left the Black Sea in December, according to a U.S. Navy statement. Britain's Royal Navy has not been to the Black Sea since last summer, according to Turkishnavy.net.
NATO member Turkey does have a navy that operates in the Black Sea region. Other NATO allies - including the United States and France - currently have navy vessels in the Mediterranean.
PORTS ‘SHUT DOWN’
Ukraine relies heavily on its coastline for trade, with more than half of the country’s exports and imports traveling by sea. The Black Sea port of Odessa, Ukraine’s busiest port and largest oil and gas terminal, came under missile attack on Thursday, regional authorities of Ukraine's southern Odessa region said. 
Ukraine's military on Thursday suspended commercial shipping at its ports after Russian forces invaded the country, an adviser to the Ukrainian president's chief of staff said.
Even before Thursday’s attack, there had been a growing reluctance by companies to send ships to the area because of the increased Russian naval presence, the three shipping industry officials plus one other said. That added to existing disruptions to trade caused by global supply chain issues, which has reduced the pool of available vessels willing to sail into the region.
Shipping traffic had recently dropped. The number of container ship arrivals to Ukrainian ports this month through Feb. 20 had fallen to 25 visits, down sharply from 48 visits during the month of January, according to data from ship tracking and intelligence provider MarineTraffic, which is based in Greece.
Odessa had also seen the capacity of ships coming into the port more than halved. For the first three weeks of February it was at 46,357 20-foot container units, down from 82,091 in January and 97,027 in December 2021, data from U.S. headquartered logistics platform project44 showed.
NATO’S ‘HAND TIED’
Some diplomats say NATO should have already established a Black Sea maritime patrol mission. 
The lack of such a presence despite regular visits by U.S. warships has allowed Russia to declare large areas near the Romanian and Bulgarian coastlines off-limits for months at a time while Moscow conducts military maritime exercises, according to a senior Western military official.
NATO is heavily dependent on member Turkey’s help; the other alliance members bordering the Black Sea - Bulgaria and Romania - have limited navies.
Under the international Montreux Convention of 1936, Turkey has control over passage of vessels between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Ships from non-littoral states such as Britain and France, can only stay for 21 days at a time. France has about three naval exercises in the Black Sea each year.
But Turkey must balance Ankara’s strong diplomatic ties with Moscow and its obligations as a NATO ally. Recent informal talks at NATO with Ankara over a possible maritime policing mission have gone nowhere, according to two Turkish government security sources and a NATO ambassador.
""We are evaluating the situation to be prepared for every situation,"" Turkey's defence ministry told Reuters on Feb. 10. NATO has previously declined to comment directly on the possibility of a Black sea policing mission.

""NATO has one hand tied behind its back,"" Paul Taylor, a European analyst at the Friends of Europe think tank, referring to Turkey’s reluctance to impose more control over the Black Sea.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Members of the U.S. Congress said on Thursday they could approve hundreds of millions of dollars in additional military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine starting as soon as next week, to boost the government in Kyiv after Russia invaded.
Departing from typical party divisions, both Democrats and Republicans said they favored sharp increases on top of what has already been sent. President Joe Biden's administration has sent more than $650 million in military assistance to Ukraine over the past year.
""My colleagues and I are carefully monitoring the situation and stand ready to provide assistance both to our Ukrainian partners and to our allies in Central and Eastern Europe as they confront this crisis,"" Representative Rosa DeLauro, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, said in a statement.
U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said lawmakers want to provide Ukraine with humanitarian assistance as well as the defensive weapons needed to battle Russia's unfolding attack.
""What we're doing with Ukraine is making sure that we have humanitarian assistance to help the people, that we have lethal defense weapons going into Ukraine to the tune of $600 million for them to fight their own fight,"" Pelosi told reporters in San Francisco.
Lawmakers did not provide specific numbers, but they have made clear they back significant spending.
Ukraine would need $1 billion in humanitarian aid over the next 12 months, Representative Barbara Lee, the Democratic chair of the House appropriations subcommittee overseeing foreign aid, had told a press conference in Washington on Wednesday.
Senator Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also backed ""significant"" additional aid for Ukraine. ""Obviously the numbers differ between what would go to defensive weaponry and what would go to other things, such as humanitarian needs, which are probably going to be significant,"" he told reporters on a conference call.
Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM), a senior Republican member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, told reporters earlier this week he wanted Congress to act on a spending bill for Ukraine next week, when they return to Washington.
Senators had discussed providing $500 million in additional military aid for Ukraine earlier this year during failed negotiations on a bipartisan bill to boost Ukraine and punish Russia. That effort stalled as Democrats and Republicans disagreed over whether to wait to impose sanctions until after an invasion and whether to impose secondary sanctions on institutions that do business with Russian banks.
Aid for Ukraine was among topics discussed when administration officials held non-classified calls about Ukraine with members of the Senate and House on Thursday evening, according to people familiar with the calls.

The Biden administration has not said how much money it would like Congress to authorize, saying the situation was still being assessed.
It was not immediately clear whether funding would be approved in a standalone emergency spending bill, or as part of a broader measure to keep the government open after funding expires on March 11.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Demonstrators in several major U.S. cities protested the invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, calling on Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt the missile and troop assault as U.S. President Joe Biden announced new sanctions against Russia.
Despite freezing temperatures, hundreds of protesters in Manhattan marched to the Russian mission to the United Nations, some cloaked in Ukrainian flags and chanting ""stop the war"" and ""stop Russia now."" New York City has the largest Ukrainian community in the United States.
""I was born in Ukraine ... but today I think everybody is Ukrainian,"" said Ivana Lotoshynski, a U.S. citizen protesting in Times Square. ""It doesn't matter where you were born, where you live. People are losing their lives right now. Ukrainians are fighting against this regime from Russia and ... it’s really devastating.”
Marcin Branowski, a Polish student living in New York, said he felt compelled to show his support for Ukraine.
“My whole family is in Poland and I'm pretty terrified as to what’s going to happen if the situation continues,” Branowski said.
Anstasiia Yashchenko, a resident of Kyiv, told Reuters her family and friends were foremost on her mind while she attended the protest with her boyfriend, who had flown her to New York City 10 days earlier.
""I packed everything in like two suitcases and I just ran out of the apartment and just left,” said Yashchenko, 23. She said she had hoped tensions would lessen, and could not believe her eyes when watching the invasion unfold early Thursday.
In sunny Los Angeles, on the other side of the country, about 300 people gathered outside a federal government building, holding banners and waving Ukrainian flags while many passing motorists honked horns in support.
""We have to show solidarity,"" said Andrew, 37, who had his young child strapped to him in a baby carrier. ""We stand here for our people,"" he said, adding that he had family in both Ukraine and Russia.
The earliest protest on Thursday occurred outside Russia's embassy in Washington around 1 a.m. EST (0600 GMT), shortly after news broke that Russian forces had launched a massive attack against its neighbor.
Additional protests took place on Thursday in other U.S. cities, including Washington, Houston, and Denver, as well as cities around the world.
Russia's invasion, the biggest attack on a European country since World War Two, has left many Ukrainian-Americans fearful for the safety of loved ones still living in the eastern European country. 
One of the people at Washington's early-morning protest, which dispersed before sunrise, told Washington television station WUSA that he had been pleading with his parents and sister to leave and get to safety for weeks, to no avail.
Dozens of Ukrainians began fleeing Ukraine into Poland and other neighboring central European countries after Russia's assault began on Thursday, some taking only what they could carry and leaving behind possessions and pets.
In Russia, protesters defied an official warning explicitly threatening criminal prosecution and even jail time for those calling for or taking part in protests. Hundreds rallied in cities including Moscow, St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg.
By evening, police had detained no fewer than 1,667 people in 53 cities, the OVD-Info rights monitor said. Six hundred were arrested in Moscow alone, the Tass news agency reported. 

Russians also joined the U.S. protests. Outside the Russian U.N. mission in Manhattan on Thursday, Julia Makhalova, a 34-year-old who immigrated to New York from Russia in 2017, said she feared Putin's actions would escalate into a full-blown world war.
""I think it’s very scary overall,"" she said in an interview. ""The president is literally crazy.""

KYIV/MARIUPOL, Ukraine (Reuters) -Ukrainian forces battled Russian invaders on three sides on Thursday after Moscow unleashed the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two, prompting tens of thousands of people to flee their homes.
After Russian President Vladimir Putin declared war in a pre-dawn televised address, explosions and gunfire were heard through the day in Ukraine's capital and elsewhere in the country, with at least 70 people reported killed. 
The assault brought a calamitous end to weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by Western leaders to avert war over Russian demands for a redrawing of post-Cold War security arrangements in Europe.
""This is a premeditated attack,"" U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters at the White House as he unveiled harsh new sanctions, coordinated with allies, against Russian banks, oligarchs and state companies.
""Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences,"" he said.
In his address, Putin said he had ordered ""a special military operation"" to protect people, including Russian citizens, subjected to ""genocide"" in Ukraine - an accusation the West calls baseless propaganda.
""And for this we will strive for the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine,"" Putin said.
After nightfall, a picture was emerging of fierce fighting across multiple fronts. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy late on Thursday ordered a general mobilization, to be carried out within 90 days, ""to ensure the defence of the state"". 
An adviser to the Ukrainian presidential office said Russian forces had captured the Chernobyl former nuclear power plant, just 90 km (60 miles) north of Kyiv. The plant is along the shortest route from the Ukrainian capital to Belarus, where Moscow has staged troops.
There was also fighting at Hostomel airport, just outside Kyiv, where Russian paratroopers landed. A Ukrainian official later said the airfield had been recaptured, while a senior U.S. defence official said Russian forces were advancing closer to Kyiv. 
Heavy exchanges of fire were also reported in the regions of Sumy and Kharkiv in the northeast and Kherson in the south.
The highway heading west out of Kyiv, home to 3 million people, was choked with traffic across five lanes as residents sought to escape, fearful of bombardments while stuck in their cars. 
The U.N. refugee agency said an estimated 100,000 Ukrainians had fled their homes. Thousands were crossing into neighbouring countries, including Romania, Moldova, Poland and Hungary.
Some 57 people were killed and 169 were wounded on Thursday, Ukraine's health minister said, while the interior ministry said 13 border guards died when a Russian vessel shelled Ukraine's Zmiinyi Island, south of the Black Sea port of Odessa.
'NEW IRON CURTAIN'
The day began with missiles raining down on targets across Ukraine and reports of troops and armour pouring across the borders from Russia and Belarus to the north and east.
Zelenskiy called on Ukrainians to defend their country and said arms would be given to anyone prepared to fight.
""What we have heard today are not just missile blasts, fighting and the rumble of aircraft. This is the sound of a new Iron Curtain, which has come down and is closing Russia off from the civilised world,"" Zelenskiy said.
Putin, after referring earlier in his speech to Russia's powerful nuclear arsenal, warned: ""Whoever tries to hinder us... should know that Russia's response will be immediate. And it will lead you to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history.""
Asked whether that threat was tantamount to threatening Russian use of nuclear weapons, Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said it was indeed understood as such, adding that Putin should also understand that NATO was a nuclear alliance.
Biden has ruled out sending U.S. troops to defend Ukraine, but Washington has reinforced its NATO allies in the region with extra troops and planes. 
After consulting with the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations, Biden announced measures to impede Russia's ability to do business in the world's major currencies, along with sanctions against banks and state-owned enterprises.
Britain also targeted banks, as well as members of Putin's inner circle. European Union leaders said measures would include freezing Russian assets in the 27-nation bloc.
China remained out of step, however, rejecting the description of Russia's actions as an ""invasion"".
Russia is one of the world's biggest energy producers, and both it and Ukraine are among the top exporters of grain. War and sanctions will disrupt economies around the world already facing a crisis as they emerge from the coronavirus pandemic.
European stocks dived to nine-month lows, but U.S. stocks ended higher after Biden's sanctions announcement. Brent oil earlier surged past $100/barrel for the first time since 2014. [MKTS/GLOB] [O/R]
'HANG THEM FROM BRIDGES'
Putin said he did not plan a military occupation, only to disarm Ukraine and purge it of nationalists, and his endgame remains unclear.
The senior U.S. defence official said Washington believed the invasion was intended to ""decapitate"" Zelenskiy's government.
But it is hard to see Ukrainians accepting leadership installed by Moscow.
""I think we must fight all those who invade our country so strongly,"" said one man stuck in traffic trying to leave Kyiv. ""I would hang every single one of them from bridges.""
A democratic nation of 44 million people, Ukraine is Europe's biggest country by area after Russia itself. It voted for independence at the fall of the Soviet Union and has recently stepped up efforts to join NATO and the European Union, aspirations that infuriate Moscow.
Putin, who denied for months that he was planning an invasion, has called Ukraine an artificial construct carved from Russia by its enemies - a characterisation Ukrainians see as an attempt to erase their more than 1,000-year-old history.
While many Ukrainians, particularly in the east, speak Russian as a native language, virtually all identify themselves as Ukrainian.
There was also some dissent in Russia. Police detained more than 1,600 taking part in anti-war rallies in 53 cities and authorities threatened to block media reports carrying ""false information"".
UKRAINIANS FLEE, SUPPORTERS PROTEST
In the southeastern port of Mariupol, near a frontline held by Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, local authorities said 26 people were wounded in shelling.
Civilians packed bags. ""We are going into hiding,"" a woman said.
Ukraine's ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova, said its forces had downed two Russian helicopters and seven other Russian aircraft and destroyed several Russian trucks, and a platoon from Russia's 74th Motor Rifles Brigade had surrendered.
Russia's defence ministry said it had destroyed 83 land-based Ukrainian targets and had achieved all its goals, according to Interfax news agency.

Protests against Russia's invasion were held in Europe and the United States. At a demonstration in New York's Time Square, Ivana Lotoshynski, who was born in Ukraine, urged solidarity with Ukrainians. 
""People are losing their lives right now. Ukrainians are fighting against this regime from Russia and it's really devastating,"" she said. ""Today I think everybody is Ukrainian.""

(Reuters) - Justices on Texas's high court on Thursday sharply questioned whether clinics can challenge a law that banned most abortions in the state because it is enforced by private individuals, just two months after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the case to move forward.
The clinics are suing over a law, known as SB8, that went into effect Sept. 1 and bans abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. It allows private citizens to sue anyone who performs and assists a woman in obtaining an abortion after embryo cardiac activity is detected.
A federal appeals court last month asked the Texas Supreme Court to weigh in on whether state officials, including those tasked with doctor licensing, could indirectly enforce the law by taking disciplinary actions against violators.
That could allow the clinics to overcome a novel feature of the law that has frustrated their ability to challenge it in federal court by placing enforcement in the hands of private citizens, rather than the state officials.
The U.S. Supreme Court in December allowed part of the clinics' case to proceed against Texas licensing officials, who they would seek to block from enforcing the law through an injunction.
The clinics contend the law is unconstitutional under Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that made abortion legal nationwide and that the conservative-leaning U.S. Supreme Court is now weighing rolling back or overturning in a Mississippi case.
""SB8 is blatantly unconstitutional under 50 years of Supreme Court precedent,"" Marc Hearron, a lawyer for the clinics, told the Texas high court's nine justices. 
But several justices pointed to a provision in the law that says ""notwithstanding ... any other law,"" SB8 would be enforced exclusively through private civil lawsuits. The court's nine justices are all Republican.
""It's pretty definitive,"" Justice Debra Lehrmann said. ""How do you get around that?""
Justice Evan Young asked if the court could just ""eliminate"" the ambiguity and conclude that SB8 does not allow licensing officials to indirectly enforce the law.

""If you were to do that, that would, at a minimum, provide our clients some certainty,"" Hearron said. ""It would, however, essentially end our challenge.""
(Corrects to say all the court's justices are Republican instead of the justices were all appointed by Republican governors, paragraph 8)

(Reuters) - The government of Ukraine is asking for volunteers from the country's hacker underground to help protect critical infrastructure and conduct cyber spying missions against Russian troops, according two people involved in the project.
As Russian forces attacked cities across Ukraine, requests for volunteers began to appear on hacker forums on Thursday morning, as many residents fled the capital Kyiv.
""Ukrainian cybercommunity! It's time to get involved in the cyber defense of our country,"" the post read, asking hackers and cybersecurity experts to submit an application via Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) docs, listing their specialties, such as malware development, and professional references.
Yegor Aushev, co-founder of a cybersecurity company in Kyiv, told Reuters he wrote the post at the request of a senior Defense Ministry official who contacted him on Thursday. Aushev's firm Cyber Unit Technologies is known for working with Ukraine's government on the defense of critical infrastructure. 
Another person directly involved in the effort confirmed that the request came from the Defense Ministry on Thursday morning.
Ukraine Defense Ministry representatives did not respond to a request for comment. A defense attache at Ukraine's embassy in Washington said he ""cannot confirm or deny information from Telegram channels"" referring to the mobile messaging platform, and declined further comment.
Aushev said the volunteers would be divided into defensive and offensive cyber units. The defensive unit would be employed to defend infrastructure such as power plants and water systems. In a 2015 cyberattack, widely attributed to Russia state hackers, 225,000 Ukrainians lost electricity. 
The offensive volunteer unit Aushev said he is organizing would help Ukraine's military conduct digital espionage operations against invading Russian forces.
""We have an army inside our country,"" Aushev said. ""We need to know what they are doing.""
On Wednesday, a newly discovered piece of destructive software was found circulating in Ukraine, hitting hundreds of computers, according to researchers at the cybersecurity firm ESET. Suspicion fell on Russia, which has repeatedly been accused of hacks against Ukraine and other countries. The victims included government agencies and a financial institution, Reuters previously reported. 
Russia has denied the allegations. 
The effort to build a cyber military force is coming late in the game, Aushev acknowledged. 

A Ukrainian security official said earlier this month that the country had no dedicated military cyber force, the Washington Post reported. ""It’s our task to create them this year,"" he told the Washington Post.
Reached late Thursday night in Ukraine, Aushev said he already had received hundreds of applicants and was going to begin vetting to ensure that none of them were Russian agents.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday said she will question a juror in Ghislaine Maxwell's sex trafficking case to determine whether his failure to disclose having been sexually abused as a child tainted the British socialite's conviction.
U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan also denied Maxwell's bid for a new trial, at least until after a March 8 hearing, when the Manhattan man known as Juror 50 will testify under oath in open court.
Nathan said Maxwell had met the ""high"" legal standard to obtain a post-verdict hearing.
Maxwell, 60, was convicted on Dec. 29 of five of the six counts she faced for aiding the late financier Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls.
The verdict became clouded when Juror 50, who identified himself by his first and middle names Scotty David, told media including Reuters that he shared with other jurors his history of sexual abuse during the five days of jury deliberations.
He had not disclosed this abuse before trial when filling out his juror questionnaire.
Question 48 had asked whether prospective jurors had been victims of sexual harassment, sexual abuse or sexual assault, and if yes whether they could judge Maxwell fairly and impartially.
Juror 50, who is in his mid-30s, checked ""No"" to the first part of the question, and left the second part blank.
He told Reuters he did not remember the question and would have answered honestly, but that he ""flew through"" the questionnaire.
Nathan called Juror 50's statements ""clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence"" that he responded falsely on his questionnaire, depriving Maxwell's lawyers of a chance to question him for bias.
But in denying a new trial, Nathan said she could not accept Juror 50's statements at face value because they were either unsworn, or inadmissible under federal evidentiary rules.
Lawyers for Maxwell did not respond to requests for comment.
They had argued that Juror 50's failure to respond truthfully required a new trial because Maxwell's jury was not fair and impartial, and that they would have excluded him ""for cause"" had he been truthful.
Maxwell's lawyers had also sought to question a second juror who reportedly claimed to discuss with fellow jurors having also experienced sexual abuse as a child. Nathan denied that request on Thursday.
Todd Spodek, a lawyer for Juror 50, declined to comment.
Legal experts have said overturning verdicts because of juror dishonesty generally occurs when jurors lie in order to be seated, not when they mistakenly conceal important information.
Maxwell's sentencing is scheduled for June 28.

Epstein killed himself on Aug. 10, 2019, at age 66 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting his own sex-trafficking trial. 
Juror 50 said in his questionnaire that he had heard Epstein had been in jail awaiting trial but had died, and read that Maxwell had been Epstein's girlfriend.

(Reuters) - Medication abortion accounted for more than half of all abortions in the United States as of 2020, a new survey found, a significant increase from prior years as the pills became more widely available and surgical abortions harder to obtain.
Fifty-four percent of abortions administered in 2020 involved the two-pill method as opposed to a surgical procedure, according to a survey published on Thursday by the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights advocacy research group.
The data showed a jump from 2017, when Guttmacher found that 39% of abortions were done by medication. The research group collects data from U.S. abortion providers every three years.
Abortion rights advocates consider medication abortion essential to the future of abortion access in the United States, allowing women who live far from clinics to end their pregnancies without significant travel and financial hurdles.
The U.S. Supreme Court could overhaul abortion rights as soon as this spring, when it is expected to rule on a Mississippi law that bans abortion at 15 weeks. The court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, has signaled its willingness to let that ban stand. Such a ruling would undercut the 1973 Roe v. Wade case that established the right to end pregnancy before the fetus is viable, at around 24 weeks. If Roe is overturned, some two dozen states would move quickly to ban abortion.
""Particularly if patients are living in states where abortion is banned, patients may be able to access medication abortion through the internet,"" said Elizabeth Nash, a state policy expert at Guttmacher. ""For many people, it may be easier to access abortion care through the internet rather than travel hundreds of miles to get to a facility.""
Abortion opponents see limiting access to the pills as a new front in their fight to end abortion. So far this year, at least 16 state legislatures have introduced bills that would restrict the administration of abortion pills or ban their use altogether, according to Guttmacher.
The use of medication to terminate a pregnancy up to 10 weeks was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2000. The method involves two drugs, taken over a day or two. The first, mifepristone, blocks the pregnancy-sustaining hormone progesterone. The second, misoprostol, induces uterine contractions.

For years, the FDA restricted the use of medication abortion with measures like requiring mifepristone to be dispensed in person, rather than allowing it to be prescribed remotely and sent by mail. The FDA eased its restrictions in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic posed a barrier to in-person healthcare. The agency then permanently relaxed its prior restrictions on the pill in December 2021, allowing the drug to be prescribed by certified providers via telemedicine and sent by mail. 
However, laws in some states further limit the accessibility of medication abortion. In 19 states, the physician prescribing the pills must be present for their administration, meaning telemedicine is not allowed.

Rochester District Court Judge Julie Nicholson said prosecutors during a two-day preliminary hearing had presented sufficient cause for James and Jennifer Crumbley to stand trial. 
The case appears to mark the first U.S. case in which the parents of a teenage school shooter have been charged in connection with crimes allegedly committed by their child.Ethan Crumbley, 15, is charged with using the weapon his parents bought him as a Christmas gift to open fire at Oxford High School in Oakland County, Michigan, on Nov. 30, 2021. He has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder charges.
Four students were killed in the rampage and six other students and a teacher were wounded in the attack, the deadliest U.S. school shooting of 2021. 
James Crumbley, 45, and Jennifer Crumbley, 43, have pleaded not guilty in the case. Their attorneys argued during the preliminary hearing that prosecutors had not submitted sufficient evidence to bound them over for trial. 
The Crumbleys both dabbed tears from their eyes during testimony in the case as they sat at the defense table wearing prison garb. Jennifer Crumbley appeared emotional as the judge issued her ruling.
At one point during Thursday's proceedings a defense attorney read excerpts from Ethan Crumbley's journal, in which the teen wrote: ""I hope my parents can forgive me for what I do."" 
The defense asserted that the journal entry proved the boy had not told his parents of his plans. 
Prosecutor Marc Keast read for the court a text message that the teenager had sent to a friend, saying: ""I actually asked my dad to take me to the doctor yesterday, but he just gave me some pills and told me to suck it up."" 

Four days before the shooting, Ethan Crumbley accompanied his father to a gun shop, where James Crumbley bought a 9mm handgun, prosecutors said.
The next day his mother posted on social media that the father and son were at a gun range ""testing out his new Christmas present,"" according to prosecutors.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - From bustling Tokyo to the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea, from Novosibirsk in Siberia to the equatorial city of Quito, from congested Cairo to the desert town of Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, people everywhere comprise a single family.
Researchers on Thursday underscored that point, unveiling the most comprehensive family tree for Homo sapiens ever devised, based upon both modern and ancient genome data from more than 3,600 people from around the world. They dubbed the results the ""genealogy of everyone.""
The study helps delineate human genetic diversity and map out how people globally are related to one another, with our species arising in Africa before fanning out worldwide.
The oldest roots of present-day human genetic variation reach back to northeastern Africa at a time before our species originated, according to Anthony Wilder Wohns, a postdoctoral researcher in genetics at the Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University and lead author of the study published in the journal Science.
""The very earliest ancestors we identify trace back in time to a geographic location that is in modern Sudan. These ancestors lived up to and over one million years ago - which is much older than current estimates for the age of Homo sapiens - 250,000 to 300,000 years ago. So bits of our genome have been inherited from individuals who we wouldn't recognize as modern humans,"" Wohns said.
This million-year-old genetic contribution likely came from the species Homo erectus, Wohns said. Homo erectus, which lived from about 1.9 million years ago to 110,000 years ago, was the first species in the human evolutionary lineage with body proportions resembling our own. 
The study, spearheaded by the University of Oxford's Big Data Institute, also documented how extinct human species such as the Denisovans and Neanderthals left genetic descendants among modern-day people around the world, though not in Africa. 
""For example, people in Papua New Guinea and Oceania have quite large amounts of Denisovan ancestry, but even people living in Europe have some ancestry that looks like these ancient people,"" Wohns said.
The study helped shed light on when and where major population developments unfolded, such as the large-scale ""out of Africa"" migration that led our species to distant locales and occasional interbreeding with Denisovans and Neanderthals.
""Our method uses DNA sequences to learn about the ancestral relationships between individuals. Informally, what we try to do is to trace how genetic mutations, which occurred in our ancestors, and the bits of genome in which they occur have been passed down through the generations to the present day,"" Wohns said.
""Moreover, we can estimate the date and approximate geographic location of ancestors,"" Wohns added.
Other studies have indicated that groups of Homo sapiens departed Africa at various times in the ancient past. The new study suggests that the timing of the most significant departures occurred roughly 72,000 years ago.
The study raises the possibility that our species populated the Americas and Oceania well before the earliest archaeological evidence of human presence in those regions. 
""Our method estimated that there were ancestors in the Americas by 56,000 years ago. We also estimated significant numbers of human ancestors in Oceania - specifically Papua New Guinea - by 140,000 years ago,"" Wohns added. ""But this is not firm evidence like a radiocarbon-dated tool or fossil.""

The researchers built the genealogy using 3,601 genetic samples from people around the world and eight ancient samples, the oldest coming from Neanderthal remains about 110,000 years old from a Siberian cave. They examined genome fragments from 3,500 ancient humans but did not directly incorporate these into the genealogy.
""The story of humanity is written in our genes,"" Wohns said, ""and reconstructing our genealogy allows us to read that history.""

(Reuters) -Florida's House of Representatives on Thursday approved a Republican-backed bill that would prohibit classroom discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity, a measure Democrats denounced as being anti-LGBTQ.
Dubbed the ""don't say gay"" bill by opponents, the legislation is part of a broader political debate in the United States over how sexual orientation and gender identity should be recognized in schools, sports and healthcare settings.
The Florida bill states that ""classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.""
The bill's supporters said it was designed to keep schools from talking about topics young kids were not ready to process. U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, called it ""hateful"" in a tweet earlier this month and pledged that his administration would fight to protect the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community.
While the language only specifically includes young children in those primary school grades, critics said it could be interpreted to extend to all grade levels depending on what is deemed ""age appropriate."" The bill would allow parents to sue school districts in violation.
The measure passed 69-47 on Thursday, with mostly Republican support.
""Little children do not have a fully developed prefrontal cortex. They don't have that ability to understand things at a certain level,"" Republican state Representative Tom Fabricio said during debate ahead of the vote.
State Democratic Representative Mike Grieco slammed the bill as an attack on LGBTQ people.
""This is an anti-gay bill. And if you vote for this anti-gay bill, after today, you can never ever claim to be an ally of the LGBTQ community. In fact, you are voting to be an opponent,"" he told fellow lawmakers.
A companion bill must also be passed in the state Senate before the legislation goes to Governor Ron DeSantis for his signature. DeSantis, a Republican, seemed to signal his support for the bills formally titled ""Parental Rights in Education"" at a public event earlier this month.
""Injecting these concepts about choosing your gender...that is just inappropriate for our schools,"" he told reporters. 
The governor's office did not return a request for comment. The bill would take effect in July if it becomes law.
LGBTQ LEGISLATION
Republican lawmakers across the country have pushed measures seeking to limit children’s education on LGBTQ issues and restrict transgender kids from accessing gender-affirming medical treatment and bathrooms that match their identity.
Democrats have sought to increase children’s freedom to access these services and facilities in accordance with their gender identity.
In Texas this week, Republican Governor Greg Abbott instructed the state's child welfare agency to investigate any gender-affirming medical procedures for transgender youth as ""child abuse."" That move was also widely condemned by LGBTQ advocates, as well as healthcare providers. 
The governor's letter to the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services came after the state attorney general last week wrote that such medical procedures ""can legally constitute child abuse"" under Texas law.

It was not immediately clear how this interpretation of the law could be enforced.
Cathryn Oakley, state legislative director for the Human Rights Campaign, condemned Abbott's move and Florida's bill in a call with reporters on Thursday. She said 2022 is ""poised to become the year of the most anti-LGBTQ legislation"" in the United States.

MEDYKA, Poland/BUCHAREST (Reuters) -Thousands of Ukrainians fleeing war with Russia started arriving in neighbouring central European countries on Thursday and the region braced for many more, setting up reception points and sending troops towards the borders to provide assistance.
The countries on the European Union's eastern flank were all once part of the Moscow-led Warsaw Pact and are now members of NATO. Among them, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania all share land borders with Ukraine.
Russia has launched an all-out invasion of Ukraine by land, air and sea, the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War Two. It has fuelled fears of a massive flood of refugees fleeing Ukraine, a nation of 44 million people. 
At the usually quiet border crossing at Medyka in southern Poland, dozens arrived from Ukraine on foot on Thursday morning, carrying luggage. A line of cars waiting for passage grew longer during the course of the day.
A Polish woman, Olena Bogucka, 39, said she had been waiting for four hours while her Ukrainian husband and child were stuck on the other side.
""You can't get through,"" she said. ""I can't reach them on the phone... I don't how to get my child out... I don't know what to do.""
To facilitate border crossings, Poland lifted quarantine rules on Thursday for people arriving from outside the EU without a lab-certified negative COVID-19 test.
The country is home to the region's largest Ukrainian community, numbering around 1 million, and is the easiest EU country to reach from Kyiv. 
Warsaw called for the ""fiercest possible sanctions"" against Russia.
Elsewhere in the region, Czech President Milos Zeman, long sympathetic to Moscow, called Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""madman."" Prague stopped issuing visas to Russians and ordered the closure of two Russian consulates. 
Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has also forged good ties with Putin, condemned Moscow's actions, too. He said Hungary would prepare humanitarian aid for Ukraine and was ready to receive refugees.
Groups of people fled into Hungary via the Beregsurany and Tiszabecs crossings, some coming from as far as Kyiv, a Reuters eyewitness said. Some arrived by car but many pedestrians were also hauling suitcases across.
""No one wants to get conscripted, no one wants to die,"" said Tamas Bodnar at the border with Hungary. ""It's clear that those who can, they flee.""
Several hundred people also left Ukraine from a sliver of its territory sandwiched between Moldova and the Black Sea, crossing into Romania by ferry over the Danube river, local authorities said.
Slovak customs officials said passenger cars were having to wait up to 12 hours at the busiest of Slovakia's three road crossings with Ukraine.
Tens of thousands of Ukrainians work in Slovakia and Hungary, which has a large ethnic minority of around 140,000 living just inside Ukraine's border. 
HOSPITALS ON STANDBY
Poland was preparing a medical train to transport wounded Ukrainians and drew up a list of 1,230 hospitals that could admit the injured, the health ministry said. The Polish army raised the level of preparedness of some units.
""We will do everything to ensure that every person who enters the territory of Poland has access to healthcare, including hospitalisation,"" the ministry said.
Poland set up reception points for refugees near border crossings.
Slovakia also said it was ready to help refugees.
""Please let's have compassion and understanding for them,"" Prime Minister Eduard Heger said. 
Slovakia will send up to 1,500 troops to its border with Ukraine and additional crossings will be set up, said Defence Minister Jaroslav Nad. Hungary has also said it will send troops to its border to help process refugees.
The governor of Slovakia's eastern Kosice region, Rostislav Trnka, told Reuters around 2,000 beds and some 60 gyms had been prepared to help house refugees.
The Czech Republic, which does not border Ukraine but is home to 260,000 Ukrainians, also said it was ready to help refugees. Czech Railways offered rail cars with 6,000 seats and beds to help evacuate people if necessary.
Romania is ready to grant humanitarian aid if needed, President Klaus Iohannis said on Thursday, while Bulgarian President Rumen Radev said his country was preparing to evacuate by land more than 4,000 ethnic Bulgarians from Ukraine and was ready to host other Ukrainian refugees. 
A Polish government spokesman said Polish diplomatic missions in Ukraine would remain open ""as long as possible"" but the foreign ministry urged all Polish citizens to leave Ukraine.

Hungary also said its embassy in Kyiv remained open. The Czech Republic closed its Kyiv embassy but its consulate in the western city of Lviv remained open.
Germany offered humanitarian help to countries bordering Ukraine. German media have cited estimates that between 200,000 and one million people may flee to the EU from Ukraine.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Police on Thursday detained more than 1,600 Russians who protested against Russia's multi-pronged military operation in Ukraine, while authorities threatened to block media reports that contain what Moscow described as ""false information"". 
In acts of cautious, but unusual dissent, Russian pop stars, journalists, a television comedian and a footballer opposed the war online after President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine in the early hours of Thursday.
By 1939 GMT, police had detained 1,667 people at rallies in 53 cities, the OVD-Info rights monitor said, easily the biggest tally since last year's crushing of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny's network ushered in an ice age in activism. 
Protesters defied a warning issued on Thursday by the Investigative Committee, a kind of Russian answer to the FBI, that explicitly threatened criminal action and even jail time for people calling for or taking part in protests. 
""I was detained on my way out of the house,"" Marina Litvinovich, a Moscow-based activist, wrote on Telegram after she called on Russians in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Thursday morning to protest later that evening.
""We will be cleaning up this mess for years to come. Not even us. But our children and grandchildren,"" she said as she announced the protest. ""All we see is the agony of a dying man. Alas, Russia is in agony."" 
Hundreds of people rallied in cities including Moscow, St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg, chanting slogans like ""no to war!"" and holding up makeshift signs. One person waved a Ukrainian flag. 
Police in Moscow said they had detained 600 people. Authorities in the capital have banned any form of protest, citing the COVID-19 pandemic. 
From jail where he appeared at a hearing, Navalny condemned the war as a attempt by the Kremlin to distract from domestic problems like poverty, though it was unclear if he understood the full scale of the invasion from behind bars. 
""I'm against this war ... It was unleashed to conceal the robbery of Russia's citizens ... and this war will lead to an enormous number of victims from both sides, ruined lives and a continuation of the impoverishment of Russian citizens,"" the anti-corruption activist said in footage of the remarks aired by his spokesperson. 
'FEAR AND PAIN' 
The displays of opposition to war were often not overtly directed at Putin, whose verbal attack on Ukraine in a speech on Monday set the tone for Thursday's assault. 
But dissent came from unusually mainstream figures such as Ivan Urgant, one of Russia's most famous television comedians, who wrote on Instagram: ""Fear and Pain. NO TO WAR."" 
Maxim Galkin, a television presenter and singer, said: ""I've been in touch with my relatives and friends from Ukraine since morning! I can't explain in words what I feel! How is this possible! No war can be justified! No to war!"" 
Others included Fedor Smolov, a footballer for Russia's national soccer team, Russia's former no. 1 tennis player Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Nobel laureate Dmitry Muratov, chief editor of the Novaya Gazeta newspaper. 
Some of them and other Russians posted a blank, black picture on Instagram to voice opposition. 

Russia's telecommunications regulator warned media organisations on Thursday not to circulate what it described as ""false information"" about Moscow's massive military operation against Ukraine and threatened to block offending content. 
Russia's state communications regulator Roskomnadzor said in a statement that it considered information from Russian official sources as reliable.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Civilians and critical infrastructure such as water and power systems in Ukraine must be protected from attacks in line with the rules of war, United Nations and Red Cross officials said on Thursday as aid agencies struggled to assess damage from Russia's attack.
Ukrainian forces fought Russian invaders around nearly all of the country's perimeter after Russia launched an assault by land, sea and air on Ukraine in the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said that Russia's military action ""clearly violates international law"" and that protecting Ukraine's civilian population was a priority.
The U.N. refugee agency said the situation in Ukraine was quickly deteriorating and appealed to neighbouring countries to keep their borders open to people seeking a safe haven.
Several thousand Ukrainians have crossed into neighbouring countries, mainly Moldova and Romania, while an estimated 100,000 have fled their homes and are uprooted in the country after Russia's invasion, the U.N. refugee agency said.
International Committee of the Red Cross President Peter Maurer, in a statement issued after Moscow's missiles struck major Ukrainian cities including the capital Kyiv, said that all warring sides must respect international humanitarian law.
""They must refrain from attacks that violate the rules of the conduct of hostilities or prohibitions on means and methods of warfare. The use of weapons with wide area effects should be avoided in populated areas,"" Maurer said. 
""Essential infrastructure must be spared, including water, gas and electrical systems that, for instance, provide civilian homes, schools and medical facilities with vital water and electricity supplies,"" he added.
Security permitting, ICRC teams would continue to repair vital infrastructure, supply health facilities with medicines and equipment, and families with food and other items, he said.
The agency, which already had some 600 aid workers across Ukraine, including 400 in the east, has been helping repair two water pumping stations in the Donetsk region damaged by weekend shelling that left 1 million people without water.

""Today it has not been possible to go out and assess damages or provide humanitarian support because the security situation has not allowed it,"" Martin Schuepp, ICRC regional director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, told Reuters in an interview at ICRC headquarters.
""As soon as the situation allows, it will be our priority to go and assess the situation of hospitals, water infrastructure and other critical infrastructure to see how we can best help,"" he said.

The race, one of the most prestigious events on the global running calendar, was cancelled in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic and returned last year with a reduced field of 30,000 runners amid a number of safety protocols.
""Last year's marathon served as an uplifting and unifying moment for New York City's recovery as well as a symbol of renewed hope, inspiration, and perseverance,"" New York City Marathon Race Director Ted Metellus said in a news release.
""This November, we are excited to have runners from all over the world fully return as we come together to deliver one of the best days in New York.”

Organisers said this year's marathon, scheduled for Nov. 6, will require runners to be fully vaccinated. Many event elements will be restored, including on-course entertainment.
The 26.2-mile (42.16 km) run through the city's five boroughs typically draws hundreds of thousands of people along the race course in a city-wide celebration.

MEDYKA, Poland (Reuters) - Ukrainians fleeing a Russian invasion have started trickling into Poland, with dozens arriving at the normally quiet Medyka crossing on Thursday, some carrying luggage and accompanied by children.
Officials in European Union countries bordering Ukraine, including Romania and Slovakia, said there was no big influx of refugees for now, but local media and witnesses said foot traffic was increasing.
Alexander Bazhanov fled his home in eastern Ukraine with his wife and young child, taking only what they could carry and walking the final part of their journey into Poland.
The 34-year-old technical manager from Mariupol, 113 km (70 miles) from Donetsk, decided to cross into Poland when he learned the war had started from a colleague.
""I don't have any feelings other than that I am very scared,"" Bazhanov said at the pedestrian border crossing, about 400 km from Warsaw. ""I will visit my father in Spain but I don't have any money and I don't know how I will do that.""
Russian forces invaded Ukraine by land, air and sea on Thursday after President Vladimir Putin authorised what he called a special military operation in the east.
Central European nations that share a border with Ukraine have for weeks braced for an expected flood of refugees searching for sanctuary within the European Union.
The Medyka crossing is largely used by people going shopping across the border or travelling for work. 
Lines to enter the Polish border town grew during the morning. Some people said they feared Russia could push far into Ukraine.
""Everybody thought western Ukraine was safe because it was close to EU and NATO nations,"" said Maria Palys, 44, who was travelling with her family and that of her brother. ""It seems like it is not the right protection.""
Russia has demanded an end to NATO's eastward expansion and Putin repeated his position that Ukrainian membership of the U.S.-led military alliance would be unacceptable.

Putin said he had authorised military action after Russia had been left with no choice but to defend itself against what he said were threats from modern Ukraine, a democratic state of 44 million people.
News of the invasion spurred Olga Pavlusik and her boyfriend Bohdan Begey to rush to the border, leaving their dog at home in their town in western Ukraine. They have no destination in mind. ""Anywhere safe will be fine,"" she told Reuters.

LONDON (Reuters) - A humpback whale, likely lured by a trawling net capturing masses of Antarctic krill, became entangled last month and died in the Southern Ocean. Three dead juveniles were caught in the same company's krill nets last year.
Scientists say the humpbacks may have been malnourished while forced to compete for food with a burgeoning industry harvesting the tiny crustaceans - the linchpin in the Antarctic food web - for use in pharmaceuticals and fish feed.
The fishing company, Norway's Aker BioMarine, said these were its first cases of whale bycatch in 15 years of harvesting krill in Antarctica, and that it has since reinforced its ships' devices for keeping marine mammals out of its nets.
Pål Skogrand, director of Antarctic affairs and sustainability at Aker BioMarine, said the company ""has no desire"" to be part of this global problem. 
But with the krill industry set to grow significantly in the next decade - as nations including China and Russia plan new investments in the business - scientists and conservationists fear krill trawling could further imperil Antarctic wildlife.
The krill trawlers target the same foraging grounds as fur seals, humpback whales, and blue whales. Penguins are also struggling when fishing vessels are nearby, with studies describing the birds having to swim for longer periods in search of food for their chicks.
""Krill fishing is an acute example that we are fishing down the food web,"" said Teale Phelps Bondaroff of the conservation non-profit OceansAsia. ""That doesn't bode well for our global fisheries. It means we're getting to the end of what's available in our oceans.""
POLAR ABUNDANCE
The icy waters off Antarctica are estimated to hold between 300 million and 500 million tonnes of krill - nearly as weighty as all of the world's cattle.
This perceived abundance led Soviet fishing fleets to target Antarctic krill in the 1970s, scooping up hundreds of thousands of tonnes per year until the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
Their surveys make Antarctic krill relatively well researched, compared with the 84 other krill species in the world's oceans. Governments have resisted opening new krill fisheries due to conservation concerns, though both Japan and Canada operate small krill fisheries in the North Pacific.
On the southernmost continent, about 11 vessels from China, Norway, South Korea, Ukraine and Chile trawl the region's choppy waters from December to July. Under established rules within the Antarctic Treaty System, trawlers must stay largely confined to four areas off the Antarctic Peninsula, with a seasonal catch capped at 620,000 tonnes - less than 2% of the species.
Due to the expense and ice cover, fishing vessels have yet to take the full quota. But in 2020, they scooped up 450,000 tonnes - the most recorded in decades. China more than doubled its take from the previous year.
""If we introduce just a couple more big trawlers we will reach (620,000) tonnes very easily,"" said Rodolfo Werner, senior advisor of the Antarctic and Southern Coalition, a group of environmental non-profits. ""This has always been our concern."" 
The world's krill industry is still modest in economic terms. But it is growing fast, with the $531-million market for krill oil - one of the key products - projected to rise to $941 million by 2026, according to a report last month by Global Industry Analysts.
Fish farming, for which krill is used as feed, is the world's fastest growing food sector, with analysts expecting global demand for fish to double by 2050.
""Krill contain so many good elements, such as omega-3s,"" said Skogrand, disputing the argument that krill should be left to nourish wildlife alone. That's ""not the way to secure food production in the world.""
Norway's Aker BioMarine, which accounts for more than 60% of today's krill catch, added a third ship to its fleet in 2019, as the company ""increased our catches significantly in the past five to ten years,"" said Skogrand. 
Contacted by Reuters, Chinese companies involved in krill fishing declined to comment. The country's fishery management bureau said last year its krill fishing fleets had reached an ""international level"" of efficiency, citing unspecified breakthroughs in industrializing krill production.
In a statement to Reuters, the foreign ministry said China ""attaches a great importance to conservation and rational use of the marine biological resources of Antarctica."" 
China ""will definitely grow,"" said Dimitri Sclabos, the CEO of the Chile-based krill consultancy Tharos. ""They have built several factories for extracting krill oil. There's a huge market.""
Russia has announced plans to invest 45 billion roubles ($604 million) in the fishery, including building five high-tonnage trawlers.
""The development of krill fishing is part of the policy of the Russian Federation to renew the activities of the Russian fishing fleet in remote areas of the world ocean,"" Russia's state fishing agency told Reuters in a written statement.
SUPPLY PRESSURE
Mindful of the threat krill fishing poses to penguins, eight krill fishing companies in 2018 pledged to stay at least 30 km away from key breeding colonies during incubation and chick-rearing season. An analysis for Reuters by the Global Fishing Watch monitoring agency found that since 2019 the trawlers in operation have upheld that promise.
Even without competition from fisheries, the krill supply is under increasing pressure due to both climate change and a partial rebound in whale numbers since the end of commercial whaling. A 2016 study in the journal Geophysical Research Letters found warmer waters and increased ice melt could drive krill numbers down about 30 percent this century.
""We have limited knowledge of the resiliency of krill to warming,"" Bettina Meyer, a marine biologist at the Alfred Wegener Institute, told Reuters by phone while conducting krill research for Aker BioMarine aboard the Antarctic Endurance.
Polar scientists say even current limits on Antarctic krill fisheries may not go far enough to safeguard the food supply for wildlife. A single humpback whale in the West Antarctic Peninsula eats up to 3.1 tonnes of krill a day. The region has an estimated 3,000 humpbacks.
The seasonal catch ""is actually being taken from a much smaller area than for which it was appropriately calculated,"" said George Watters, director of Antarctic research at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. He led a February 2020 study published in Scientific Reports that found penguins were failing to raise as many chicks when 10% or more of the krill was removed from a nearby area.
In October, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources will consider revising catch limits and trawling zones, due to conservation concerns. It declined to give details of the proposed changes. Approval requires a consensus vote by all 26 commission members.

Scientists fear some nations may object to stricter measures. Beijing and Moscow have been notable opponents of efforts to establish Marine Protected Areas in the region.
The Russian state fishing agency, noting the ""impressive"" krill stocks in the region, said any changes would have to be ""clearly justified"" by scientific evidence. ""There are not many areas open to fishing.""

(Reuters) - Ukrainian forces are defending against an invasion on three sides by a Russian military that is bigger, better armed and steeped in recent combat experience from Syria's civil war.
Missiles struck Ukrainian cities on Thursday, and Ukraine reported columns of troops pouring across its borders from Russia and Belarus and landing on its Black Sea and Azov Sea coasts.
Russia's objective remained unclear but the capital Kyiv was clearly a principal target, with President Vladimir Putin saying he intended to ""strive for the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine"".
""The Russian military command will be wanting to move very quickly, particularly to isolate and then take over Kyiv, to prevent a coherent Ukrainian defence from forming and, if they can, disrupt the movement of Ukrainian reserves,"" said Ben Barry, senior fellow for land warfare at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).
A Ukrainian presidential adviser said Hostomel airfield, northwest of the capital, had been captured by Russian forces - something Barry said would enable them to fly in extra hardware including light armoured vehicles to intensify the assault.
The Russian advances along the Azov Sea coast and near Kharkiv in the northeast also suggested an attempt to encircle Ukrainian forces in the east of the country, he said.
The United States estimated Russia had more than 150,000 troops massed around Ukraine's borders on the eve of the invasion, plus tens of thousands of Russian-backed fighters in breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine.
Ukraine's total active armed forces number 196,600, according to the authoritative IISS Military Balance report released last week.
But while highly motivated to defend the country, and newly equipped with Turkish drones and U.S. and British anti-tank missiles, analysts say they are gapingly vulnerable, in particular to air and missile attack. Ukraine's navy is limited to one major warship and a dozen patrol craft, against the might of Russia's Black Sea Fleet.
MOBILE VERSUS STATIC
Ukraine's experience from eight years of fighting with separatist forces in the east has been dominated by static World War One-style trench warfare.
By contrast Russia's forces showed in Syria, where they intervened on the side of President Bashar al-Assad, that they are capable of moving swiftly across large distances, assembling floating bridges to cross rivers, and synchronising ground manoeuvres with air and drone attacks.
Russia's air force delivered tens of thousands of air strikes, inflicting thousands of civilian casualties, according to the Syrian opposition. Tens of thousands of Russian service personnel saw duty in Syria, and senior land, air and special operations (Spetsnaz) personnel were cycled through tours of duty, according to Barry.
Russian soldiers gained extensive experience of urban warfare alongside Assad's allies from Lebanon's Hezbollah, which could prove valuable if battles ensue for major Ukrainian cities.
Analysts at Janes, a defence intelligence provider, said Russia had also used the Syrian intervention to test new and modernised air, ground and naval equipment including next-generation Su-57 fighter jets and Kalibr cruise missiles.

""To prevail against Russia, the Ukrainian forces are going to have to display a very high standard of tactics, be very bold and resolute and have a campaign plan that is superior to Russia's,"" said Barry.
""The one advantage the Ukrainians have got is they're fighting for their own country on their soil. Secondly, it appears large numbers of civilians are volunteering to fight alongside the armed forces, and that may make any Russian attacks on urban areas more difficult.""

NICOSIA/LONDON (Reuters) - A 24-year-old videogame designer who runs his small business out of a home next to an old Cypriot church in a quiet suburb of Nicosia now finds himself entangled in a global crisis following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Polis Trachonitis' firm, Hermetica Digital Ltd, has been implicated by U.S. researchers in a data-shredding cyberattack that hit hundreds of computers in Ukraine, Lithuania, and Latvia.
Discovered on Wednesday night just hours before Russian troops rolled into Ukraine, the cyberattack was widely seen as the opening salvo of Moscow's invasion.
The malware had been signed using a digital certificate with Hermetica Digital's name on it, according to the researchers, some of whom have started calling the malicious code ""HermeticWiper"" because of the connection.
Trachonitis told Reuters he had nothing to do with the attack. He said he never sought a digital certificate and had no idea one had been issued to his firm.
He said his role in the videogame industry is just to write the text for games that others put together.
""I don't even write the code – I write stories,"" he said, adding that he was unaware of the connection between his firm and the Russian invasion until he was told by a Reuters reporter on Thursday morning.
""I'm just a Cypriot guy ... I have no link to Russia.""
The extent of the damage caused by the malware attack was not clear, but cybersecurity firm ESET said the malicious code had been found installed on ""hundreds of machines"".
Western leaders have warned for months that Russia could conduct destructive cyberattacks against Ukraine ahead of an invasion.
Last week, Britain and the United States said Russian military hackers were behind a spate of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that briefly knocked Ukrainian banking and government websites offline.
DIGITAL CERTIFICATE
Cyber spies routinely steal random strangers' identities to rent server space, or register malicious websites.
The Hermetica Digital certificate was issued in April 2021, but the time stamp on the malicious code itself was Dec. 28, 2021.
ESET researchers said in a blog post that those dates suggested that ""the attack may have been in the works for some time.""
If, as is widely assumed by cybersecurity experts and U.S. defence officials, the attacks were carried out by Russians, then the time stamps are potentially significant data points for observers hoping to understand when the plan for the invasion of Ukraine came together. 
ESET's head of threat research, Jean-Ian Boutin, told Reuters there were various ways in which a malicious actor could fraudulently obtain a code signing certificate.
""They can obviously obtain it themselves, but they can also buy it in the black market,"" Boutin said.
""As such, it is possible that the operation dates back further than we previously knew, but it is also possible that the threat actor acquired this code signing certificate recently, just for this campaign.""
Ben Read, director of cyber espionage analysis at Mandiant, said it was possible that a group could ""impersonate a company in communications with a digital cert providing company and get a legitimate cert fraudulently issued to them.""

Cybersecurity firm Symantec (NASDAQ:NLOK) said organisations in the financial, defence, aviation and IT services sectors had been targeted in Wednesday's attack. DigiCert, the company that issued the digital certificate, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Juan-Andres Guerrero-Saade, a cybersecurity researcher at digital security firm  SentinelOne  (NYSE:S), said the purpose of the attack was clear: ""This was meant to damage, disable, signal and cause havoc.""

KYIV (Reuters) -The mayor of Kyiv imposed a curfew on Thursday after Russia invaded Ukraine and the capital echoed throughout the day to the sound of gunfire, sirens and explosions.
Many people tried to flee for safer areas, snarling traffic. Black smoke rose from a defence ministry headquarters, a missile caused minor damage after landing in the city and officials said a nearby airport was attacked.
But people were defiant as Mayor Vitaly Klitschko declared a curfew from 10 p.m. until 7 a.m., saying transport would be halted overnight and subway stations used as round-the-clock shelters because of ""conditions of military aggression"".
""The mood is patriotic,"" said a driver waiting in a huge traffic jam on a road heading west out of the city.
Identifying himself only as Aleksander from the western city of Lviv, he said: ""We will fight this off. Ukraine will win, no matter what."" 
Some residents chose to stay, and stood in long lines outside banks and shops hoping to draw money and stock up on supplies. But others packed bags and suitcases and looked for a way out of the city - by bus, car or plane.
Traffic came to a standstill on the four-lane main road to Lviv, far from the areas considered most likely to be attacked after President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion.
""I'm going away because a war has started, Putin attacked us,"" said Oxana, stuck in the traffic jam with her three-year-old daughter on the back seat. ""We're afraid of bombardments.""
She said her immediate aim was to get out of Kyiv, a city of about 3 million. Then she would decide where to go.
'REAL MEN' AND 'PATRIOTS'
Another driver stuck in traffic called ""on real men, on patriots"" to mobilise. 
""I believe we need to get our act together and give a stern reply to the Russian aggression,"" he said, without giving his name. ""Please forgive me for saying this but I think we must fight all those who invade our country so strongly. I would hang every single one of them from bridges."" 
Even after weeks of warnings by Ukrainian and Western politicians that a Russian attack was imminent, some people were caught off guard. 
""I didn't expect this. Until this morning I believed nothing would happen,"" said Nikita, a 34-year-old marketing specialist, as he waited in a long line at a supermarket with bottles of water piled high in his shopping cart. ""I packed, bought food and will stay at home with my family.""
Some who wanted to leave feared chaos or the military situation would prevent them leaving.

A traveller at the main airport who gave her name only as Gulnara said her flight to Baku had been cancelled.
""No one is telling us what happened, what will happen to our flight, what should we do, where to go. We have no place to go to. No one is responding to us,"" she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden met with his counterparts from the Group of Seven allies on Thursday morning to map out more severe measures against Russia after President Vladimir Putin launched what Biden called ""a premeditated war"" against Ukraine.
Biden, who spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy late on Wednesday, convened his National Security Council earlier on Thursday to discuss the latest developments in Ukraine, according to a White House official. 
He planned to make his first public remarks on the new conflict in Ukraine at 12:30 p.m. EST (1730 GMT), the White House said. Biden and his G7 colleagues are scrambling to respond to a worst-case scenario by imposing harsh sanctions on Russia that may cause gasoline prices in the West to go up.
The virtual meeting between the United States and its allies ended at 10:27 a.m., the White House official said.
Biden met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President Charles Michel, and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.
The group was looking at ways to respond to what Biden in a statement late Wednesday called ""an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces"" on Ukraine.
""President (Vladimir) Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,"" Biden wrote.
It came shortly after Putin told Russian state TV he had authorized a military operation in eastern Ukraine and explosions were heard in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv and the breakaway eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk.
Biden will announce ""the further consequences the United States and our allies and partners will impose on Russia"" later on Thursday, the White House said. 
The U.S. president said Washington would also coordinate with NATO allies ""to ensure a strong, united response that deters any aggression against the alliance."" 
NATO, set to hold an emergency summit on Friday, on Thursday said it was bolstering its troop presence on its eastern flank and putting hundreds of warplanes and ships on alert.
Biden, who served as America's vice president and was deeply engaged in 2014 when Russia annexed the Crimea region of Ukraine, will be joined for the G7 call in the White House Situation Room by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.
The G7 is comprised by the United States, Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Canada and Japan.
TOUGHER SANCTIONS URGED
Biden, who orchestrated an initial round of Western sanctions against Russian oligarchs, financial institutions and exports this week, is under pressure from fellow Democrats and Republicans in Congress to crack down even harder on Moscow.
House of Representatives Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, a fellow Democrat, told CNN on Wednesday that Western actions were being closely watched by China with an eye to whether it could successfully invade Taiwan.
""We have to make sure that if Putin goes forward with this invasion more fully ... that the costs to Putin and Russia are just crippling,"" he said.
Schiff said the United States and its allies should put in place ""the most severe sanctions as soon as possible,"" including a permanent end to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline connecting Russia with Germany under the Baltic Sea.
Republican Senator Rob Portman demanded tough sanctions, rigid export controls and moves to increase military support to Ukraine and other allies, including Poland, Romania and the Baltic countries, in a statement after the Russian attacks.
Top U.S. officials were previously scheduled to brief all members of Congress by phone later on Thursday.
Moscow will pay an even steeper price if it continues its aggression, U.S. officials warned this week.
Washington on Wednesday stepped up pressure on Putin by imposing sanctions on the firm building the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and its corporate officers, a move Biden had waived for months.
Germany on Tuesday froze approvals for the pipeline, which has been built but was not yet in operation, amid concerns it could allow Moscow to weaponize energy supplies to Europe.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday vowed ""a massive package of economic sanctions."" 
Next steps are likely to include sanctions against additional Russian banks, including Sberbank and VTB, steps to bar U.S. financial institutions from processing transactions for major Russian banks, and export controls on U.S. and foreign-made goods, from commercial electronics and computers to semiconductors and aircraft parts.

Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, has complained of regular such missions by the Chinese air force over the last two years, though the aircraft do not get close to Taiwan itself.
The number of aircraft involved was well off the last large-scale incursion, 39 Chinese aircraft on Jan. 23, and since then, such fly-bys have been sporadic with far fewer aircraft. 
The ministry said the latest mission involved eight Chinese J-16 fighters and one Y-8 reconnaissance aircraft, which flew over an area to the northeast of the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands at the top end of the South China Sea.
Taiwanese fighters were sent up to warn the Chinese aircraft and air defence missiles were deployed to ""monitor the activities"", the ministry said, using standard wording for how Taiwan describes its response.
Taiwan has been warily watching the Ukraine crisis, nervous that China may try to take advantage to move on the island.
While Taipei has not reported any unusual movements by Chinese forces, the government has increased its alert level.
China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, and routinely condemns U.S. arms sales or other shows of support from Washington.
Speaking in Beijing earlier on Thursday when asked about the new U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy, Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman Tan Kefei reiterated that Taiwan was a ""core issue"" of China's and it would tolerate no foreign interference.
""We urge the U.S. side to recognise the high sensitivity of the Taiwan issue, stop interfering in China's internal affairs and stop playing with fire on the Taiwan issue,"" Tan said.

In the 12-page Indo-Pacific strategy overview issued earlier this month, the Biden administration vowed to commit more diplomatic and security resources to the region.
On Taiwan, Washington would work with partners inside and outside the region to maintain peace and stability in the strait dividing the island from China, it said.

Hours after the breakaway regions issued their plea, at least five explosions were heard in the separatist-held eastern Ukraine city of Donetsk on Thursday morning, a Reuters witness said. Four military trucks were seen heading to the scene. 
Airlines should stop flying over any part of Ukraine because of the risk of an unintended shootdown or a cyber attack targeting air traffic control amid tensions with Russia, a conflict zone monitor said.
""Russia has positioned its forces at the final point of readiness,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told NBC Nightly News. ""Everything seems to be in place for Russia to engage in a major aggression against Ukraine."" 
The United Nations Security Council will discuss the stand-off on Wednesday night, diplomats said, in the 15-member body's second late night meeting on the crisis this week. 
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen spoke separately with her counterparts from Britain and Canada, with officials planning to stay in close touch on potential further responses. G7 leaders are also due to talk on Thursday. 
Convoys of military equipment including nine tanks were seen moving towards Donetsk earlier on Wednesday from the direction of the Russian border, a Reuters witness reported.
Shelling has intensified since Russian President Vladimir Putin recognised two separatist regions as independent and ordered the deployment of what he called peacekeepers, a move the West calls the start of an invasion.
Moscow has long denied that it has plans to invade despite massing tens of thousands of troops near its neighbor.
""I am asking for help to repel the Ukrainian regime's military aggression against the population of the Donetsk People's Republic,"" said Denis Pushilin who heads the area Moscow recognised as independent, according to TASS news agency.
The White House rejected the separatist plea for help as another Russian ""false flag"" operation, a fake crisis manufactured to justify greater intervention. 
""This is an example of it,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters. ""That is suggesting that they feel under threat. By whom? The Ukrainians that the Russians are threatening to attack?""
U.N. chief Antonio Guterres has dismissed claims of a genocide in eastern Ukraine. Under international law, genocide is an intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.
WAR FOOTING? 
A total of 80% of the soldiers assembled are in a position to launch a full-scale invasion on Ukraine, a senior U.S. defence official said.
Satellite imagery taken on Wednesday showed new deployments in western Russia, many of them within 10 miles (16 km) of the border with Ukraine and less than 50 miles from the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, U.S. satellite company Maxar said. 
The images showed field deployment, military convoys, artillery and armoured personnel carriers with support equipment and troops. The images could not be independently verified by Reuters.
Russia has partially closed airspace in the Rostov flight information region to the east of its border with Ukraine ""in order to provide safety"" for civil aviation flights, according to its notice to airmen.
A 30-day state of emergency in Ukraine restricting the freedom of movement of conscripted reservists, curbing the media and imposing personal document checks, according to a draft text, begins on Thursday. 
The Ukrainian government has also announced compulsory military service for all men of fighting age. 
While the West has held off the most stringent sanctions measures it could impose, the United States stepped up the pressure by imposing sanctions on the firm building the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and its corporate officers.
Germany on Tuesday froze approvals for the pipeline, which has been built but was not yet in operation, amid concerns it could allow Moscow to weaponize energy supplies to Europe.
The rouble plunged more than 3% as the European Union blacklisted Russian lawmakers, freezing their assets and banning travel. Wall Street slipped on news of security measures taken by Ukraine's government.
'SILENCE' ON TALKS 
Ukrainian government websites, which have experienced outages in recent weeks blamed by Kyiv on cyber attacks, were again offline on Wednesday. Ukraine's parliament, cabinet and foreign ministry websites were affected.
Moscow has described warnings of an invasion as anti-Russian hysteria. On Wednesday, it took down flags from its embassy in Kyiv, having ordered its diplomats to evacuate for safety reasons.
Ukraine's military said one soldier had been killed and six wounded in increased shelling by pro-Russian separatists using heavy artillery, mortar bombs and Grad rocket systems in the two breakaway areas in the last 24 hours.
Russia says the crisis is a dispute with the West, demanding security guarantees, including a promise never to allow Ukraine to join NATO.
But the recognition of the separatist regions was accompanied by much stronger language against Ukraine, which Putin called an artificial construct wrongly carved out of Russia by its enemies.
While both sides have said they are still open to diplomacy to resolve the crisis, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Moscow had approved an offensive and not replied to an invitation for talks.
""Today I initiated a telephone conversation with the President of the Russian Federation. The result was silence,"" he said.

Bombardments were carried out for a second day in Nan Mei Khon village in Kayah, a state bordering Thailand where soldiers have met months of resistance from the Karenni National Defence Force (KNDF), one of several militia groups that is challenging the junta's rule. 
Myanmar's military council could not immediately be reached for comment on Thursday and state media outlets have not mentioned the fighting. 
The Free Burma Rangers, a relief organisation operating in the area, shared footage from a day earlier of houses ablaze in the village with the sound of artillery exploding nearby. 
""Bombing again today on 24 February 2022. Also mortar attacks and infantry assault in this area. Thousands fleeing again,"" the group's founder, David Eubank, said in a text message.
Eubank said two people were killed and three were wounded on Wednesday. The Myanmar Now news site reported three were killed in another village attacked by a jet on Wednesday. 
A KNDF representative was unable to confirm reports of casualties but said heavy fighting had taken place since Wednesday. Reuters was unable to independently verify the information. 
The military ruled Myanmar for five decades until 2011 but is struggling to consolidate power this time as it faces protests in cities, armed conflict on several fronts and sanctions imposed to isolate generals who overthrew a democratically elected government last year.
At least 90,000 people have since been displaced by fighting in Kayah state, according to the United Nations humanitarian agency, which estimates 441,000 people have fled unrest in Myanmar since the coup.
Human rights groups have accused the military of using disproportionate force in civilian areas. The military says it is fighting ""terrorists"". 
A rescue worker, who declined to be identified for safety reasons, told Reuters that heavy bombardment was complicating efforts to move civilians to relief camps. 
""Thousands of people are stuck,"" the rescue worker said. 
""We weren't able to get them out of the area yet...They are attacking the people by air, by land and also with heavy weapons.""

KYIV (Reuters) - Volodymyr Zelenskiy swept to power three years ago promising to end a war with Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. He now faces a Russian invasion that could result in the overthrow of his government and the end of Ukrainian democracy.
As Russia rained missiles down on Ukrainian cities including Kyiv on Thursday, Zelenskiy appealed to all citizens to defend Ukraine, saying weapons would be given to all who wanted them.
""Russia treacherously attacked our state this morning, as Nazi Germany did during World War Two, "" Zelenskiy told Ukrainians in a national address.
""Russia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself and won't give up its freedom, no matter what Moscow thinks."" 
It is a disastrous outcome for Zelenskiy, a 44-year-old former comic actor whose increasingly insistent calls over the past two years for NATO to admit Ukraine, an ex-Soviet republic, have infuriated Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Moscow had demanded that NATO promise never to take in Ukraine, a country of huge geopolitical, historic and cultural importance to Russia, a demand rebuffed by the West. Putin on Monday rejected Ukraine's right to exist as an independent state, saying it is effectively part of Russia.
In recent weeks, Zelenskiy has drawn praise from Western leaders for his composure and his appeals to Ukrainians not to panic as Russia massed up to 150,000 troops near the border.
He also criticised foreign embassies and Ukrainian businessmen for leaving Ukraine for security reasons, and renewed his call for companies to stay put, saying they risked inadvertently helping Putin's efforts to destabilise Ukraine.
SERVANT OF THE PEOPLE
But Zelenskiy is an unlikely wartime leader. He shot to fame in a popular television series ""Servant of the People"" in which he played an honest school teacher who is elected president and outwits crooked lawmakers and shadowy businessmen.
Winning the presidency by a landslide in April 2019, he pledged to tackle the corruption that has blighted Ukraine's transition from communism to democracy. But Russia has always posed the biggest challenge to his aspirations to build a modern, democratic and stable European country.
His Servant of the People party - named after the TV series - won a big majority in a July 2019 parliamentary election and Zelenskiy initially pursued confidence-building measures with Russia in eastern Ukraine, including prisoner exchanges.
But that minor thaw did not last long. Russia, which in 2014 seized Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, continued to back armed separatists battling Kyiv's forces in the mainly Russian-speaking Donbass region of eastern Ukraine in a conflict that Zelenskiy says has claimed at least 15,000 lives to date.
Risking Moscow's ire, Zelenskiy courted Western leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden at talks in the White House on Sept. 1, 2021.
""Everyone should understand...that we are at war, that we are defending democracy in Europe and defending our country, and therefore you cannot just talk to us with phrases about reforms,"" Zelenskiy said a June 2021 interview.
""Every day we prove that we are ready to be in the (NATO) alliance more than most of the countries of the European Union.""
'A NEW FACE'
Zelenskiy rode a wave of public discontent with Ukraine's corrupt political elite to victory over wealthy businessman Petro Poroshenko in 2019.
Asked by Reuters ahead of that election how he differed from other presidential hopefuls, Zelenskiy pointed to his face, saying: ""This is a new face. I have never been in politics."" 
""I have not deceived people. They identify with me because I am open, I get hurt, I get angry, I get upset... If I'm inexperienced in something, I'm inexperienced. If I don't know something, I honestly admit it.""
But despite his promises to curb the influence of tycoons in politics, Zelenskiy has had to fend off suspicion that he is a puppet of Ihor Kolomoisky, an oligarch whose TV channel aired ""Servant of the People"".

Zelenskiy was also drawn unwittingly into U.S. politics after a phone call in which then-President Donald Trump tried to get him to investigate his Democratic rival Biden over business deals in Ukraine.
The Democrat-led U.S. House of Representatives impeached Trump after an inquiry concluded he had withheld military aid from Ukraine in order to influence Kyiv. Trump denied wrongdoing and the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate later acquitted him.

Reuters reported last week that a U.S.-Iranian deal was taking shape to revive the pact, abandoned in 2018 by then-U.S. President Donald Trump, who also reimposed extensive sanctions on Iran.
Iran's top security official, Ali Shamkhani, said it was possible to achieve a good agreement after significant progress in the negotiations in Vienna. 
However, he added: ""To resolve the remaining crucial issues, Western political decision-making is necessary to balance the accord.""
Shamkhani is secretary of Iran's Supreme National Council, which reports directly to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
""Being near the finish line is no guarantee of crossing it” and sealing an accord, Ali Bagheri Kani, Iran's chief negotiator at the Vienna talks, said in a tweet.
""It requires extra caution, much perseverance, additional creativity and a balanced approach to take the last step,"" he added.

Diplomats said a vague mention of other issues in a draft text of the agreement was a reference to the unfreezing of billions of dollars in Iranian funds in South Korean banks, and the release of Western prisoners held in Iran. 
Iran on Wednesday urged Western powers to be ""realistic"" in the talks and said Bagheri Kani was returning to Tehran for consultations, suggesting a breakthrough was not imminent.

(Reuters) -The trial of a white former Kentucky police officer charged with wanton endangerment during the 2020 shooting death of Breonna Taylor began on Wednesday, casting a spotlight on another case in the United States that sparked a summer of protests against racial injustice two years ago.
Detective Brett Hankison, 45, whose stray bullets hit a neighboring apartment in the city of Louisville during a botched execution of a search warrant in March 2020, was the only officer charged in the case.
Kentucky Assistant Attorney General Barbara Whaley reminded the jury in her opening argument on Wednesday that the case was not about Taylor. Rather, she said it concerned whether Hankison exhibited ""extreme indifference to human life"" when firing the bullets that endangered Taylor's neighbors, shattered their glass patio door, and caused drywall to fall on one of them, Cody Etherton.
Etherton testified on Wednesday that he awoke that March night to a boom, then heard several shots and felt debris falling on him after he left his room. 
When his glass patio door shattered, Etherton said he went to check it out, whereupon officers pointed guns at him and told him to put his hands out through the broken glass. ""It was just reckless,"" he said. 
""There's not going to be any dispute about the evidence,"" said Hankison's attorney, Stew Mathews, in his opening argument. ""The issue is, what was the reasoning behind his firing those shots?""
The death of Taylor, a 26-year-old Black emergency medical technician who was unarmed, along with the killings of two Black men - George Floyd in Minneapolis and Ahmaud Arbery in Brunswick (NYSE:BC), Georgia - captured international attention and sparked weeks of protests over police violence against Blacks and other minority groups.
Calls to ban no-knock warrants also intensified after the death of Taylor, who was not the subject of the search warrant.
Hankison's trial in Jefferson County Circuit Court has failed to satisfy activists who believe police got off too easily after Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, the lead investigator, said police were justified in using deadly force.
The charge against Hankison, who pleaded not guilty, is a Class D felony punishable by up to five years in prison. Jury selection began on Feb. 3.
A grand jury cleared the two white officers who actually shot Taylor but found reason to charge Hankison for endangering neighbors in the adjacent apartment. 
When police burst into Taylor's home while serving a search warrant, her boyfriend Kenneth Walker, who was with her, fired one round from a 9 mm handgun that he was licensed to carry, wounding one officer in the leg.
Police responded by firing 32 rounds, hitting Taylor six times.
Hankison fired 10 of those shots from outside the apartment and through a sliding glass patio door that had the blinds drawn. Some of his shots pierced the wall and entered the next-door home occupied by a child, a pregnant woman and a man.
Hankison told a grand jury he opened fire once the shooting started. As he saw flashes light up the room, he said he mistakenly believed one of the occupants was holding an AR-15 or other long gun as his colleagues came under assault.
""I thought they were just being executed,"" Hankison said of his fellow officers.
Instead, mostly what he heard was other police firing their weapons. Police Sergeant Jonathan Mattingly, who was wounded by Walker's single shot, fired six times and Detective Myles Cosgrove fired 16 shots, the investigation found.

Police wanted to search the home in connection with a drug investigation in which Taylor's ex-boyfriend was a suspect.
Taylor's family won a $12 million wrongful death settlement from the city of Louisville.

308,"<span>Feb 24, 2022 03:10AM ET</span>","(Reuters) -Ukraine's armed forces are heavily outnumbered and outgunned by Russia's, but as Russia begins what may be a large-scale invasion, military experts say they would be capable of mounting significant resistance and inflicting heavy casualties.
Ukraine's army is also better trained and equipped than in 2014, when Russia captured the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine without a fight, and is widely seen as highly motivated to defend the country's heartland.
Here are some details of Ukraine's military:
HOW DO THE NUMBERS LOOK?
In terms of manpower and weapons, the arithmetic looks grimfor Ukraine.
Most military experts' estimates put the number of Russian troops near Russia's border with Ukraine at more than 100,000. Russia has also moved some troops to Belarus, north of Ukraine, for military drills.
Russia's army has about 280,000 personnel and its combined armed forces total about 900,000, while its 2,840 battle tanks outnumber Ukraine's by more than three to one, according to the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).
Ukraine's prime minister said a decree recently signed by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy - on priority measures to strengthen the state's defence capabilities, increase the attractiveness of military service and the gradual transition to a professional army - would eventually bring Ukraine's armed forces to 361,000 personnel. 
Although Ukraine trebled its defence budget in real terms from2010 to 2020, its total defence expenditure in 2020 amountedto only $4.3 billion, or one-tenth of Russia's.
Military analysts say Ukraine's anti-aircraft and anti-missile defences are weak, leaving it highly vulnerable to Russian strikes on its critical infrastructure. They say Russia would also seek to use its superiority in electronic warfare to paralyse its adversary's command and control and cut off communications with units in the field. 
HOW EXPERIENCED ARE UKRAINE'S FORCES? 
Ukraine's forces have gained combat experience in the Donbass region in the east of the country, where they have been fighting Russia-backed separatists since 2014, and are highly motivated. 
They also have short-range air defences and anti-tank weaponry, including U.S.-supplied Javelin missiles, which would help to slow any Russian advance. 
Beyond the regular army, Ukraine has volunteer territorial defence units and around 900,000 reservists. Most adult males have at least basic military training, so Russia could find itself facing stubborn and protracted resistance if it tried to capture and hold onto territory.
The military challenge would be incomparably higher than in previous wars Russia has fought since the Soviet Union's collapse, including in breakaway Chechnya in the 1990s and against Georgia in 2008. 
WHAT IS THE WEST DOING TO HELP UKRAINE'S MILITARY?
Western countries have stepped up arms deliveries to Ukraine, but Kyiv says it needs more. The United States has ruled out sending U.S. troops to Ukraine to fight. 
The United States has provided more than $2.5 billion in military aid since 2014, including Javelin anti-tank missiles, coastal patrol boats, Humvees, sniper rifles, reconnaissance drones, radar systems, night vision and radio equipment. Further supplies could include Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, small arms and boats.
Turkey has sold Kyiv several batches of Bayraktar TB2 drones, which it deployed against Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.
Britain supplied Ukraine with a reported 2,000 short-range anti-tank missiles in January and sent British specialists to deliver training. It has also provided Saxon armoured vehicles.
Estonia said it was sending Javelin anti-armour missiles and Latvia and Lithuania are providing Stinger missiles. The Czech Republic has said it plans to donate 152mm artillery ammunition.
Germany has ruled out arms deliveries to Ukraine but is co-financing a $6-million field hospital and providing training. 
COULD RUSSIA STAGE A FULL-SCALE INVASION?
Many military analysts say this would be unlikely because it would involve a long and messy war with unavoidably heavy casualties. They expect Russia to opt for crushing air strikes and/or limited land grabs rather than all-out war including battles for major cities.

One option would be for Russia to push south and west from the Donbass region of east Ukraine, already controlled by pro-Russian forces, to link up with annexed Crimea and the Black Sea. There is also a possibility that troops in Belarus could cross Ukraine's northern border as part of an attack.
Putin would be likely to face qualms from his own public about waging war on a fellow Slav nation, as well as intenseanti-Russian sentiment within Ukraine. Russia has already been sanctioned over moving troops into separatist-controlled regions of Ukraine, and will most likely face much harsher ones for a full invasion.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -President Vladimir Putin authorised ""a special military operation"" against Ukraine on Thursday morning to eliminate what he called a serious threat, saying his aim was to demilitarise Russia's southern neighbour. 
In an early morning address on state television, Putin said he had been left with no choice but to launch the operation, the scope of which was not immediately clear but appeared to go well beyond helping Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. 
""I have decided to conduct a special military operation,"" said Putin, seated at a desk in the Kremlin next to a battery of telephones, with the Russian flag behind him. 
""Its goal is to protect people who have been subjected to bullying and genocide... for the last eight years. And for this we will strive for the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine.
""And to bring to court those who committed numerous bloody crimes against civilians, including against citizens of the Russian Federation.""
Ukraine dismisses as invented Russian accusations of genocide against people living in parts of its east seized by Russian-backed separatists in 2014. Kyiv has said Putin was looking for an artificial pretext to attack it.
The Kremlin chief's announcement followed an appeal from the Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine for military help against what they said was growing Ukrainian aggression.
Kyiv has denied any such aggression.
Putin told the Ukrainian military to lay down its weapons and go home.
""I urge you to immediately lay down your weapons and go home. All servicemen of the Ukrainian army who fulfil this demand will be able to freely leave the combat zone and return to their families,"" said Putin who spoke with anger in his voice at times.
A Reuters reporter in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, heard explosions that sounded like artillery shelling in the distance minutes after Putin finished speaking.
""Russia cannot feel safe, develop, and exist with
a constant threat emanating from the territory of modern Ukraine,"" Putin said.
Russia would respond instantly if any external force tried to interfere with its actions, he added.
""Whoever tries to hinder us, and even more so, to create threats to our country, to our people, should know that Russia's response will be immediate. And it will lead you to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history. 
""We are ready for any development of events. All the necessary decisions have been made in this regard. I hope that I will be heard.""

Putin's comments come after the United States said Russia had stationed nearly 150,000 troops near Ukraine's borders.
Putin repeated past complaints about the failure of NATO and the United States to satisfy Russia's security demands.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States and other United Nations Security Council members slammed Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday for attacking Ukraine as the 15-member body met in New York to try and defuse weeks of mounting tensions.
""At the exact time as we are gathered in the council seeking peace, Putin delivered a message of war in total disdain for the responsibility of this Council. This is a grave emergency,"" U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the council.
In an address on Russian state TV, broadcast at the same time as the U.N. Security Council began its meeting in New York, Putin announced his military operation in eastern Ukraine. Russian forces fired missiles at several Ukrainian cities and landed troops on its south coast.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters after the council meeting it was ""the saddest moment"" in his more than five years in the job, appealing: ""President Putin, in the name of humanity bring your troops back to Russia.""
""This conflict must stop now,"" he said.
Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia notified the council of Moscow's move during the meeting, justifying it under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, which covers individual or collective self-defense by states against armed attack. 
Britain's U.N. Ambassador Barbara  Woodward  (NASDAQ:WWD) described Russia's move on Ukraine as ""unprovoked and unjustified.""
French U.N. Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere said: ""This decision - announced at the very moment when the council was meeting - shows the disdain that Russia has for international law and for the United Nations.""
Thomas-Greenfield said she would put forward a U.N. Security Council on Thursday, which de Riviere said would condemn ""the war conducted by Russia."" The move is doomed to fail as it will can be vetoed by Russia, but it gives Washington and allies a chance to try and isolate Moscow over its actions.
Diplomats said the council would likely vote before the end of the week.
""We believe that the door to a peaceful solution to the Ukraine issue is not fully shut, nor should it be,"" China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun told the Security Council as the violence escalated in Ukraine.

Ukraine's U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya said Russia had just declared a war on his country and told Nebenzia at the end of the council meeting: ""There is no purgatory for war criminals. They go straight to hell.""
Nebenzia responded: ""We aren't being aggressive against the Ukrainian people, but against the junta that is in power in Kyiv.""

ADELANTO, Calif. (Reuters) -A group of American truckers began a cross-country drive from California to Washington on Wednesday to protest coronavirus restrictions, taking a cue from demonstrations that paralyzed Canada's capital city, Ottawa, for weeks. 
More than two dozen 18-wheeler trucks, along with some 50 pickups and recreational vehicles, left Adelanto, California, about 80 miles (130 km) northeast of Los Angeles. The self-styled 'People's Convoy' is beginning an 11-day trek to the Beltway, a major highway encircling the U.S. capital, to demand an end to COVID-19 vaccine and mask requirements. 
""This is for our freedoms, our human rights. Enough is enough,"" said Ron Coleman, 61, a trucker from Reno, Nevada, as he prepared to make the 2,500-mile (4,000-km) journey. 
Coleman, a trucker for 45 years, said the group was also pushing for the end to the emergency powers that U.S. politicians have used to enact pandemic-related restrictions. 
Preparations are being made in Washington for the expected arrival of the convoy and other similar protests in the coming days. The Pentagon said it had approved 400 National Guard troops from the District of Columbia, who would not carry weapons, to help at traffic posts from Saturday through March 7.
About 50 tactical vehicles were also approved to be placed at traffic posts. In addition, up to 300 National Guard troops from outside of Washington will assist at traffic posts if needed. 
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was ""confident"" in the security plans to protect Washington around the time of President Joe Biden's State of the Union speech next Tuesday. 
The People's Convoy is expected to arrive in the Washington area on March 5 but there are no plans to go into the District of Columbia proper, according to a statement. 
Brian Brase, a truck driver and one of the organizers, said regardless of where the trucks stop, ""we're not going anywhere"" until the group's demands are met. 
Brase said he expected thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, would participate. Organizers bill the convoy as nonpartisan, trucker-led, and supported by a wide range of ethnic minorities and religious faiths.
The truckers are making their demands even as most U.S. states have already eased many restrictions. In California, where the convoy begins, the state lifted universal mask requirements last week while requiring masks for vaccinated people only in high-risk areas such as public transit, schools and healthcare settings.
PENNSYLVANIA CONVOY 
Another convoy, made up of a single 18-wheeler and a handful of pickup trucks and SUVs, left Scranton, Pennsylvania - Biden's hometown - on Wednesday morning and was headed to the Beltway sometime during the afternoon.
Organizer Bob Bolus told Washington television station WJLA that his convoy has no intention of breaking laws or blocking traffic, but warned this could happen if their demands regarding pandemic mandates and the cost of fuel are not meant. 
""They are not going to intimidate us and they are not going to threaten us. We're the power, not them,"" said Bolus, a trucker who owns a tow truck company.
In Canada, protests choked streets in Ottawa for more than three weeks and blocked the busiest land crossing between Canada and the United States for six days.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked rarely used emergency powers to end the protests, and Canadian police restored a sense of normalcy in Ottawa over the weekend.
In the United States, new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations due to the coronavirus have plummeted from all-time highs hit a month ago, though nearly 2,000 people per day are still dying from the disease and the number of total deaths is closing in on 1 million since the pandemic began.

(Reuters) -Courts in North Carolina and Pennsylvania on Wednesday approved new congressional districts that could bolster Democrats' chances of holding onto the U.S. House of Representatives in November, after Republican efforts to install more advantageous maps for their party failed in both states.
A panel of North Carolina judges rejected the latest map produced by the Republican-controlled General Assembly, ruling that it did not meet the standards of partisan fairness that the state's Supreme Court set earlier this month.
Instead, the judges adopted a map drawn by several court-appointed experts. The new map includes seven likely Republican districts, six likely Democratic districts and one competitive seat, Dave Wasserman, a redistricting analyst at Cook Political Report, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
The state Supreme Court had previously tossed out an initial Republican-backed plan as unconstitutionally partisan, finding that Republicans would win a strong majority of the state's 14 seats under almost any circumstance.
The Republican speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives, Tim Moore, said he would immediately appeal the ""egregious"" ruling.
In Pennsylvania, the state Supreme Court accepted a map backed by Democrats, weeks after Democratic Governor Tom Wolf vetoed a plan that was passed by the majority-Republican state legislature.
The map approved on Wednesday largely eschews major changes, while eliminating one Republican-held district due to the state's slower population growth. Republicans and Democrats currently hold nine seats each.
Both decisions drew immediate criticism from Republicans that the state Supreme Courts - both majority Democratic - acted out of partisan interest rather than judicial impartiality.
""These are nothing but partisan rubber-stamps today,"" said former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, the co-chair of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, which coordinates Republican mapping efforts nationwide.
Democrats, by contrast, said the rulings ensured fair maps and protected voters' rights.
""This is a substantial win for Pennsylvanians who now get to vote for the candidate of their choosing in fair, lawful districts for the next decade,"" Eric Holder, the chairman of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said in a statement after the Pennsylvania decision.
Republicans need to flip only a handful of seats in November's midterm elections to recapture control of the U.S. House and stymie much of President Joe Biden's legislative agenda.
States must redraw their congressional maps every 10 years under federal law to account for population shifts. In most cases, lawmakers control redistricting, leading to partisan gerrymandering, the process by which one party manipulates district lines to increase its power.

With more than three dozen states having completed new maps, neither Republicans nor Democrats have gained a significant advantage. Republican gerrymanders in states such as Texas, Tennessee and Georgia have been countered by Democratic ones in Maryland, Illinois and New York.
Instead, the biggest change has been the elimination of competitive districts, a shift that is likely to increase polarization and lead to more ideologically extreme candidates, electoral experts say.

ST. PAUL, Minn. (Reuters) -A jury began deliberating on Wednesday on whether three former Minneapolis police officers deprived George Floyd of his constitutional rights by failing to come to the aid of the handcuffed Black man pinned beneath a colleague's knee.
Tou Thao, 36; J. Alexander Kueng, 28; and Thomas Lane, 38, all testified in their own defense in the federal trial at the U.S. District Court in St. Paul, telling jurors they did not realize at the time that Floyd was in dire need of medical care, which it was their duty to provide.
The 12 jurors, all of whom appear to be white, deliberated for about seven hours before breaking for the night, and were due to resume deliberations on Thursday morning.
The defendants' lawyers in defense summations said prosecutors had failed to prove the three men acted with deliberate indifference during the May 2020 arrest, even as they had what a prosecutor called ""front-row seats"" to Floyd's murder beside a police car parked in a Minneapolis intersection.
Thao and Kueng are also charged with willfully breaching Floyd's rights by not intervening in the use of excessive force by their colleague Derek Chauvin. A widely seen cellphone video showed Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on the neck of the prone Floyd for more than 9 minutes as horrified onlookers begged the officers to check Floyd's pulse.
Floyd's killing sparked protests in cities around the world against police brutality and racism. Thao is Asian American, Kueng describes himself as mixed race and Lane is white.
Chauvin, 45, was convicted of Floyd's murder at a separate state trial last year and sentenced to 22-1/2 years in prison. In December, he pleaded guilty to the federal charge of violating Floyd's rights.
U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson instructed the 12 jurors in the law before giving them the case for deliberations. He told them that the government needs to have proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants knew that Floyd needed medical care or that the force used against him was excessive.
In closing arguments on Tuesday, defense lawyers said the officers deferred to the authority of Chauvin, the most senior officer at the scene with 19 years at the Minneapolis Police Department.
It was not obvious to them that Chauvin's knee on Floyd's neck amounted to excessive force, they said, even as onlookers yelled at the officers with growing alarm to get off Floyd, who begged for his life before falling unresponsive.
Kueng and Lane, who first handcuffed Floyd on suspicion of using a fake $20 bill in a nearby store, have noted that they were rookies only a few days out of training, which lasted more than a year. They used their knees to pin down Floyd's buttocks and legs while Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck. Thao, who had been on the force for eight years, stood to the side of Floyd, keeping back the bystanders.
In a final rebuttal on Tuesday, LeeAnn Bell, a federal prosecutor, said there were no ""free passes"" under the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees that people not face excessive force or be deprived of medical care when the government takes them into custody.
""There's no pass for, 'I was a brand-new officer.' There's no pass for, 'It would have been hard or uncomfortable to speak up,'"" she said. ""Our Constitution weighs the risk and our Constitution says you must act.""

Medical experts have testified that Floyd almost certainly would have survived the arrest if he had been rolled onto his side once the officers restrained him, as the officers acknowledged that they had been taught to do.
All three men face years in prison if convicted, and are also due to stand trial in a Minneapolis court in June on state charges of aiding and abetting Floyd's murder.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The former head of one of New York City's police unions was charged with fraud, the U.S. Justice Department said on Wednesday, saying that he schemed to steal hundreds of thousands of dollars from the union.
Ed Mullins, who was first elected president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association (SBA) in 2002, surrendered to authorities in New York and appeared before a judge at the U.S. District Court in Manhattan. 
Prosecutors charged him with one count of wire fraud, alleging that his scheme covered a period from 2017 until his resignation as union chief in October 2021 in the face of a federal probe into the labor organization he led, according to a news release. He later left the force.
Mullins used a personal credit card to dine at expensive restaurants and shop at luxury stores. He sought to be reimbursed by the SBA for more than $1 million in expenses, much of which was fraudulent, prosecutors say. 
Mullins ""abused his position of trust and authority to fund a lavish lifestyle that was paid for by the monthly dues of the thousands of hard-working sergeants of the NYPD,"" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement.
A lawyer for Mullins, Marc Mukasey, declined to comment on the matter.

The union could not be reached immediately for comment after the Justice Department statement. The SBA represents 12,000 current and retired members of the largest U.S. police force, according to its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) profile.
His resignation was applauded at the time by former New York Mayor de Blasio. The union chief frequently used the SBA's Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account to air grievances with the mayor and his administration. Mullins often accused de Blasio of being soft on crime and turning his back on the NYPD.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -The man who held a customer hostage at gunpoint at an Amsterdam Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) store has died of the injuries he sustained during his arrest, public prosecutors said on Wednesday.
Police stopped the man, identified as a 27-year-old from Amsterdam, by running into him forcefully with a car as he chased after his hostage when the hostage fled from the Apple flagship store on Tuesday night. 
""We are investigating the possible motives of the hostage taker and the explosives he carried on his body"", police said in a statement, noting that the explosives were not ready to detonate.
The suspect was armed with a pistol and an automatic rifle, with which he fired at least four shots when police arrived at the central Leidseplein square in front of the store around 6 p.m. (1700 GMT), Amsterdam police chief Frank Pauw told a news conference.
The man, who had a criminal record, had demanded a ransom of 200 million euros ($226 million) in crypto currencies and safe passage out of the building, Pauw said.
The hostage, described by police as a 44-year-old Bulgarian man, fled from the building around 10:30 p.m. 
The hostage taker chased after the man and police waiting outside rammed him with the car to stop him.
Videos of the incident showed the hostage taker being knocked onto the hood of the police car and then falling to the ground.
Police said on Wednesday the man who was arrested was the only suspect.

During the evening, about 70 people were able to leave the store while the hostage situation was ongoing. There were no reports of other injuries.
""We are so incredibly grateful and relieved that our employees and customers in Amsterdam are safe after this terrifying experience,"" Apple said in a statement.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City will experiment with installing barriers or doors on a few subway platforms, the city's transit chief said on Wednesday, with residents on edge over a rise in violence against riders.
The move comes five weeks after a 40-year-old woman, Michelle Go, was struck and killed by a train at the Times Square subway station after an assailant shoved her onto the tracks without warning.
The barriers can only be installed in some subway stations, Metropolitan Transportation Authority chairman Janno Lieber told local NY1 in an interview posted to the MTA website on Wednesday, because the aging system was not built to accommodate them.
""It doesn't work in a lot of places,"" Lieber said, adding that the installations would be tried in Times Square and two other busy stations and possibly expanded if found to be successful.
""We're also going to be piloting new technologies to detect track incursion using thermal technology, using laser technology, so we can know quicker when people get on the tracks and hopefully, interdict that kind of behavior,"" he said. 
The city will also deploy teams of police officers and mental health workers to remove homeless people from stations and ""get rid of disorderly activity"" such as drug use that have contributed to a sense of unease among riders, Lieber said.

Police arrested a 61-year-old man in Go's Jan. 15 death, saying the paroled felon appeared to be mentally ill and homeless and may have chosen his victim at random. Despite that characterization, activists say Go may have been targeted because she was Asian, part of a surge in hate-driven attacks against Asian Americans in New York City and elsewhere.
Earlier in January a man was stuck and killed by a subway train while attempting to help a man who had fallen onto the tracks after being attacked by a group of assailants. Two people have been charged with murder in that case.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday will end a program focused on fighting Chinese espionage and intellectual property theft, shifting from what an official called a ""myopic"" focus to address threats from a broader array of hostile nations.
Critics have said the initiative, put in place during former President Donald Trump's administration, amounted to racial profiling and that it created a culture of fear that has chilled scientific research. 
The move, the details of which were reported by Reuters earlier this month, is a recognition that the focus on China was too limited, said Matt Olsen, the Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division.
""We see nations such as China, Russia, Iran and North Korea becoming more aggressive and more capable in their nefarious activity than ever before,"" Olsen said in a speech at George Mason University's National Security Institute. ""Our new strategy is threat-driven.""
The department's ""China Initiative,"" started in 2018, has faced intense scrutiny by civil rights groups and some members of Congress for its expansive investigation into professors at U.S. universities over whether they disclosed financial ties to China when seeking federal grant funding and visiting Chinese scholars from military affiliated universities.
""By picking one country, what the China initiative did, it created in some ways a bit of a myopic approach which I don't think really reflects the nature of the threat landscape,"" said Olsen, who discussed the changes with reporters ahead of his speech.
At least 20 academic researchers have faced charges as part of the China Initiative, including Charles Lieber, a Harvard University professor convicted in December of lying about his ties to China in connection with federally funded research.
But several of the department's cases were dismissed due to flaws in the evidence or the premise, including one against Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Gang Chen, who was accused of hiding ties to China when seeking federal grant funds.
""Anything that creates the impression that the Department of Justice applies different standards based on race or ethnicity harms the department and our efforts and it harms the public,"" Olsen said.
Going forward, the Justice Department will have a much higher bar and conduct more intense supervision before bringing similar future criminal cases against academics, Olsen said.
Olsen added that the department will not be ""taking any tools off the table"" when it comes to bringing possible future cases involving researchers, nor will the department drop any of its outstanding cases against professors.
""The department will continue to stand behind the cases that we are currently prosecuting,"" he said.
U.S. Representative Ted Lieu, a Democrat from California and critic of the initiative, told Reuters in an interview he was pleased the Justice Department was changing its approach and would “ no longer be focused on things that have nothing do with spying and espionage.""
“This change is going to result in less racial profiling of Asians and Asian Americans, and that is a good thing,"" he said.
""Now we need to monitor it and see what actually comes of the change.”
Linda Ng, the national president for the OCA-Asian Pacific American Advocates, also said her organization is ""cautiously optimistic"" about the changes, but cautioned it should not merely amount to ""a rebranding exercise.""

The Justice Department's new strategy will primarily focus on cases in a few core areas: defending the nation from threats of espionage, export control and sanctions violations; protecting corporate intellectual property, private information about Americans and supply chains; and defending democracy from rising threats posed by authoritarian regimes.
""Make no mistake, we will be relentless in defending our country from China,"" Olsen said.

(Reuters) - Three men pleaded guilty on Wednesday for their roles in conspiring to attack U.S. power grids, as part of a plot motivated by white supremacy to sow civil unrest and economic distress, the U.S. Justice Department said.
Christopher Cook, 20, of Columbus, Ohio; Jonathan Frost, 24, of Katy, Texas and of West Lafayette, Indiana; and Jackson Sawall, 22, of Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK), Wisconsin each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to provide material support to extremists, court documents filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio showed.
The case comes at a time when Justice Department officials have pointed to an increase in domestic threats stemming from white supremacists and anti-government militias.
In January, the department announced the formation of a new domestic terrorism unit, amid a growing realization that extremists within the country represent a threat on par with that posed by foreign militant groups such as Islamic State.
The defendants, whose representatives could not immediately be reached for comment, face a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison.
Prosecutors say that in the fall of 2019, Frost and Cook hatched their plans in an online chat group, with Frost concocting the idea of attacking a power grid. Within weeks, the two began efforts to recruit others to join in their plan, and Sawall later joined the conspiracy, the prosecutors say.
Their plan was to attack substations, or power grids, with powerful rifles and they believed it would cost the government millions of dollars while causing unrest, the Justice Department said.
""They had conversations about how the possibility of the power being out for many months could cause war, even a race war"", the department said in a statement.
As their plan advanced, prosecutors say they met in Columbus, Ohio in February 2020 to train. Frost allegedly provided Cook and Sawall with ""suicide necklaces"" laced with fentanyl they could ingest if they were caught by law enforcement.
They also are accused of painting a swastika flag under a bridge at a park.

Their plot to carry out their mission in Ohio was derailed during a traffic stop, in which Sawall tried to swallow his suicide pill. He ultimately survived.
Cook and Frost, however, continued traveling onward to Texas where they attempted to recruit juveniles to help their cause, prosecutors say.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Supreme Court justices on Wednesday struggled over whether to let Republican state officials defend an immigration rule crafted by former President Donald Trump's administration to bar permanent residency for immigrants deemed likely to need government benefits. 
The justices heard oral arguments in an appeal by 13 Republican state attorneys general led by Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich of a lower court's ruling that rejected their bid to defend Trump's rule, which expanded the scope of those considered likely to become a ""public charge."" 
President Joe Biden's administration dropped the government's defense of the policy, prompting the action by the states. The rule took effect in February 2020.
Liberal and conservative justices questioned why the administration rescinded the policy in March 2021 based on a November 2020 decision by U.S. District Judge Gary Feinerman in Illinois ordering it vacated nationwide in another case, rather than undertaking a formal rulemaking process to replace it while it remained in effect. 
Liberal Justice Elena Kagan suggested that the administration evaded requirements under a U.S. law called the Administrative Procedure Act and expressed doubt that the court should be ""green-lighting"" such behavior. Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts said circumventing that statute ""is a pretty big deal.""
Some justices noted that presidential administrations often stop defending in court certain policies they oppose.
""It's very much not unprecedented,"" conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh said.
Biden administration lawyer Brian Fletcher raised some eyebrows when he told the justices that the government does not believe that federal administrative law gives judges the power to set aside policies on a nationwide basis, as Feinerman did in this case - a position aligning with that of the Trump administration. 
Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch wondered how that admission should affect the case given that the Biden administration's decision to rescind Trump's rule ""is premised on what it admits to be an unlawful order"" by Feinerman. 
The Supreme Court in a separate dispute https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-weighs-kentucky-officials-bid-defend-abortion-law-2021-10-12 is weighing whether to let Kentucky's Republican attorney general defend a restrictive abortion law in his state that was struck down by lower courts, after its Democratic governor dropped the case. 
Biden's administration six days ago announced https://www.dhs.gov/news/2022/02/17/dhs-proposes-fair-and-humane-public-charge-rule a new ""fair and humane"" public charge rule that it said would avoid penalizing people for seeking medical attention and other services. The fact that a new federal rule already has been devised raises questions about what type of remedy would be available to the state officials even if they win and get to defend Trump's policy. 
Brnovich was joined by officials from Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and West Virginia. 
U.S. guidelines in place for the past two decades had said immigrants likely to become primarily dependent on direct cash assistance or long-term institutionalization, in a nursing home for example, at public expense would be barred from legal permanent residency, known as a ""green card."" 
Trump's policy expanded this to anyone deemed likely to receive a wider range of even non-cash federal benefits such as the Medicaid healthcare program, housing and food assistance for more than an aggregate of 12 months over any 36-month period. 
The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decided in 2020 that Trump's policy impermissibly expanded the definition of who counts as a ""public charge."" Other courts made similar rulings.

During the time the policy was enforced, the government issued only three denials of admission under it, according to court filings, all of which have since been reversed.
The Supreme Court's ruling is expected by the end of June.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday overturned the conviction of a former Chinese diplomat and head of U.S. operations for a Chinese construction company for engaging in forced labor, while upholding his conviction on two other charges.
Citing improper testimony from a government expert on forced labor, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ordered a new trial for Dan Zhong on three counts related to his allegedly having forced workers into ""debt bondage"" contracts.
Zhong, 52, has been serving a 190-month prison term--nearly 16 years--following his March 2019 conviction, including concurrent nine- and five-year terms for alien smuggling and visa fraud.
Wednesday's decision upheld those convictions, but ordered a resentencing on the visa fraud count.
The office of U.S. Attorney Breon Peace in Brooklyn declined to comment. Lawyers for Zhong did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Zhong had overseen U.S. operations at privately held China Rilin Construction Group, led by his uncle Wang Wenliang, a onetime billionaire, according to Forbes magazine.
Prosecutors alleged that from 2010 to 2016, Zhong brought Chinese workers to the United States on visas, purportedly to work on diplomatic facilities including China's U.N. mission, embassy and consulates general.
Instead, prosecutors said Zhong compelled them to work on private construction projects, or perform yard work and cooking at his New Jersey residence, and threatened them with the loss of their homes in China if they refused.
The appeals court said the expert witness' ""color commentary"" about the government's evidence came ""dangerously close"" to cementing Zhong's guilt, and that he gave largely irrelevant testimony about forced labor worldwide and the Chinese government's ""poor"" forced labor record.
It also said jurors should not have heard testimony about Rilin's alleged treatment of three workers in 2001 and 2002, many years before Zhong's alleged crimes.
""We cannot conclude that the cumulative effect of those errors was harmless,"" Circuit Judge Steven Menashi wrote for a three-judge panel.
Zhong has been in U.S. custody since his November 2016 arrest. He is housed at a federal prison in West Virginia.
The case is U.S. v. Zhong, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 19-4110.

In late November, the WTO was forced to postpone the conference after Swiss travel restrictions due to the Omicron variant meant many planned face-to-face meetings could not take place.
""WTO members agreed, during (Wednesday's) General Council meeting, to reconvene the 12th Ministerial Conference in Geneva during the week of 13 June,"" the Geneva-based trade watchdog said in a brief statement.
The talks have been widely seen as a test of the WTO's relevance.

The WTO has only managed one update of its global rules in its near 27-year history, the red tape-cutting Trade Facilitation Agreement, and its 164 members have looked far from agreement in its most active talks - on curbing fishing subsidies and spreading COVID-19 vaccines more widely.
India, South Africa and other developing countries are calling for a waiver of intellectual property rights for vaccines and other COVID-19 treatments to make them more available in poorer countries. U.S. President Joe Biden has said he supports a waiver for vaccines.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain accused Russian news channel RT on Wednesday of being a tool of a Kremlin disinformation campaign and asked the UK media regulator to take action if needed after Russia recognised two rebel regions of eastern Ukraine.
Russian officials say RT is a way for Moscow to compete with the dominance of global media companies based in the United States and Britain that Moscow says offer a partial view of the world.
Critics say RT, which broadcasts news in English, Arabic, Spanish and German, is the propaganda arm of the Russian state and aims to undermine confidence in Western institutions.
Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said in a letter to state media regulator Ofcom that she was concerned RT would seek to spread ""harmful disinformation"" about the Russia-Ukraine crisis.
""While respecting Ofcom’s regulatory independence, I call on you to ensure your actions are timely and transparent to reassure the British public,"" the letter, seen by Reuters, said.
Asked in parliament whether he would request Ofcom review RT's licence, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he believed Dorries had asked the regulator to review that matter.
Johnson's spokesman, asked later if the government was looking to ban the channel, sought to clarify the prime minister's remarks. ""All the culture secretary is asking Ofcom (is to) take any appropriate action should there be any attempt to use Russia Today to spread disinformation,"" he said. 
The Conservative prime minister had also said the regulator should make its own decisions.
""We live in a country that believes in free speech,"" Johnson told parliament. ""And I think it's important that we should leave it up to Ofcom rather than to politicians to decide which media organisations to ban - that's what Russia does."" 
RT said British politicians seemed to be trying to meddle in the affairs of a regulator, undermining its independence.
""The UK culture minister is now clearly directly interfering in institutions touted as supposedly wholly free from political pressure and influence,"" Anna Belkina, RT's deputy editor in chief, told Reuters.
Belkina said despite political pressure Ofcom had found no breaches of the Broadcasting Code by RT in the past four years.
Ofcom did not comment specifically on RT but said it would prioritise complaints about any broadcaster's news coverage of Russia and Ukraine.

""Recognising the serious nature of the crisis in Ukraine, we have been keeping the situation under close review and have already stepped up our oversight of coverage of these events by broadcasters in the UK,"" it said in a reply to Dorries' letter.
""It would not be acceptable for any of our licensees to broadcast one-sided propaganda.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Indonesia's peatlands, California's forests, and, now, vast swathes of Argentine wetland have all been ravaged by extreme wildfires, heralding a fiery future and the dire need to prevent it.
With climate change triggering droughts and farmers clearing forests, the number of extreme wildfires is expected to increase 30% within the next 28 years. And they are now scorching environments that were not prone to burning in the past, such as the Arctic's tundra and the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest.
""We've seen a great increase in recent fires in northern Syria, northern Siberia, the eastern side of Australia, and India,"" said Australian government bushfire scientist Andrew Sullivan, an editor on the report, released Wednesday, by the UN Environment Programme and GRID-Arendal environmental communications group.
At the same time, the slow disappearance of cool, damp nights that once helped to temper fires also means they are getting harder to extinguish, according to a second study https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04325-1 published last week in the journal Nature.
With night time temperatures rising faster than day time ones over the last four decades, researchers found a 36% increase in the number of after-dark hours that were warm and dry enough sustain fire.
""This is a mechanism for fires to get much bigger and more extreme,"" said Jennifer Balch, lead author of the Nature study and director of the University of Colorado Boulder's Earth Lab.
""Exhausted firefighters don't get relief,"" which means they can’t regroup and revise strategies to tackle a blaze.
The consequences of extreme fires are wide-ranging, from loss and damage to costly firefighting response. In the United States alone, the UNEP report said the economic burden of wildfire totals as much as $347 billion annually.
With California's forests ablaze, the state government spent an estimated $3.1 billion on fire suppression in the 2020-21 fiscal year. 
The fires raging since December in Argentina's Corrientes province have taken an enormous toll, killing Ibera National Park wildlife, charring pasturelands and livestock, and decimating crops including yerba mate, fruit, and rice. Losses already have exceeded 25 billion Argentine pesos ($234 million), The Argentine Rural Society said.

The UNEP report calls on governments to rethink wildfire spending, recommending they put 45% of their budget toward prevention and preparedness, 34% toward firefighting response, and 20% for recovery.
""In many regions of the world, most resources go toward response — they focus on the short-term,"" said Paulo Fernandes, a contributing author of the UNEP report and fire scientist at Universidade of Tras-os-Montes and Alto Douro in Portugal.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Insurance agent Emily Kwong, 30, is struggling to home-school her five-year-old daughter and is worried she has learned nothing due to Hong Kong's strict COVID-19 restrictions that have forced toddlers and teens into online classes. 
New plans to close schools early in March are ""disturbing the whole year"", Kwong said, echoing concerns from parents and teachers in the global financial hub worried about their children's mental health and education.
""Just with the iPAD, the Zoom, for the whole two years... next year she will be in Year 1, and she will have learned nothing from the last two years,"" Kwong said.
For many children, the absence from friends and a physical space to learn is adding to anxiety.
""The kids are broken. I absolutely feel for them, there is nothing left in them,"" said a teacher at an international school, who declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
Hong Kong is pursuing a ""dynamic zero COVID"" strategy similar to mainland China, aiming to eradicate any outbreaks at all costs instead of trying to live with the virus. Since the start of February, daily infections have surged around 70 times.
The move to let all students start their summer holidays in March to allow campuses to be used as testing and vaccination sites has triggered a backlash. 
Belinda Greer, chief executive of the English Schools Foundation which has 18,000 pupils across 22 schools, met Education Bureau (EDB) officials on Wednesday and said she had relayed concerns and was working to minimise disruption.
For pupils taking external exams this year, there would be some flexibility, she added.
""EDB has signalled that they have taken on board our perspective and we will continue to work with them to agree the best way forward,"" Greer said.
The holiday break will run until April 17, with the last day of the school year pushed back to August, disrupting teaching and learning.
There are around 900,000 pupils out of school more than two years after the pandemic started in 2020. 
Many families in the Chinese-ruled territory live in tiny, high-rise apartments with several people over three generations, making online learning particularly difficult, with sometimes patchy WiFi connections.
The government said on Tuesday that mass testing for the city's 7.4 million people would start in March.
The city has already reported COVID-related deaths of children as young as 11 months, exacerbating worries among families. 
This week an infected 11-month-old was made to isolate by herself in hospital despite pleas from her parents to accompany her.
""As soon as we saw the news of the kid separation. I said, 'I am done',"" said Sofia, a mother of two. 

The family plans to leave the city next week and relocate to Singapore in June.
""The aim for zero cases here, it’s absurd,"" she said. ""We cannot get to zero. It plays on peoples' minds – why are we staying here?""

Turchak said any such deployment would be of what he described as ""of a peacekeeping nature."" 
Turchak and Denis Pushilin, a Russian-backed leader in one of the breakaway regions, told reporters that the Russian military was not yet present in the Russian-backed separatist-held areas despite allegations from the West that Moscow has had a covert military presence there for years. 
A Reuters witness saw columns of military vehicles including tanks early on Tuesday on the outskirts of Donetsk, the capital of one of the two breakaway regions, after Russian President Vladimir Putin recognised them as independent states.

The Reuters reporter saw about five tanks in a column on the edge of the city and two more in another part of town. No insignia were visible.
Pushilin told reporters that separatist forces in Donbass were not at the stage of trying to expand their territory and would prefer to resolve any border demarcation issues with Ukraine peacefully.

The United States and its allies have accused Russia of flagrantly violating international law by ordering troops into separatist regions of eastern Ukraine and recognising the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk regions as independent republics. [L1N2UY055]
Francis, speaking in a sombre tone at the end of his weekly general audience, also urged politicians to make ""a serious examination of conscience before God"" about the effects of their actions.
He proclaimed Ash Wednesday, on March 2 this year, as an international day of fasting and prayer for peace. He condemned the ""diabolic senselessness of violence"" and asked the Madonna, ""the queen of peace, to save the world from the madness of war"".
""I have great pain in my heart because of the worsening of the situation in Ukraine,"" Francis said, adding that he was anguished and worried like many around the world because peace was threatened by partisan interests.
""I appeal to all sides to abstain from any action that could provoke more suffering to the populations, destabilising coexistence among nations and discrediting international law.""
The United States, the European Union, Britain, Australia, Canada and Japan announced plans to target banks and elites while Germany halted a major gas pipeline project from Russia in one of the worst security crises in Europe in decades.

It was the second time Francis has called an international day of prayer for peace in Ukraine. The first was on January 26.
""Jesus taught us that we should respond to the diabolic senselessness of violence with the weapons of God, with prayer and fasting,"" Francis said on Wednesday.

Security Council to halt the flow of weapons enabling atrocities. 
Thomas Andrews, a former U.S. congressman serving in the independent post, released a report that also named Serbia as one of three countries supplying arms to the Myanmar military since it seized power last year, with ""full knowledge that they would be used to attack civilians"".
""It should be incontrovertible that weapons used to kill civilians should no longer be transferred to Myanmar,"" Andrews said in a statement. 
Chaos has gripped Myanmar since a coup ended a decade of tentative democracy, triggering protests that troops suppressed with lethal force.
At least 1,500 civilians have been killed, according to activists cited by the U.N., which also says more than 300,000 people have been displaced by rural conflict between the military and armed opponents.
The junta says it is fighting ""terrorists"" and objects to what it calls U.N. interference.
Myanmar's military and Russia's foreign ministry could not immediately be reached for comment on the report. 
Asked about the report at a regular briefing, China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, said China ""has always advocated that all parties and factions should proceed in the long-term interests of the country"" and ""resolve contradictions through political dialogue"".
In a statement, Serbia's foreign ministry denied supplying arms and said since Myanmar's coup it had ""examined the new situation very carefully and in March last year made a decision not to deliver weapons to this country either under previously concluded agreements or new export requests.""
Human rights groups and the U.N. have accused the junta of using disproportionate force to fight militias and ethnic minority rebels, including artillery and air strikes in civilian areas. 
The report said Russia had supplied drones, two types of fighter jets, and two kinds of armoured vehicles, one with air defence systems. China transferred fighter jets while Serbia had provided rockets and artillery shells, it said. 
The U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution last year calling on members to halt arms transfers to Myanmar's military, which Andrews said the security council should make binding. 
Serbia voted in favour of the resolution, but Russia and China abstained. 
While China has urged an end to hostilities in Myanmar, Russia has been the generals' closest diplomatic ally amid efforts by the West to isolate them.
Andrews also called for cutting the Myanmar military's access to oil and gas revenue and foreign exchange reserves, plus international bans on purchases of Myanmar timber, gemstones, and rare earths.

Myanmar's rulers were vulnerable and could be stopped with international resolve, he said in the report. 
""If revenues necessary to maintain such a military are reduced, the junta's capacity to assault and terrorise the people of Myanmar will diminish,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge signaled on Tuesday he may not let Donald Trump countersue E. Jean Carroll, a writer who accused the former president of raping her in the mid-1990s and is suing him for defamation.
At a hearing in Manhattan, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan suggested it might be futile for Trump to claim that Carroll's lawsuit violated a New York ""anti-SLAPP"" law protecting free speech, citing several courts that found similar laws did not apply in federal court.
""I question whether you have the right to do what you are seeking to do, because it seems to me it's entirely inconsistent with the notion of futility,"" Kaplan told Trump's lawyer Alina Habba. ""It may not be the way I resolve this matter.""
Carroll, a former Elle magazine columnist, accused Trump in a June 2019 book excerpt of having raped her in a dressing room at the Bergdorf Goodman department store in Midtown Manhattan.
She sued five months later, claiming that Trump defamed her when he told a reporter he did not know Carroll, said ""she's not my type,"" and accused her of concocting the rape claim to sell her book.
New York's anti-SLAPP law, short for ""strategic lawsuits against public participation,"" was enacted in Nov. 2020.
It was meant to protect journalists and others from wealthy companies and people who file frivolous lawsuits to silence critics. How the law might apply to public officials, or former public officials like Trump, remains unclear.
Kaplan questioned why Trump waited until January, 14 months after New York's law took effect, to invoke it, which Carroll's lawyers said reflected Trump's pattern of delaying the case.
""This is about giving us the right to litigate these issues,"" Habba said. ""That is all I'm asking.""
Kaplan did not say when he will rule.
Both sides are awaiting a decision from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan on whether Carroll's lawsuit should be dismissed because Trump was immune from being sued.
In that appeal, the Biden administration essentially adopted an argument by Trump's Justice Department that the government should be substituted for Trump as the defendant, which could doom Carroll's case.

Carroll's lawyers want to question Trump under oath and compare his DNA with a dress Carroll said she wore during the alleged rape.
The case is Carroll v Trump, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-07311.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday he had canceled a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov planned for Thursday after Moscow's recognition of two separatist regions in Ukraine as independent entities.
Blinken said he had agreed to meet with Lavrov, his counterpart, only if Russia did not invade Ukraine.
""Now that we see the invasion is beginning and Russia has made clear its wholesale rejection of diplomacy, it does not make sense to go forward with that meeting at this time,"" Blinken told reporters after a meeting with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in Washington.
Blinken said he was still committed to diplomacy ""if Moscow's approach changes"" and would do anything he could ""to avert an even worse-case scenario, an all-out assault on all of Ukraine, including its capital.""
""But we will not allow Russia to claim the pretense of diplomacy at the same time it accelerates its march down the path of conflict and war,"" he added.
Western nations imposed new sanctions on Russia on Tuesday after Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk on Monday and ordered Russian troops into eastern Ukraine to ""keep the peace."" Washington has dismissed that justification to deploy troops as ""nonsense.""
A Reuters reporter saw a handful of tanks on the outskirts on Donetsk overnight and several blasts were heard in the city of Donetsk on Tuesday.
Washington had consulted with allies on the decision to cancel the talks, scheduled to take place in Europe, before informing Lavrov in a letter on Tuesday, Blinken said.

Blinken said Putin's speech announcing the moves was ""deeply disturbing"" and showed the world that Putin views Ukraine as ""subordinate to Russia.""
The United States and its allies will continue to escalate sanctions if Russia further escalates its aggression toward Ukraine, the secretary of state said.

BRUNSWICK, Ga. (Reuters) -The three white men convicted of chasing down and murdering a young Black man, Ahmaud Arbery, as he was out jogging in their suburban Georgia community, were found guilty on Tuesday of committing federal hate crimes and other offenses in the 2020 killing.
A predominantly white jury deliberated for about four hours over two days before returning the verdict against Travis McMichael, 36, his father, former police officer Gregory McMichael, 66, and a neighbor, William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52, in U.S. District Court in Brunswick (NYSE:BC), Georgia.
""Ahmaud will continue to rest in peace but he will now begin to rest in power,"" Wanda Cooper-Jones, Ahmaud's mother, said outside the courthouse after the verdict was read.
All three men were found guilty of violating Arbery's civil rights by attacking him because of his race, and of attempted kidnapping, capping the latest high-profile trial to probe issues of vigilantism and racial violence in America. 
The McMichaels were also convicted of a federal firearms charge. Bryan was not charged with a weapons offense. The hate-crimes felony, the most serious of the charges the defendants faced, carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. The judge has not yet set a sentencing date. 
The three men were convicted last year https://www.reuters.com/world/us/georgia-jury-resume-deliberations-arbery-murder-trial-2021-11-24 of murder and other crimes in state court and sentenced to life terms for the shotgun slaying of Arbery, 25, a onetime high school football star who worked for a truck-washing company and his father's landscaping business. 
Prosecutors in the state trial avoided characterizing the killing as racist, seeking only to prove that the McMichaels and Bryan were responsible for his death.
Cooper-Jones on Tuesday railed against the Department of Justice (DOJ) prosecutors, who had originally reached a plea deal with the defendants to avoid a trial, as typically happens in hate-crimes cases https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-chose-not-prosecute-82-hate-crime-suspects-2005-2019-2021-07-08, such as with Derek Chauvin, the police officer who kneeled on George Floyd's neck https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/derek-chauvin-expected-change-plea-guilty-george-floyd-civil-rights-case-2021-12-15 and was found guilty of murdering him. 
In a rare move, the judge last month rejected the plea deal https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-prosecutors-reach-hate-crime-plea-deals-ahmaud-arbery-murder-court-filings-2022-01-31 after Ahmaud's family implored her not to accept it. 
""What we got today, we wouldn't have gotten today if it wasn't for the fight that the family put up,"" Cooper-Jones said. ""What the DOJ did today, they was made to do today. It wasn't because it's what they wanted to do."" 
The family and supporters plan to hold a vigil on Wednesday in the neighborhood where Arbery was killed to mark the second anniversary of his murder. 
LAG TIME ON CHARGES
Arbery was shot to death on Feb. 23, 2020, by the younger McMichael after all three defendants had chased him down in pickup trucks as the victim was out for an afternoon jog through the community of Satilla Shores, near the southeastern coastal town of Brunswick.
The McMichaels insisted they did not act out of racial animus but out of self-defense and a belief that Arbery appeared suspicious when they saw him running through the streets after a series of neighborhood break-ins.
But trial testimony revealed there had been no burglaries. Federal prosecutors presented testimony from 20 witnesses and other evidence they said showed that the three men had long histories of using slurs and making racist statements. The defense rested its case after calling just one witness.
There was never any dispute that the younger McMichael fired his shotgun three times at Arbery at close range. 
The killing was captured in a graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan, stoking public outrage when it surfaced on social media more than two months later with no arrests yet made, even though Travis McMichael had admitted to police at the scene that he gunned down Arbery.
Civil rights activists pointed to the lag time in arrests of the three men as the latest example of law enforcement allowing white perpetrators to go unpunished in the unjustified killing of Black people. 

Arbery's name became entwined with a host of others invoked in a summer of protests against racial injustice across the United States after Floyd, another unarmed Black man, was killed in May 2020. The federal prosecution of Arbery's killers is the first in which those who committed such a high-profile murder are facing a jury in a hate-crime trial.
In response to Arbery's murder, lawmakers in Georgia passed a law in 2020 that hiked punishments for hate crimes and mandated data collection on hate crimes. A year later, lawmakers overhauled a Civil War-era citizens arrest law https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-race-usa-police/georgia-state-overhauls-citizen-arrest-law-following-ahmaud-arberys-death-idUSKBN2BN3O6 in an effort to prevent vigilantism.

ST. PAUL, Minn. (Reuters) -A federal prosecutor told a jury in closing arguments on Tuesday that three former Minneapolis police officers ignored their training and basic human decency by failing to intervene when their colleague knelt on George Floyd's neck during a deadly arrest.
Tou Thao, 36; J. Alexander Kueng, 28; and Thomas Lane, 38, have all pleaded not guilty to charges they willfully denied Floyd's constitutional right to receive medical aid in police custody during the May 2020 arrest, even as they had what a prosecutor called ""front-row seats"" to Floyd's murder beside a police car parked in a Minneapolis intersection.
Their lawyers in defense summations said prosecutors had failed to prove the three men acted with deliberate indifference, arguing that the defendants were oblivious at the time to the urgency of Floyd's medical needs.
Thao and Kueng are also charged with willfully breaching the handcuffed 46-year-old Black man's rights by not intervening in their colleague Derek Chauvin's use of excessive force. Chauvin, who is white, was captured on widely seen cellphone video kneeling on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes as horrified onlookers begged the officers to check Floyd's pulse.
Chauvin, 45, was convicted of Floyd's murder at a separate state trial last year and sentenced to 22-1/2 years in prison. The federal trial in the U.S. District Court in St. Paul hinges on when an officer has a duty to intervene in a colleague's misconduct.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Manda Sertich said Thao was captured on video choosing to argue with and mock the people on the sidewalk begging him to help Floyd rather than trying to get Chauvin off Floyd.
Kueng, she said, is seen smiling at a shared joke with Chauvin as Floyd died beneath them, and picking gravel out of the police car's tire. Lane could be heard worrying that they should turn Floyd on his side but did not get up from pinning down Floyd's legs.
She told the jurors, who were due to begin deliberations on Wednesday morning, that the defendants did not do what ""human decency and common sense required them to do: to stop the slow-motion killing unfolding right in front of them.""
DEFERRING TO CHAUVIN
All three defendants have testified in their own defense, saying they deferred to Chauvin's 19 years of experience as the most senior officer on the scene. 
Lane and Kueng, who pinned Floyd's legs as Thao stood nearby keeping onlookers back, have emphasized that they were rookies only a few days out of training. Sertich argued that even the rookies should have asked Chauvin to get off Floyd or to check his neck for a pulse.
""They want you to accept that it is too much to ask of them to say those things even though it was not too much for those regular people who were walking by,"" Sertich said. ""They made the choice not to upset their colleague rather than do their duty, even though that choice resulted in the death of a human.""
In his summation to the jury, Kueng's lawyer Thomas Plunkett argued that Kueng should be acquitted because of his ""inadequate training"" and his lack of experience.
Thao's lawyer, Robert Paule, argued that Thao knew from his training that if police find someone's heart has stopped beating they must immediately begin performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if safe.
""If Mr. Thao is standing there and the other three officers are monitoring and dealing with Mr. Floyd, and if he doesn't see them rolling Mr. Floyd over or doing CPR, the logical assumption from their training is that Mr. Floyd must still have a pulse,"" he said.
Kueng can be heard in body-worn camera videos telling his colleagues twice that he cannot find a pulse. He told the jury he did not take from this that Floyd's heart had stopped, but decided instead that the handcuffs were preventing him from checking the pulse successfully.
All three men face years in prison if convicted, and are also due to stand trial in a Minneapolis court in June on state charges of aiding and abetting Floyd's murder. 
Lane's lawyer, Earl Gray, accused the U.S. government of railroading an innocent man in a case that has reshaped discourses about policing and race.

""Why did the government indict him? You know why: politics, ladies and gentleman,"" Gray said over prosecutors' objections. 
He noted that Lane got in the ambulance with the unresponsive Floyd and pumped Floyd's chest, performing CPR: ""How in the world could our government - the wonderful United States of America, freedom and all that - charge someone who does that?"" Gray asked. ""Think about that. Sort of scary.""

(Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin has shifted the Ukraine crisis into a new, more dangerous phase with a barrage of words and actions that suggest his ultimate aims go far deeper than extending Russian sway over two struggling separatist regions.
Putin signed friendship treaties on Monday night with the so-called Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics proclaimed by Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, in a move denounced as illegal by the West and met with immediate sanctions, including on Russian banks and a major new gas pipeline.
But it was the extraordinary televised speech preceding the signing that offered deeper clues to Putin's thinking, as he twisted centuries of history into an hour-long diatribe portraying Ukraine as an artificial nation with no tradition of statehood.
Kremlin watchers said his lecture looked like an attempt to justify deeper aggression against Ukraine and a possible new invasion, eight years after he captured and annexed Crimea.
""He has questioned the right to sovereignty of Ukraine and he's declared that this was a historic mistake, a historic accident that Ukraine is existing,"" said Gerhard Mangott, a professor at Austria's Innsbruck University and member of a group of Russia experts that meets yearly with Putin.
""So it's most likely that his final ambition is to destroy this Ukrainian state, or at least make Ukraine divide into two separate halves,"" he said, with Russia controlling the eastern part of the country.
In significant follow-up comments on Tuesday, Putin said he was recognising the entire Donetsk and Luhansk regions of east Ukraine, which together comprise an area known as the Donbass, as forming their breakaway ""republics,"" even though only a fraction of that territory is controlled by the separatists.
With Russia affirming the right under its new treaties to send in troops and build military bases, that opens up the risk it could enter an open war with Ukraine to extend the separatist territories.
""AT A LOSS""
Putin has always denied planning to reinvade Ukraine but his huge military build-up on its borders since November has prompted brutal falls in Russian shares, government bonds and the rouble. His latest moves have heightened anxiety among the Russian elite. 
""We’re all at a loss. We’re all very nervous. No one knows what the endgame is,"" said a former high-placed official.
Putin's latest move has killed off any lingering hopes of ending the eight-year separatist war in Ukraine by reviving peace agreements signed in 2014 and 2015 - an ominous shift from diplomacy towards force.
""By abandoning the Minsk agreements, Russia has deprived itself of one avenue of potential long-term political leverage over Ukraine and will now be seeking another one,"" said Oleg Ignatov, senior analyst for Russia at International Crisis Group.
In his speech, Putin looked like a man who, after more than two decades as Russia's paramount leader, is thinking more about his legacy than about the casualties and economic costs that a full-scale war with Ukraine would entail.
It followed comments from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week that Putin might not be thinking logically and sanctions might not deter an ""irrational actor"". Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte described him as ""totally paranoid"".
""We've seen a shift from Putin (as) the kind of pragmatic, rational calculating leader, to someone who is increasingly looking for their place in history, who sees themself on a historical mission to right injustices,"" said Neil Melvin of the RUSI think-tank in London.
That led to a shift in Putin's risk calculus where the short-term costs of his actions paled into insignificance compared to the bigger historical picture, he said.
Melvin, who recently returned from meetings with senior Russian officials in Moscow, said the Ukraine crisis was only beginning to unfold.
""To be frank, you don't station 200,000 troops on the border with Ukraine and invoke the biggest crisis in European security for 40 years if all you're trying to do is extend your control over two small territories that you already control,"" he said.

The next stage would be determined by the entry of Russian forces into Donetsk and Luhansk and possible moves to expand into wider territory, depending on how Ukraine responds.
""I think that's what we need to look for now,"" Melvin said. ""It's how will the trigger be pulled for this wider military incursion?""

(Reuters) - For months, local prosecutors took no action after three white men jumped in their trucks and chased Ahmaud Arbery, a young Black jogger, through their Georgia neighborhood before shooting him to death.
It was only after a video of Arbery's final moments on Feb. 23, 2020 surfaced in May of that year that Travis McMichael, 36, his father Gregory McMichael, 66, and a neighbor, William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52 were charged. In late November the three were convicted of murder in a state trial.
Race and racism - issues local prosecutors had skirted during the murder trial - were at the heart of federal hate crimes proceedings that opened Feb. 14 in Brunswick (NYSE:BC), Georgia near where Arbery died in the Satilla Shores neighborhood. 
After a week of listening to testimony about the defendants' long history of racist social media posts and discourse, a predominantly white jury on Tuesday found racial animus motivated Arbery's murderers. In that moment, the justice system took note of the full circumstances of a death that perpetrators had lied about to authorities who initially seemed uninterested in holding them accountable.
""We got a victory today, but it’s so many families out there who don’t get victories because of people that we have fighting for us,"" Arbery's mother Wanda Cooper-Jones said after the verdict. 
Cooper-Jones criticized the federal prosecution team for earlier seeking a plea deal, which would have meant graphic evidence of the defendant's deadly racism would not have been before the public. U.S. District Judge Lisa Wood had made a rare move in rejecting the plea agreement, allowing the trial to go forward.
""They were made to do their job today,"" Cooper-Jones said of Department of Justice prosecutors.
The Department declined to seek charges against 82% of the roughly 1,800 people suspected of federal hate crimes it investigated between 2004 and 2019, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.
Reluctance to seek charges may stem from concern they will be hard to prove. After Tuesday's verdict, Wood told the prosecutors in the Arbery hate crimes case that ""it can be difficult to prove the racial motivation part of hate crimes. But you had the evidence and you introduced it in a skillful and professional manner.""
Page Pate, a federal criminal defense lawyer based in Brunswick with 25 years experience, told Reuters that prosecutors had a heavy lift because the federal hate crimes law was originally designed to turn on concrete evidence.
""The law was written for KKK (Ku Klux Klan) types of violence where there was no mystery - burning crosses, burning down churches and that sort of thing,"" Pate said in an interview.
U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, speaking to reporters after the verdict against Arbery's murderers, said, ""every case is decided on its own merits. We have done a number of hate crimes prosecutions in the last year years and we will continue to bring those cases where we have the facts and the law on our side.""

Garland did not directly answer a question about criticism from Arbery's mother of the initial plea deal attempt.
""I cannot imagine the pain that a mother feels to have her son run down and gunned down while taking a jog on a public street and the family,"" Garland said, sounding choked up.

NOVOLUHANSKE, Ukraine (Reuters) - Zoya, a pensioner, cowered under the stairs in the early hours of Tuesday as fresh shelling shook her home near the frontline of the war in eastern Ukraine, just hours after Russia said it would recognise two breakaway regions as independent.
""Around 5 a.m. I was at home and went from the living room to the kitchen. When it impacted, everything shook, glass flew around... I hid under the stairs, it was horrible, just horrible,"" said the 68-year-old.
Asked what she thought of Russian President Vladimir Putin's move, she shrugged: ""I don’t expect anything good ... I'm so fed up ... For eight years now we don't live, but just exist.""
Her town of Novoluhanske is located in Ukraine's Donetsk region but just outside the self-proclaimed ""Donetsk People's Republic"" which, along with the neighbouring ""Luhansk People's Republic"", has just been recognised by Russia as a state.
Ukrainian government forces recaptured the town from the Moscow-backed separatists in 2017 but the fighting that first erupted in 2014 has continued, taking a heavy toll on local people trapped in their homes with nowhere else to go.
Soldiers patrolling earthen trenches nearby fear the separatists, now fully backed up by Russian troops expected to arrive in the area very soon, will be emboldened to make renewed attempts to seize the town and surrounding areas.
""We are ready to stop an incursion by the Russian Federation, including the Luhansk and Donetsk People’s republics. I don’t know what the scale will be, it depends on how big the army will be,"" said Oleksiy, a soldier.
Another soldier, Oleksandr Ryabov, expressed concern that the separatists would now try to seize those parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions - including Novoluhanske - still controlled by Ukrainian government forces.
""This possibility worries me, it would then be contested territories, and Ukraine will have to defend those parts of the region by military means,"" he said.

Another pensioner, Oleksiy, saw little hope of peace returning.
""I am very worried. From this situation, we cannot expect anything good to happen,"" he said.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Indirect talks between Tehran and Washington to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal are in the home straight, delegates say, though some important issues remain unresolved and it is still unclear whether an agreement will be clinched.
Since then-President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the accord in 2018 and reimposed sanctions, Iran has breached many of the deal's curbs that had extended the time it would need to produce enough fissile material for an atom bomb - if it chose to build one - to at least a year from 2-3 months.
That time, which is widely referred to as ""breakout time"", will not return to a year even if an agreement is reached, diplomats say, given the knowledge Iran has gained from going beyond the deal's restrictions. But broadly returning to those restrictions would make breakout time longer than now.
Iran says it only wants to enrich uranium for civil uses, but many suspect it is keeping its options open or at least seeking to gain leverage in negotiations by getting closer to being able to produce a nuclear weapon.
Western powers say time is running out to clinch an agreement because Iran's nuclear programme is advancing so far that the deal will soon be redundant. How close is Iran to being able to make an atom bomb, and how far past the deal's restrictions has it pushed?
BREAKOUT TIME
Based on the International Atomic Energy Agency's last quarterly report https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/21/11/gov2021-51.pdf on Iran's nuclear activities, which was published in November, experts have generally put breakout time at around three to six weeks but say weaponisation would take longer - often roughly two years. 
Israel's finance minister said in November that Iran could have nuclear weapons within five years.
Estimating breakout time is not an exact science, and it is even harder to say where it would stand under an agreement that has yet to be finalised or published. But initial rough estimates put it around six months, diplomats and analysts say.
ENRICHMENT
The deal restricts the purity to which Iran can enrich uranium to 3.67%, far below the roughly 90% that is weapons-grade or the 20% Iran reached before the deal. Iran is now enriching to various levels, the highest being around 60%.
The deal also says Iran can only produce, or accumulate, enriched uranium with just over 5,000 of its least efficient, first-generation centrifuges at one facility: the underground Fuel Enrichment Plant (FEP) at Natanz.
The deal lets Iran enrich for research, without accumulating enriched uranium, with small numbers of advanced centrifuges, which are generally at least twice as efficient as the IR-1.
Iran is now enriching uranium with hundreds of advanced centrifuges both at the FEP and the above-ground Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant (PFEP) at Natanz. 
It is also enriching with more than 1,000 IR-1s at Fordow, a plant buried inside a mountain, and with more than 100 advanced centrifuges already installed there.
URANIUM STOCKPILE
The IAEA estimated in its November report https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/21/11/gov2021-51.pdf that Tehran's stock of enriched uranium was just under 2.5 tonnes, more than 12 times the 202.8-kg (446-pound) limit imposed by the deal, but less than the more than five tonnes it had before the deal.
That said, it is now enriching to a higher level than the 20% it reached before the deal and has around 17.7 kg of uranium enriched to up to 60%, which is close to the roughly 90% purity of weapons grade. It takes around 25 kg of weapons-grade uranium to make one nuclear bomb.
Under the agreement that is taking shape, excess enriched uranium would be diluted or shipped to Russia, diplomats say, and Iran would return to the deal's 3.67% enrichment limit.
INSPECTIONS AND MONITORING
The deal made Iran implement the IAEA's so-called Additional Protocol, which allows for snap inspections of undeclared sites. It also expanded IAEA monitoring by cameras and other devices beyond the core activities and inspections covered by Iran's long-standing Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA.
Iran has stopped implementing the Additional Protocol and is allowing the extra monitoring to continue only in a black-box-type arrangement, whereby the data from cameras and other devices is collected and stored but the IAEA does not have access to it, at least for the time being.
That arrangement has been in place for a year.
POTENTIAL WEAPONISATION

Despite being banned under the deal, Iran has produced uranium metal enriched to 20%. This alarms Western powers because making uranium metal is an important step towards producing bombs and no country has done it without eventually developing nuclear weapons. 
Iran says it is working on reactor fuel.

President Vladimir Putin on Monday granted official recognition to the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics and signed friendship treaties with their leaders, a step that paves the way for Russia to send in troops and establish military bases.
The West condemned the move as an illegal act that could mark the prelude to a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine and began imposing some sanctions.
But for some in Donetsk, where Moscow-backed separatists have battled Ukrainian government forces in a conflict that Kyiv says has cost 15,000 lives since 2014, it was long overdue.
""This is very important for me. I know that the blood I spilled with my comrades and our labours and efforts and the losses of civilians were not in vain all this time,"" said Dmitry, a former member of a pro-Russian separatist militia.
He was looking forward to the arrival of Russian troops as part of the agreements signed on Monday.
""This great people of Donbass have suffered so much, they need it now (Russian troops). They've had enough blood, enough death,"" he said.
A convoy of at least a dozen cars flying large Russian tricolor flags and honking their horns wound its way through the city centre. ""Russia, hoorah!"" shouted one driver.
Other residents of Donetsk were trying to go about their lives as normal, walking with children or shopping at the market, a Reuters witness said. A wedding took place at a hotel.
However, six blasts were later heard in the centre of the city. Their origin was not clear. A diplomatic source told Reuters shelling had resumed on the line of contact between the Ukrainian government and separatist forces.
'EVERYONE IS VERY SCARED'
Irina, a woman of about 40, said Russia's decision was not unexpected but people were unsure how to react.
""I don't know what will happen now - everyone is at a loss and uncertain,"" she said, adding that she hoped the reinforced Russian backing would help bring an end to the conflict.
""If there are (Russian) troops, it means it's not worth fighting because Russia is a great power, mighty, nuclear.""
A Reuters reporter saw a handful of tanks on the outskirts on Donetsk overnight and two more in other parts of the city. The Kremlin's spokesman said he was unable to say if Russia had already sent in military forces.
Vyacheslav, a man of about 60, said he hoped the deployment of Russian troops would bring an end to ""provocative actions"" by Ukraine, adding: ""I think the other side will also have a think and decide to move onto peace negotiations.""
But Karina, a woman in her early twenties, burst into tears as she described her feelings.

""To be honest, it's such a depressing situation right now that I don't know how good a decision this really is and how much it can lead to peace,"" she said.
Referring to the separatist administrations' decision to evacuate tens of thousands of women and children from Donetsk and Luhansk in recent days, Karina added: ""Now everyone is very worried, everyone is being taken away from their fathers, brothers, husbands. In fact, everyone is very scared.""

VIENNA (Reuters) -Talks on restoring a deal to curb Iran's nuclear programme and ease sanctions are near conclusion, a Russian envoy said on Tuesday, and sources close to the negotiations said a prisoner swap between Iran and the United States is expected soon. 
""Apparently the negotiations on restoration of #JCPOA are about to cross the finish line,"" Mikhail Ulyanov said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), using the 2015 agreement's full name, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. 
Reuters reported last week that a U.S.-Iranian deal was taking shape in Vienna after months of talks between Tehran and major powers to revive the nuclear deal pact, abandoned in 2018 by then-U.S. President Donald Trump, who also reimposed extensive sanctions on Iran.
A draft text of the agreement alluded only vaguely to other issues, diplomats said, adding that what was meant by that was unfreezing billions of dollars in Iranian funds in South Korean banks, and the release of Western prisoners held in Iran.
On Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said the Islamic Republic was ready for an immediate prisoner exchange with the United States. 
""Iran has always and repeatedly expressed its readiness to exchange prisoners. Months ago we were ready to do it but the Americans ruined the deal,"" a senior Iranian official in Tehran told Reuters, without elaborating.
""Now I believe some of them will be released, maybe five or six of them. But those talks about prisoners are not linked to the nuclear agreement, rather associated with it. This is a humanitarian measure by Iran."" 
U.S. negotiator Robert Malley has suggested that securing the nuclear pact is unlikely unless Tehran frees four U.S. citizens, including Iranian-American father and son Baquer and Siamak Namazi, that Washington says Tehran is holding hostage. 
""Six years ago the Iranian government arrested Baquer Namazi and they still refuse to let him leave the country,"" Malley tweeted on Tuesday. ""The Iranian government can and must release the Namazis, Emad Shargi, Morad Tahbaz, and other unjustly held U.S. and foreign nationals.""
DOZENS OF DUAL NATIONALS, FOREIGNERS JAILED IN IRAN
Iran, which does not recognise dual nationality, denies taking prisoners to gain diplomatic leverage. However, in recent years, the elite Revolutionary Guards have arrested dozens of dual nationals and foreigners, mostly on espionage and security-related charges. 
Britain has been seeking the release of British-Iranians Anousheh Ashouri, jailed on espionage charges, and Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Foundation who was convicted of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment. [L8N2UW3FH]
Tehran has sought the release of over a dozen Iranians in the United States, including seven Iranian-American dual nationals, two Iranians with permanent U.S. residency and four Iranian citizens with no legal status in the United States.
Most were jailed for violating U.S. sanctions against Iran.
In the latest comments on the final phase of 10 months of nuclear negotiations, the talks' coordinator, Enrique Mora, tweeted that ""key issues need to be fixed"" but the end was near.
Several Iranian officials, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said some minor technical issues were being discussed in Vienna and that a deal was expected before the end of the week, though adding that ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"".
Separately, hardline Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi told gas exporter countries on Tuesday to avoid any ""cruel"" sanctions imposed by the United States on Tehran. 
""The members of this forum should not recognise those sanctions...(because) in today's world we see that the sanctions are not going to be effective,"" Raisi told a gas exporters conference in Doha.

The 2015 deal between Iran and world powers limited Tehran's enrichment of uranium to make it harder for it to develop material for nuclear weapons, if it chose to, in return for a lifting of international sanctions against Tehran.
Since 2019, following the U.S. withdrawal from the deal, Tehran has gone well beyond its limits, rebuilding stockpiles of enriched uranium, refining it to higher fissile purity and installing advanced centrifuges to speed up output.

Accelerating a crisis the West fears could spark a war, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered on Monday the deployment of troops to two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine after recognising them as independent.
Russia denies any plan to attack Ukraine, but has threatened unspecified ""military-technical"" action unless it receives sweeping security guarantees, including a promise that its neighbour will never join NATO.
The legitimate security concerns of any country should be respected, Wang, who is also a Chinese state councillor, told U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a telephone call, the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement.
""The situation in Ukraine is worsening,"" Wang told Blinken. ""China once again calls on all parties to exercise restraint.""
On the call, Blinken underscored the need to preserve Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity amid Russia's 
""aggression"", said Ned Price, a U.S. State Department spokesperson. 
Earlier on Tuesday, China's embassy in Ukraine warned its nationals there not to venture into unstable areas, but stopped short of telling them to leave, as many other nations have advised their own citizens. [L1N2UX0EH]
""The Chinese embassy in Ukraine has issued a reminder to Chinese citizens and enterprises to strengthen security precautions,"" said Wang Wenbin, a foreign ministry spokesman.
The embassy will ensure that dietary needs of Chinese citizens in Ukraine are met in a timely way, Wang said at a regular media briefing in response to a query about when China would pull out its citizens.
China is closely following the evolving situation in Ukraine, Wang told the briefing, which drew more reporters than usual. 
TAIWAN, NORTH KOREA
The United States should not include Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, in America's Indo-Pacific strategy, Wang told Blinken. 
This month, the United States said it would commit more diplomatic and security resources to the Indo-Pacific, and vowed to work with partners both in and outside the region to maintain peace and stability in the strait dividing Taiwan from China.
The attempt to include Taiwan in the strategy to contain China is sending all the ""wrong signals"", Wang told Blinken on the telephone call, the foreign ministry said in its statement. 
Still, China is willing to manage its differences with the United States and stabilise two-way ties, Wang added.
On Monday, China said it had placed  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp under sanctions over arms sales to Taiwan, in at least the third time it has announced punishments for the U.S. firms.
Taiwan's foreign ministry said it would continue to urge the United States to keep selling the island weapons ""in the face of China's military threats and intimidation"".
""The U.S. provision to us of defensive weapons helps defend Taiwan's democracy and freedom, as well as ensures national security and peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region,"" spokesperson Joanne Ou told reporters on Tuesday.

Blinken and Wang also spoke on developments in North Korea. 
China calls for direct dialogue between the United States and North Korea, and will, as always, seek to play a constructive role in promoting resolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, Wang said.

BOGOTA (Reuters) -Judges on Colombia's constitutional court voted on Monday to decriminalize abortion until 24 weeks of gestation, the court said in a statement, in a victory for abortion rights groups which sued to have the procedure removed from the penal code.
The decision adds Colombia to a list of Latin American countries which have recently liberalized abortion access, including Mexico and Ecuador.
Abortion was partially legalized in Colombia under a 2006 court decision which allowed it only in cases of rape, fatal fetal deformity and health of the woman, without any time limits.
Under Monday's ruling, backed by five of nine judges, women will not be prosecuted for seeking abortions up to 24 weeks of gestation, after which the procedure will only be allowed under the original three conditions.
""The practice of abortion will only be punishable when it is conducted after the twenty-fourth week of gestation and, in all cases, this time limit will not apply to the three conditions laid out in Ruling C-355 of 2006,"" the court said in a statement.
Congress and the national government must urgently implement policies to protect the rights of pregnant women, the court's statement added, including family planning services, eliminating obstacles to abortion care and help with adoptions.
The Causa Justa coalition, which sued for decriminalization in September 2020, estimates around 90% of abortions in the country take place clandestinely, putting women's lives at risk as they seek dangerous alternatives to seeing a doctor. ""We did it!"" the coalition, which is made up of more than 90 feminist organizations, said on its Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account. 
Its supporters, many sporting green to represent the abortion rights movement and some crying, celebrated outside the court.
CHANGE ACROSS THE REGION
Mexico's Supreme Court decriminalized abortion last year, while Ecuador's National Assembly last week approved regulations to allow access to abortion in cases of rape.
Incoming Chilean President Gabriel Boric has vowed to make the procedure freely available, as it is in Argentina and Uruguay under certain time limits.
Abortion rights advocates said the decision was not the end of their fight for full legalization.
""We hope that the next step for Colombia will be the total decriminalization of abortion, in order to protect women's reproductive autonomy at all times,"" Nancy Northup, president of the New York City-based Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement.
The coalition argued in its suit that prosecutions of women and girls who sought or obtained abortions have worsened stigma and scared doctors and patients, even in cases when one of the three legal conditions has applied.
Some 350 women were convicted or sanctioned for abortions between the original 2006 ruling and mid-2019, including at least 80 girls under the age of 18, according to Causa Justa.
Decriminalization will reduce deaths from clandestine procedures, save the under-funded health system money, end expensive prosecutions and guarantee women's bodily autonomy, the group said.
A ruling had originally been expected late last year, but the decision has been repeatedly delayed amid a recusal request from a judge and other procedural debates.

Dozens of protesters opposed to abortion were also outside the court on Monday.
""We don't want either legal or clandestine abortion,"" said Daniela Clavijo, who was protesting before the ruling. ""We are asking the court to totally penalize abortion, so there's never any condition for abortion.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the deployment of troops to two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine after recognising them as independent on Monday, accelerating a crisis the West fears could unleash a major war.
A Reuters witness saw tanks and other military hardware moving through the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk after Putin formally recognised the breakaway regions and ordered the deployment of Russian forces to ""keep the peace"".
About five tanks were seen in a column on the edge of Donetsk and two more in another part of town, a Reuters reporter said. No insignia were visible on the vehicles.
Putin's announcement drew international condemnation and immediate U.S. sanctions to halt U.S. business activity in the breakaway regions and ban import of all goods from those areas.
The measures were separate from sanctions the United States and its allies had prepared if Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said.
A senior U.S. official said the deployment to breakaway enclaves did not yet constitute a ""further invasion"" that would trigger the harshest sanctions as Russia already had forces there, but that a wider campaign could come at any time.
Britain, France and Germany also agreed to respond to Russia's recognition of the breakaway regions with sanctions, and the White House said it would announce further measures on Tuesday.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who received a solidarity call from U.S. President Joe Biden, accused Russia of wrecking peace talks and ruled out territorial concessions.
Linda Thomas-Greenfield, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told an emergency meeting of the Security Council that Moscow's recognition of the eastern regions was part of its attempt to create a pretext for a further invasion of Ukraine.
""Tomorrow, the United States will impose sanctions on Russia for this clear violation of international law and Ukraine sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" she told reporters after the Security Council meeting on Monday evening.
""We can, will, and must stand united in our calls for Russia to withdraw its forces, return to the diplomatic table and work toward peace.""
The Russian U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, warned Western powers to ""think twice"" and not worsen the situation.
China called for all parties to exercise restraint while Japan said it was ready to join international sanctions on Moscow in the event of a full-scale invasion.
U.S. diplomatic staff, who had been moved from Kyiv to the western city of Lviv, were ordered to spend the night in Poland as the crisis deepened. 
Oil jumped to a seven-year high, safe-havens currencies like the yen rallied and global stocks tumbled as Europe's eastern flank stood on the brink of war. [MKTS/GLOB] [RU/RUB] [O/R] The rouble extended its losses as Putin spoke, at one point sliding beyond 80 per dollar.
ANCIENT LANDS
In a lengthy televised address packed with grievances against the West, a visibly angry Putin said eastern Ukraine was ancient Russian land..
Russian state television showed Putin, joined by Russia-backed separatist leaders, signing a decree recognising the independence of the two Ukrainian breakaway regions - the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic. 
Putin had announced his decision in phone calls to the leaders of Germany and France earlier, the Kremlin said.
In his address, Putin delved into history as far back as the Ottoman empire and as recent as the tensions over NATO's eastward expansion. His demands that Ukraine drop its long-term goal of joining the Atlantic military alliance have been repeatedly rebuffed by Kyiv and NATO states. 
""I deem it necessary to make a decision that should have been made a long time ago - to immediately recognise the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic,"" Putin said. 
A French presidential official said the speech ""mixed various considerations of a rigid and paranoid nature"".
DIPLOMATIC WINDOW NARROWS
The United States says Russia has massed a force numbering 169,000-190,000 troops in the region, including the separatists in the breakaway regions, and has warned of invasion at any moment.
Putin has for years worked to restore Russia's influence over nations that emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union, with Ukraine holding an important place in his ambitions. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.

Russia denies any plan to attack its neighbour, but it has threatened unspecified ""military-technical"" action unless it receives sweeping security guarantees, including a promise that Ukraine will never join NATO.
Recognition of the separatist-held areas will narrow the diplomatic options to avoid war, since it is an explicit rejection of a seven-year-old ceasefire mediated by France and Germany.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada's parliament on Monday backed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's decision to invoke rarely-used emergency powers to end pandemic-related protests that have blocked streets in the capital Ottawa for more than three weeks. 
The Emergencies Act was approved in parliament by 185 to 151, with the minority Liberal government getting support from left-leaning New Democrats.
The special measures, announced by Trudeau a week ago, have been deemed unnecessary and an abuse of power by some opposition politicians.
Over the weekend, Canadian police restored normalcy in Ottawa. The protesters initially wanted an end to cross-border COVID-19 vaccine mandates for truck drivers, but the occupation turned into a broader demonstration against Trudeau and his government. Protestors blocked the busiest land crossing between Canada and the United States for six days, snarling trade.
Earlier on Monday, Trudeau told reporters his government still needed temporary emergency powers citing ""real concerns"" about threats in the days ahead. ""This state of emergency is not over. There continue to be real concerns about the coming days,"" Trudeau said. 
The act grants authorities broader powers. 
Police spent two days clearing protesters from the downtown Ottawa, making 191 arrests and towing 79 vehicles by the time the operation ended on Sunday. 
Trudeau also called for people to work together, saying ""we don't know when this pandemic is going to end, but that doesn't mean we cannot start healing as a nation"". 
Some members of the official opposition Conservative Party accuse Trudeau of abusing his powers. Legislator Dean Allison decried what he called ""authoritarian military style measures"" against the protesters. 

Green Party member Mike Morrice, who voted against the motion, said invoking the act was an ""inappropriate"" response to a failure in policing. 
""As many other Parliamentarians have shared, the use of the Emergencies Act sets a worrying precedent for future protests,"" he said.

ST. PAUL, Minn. (Reuters) -Pinning George Floyd face down on a Minneapolis road in a May 2020 arrest seemed reasonable in the moment, one of three former Minneapolis police officers on trial for violating the handcuffed Black man's civil rights testified on Monday.
Thomas Lane was the third of the three defendants to take the stand in his own defense at the federal trial in the U.S. District Court in St. Paul, charged with denying Floyd's right to receive medical aid once in police custody.
Answering questions from his lawyer Earl Gray, Lane told the jury how he had called over the radio for an ambulance after seeing Floyd's mouth bleeding from his struggle with Lane and another officer trying to get him in the back of a police car. 
He became emotional as he recalled helping Floyd onto a stretcher and seeing Floyd's face several minutes after he fallen unresponsive beneath Lane and two other officers.
""He didn't look good,"" Lane said, his voice beginning to waver. 
Co-defendants Tou Thao, 36, and J. Alexander Kueng, 28, took the stand last week to say they deferred to the authority of Derek Chauvin, the most senior officer at the scene. Lane, who was on Floyd's ankles, and Kueng, who was on Floyd's thighs, were rookies only a few days out of training. Thao stood a few steps away from Floyd in a hands-off role he has described as being a ""human traffic cone.""
Cellphone video of Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes while Floyd begged for his life triggered huge protests against racism and police brutality. Chauvin was convicted in a separate state trial last year of murdering Floyd and sentenced to 22-1/2 years in prison, and in December he pleaded guilty to the federal charges of violating Floyd's civil rights.
Prosecutors have said the officers have a duty of care to anyone in their custody, and the three men breached their training and common sense in not doing more to help Floyd.
Lane, 38, can be heard on body-worn camera videos asking his colleagues if they should roll the prone Floyd onto his side, something officers are trained to do to avoid positional asphyxia. 
Chauvin, 45, rebuffs the suggestion, and continues to kneel on Floyd's neck as Floyd falls motionless while bystanders scream at the officers to check his pulse.
""OK, I suppose so,"" Lane recalled responding. ""It just seemed reasonable at the time. This guy is out of control."" He said he believed the ambulance would be ""here any minute.""
He said he was unable to see Floyd's face for the entire nine-minute restrain. Lane got in the back of the ambulance and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on Floyd under a parademic's instruction.
Prosecutors have previously called medical experts who said Floyd would almost certainly had lived if rolled on his side once he had been restrained.
In cross examination by a prosecutor, Lane said he was not concerned about positional asphyxia when he suggested rolling Floyd onto his side.
""I just wanted to get a better assessment of him,"" he said. 
The jury was due to hear closing arguments on Tuesday before beginning deliberations.
Thao and Kueng face an additional count of violating Floyd's rights in their role of police officers by failing to intervene to stop Chauvin's use of excessive force. 
Both have said they assumed Chauvin knew what was he was doing from his nearly two decades on the force and did not realize the force was excessive. 

Minneapolis Police Department fired all four officers.
""I found out I was terminated the next day in a Subway parking lot,"" Lane said, referring to the chain of sandwich stores. ""I read a news article. That's how I found out I got fired.""

Farmer founded Partners in Health in Haiti in 1987 and served as chief strategist to the group, which has provided millions of outpatient visits, women's health checkups and home visits in 12 countries, according to its website.
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton in a statement praised Farmer's ""pioneering work"" that ""fundamentally changed the way health care is delivered in the most impoverished places on Earth.""
In 1983, while a student, Farmer became committed to Haiti after working with dispossessed farmers, according to his biography from Harvard University, where he earned his medical degree and a PhD in anthropology.
After a year in rural Haiti, Farmer said he had ""no doubt that serving as a doctor in a clinical desert would save lives.""
""We were watching young people die of AIDS but also eminently treatable diseases such as tuberculosis,"" he said upon receiving the 2018 Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain vowed to impose sanctions on Russia, which it warned could invade Ukraine imminently, condemning President Vladimir Putin's recognition of two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine as a breach of international law.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson offered defensive support in a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, saying while a diplomatic solution should be pursued until the last possible second, the situation was deteriorating.
""The Prime Minister told President Zelenskiy that he believed an invasion was a real possibility in the coming hours and days,"" Johnson's office said in a statement following a call between the leaders.
""He told President Zelenskiy that the UK had already drawn up sanctions to target those complicit in the violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, and that those measures would come into force tomorrow. The Prime Minister also said he would explore sending further defensive support to Ukraine, at the request of the Ukrainian government.""
Johnson will agree the package of immediate sanctions against Russia at an 0630 GMT meeting of the government's crisis response committee (COBR) on Tuesday, a Downing Street spokesperson said.
Putin signed a decree recognising the independence of the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk regions while Johnson was speaking at a news conference, upping the ante in a crisis the West fears could unleash a major war. 
""It's a ... flagrant violation of the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine,"" Johnson said at that news conference, prior to the call with Zelenskiy.
""It is a repudiation of the Minsk process and the Minsk agreements, and I think it's a very ill omen and a very dark sign."" 
After Putin signed the decree, Johnson told Zelenskiy the move made the Minsk process - a set of agreements designed to end a separatist war by Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine - unworkable, a message echoed by foreign minister Liz Truss, who said Russia had broken international law.
""We will not allow Russia's violation of its international commitments to go unpunished,"" Truss said.

Britain has prepared sanctions against Russia, and Tuesday's sanctions may not be the full extent of the response, with further sanctions in reserve if Putin subsequently decides to invade.
Truss said she had discussed co-ordinating sanctions with European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell. The United States has also promised additional measures in response to Putin's move.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin signed decrees on Monday to recognise two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine as independent statelets, defying Western warnings that such a step would be illegal and would kill off peace negotiations.
He signed the documents after delivering an astonishing verbal attack on Ukraine in an televised speech lasting nearly an hour, in which he said neo-Nazis were on the rise, oligarchic clans were rife and called Ukraine a U.S. colony with a puppet regime. 
Putin said Ukraine was a country with no tradition of independent statehood and an artificial creation of Soviet state founder Vladimir Lenin - a restatement of views he has expounded previously and which Kyiv has rejected as a false and self-serving view of history.
Since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, he said, Kyiv had taken advantage of Russia and subjected it to economic ""blackmail"".
Now its aspiration to join NATO posed a direct threat to Russia's security, he said.
""In NATO documents, our country is officially and directly declared the main threat to North Atlantic security. And Ukraine will serve as a forward springboard for the strike.""
Putin shrugged off Western threats of sanctions in the event of Russian aggression against Ukraine.
""They are trying to blackmail us again. They are threatening us again with sanctions, which, by the way, I think they will introduce anyway as Russia's sovereignty strengthens and the power of our armed forces grows. And a pretext for another sanctions attack will always be found or fabricated.""
He said Russia ""has every right to take retaliatory measures to ensure its own security. That is exactly what we will do.""
Russia's rouble, already under pressure from a vast Russian military buildup near Ukraine, tumbled to new weeks-long lows as Putin spoke from behind a wooden desk flanked by Russian tricolour flags.
The recognition of the breakaway Ukrainian regions amounts to a declaration by Russia that it no longer considers them to be part of Ukraine.
It could pave the way for Moscow to openly send military forces into both regions, using the argument that it is intervening as an ally to protect them against Kyiv.
Putin said it was a long overdue response to ""those who embarked on the path of violence, bloodshed, lawlessness and did not recognize and do not recognize any other solution to the Donbass issue, except for the military one.""
He demanded an immediate cessation of hostilities by Ukraine.

""Otherwise, all responsibility for the possible continuation of the bloodshed will be entirely on the conscience of the regime ruling on the territory of Ukraine,"" he said.
Immediately after the conclusion of the speech, state television showed Putin signing documents to recognise the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions at a short Kremlin ceremony attended by their leaders.

TRAVNEVE, Ukraine (Reuters) - Government troops in front-line trenches in Ukraine's east said on Monday heavy weapons fire from Russian-backed separatists had intensified to provoke all-out conflict amid fears of Russia seeking a pretext for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 
Ukrainian troops have battled Russian-backed forces in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions bordering Russia since 2014 in a conflict that Ukraine's leadership says has killed 15,000 people. A ceasefire deal in 2015 staunched the worst fighting, but shelling has intensified along the ""line of contact"" since last week as Russia has massed forces along Ukraine's borders.
Western governments have accused the Kremlin of preparing to fabricate a pretext for a military offensive into Ukraine by blaming Kyiv for attacks and relying on pleas for help from separatist proxies.
""In the last few days it has become very hot (dangerous) here,"" a Ukrainian soldier, who identified himself by Chamomile, his nom de guerre, said while giving Reuters a tour through fortified trenches in the government-controlled Trasneve sector.
""They shoot at us everywhere along the front, with heavy mortars, 120-calibre, 150-calibre. It has become much more dangerous here,"" he said.
""It's probably in order to provoke us, so that we answer their fire. And they might - well I'm guessing here - want to provoke us to a full-blown war,"" he said, a sign behind him reading: ""Warning: Sniper.""
Russia denies any plan to attack its neighbour but has threatened unspecified ""military-technical"" action unless it receives sweeping security guarantees, including a promise that Ukraine will never join NATO.
Another Ukrainian serviceman who went by his nom de guerre of Hurricane said separatist forces appeared intent on reasserting the menace of their heavy weaponry. 

""...They are always ready to provoke us, provoke us more and thus blame us for their actions...""We can expect anything from them after eight years' experience of war. Anything can happen. We are always ready for the worst, and hope for the best.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden will issue an executive order soon that will prohibit economic activity between U.S. individuals and the two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine that Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized as independent entities on Monday, the White House said.
Putin's recognition of the rebel-held areas could pave the way for Moscow to send military forces into the two regions - Donetsk and Luhansk - and argue that it is intervening as an ally to protect them against Ukraine.
""We have anticipated a move like this from Russia and are ready to respond immediately,"" White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said in a statement. ""President Biden will soon issue an Executive Order that will prohibit new investment, trade, and financing by U.S. persons to, from, or in the so-called DNR and LNR regions of Ukraine.""
The order will ""also provide authority to impose sanctions on any person determined to operate in those areas of Ukraine,"" Psaki said.
Psaki said more measures were forthcoming and said these were separate from sanctions that the United States and its allies have been preparing if Russia invades Ukraine.
""To be clear: these measures are separate from and would be in addition to the swift and severe economic measures we have been preparing in coordination with Allies and partners should Russia further invade Ukraine,"" she said.

Biden, who convened a meeting with his national security team at the White House earlier in the day, held a 35-minute call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and had a call with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
""We are continuing to closely consult with Allies and partners, including Ukraine, on next steps and on Russia’s ongoing escalation along the border with Ukraine,"" Psaki said.

BRUNSWICK, Ga. (Reuters) -The three white men convicted of murdering Ahmaud Arbery acted out of ""racial anger"" when they chased the young Black man as they saw him jogging through their Georgia community, a federal prosecutor told jurors at the defendants' hate-crimes trial on Monday.
Defense lawyers argued that their clients, despite a lengthy record of racist discourse, pursued Arbery because they were suspicious of his conduct, not because of his race.
Judge Lisa Wood sent the predominantly white jury out to deliberate Monday afternoon after hours of closing arguments.
The defendants - Travis McMichael, 36; his father, Gregory McMichael, 66; and neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52 - have already been convicted of murder in state court and sentenced to life in prison in an earlier trial that largely skirted racism and focused on proving a homicide case.
Wednesday will be the second anniversary of the day Arbery, 25, was out for a Sunday afternoon jog when the McMichaels spotted him running by their home, grabbed their guns and jumped in their pickup truck to follow him. Bryan joined the chase in his own truck before Aubrey was cornered and confronted face to face by the younger McMichael, who fired three shotgun blasts at Arbery at close range, killing him.
The encounter, captured in cellphone video recorded by Bryan, stirred public outrage when it surfaced on social media some two months later. At the time the video surfaced, no arrests had been made.
Civil rights activists said the lag time in arrests exemplified a pattern of U.S. law enforcement allowing white perpetrators to go unpunished in the unjustified killing of Black people. 
Arbery's name became entwined with a host of others invoked in protests that swept the country after George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis by a white policeman kneeling on the unarmed Black man's neck in May 2020. 
'THEY THOUGHT THE WORST OF HIM'
Christopher Perras, a special litigator for the U.S. Justice Department's civil rights division, said in his summation on Monday that Arbery was singled out because of the color of his skin.
""They were motivated by racial assumption, racial resentment and racial anger,"" Perras said, referring to the defendants. ""They saw a Black man in their neighborhood and they thought the worst of him.""
Perras cited trial testimony showing the defendants - seated stone-faced through Monday's proceedings - had a long history of making overtly, sometimes violently racist comments about Black people in text messages, social media and conversations with others.
Arbery's parents, Marcus Arbery Sr., and Wanda Cooper-Jones, were in court Monday. Cooper-Jones sobbed when Perras's colleague, Assistant U.S. Attorney Tara Lyons, listed for jurors some of the disparagements and racist insults the defendants had directed at Arbery.
""This case is about how these three defendants saw Ahmaud,"" Lyons said. 
Defense attorneys countered that their clients believed they recognized Arbery from previous videos taken by a neighbor showing a person lurking on four occasions around a vacant house under construction amid a series of property thefts in the community. There was no evidence that Arbery ever stole anything.
Amy Lee Copeland, representing Travis McMichael, said prosecutors presented no evidence that her client ""ever spoke to anyone about Mr. Arbery in racial terms"" or used a racial slur on the day of the killing. And she added that the government never connected McMichael to any white supremacist or hate groups.
A.J. Balbo, the attorney Gregory McMichael, argued that the defendants were motivated by a desire to protect their neighborhood.
Pete Theodocion, Bryan's attorney, argued the evidence of racism was merely ""circumstantial.""
""Yes, the n-word six times is six times too many, but it is not evidence (of a hate crime),"" he told jurors.
All three men are charged with depriving Arbery of his civil rights by attacking him because of his race, as well as with attempted kidnapping. The McMichaels are additionally charged with a federal firearms offense.
The hate-crimes felony, the most serious of the charges, carries a maximum penalty of life in prison.
After the McMichaels agreed last month to plead guilty to the federal hate-crimes offense, the son acknowledged in court that he singled out Arbery because of his ""race and color."" 

Judge Wood rejected the plea bargain because it bound her to a 30-year sentence that prosecutors had agreed would be served in a federal lockup before the men were returned to the Georgia prison system, widely perceived as a tougher environment for inmates compared with federal penitentiaries.
The plea deals were then withdrawn.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Union joined calls on Monday for Russia not to annex or recognise breakaway Ukrainian regions, threatening to impose sanctions should Moscow do so.
Ignoring the warnings, the Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin told France's and Germany's leaders during phone calls on Monday that he planned to sign a decree recognising the two breakaway regions of Ukraine as independent entities shortly.
""If there is annexation, there will be sanctions, and if there is recognition, I will put the sanctions on the table and the ministers will decide,"" the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said after a meeting of EU foreign ministers.
Borrell was speaking before the Kremlin gave a readout of Putin's calls and confirmed he told France's president and Germany's chancellor that he planned to recognise the breakaway regions' independence.
Borrell's wording signalled it may be more difficult for the EU, whose members have different interests and views on how to deal with Moscow, to agree on a joint position, and sanctions, in case of recognition than it would have been for a full-fledged annexation. 
""We call on President Putin to respect international law,"" Borrell said. ""We are ready to react with a strong united front in case he should decide"" to ignore these calls, he said.
Western countries fear a build-up of Russian troops near Ukraine in recent weeks is a prelude to an invasion, which Moscow denies.
The United States and European allies have said any attack would trigger severe sanctions against Moscow, but Kyiv wants these to be imposed now, its Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in Brussels earlier on Monday.

""We believe that there are good and legitimate reasons to impose at least some of the sanctions now to demonstrate that the European Union is not only talking the talk about sanctions, but is also walking the walk,"" he said. 
Earlier in the day, the EU ministers backed plans announced last month for a 1.2 billion euro financial aid loan package for Ukraine, and also agreed in principle to a long-standing Ukrainian request for a small-scale mission of military instructors to help train officers.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong will expand its vaccine bubble to include shopping malls and supermarkets, authorities confirmed on Monday, but added there would be exemptions and random inspections in some places, as they battle a new record surge in COVID-19 cases. 
The outbreak has overwhelmed healthcare facilities in the global financial hub, with a new daily high of 7,533 infections and 13 deaths, among them an 11-month-old child, building pressure on the government. 
As most major cities learn to live with the virus, Hong Kong has imposed its toughest curbs yet, with Chinese President Xi Jinping saying that reining in the disease is the city's ""overriding mission"". 
Hong Kong's ""dynamic zero-COVID"" policies, mirroring those in mainland China, have contributed to its woes and are unsustainable, some experts say.
The government will launch a controversial ""vaccine passport"" on Thursday that allows only inoculated people to enter places such as supermarkets and clubhouses, a move some critics say raises privacy concerns. 
The plan requires anyone aged 12 and above to have taken at least one dose of a vaccine to enter specified premises, except for those with medical exemptions, although inspections will be random at some sites, in view of straitened resources. 
""Bringing your vaccine pass is the natural thing to do,"" said Kevin Choi, deputy secretary for food and health.
Operational difficulties in some places, such as shopping malls, supermarkets, and department stores, made it hard to ensure active checks, he added. 
The final stage of the scheme, by the end of June, will see those older than 18 required to have had three vaccine doses, authorities said.
Public hospitals in Hong Kong have been severely stretched, with occupancy at more than 95%, as they struggle to cope with the flow of patients, including the elderly, many of whom have resisted vaccinations.
Hong Kong has launched an ""all-out combat"" on the outbreak, the city's No. 2 official, John Lee, said on Sunday.
As the urgency grows, private hospitals will soon begin taking in patients from public hospitals, while construction work has begun on Lantau Island on about 10,000 community and isolation units, authorities said in a statement. 
Authorities are also closely watching outbreaks in care homes, with infections reported by about 250 centres involving about 700 residents.

The fifth wave of the disease is ""ferocious"" and the government must allocate sufficient funds to help citizens and business, Financial Secretary Paul Chan, who will unveil the annual budget on Wednesday, said in a blog post on the weekend.
Unless the budget provides unprecedented relief measures, economists say, it will be hard to see how the economy can avoid contracting again after emerging just last year from its most prolonged recession, which lasted from 2019 to 2020.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Seated at a large white table in an echoing Kremlin hall, Vladimir Putin summoned his top security officials one by one on Monday to give him their advice at a potential turning point in the crisis around Ukraine.
In a lengthy meeting of his Security Council, broadcast on state television in what a presenter called ""unprecedented footage"", Putin cross-examined ministers and spy chiefs on the question of whether to recognise the two breakaway Donbass regions of eastern Ukraine as independent states.
One after another, they walked to a white lectern in the column-lined hall to paint a relentlessly grim picture of the situation in Donbass.
Looking pale and tired, Putin drummed with his fingers from time to time as he listened.
His special representative on Ukraine, Dmitry Kozak, said Kyiv and the West had no interest in implementing a 2015 peace deal to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists have been fighting Ukrainian government forces for the past eight years.
The head of the FSB security service, Alexander Bortnikov, told Putin the security situation in the two breakaway regions was deteriorating, and that nearly 70,000 people had so far fled to Russia.
Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu accused Ukraine of stepping up shelling of the separatist regions - which Kyiv has strongly denied - and said some residents had been left without gas or water.
Much was riding on the president's decision. Recognition of the separatist regions could provide Russia with a pretext to openly send its military forces into the Donbass and justify that by arguing that it was protecting residents there from Ukraine.
It would also effectively kill off the Minsk peace agreements that all sides, including Russia, have until now called the only possible route out of the crisis.
But Putin was taking his time.
SHOW OF AUTHORITY
At one point he intervened to emphasise that he had not discussed in advance what the officials were going to tell him, as if to dispel the impression that the proceedings had been choreographed.
In reality, the televised meeting appeared calculated to convey the impression of a leader carefully arriving at an important decision after weighing all the evidence from his subordinates.
It also gave Putin the chance to demonstrate his authority over the most powerful people in the land, putting them in their place if they slipped up.
He jumped in to chastise foreign intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin when the latter said he ""will support"" recognition of the Donbass regions.
""Will support, or do support? Tell me straight, Sergei Yevgenievich,"" Putin said.
When Naryshkin then said he supported the breakaway regions becoming part of Russia, Putin upbraided him again: ""We're not talking about that... We're talking about whether to recognise their independence or not.""
Naryshkin: ""Yes, I support the proposal to recognise their independence.""
Putin: ""Ok, please sit down, thank you.""

With all the reports delivered, all eyes turned to Putin to pronounce his verdict - but he was not yet ready to end the suspense.
""A decision will be taken today,"" he said - and with that, the cameras stopped rolling.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) -The World Court started to hear preliminary arguments on Monday in a case brought against Myanmar demanding that it halt alleged acts of genocide against its Rohingya Muslim minority, with representatives of the junta appearing for Myanmar.
Presiding Judge Joan Donoghue briefly addressed the debate over who has the right to represent the Southeast Asian country at the U.N. court after the military took power a year ago.
The junta, which detained civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi in a coup last February, has not been recognised by the United Nations General Assembly. 
Monday was the first of four days of hearings discussing the junta's objections to the jurisdiction of the court, formally known as the International Court of Justice (ICJ). A decision could take months to reach.
The junta nevertheless wants to be Myanmar's formal representative. The parallel civilian National Unity Government, made up of members of the ousted administration and other junta opponents, accepts the court's jurisdiction and also wants to be Myanmar's representative.
The case before the ICJ was brought in 2019 by Gambia, a predominantly Muslim West African country, backed by the 57-nation Organisation for Islamic Cooperation.
Gambia argues that Myanmar has violated the Genocide Convention, citing events in 2017, when more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims fled Myanmar into neighbouring Bangladesh after a military crackdown. A U.N. fact-finding mission concluded that the military campaign had included ""genocidal acts"".
The Myanmar military denies the accusation, saying it was conducting a legitimate counterinsurgency campaign.
Judge Donoghue recalled that the parties in cases before the court ""are states, not particular governments"", before going on to call on Myanmar's new representative, Ko Ko Hlaing.
Ko Ko Hlaing is minister for international cooperation for the junta. While stressing that Myanmar was arguing the case was inadmissible because the court lacked jurisdiction, he added that the junta wanted to cooperate with the process. 
""Myanmar raises these preliminary objections with utmost respect to the court,"" he said. 
'NO LEGAL STANDING'
Lawyers for the junta argued on Monday that Gambia was a proxy for others and had no legal standing to bring a case. 
Lawyers for Gambia will be able to respond on the second day of hearings, set for Wednesday. 
Outside the court some 20 protesters braved strong winds and heavy rain, holding ""Save Myanmar"" banners and beating pots and pans in protest at the arrival of junta representatives.
""The military dictatorship is not only killing Rohingya but also all the ethnic (groups),"" protester Zin Min Hdun told Reuters.
At a news conference outside the court, the foreign minister of the National Unity Government had called on judges not to recognise junta representatives.
Suu Kyi attended preliminary hearings in the case in 2019 in the Hague, when she also denied genocide had taken place.
In a 2020 decision, the court ordered Myanmar to take measures to protect the Rohingya from harm, given the urgency of the matter.
Speaking to reporters outside the court, Ambia Perveen of the European Rohingya Council said that, while the junta does not represent the people of Myanmar, it was important the case moved ahead.

""The people who perpetrated genocide should be brought to justice,"" she said.
Should the court rule that it has jurisdiction to hear the case, a decision on the merits of Gambia's allegation could take years more to reach.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Tackling climate change is a security threat that requires accelerated action even as international attention is focussed on Russia and Ukraine, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said on Monday during a visit to Cairo.
Egypt will host the COP27 climate conference in November and Kerry said the task for this year was to bring more countries, including Russia and China, on board to set ambitious climate goals, as well as implementing pledges made at COP26 in Glasgow.
Kerry, a former secretary of state, said the crisis between Russia and Ukraine made him concerned over issues such as the principles of international law and respect for borders.
""But I am concerned in terms of the climate efforts that a war is the last thing you need with respect to a united effort to try to deal with the climate challenge,"" Kerry told Reuters.
""Obviously we hope that we can compartmentalise, but it's just made that much more difficult without any question.""
After meeting Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, who will chair COP27, Kerry told reporters that climate change was a ""national, international security threat to all of us.""
Egypt and the United States have created a working group to set priorities for COP27 and to support Egypt's energy transition, Shoukry and Kerry said.
Egypt has set a goal of generating 42% of its power from renewables by 2030, though experts have suggested the target could be more ambitious. The government is preparing a new strategy for 2050. 
Kerry cited work to help provide finance and technology to Indonesia, and to support China in accelerating its reduction of coal consumption, as examples of a push to secure new commitments ahead of COP27.
But he also said the energy transition had not reached the speed required. ""We're not moving fast enough, not enough is happening."" 

Asked about the risk that companies ""greenwash"" their activities with net-zero announcements, Kerry said rules agreed in Glasgow to ensure transparency would help, as would satellites tracking carbon and methane emissions. 
""We have accountability that we've really never had before, and we have to make sure we're applying it,"" he said.

VIENNA (Reuters) -Efforts to revive Iran's 2015 nuclear deal cannot succeed unless Washington lifts ""major"" sanctions, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said on Monday, as sources said indirect talks between Iran and the United States were reaching a final stage. 
Reuters reported last week that a U.S.-Iranian deal is taking shape in Vienna after months of indirect talks to revive the nuclear pact abandoned in 2018 by then-U.S. President Donald Trump, who also reimposed extensive sanctions on Iran.
""The United States must prove its will to lift major sanctions,"" Raisi said at a joint news conference with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani in Doha.
""To reach an agreement, guarantees are necessary for negotiations and nuclear issues.""
Iran had demanded legal assurances that the United States will not exit the deal again but Washington says it is impossible for U.S. President Joe Biden to provide them. A senior Iranian official told Reuters that Tehran had shown flexibility in response by agreeing to ""inherent guarantees"". 
A draft text of the agreement also alluded to other issues, including unfreezing billions of dollars in Iranian funds in South Korean banks, and the release of Western prisoners held in Iran.
""Aggression is bound to fail. Resistance has brought results and none of the regional issues have a military solution,"" Raisi, a hardliner, said in Doha.
He was more cautious than Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh, who said earlier on Monday that the Vienna negotiations had made ""significant progress"".
Khatibzadeh added, however, that ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"", telling a weekly press briefing: ""The remaining issues are the hardest.""
Two sources close to the Vienna talks told Reuters that some minor technical issues were being discussed and that a deal was expected before end of the week. 
Khatibzadeh said the talks were being handled by Iran's top security body, the Supreme National Security Council, which reports directly to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
The 2015 deal between Iran and world powers limited Tehran's enrichment of uranium to make it harder for it to develop material for nuclear weapons, if it chose to, in return for a lifting of international sanctions against Tehran.
Since 2019, Tehran has gone well beyond the deal's limits, rebuilding stockpiles of enriched uranium, refining it to higher fissile purity and installing advanced centrifuges to speed up output.
Iran's foreign minister said on Saturday that Tehran is ready to swap prisoners with the United States, and that talks to revive the nuclear deal could succeed ""at the earliest possible time"" if Washington made the necessary political decisions.
Speaking from Doha on the sidelines of a gas conference, Iranian Oil Minister Javad Owji called the sanctions, which have squeezed Iran's oil exports, a violation of international law and a threat to global energy security, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.

Israel, Iran's arch-foe and widely believed to have its own nuclear arsenal, has been closely watching the Vienna talks. It is pressing Washington about the terms of an emerging Iranian nuclear deal, Israeli officials said on Monday, raising the prospect of a bilateral day-after agreement with Washington to address their worries.
While not a party to the talks, Israel has conferred with the U.S. administration in hope of wielding more clout over any revival of the deal with Tehran reached over its objections.

BAMAKO (Reuters) - Mohamed Cisse used to employ hundreds of workers in Mali's capital Bamako before economic sanctions last month shut borders and cut the lifeblood of his construction business.
Cement is scarce. Its key ingredient, clinker, comes from neighbouring Senegal, from which all but essential goods are blocked. Cisse has been forced to shut three of his four building sites. 
The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) meant to send a powerful message to Mali's military leaders when it imposed the sanctions after the junta delayed plans to hold elections in February following two coups. 
But workers, many of whom have so far supported the junta for ousting unpopular President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita in 2020, are worried about the outsized impact on ordinary citizens in one of the world's poorest countries.
Hundreds are being laid off; goods for import are stuck in mammoth traffic jams at border crossings; cotton and gold, major economic drivers, cannot reach regional buyers.
How successful the sanctions are in forcing Mali's leaders to hold elections sooner, or if they reduce support for the junta, could influence how ECOWAS seeks to punish other coup leaders in Guinea and Burkina Faso who have also snatched power over the past year. 
""We had a lot of hope when we saw these well-trained, well-structured soldiers. But the situation of this embargo, I would say that it is ... 70% the fault of the government, which presented an imprecise (election) timetable,"" Cisse said. 
The interim government set up by the junta did not respond to requests for comment. It had previously said the sanctions were ""disproportionate, inhumane, illegitimate and illegal"" and will have severe consequences on the population.
ECOWAS says it is imposing the sanctions because Mali's leaders said they would delay elections until December 2025, nearly four years later than they originally agreed. 
TIGHTENING NOOSE
Malians are accustomed to hardship. A decade-old Islamist insurgency has taken over parts of the north and centre, killing thousands. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a rise in the cost of fuel and other goods. 
But now the economy is under severe strain. Mali has defaulted on 54 billion CFA francs ($93 million) in interest and principal payments since January, data from the West Africa monetary union's debt agency Umoa-Titres shows.
The government says it is unable to meet its obligations because the sanctions have cut it off from regional financial markets.
""Closing landlocked Mali's borders, in a country that depends entirely on its coastal neighbours for trade, is nothing short of catastrophic,"" said Eric Humphery-Smith, an analyst at risk consultancy Verisk (NASDAQ:VRSK) Maplecroft. 
The authorities need tax income to pay about $120 million in monthly government wages, said Modibo Mao Makalou, an economist and former adviser to the ousted president Keita. But revenues, including from customs duties and income taxes, are under threat, he said.
Remittances from the region, key to the economy, are also being blocked as wire transfers and bank transfers fail to go through. 
""I think (the government) can last 2-3 months maximum, but the noose must be loosened,"" Makalou said, referring to the funds left to be able to pay wages and meet other outgoings. 
While the impact has yet to be shown in hard economic data, Malians are struggling. 
Issiaka Mahmoud Bah, managing director of Bamako-based recruitment firm Golden Resources Management, used to receive resumes from about 25 job applicants per day. He now gets up to 100. Meanwhile, the number of employers seeking workers has plummeted, he said. 
Revenues for Sonef, a transport company that buses people from Mali across West Africa, have dropped 80% in recent weeks, said company manager Mamadou Traore. Its customers, including people who transport dyed fabrics to Ivory Coast or bring in fish from Senegal, cannot travel, he said. 
""We have had to close several stopovers and put dozens of agents on technical unemployment,"" he said.

(Reuters) - The staff of Reuters has received a George Polk Award for its coverage of widespread intimidation of U.S. election workers by supporters of former President Donald Trump.
The prestigious Polk Awards, presented by Long Island University in the United States, honor special achievement in journalism, with particular focus on investigative reporting in the public interest.
Reporters Linda So, Jason Szep and the staff of Reuters were honored in the political reporting category for a series of reports called “Campaign of Fear.” The articles ​​revealed how the people who administer U.S. elections – from poll workers and ballot counters to county clerks and secretaries of state – have endured death threats and other intimidation from supporters of Trump, inspired by his false assertions of widespread fraud in the 2020 vote.

The work has had broad impact on U.S. law enforcement and legislators. A Justice Department task force has indicted two men over threats of violence against officials in the wake of the Reuters reports and is investigating others. At least 10 state legislatures are considering bills that would protect election workers from intimidation. 
The awards are named after George Polk, an American correspondent who was murdered in Greece in 1948 while covering the country’s civil war. 
Other recipients this year included ABC News, for reports on how climate change stoked famine in Madagascar; the Wall Street Journal, for a series that showed how Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) ignored warnings about the damaging effects of its business practices; and CNN, for its coverage of the Taliban’s reconquest of Afghanistan."

JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Israel is pressing the United States about the terms of an emerging Iranian nuclear deal, Israeli officials said on Monday, raising the prospect of a bilateral day-after agreement with Washington to address their worries. 
While not a party to the nuclear negotiations between Iran and world powers in Vienna, Israel has conferred with the U.S. administration in hope of wielding more clout over any revival of a 2015 deal with Tehran that was reached over its objections.
The United States under then-President Donald Trump withdrew from the original deal in 2018, with Israel's encouragement. Diplomats told Reuters last week that a new deal was taking shape. 
""We were unhappy with the deal to begin with...and of course we are more unhappy with (the emerging) deal,"" Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid told U.S.-Jewish leaders. 
""But there is a dialogue with the American administration about several issues that are surrounding this agreement.""
Among these, he said, was a demand by Tehran for the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps to be removed from the U.S. terrorism watchlist. Israel's message, Lapid said, was: ""This is just wrong. Don't do that.""
Iran and U.S. President Joe Biden's administration have not confirmed such a demand.
Lapid said Israel and the United States were also discussing ""other ways"" - which he did not detail - of preventing Iran from making enough progress in projects like uranium enrichment to reach the threshold of capability to develop a nuclear bomb. The Islamic Republic denies seeking nuclear weapons.
Addressing the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organisations separately, Transportation Minister Merav Michaeli - like Lapid a member of Israel's decision-making security cabinet - looked to post-deal talks with Washington.
""We will have to work on a complementary agreement between Israel and the U.S.,"" she said, without elaborating. 

Israel says it will not be bound by any deal and could eventually take unilateral action against Iranian nuclear sites. 
""There is a point at which we are going to tell the Americans (that) we have the freedom to act on Israel's security the way we understand,"" he said. ""And it might have some consequences and it might have some price tags attached to it.""

BEIJING (Reuters) -Beijing doused its Olympic flame on Sunday night, closing a Games that will be remembered for the extremes of its anti-COVID-19 measures and outrage over the doping scandal that enveloped 15-year-old Russian skating sensation Kamila Valieva.
Chinese President Xi Jinping was on hand for the snowflake-themed ceremony at the Bird's Nest stadium, where International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach described the Beijing Games as ""truly exceptional"" before declaring them closed.
The Beijing Games, contained inside a ""closed loop"", were the second Olympics in six months to be deprived by COVID-19 of much of its festivity.
They were also stalked by politics, with several countries staging a diplomatic boycott over China's human rights record, and the spectre of invasion of Ukraine by Russia, with President Vladimir Putin attending the opening ceremony in a show of solidarity against the West with Xi.
Still, China was spared any embarrassing protests by competitors over its treatment of the Uyghur Muslim minority or anything else, and the thousands of foreign journalists on hand were stuck inside the closed-loop, unable to report more widely.
Sunday night's ceremony was capped by a 90-second fireworks display that spelled out ""one world, one family,"" followed by a rendition of ""Auld Lang Syne"".
During the ceremony, Bach praised Beijing's organisers and made a call for unity as well as universal access to COVID-19 vaccines.
""You embraced each other, even if your countries are divided by conflict,"" he said. ""The unifying power of the Olympic Games is stronger than the forces that want to divide us: you give peace a chance.""
SNOWFLAKES AND LANTERNS
Bach was seated next to Xi during the opening ceremony, with space between them. 
On one side of the stadium, which was roughly half full, red Chinese lanterns projected a glow as Olympic athletes entered en masse to ""Ode to Joy"", dancing and taking selfies.
The Chinese team drew cheers that grew louder when San Francisco-born freestyle skier Eileen Gu, who won two golds and a silver for China, was shown on-screen. 
Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, joined in the applause, and Xi was later shown looking through binoculars at the spectacle of athletes walking across the illuminated LED-screen floor of the vast stadium. 
Later, a group of 365 people bade farewell with a glowing green willow twig, enacting a traditional Chinese gesture of regret over parting.
GOLD MEDALS, COVID TESTS
Beijing's tightly sealed bubble prevented the spread of the novel coronavirus at the Olympics or into the community, vindicating a zero-COVID policy that has isolated China inside what are nearly closed borders that shows no sign of easing.
However, many athletes had their Olympic dreams dashed by positive tests that prevented them from competing.
Dozens saw their preparations disrupted by enforced isolation, leading team officials and athletes to demand improved conditions including better food, internet, training equipment and more space. 
On the snow, the 18-year-old Gu delivered on the hype generated by her dozens of endorsement deals making her the youthful face of the Games even as her success raised questions about nationality and privilege.
Gu's performance is a boon for the development of snow sports in China. Xi hopes that hosting the Games will get 300 million people involved in winter sports.
China's nine gold medals exceeded expectations, putting it in third place, while winter sports powerhouse Norway, with a population of just 5.5 million, won a record 16.
DOPING SCANDAL
While Xi delivered a spectacle for a Chinese public that was unable to attend - tickets were not sold and many connected with the Olympics through the unexpected mania for panda mascot Bing Dwen Dwen - millions of Americans tuned out, with TV viewership reported to be far lower than during the 2018 Pyeongchang Games. 
The biggest legacy of the Beijing Olympics will be the controversy surrounding Valieva, who stumbled under pressure in her final skate, and the outrage directed towards Russian sports officials and the country's history of doping, which meant its athletes could not compete under Russia's flag. 
Valieva failed a doping test at her national championships in December but the result was only revealed on Feb. 8, a day after she helped the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) win the team event. 

She was nonetheless allowed to participate in the singles but finished fourth, her error-strewn performance prompting a harsh reaction from her coach Eteri Tutberidze that the IOC's Bach later said he found ""chilling"". 
The saga, which dominated the Games, reopened debate over the suitability of the Olympic environment for minors and prompted the world's top anti-doping authority to investigate Valieva's entourage.

Financial markets edged higher on the glimmer of hope for a diplomatic solution even as satellite imagery appeared to show Russian deployments closer to Ukraine's border, while sounds of fighting were heard on Monday in the east, where Ukrainian government forces are fighting pro-Russian separatists.
The office of French President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement he had pitched to both leaders a summit on ""security and strategic stability in Europe."" In a statement, the White House said Biden had accepted the meeting ""in principle"" but only ""if an invasion hasn't happened"". 
""We are always ready for diplomacy,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said. ""We are also ready to impose swift and severe consequences, should Russia instead choose war.""
Messages seeking comment from the Kremlin and the office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy were not immediately returned early on Monday. 
Few details of the proposed summit, announced after a volley of phone calls between Macron, Biden, Putin, Zelenskiy, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, are clear. 
Macron's office and the White House said the substance of the plan would be worked out by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov during their meeting planned for Feb. 24.
What role Ukraine would play in the summit, if any, was also uncertain.
A Biden administration official said in an email that the summit was ""completely notional"" as the timing and format had yet to be determined.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said there was a pressing need for talks to avoid war, while Germany said Russia should come back to the negotiating table.
While oil prices fell, Asian share markets pared losses and Wall Street futures rallied on news of the possible summit, Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia, said he was sceptical it would happen.
""But if Biden and Putin did meet, they should invite (Zelenskiy) to join,"" he said in a message posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
News of Macron's proposal comes after a week of heightened tension spurred by Russia's military buildup.
Russian forces have been massing around its neighbour since late last year, in what Western countries say is a prelude to an invasion that could come at any moment.
Russia denies any intention to invade, but nerves were further frayed when the Belarusian defence ministry announced that Russia would extend military drills in Belarus that had been due to end on Sunday. 
U.S.-based satellite imagery company Maxar reported multiple new deployments of Russian military units in forests, farms, and industrial areas as little as 15 km (9 miles) from the border with Ukraine.
On Sunday, Blinken said the extension of the exercises in Belarus, bordering Ukraine to the north, made him more worried that Russia was on the brink of an attack and every opportunity had to be taken to get diplomacy to work.
Belarus said Russian troops would go home from the exercises when there was ""an objective need"" to do so, the Interfax news agency said.
In a letter to U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, seen by Reuters, the United States raised concern that ""further Russian invasion of Ukraine may create a human rights catastrophe"", including the possible rounding up and killing of opponents.
SPORADIC SHELLING
Sporadic shelling across the line dividing Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian separatists in the east has intensified since Thursday.
Sounds of fighting were heard again on Monday, including a blast in the centre of the separatist-held city of Donetsk. The cause was not known.
The rebels said two civilians were killed in shelling by Kyiv government forces, Russia's RIA news agency said. Russian media reported 61,000 evacuees from east Ukraine had crossed into Russia.
Kyiv has accused pro-Russian forces of shelling their own compatriots in the breakaway region in order to blame the attacks on Ukrainian government forces.
Western countries are preparing sanctions they say would be wide-reaching against Russian companies and individuals in case of an invasion, including steps to bar U.S. financial institutions from processing transactions for major Russian banks, people familiar with the matter said.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the BBC such measures could include curbs on Russian businesses' access to the dollar and the pound. 

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told German broadcaster ARD that Russia ""would in principle be cut off from the international financial markets"" and from major European exports.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said it was time for the West to impose at least part of the sanctions it has prepared, but the Biden administration has declined to do so, saying their deterrent effect would be lost if used too soon.

Taiwan's foreign ministry said Pompeo and his wife would visit the Chinese-claimed island from March 2-5, and also meet Foreign Minister Joseph Wu and give a speech at a think-tank.
""Former Secretary of State Pompeo is a long-term and staunch friend of Taiwan and made outstanding contributions to promoting Taiwan-U.S. relations during his time in office,"" the ministry said in a statement. His visit shows the bipartisan ""rock solid"" U.S. support for Taiwan and the close Taiwan-U.S. friendship, it added.
The Donald Trump administration gave strong backing to Taiwan, despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties, including high profile arms sales and visits of top U.S. officials to Taipei.
China put sanctions on ""lying and cheating"" Pompeo and 27 other top Trump-era officials as President Joe Biden took office in January 2021.
In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin noted that Pompeo had been sanctioned by China due to his ""anti-China actions"". Taiwan will only ""get burned"" in its attempts to solicit support from the United States for its independence, he told reporters.
China has stepped up its military and diplomatic pressure against Taiwan over the past two years seeking to force the island to accept its sovereignty.

Taiwan's government says it wants peace but will defend itself if attacked, and that only the island's people have the right to decide their future.
Separately, Wang also announced sanctions on U.S. companies  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp over U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, at least the third time it has announced punishments against the firms.

The school was closed at the time of the crash just before 9 a.m. (0530 GMT), army spokesman Shahin Taqi-Khani said. 
He said technical failure appeared to be the cause of the crash, but that an investigation was underway.
The pilot and a trainee pilot were killed, as well as a civilian passing by in a car, he said.
The TV showed fire fighters extinghising the blaze.

Experts say Iran has a poor air safety record, with repeated crashes, many involving U.S.-built aircraft bought before the 1979 Islamic revolution.
The United States, which broke diplomatic ties in 1980 after Iranian students took U.S. diplomats hostage, imposed sanctions on Iran making it difficult for Tehran to buy spare parts for its military and civilian aircraft.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia on Monday fully reopened its international borders to travellers vaccinated against the coronavirus after nearly two years of pandemic-related closings as tourists returned and hundreds of people were reunited with family and friends.
More than 50 international flights will reach the country through the day, including 27 touching down in Sydney, its largest city, as the tourism and hospitality sectors look to rebuild after getting hammered by COVID-19 restrictions.
""It is a very exciting day, one that I have been looking forward to for a long time, from the day that I first shut that border right at the start of the pandemic,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in the island state of Tasmania, which relies heavily on tourism.
After being away from loved ones for months there were many emotional reunions, including for Cindy Moss who travelled from the U.S. state of Kentucky to see her daughter. 
""I just haven't seen her in so long and it was such a big thing to be able to get over here. So I'm so excited,"" she said after hugging her daughter, her voice cracking with emotion.
Tourism is one of Australia's biggest industries, worth more than A$60 billion ($43 billion) and employing about 5% of the country's workforce. But the sector was crippled after the country shut its borders in March 2020.
Once a champion of COVID-suppression strategy, Australia shifted away from its fortress-style controls and relentless lockdowns since late last year and began living with the virus after reaching higher vaccination levels. Skilled migrants, international students and backpackers have been allowed to fly into Australia since November in a staggered reopening exercise.
""IT'S A PARTY OUT HERE""
Passengers flying to Sydney were greeted from the air with ""Welcome Back World!"" painted on a sign near the runways while people in kangaroo costumes welcomed travellers and a DJ played music from a van festooned with a banner saying ""You were worth the wait"".
""It is a party out here, music playing, smiles on people's faces, they will be dancing soon, I'm sure,"" Tourism Minister Dan Tehan told broadcaster ABC from Sydney airport as he gave travellers gift jars of Vegemite, an iconic Australian food spread, and stuffed koala toys.
Tehan said he was hopeful for a ""very strong"" rebound in the tourism market, with Qantas looking to fly more than 14,000 passengers into Australia this week. Virgin Australia said it was seeing positive trends in domestic bookings and continued to assess demand for international flights.
All trains in Sydney, meanwhile, were cancelled on Monday after pay disputes between the union and the state government, taking some shine off the reopening. 
As borders fully reopen, Australia's outbreak of the Omicron coronavirus variant appears to have passed its peak with hospital admissions steadily falling over the past three weeks. The bulk of Australia's pandemic total of about 2.7 million confirmed cases has been detected since the emergence of Omicron in late November. Total deaths stood at 4,929. 

Just over 17,000 new cases and 17 deaths were registered by midday on Monday with the Northern Territory due to report later.

KYIV (Reuters) - Alisa, a 38-year-old Ukrainian with an office job in the capital, had always enjoyed sport shooting and joined a local territorial defence unit more than a year ago to acquire combat skills. 
Now she is worried she might have to use those skills in a real war with Russia.
""People die, that's horrible. Even worse is when you think not just about your life but about the life of a 7-year-old child,"" she said in an interview with Reuters in her house outside Kyiv while her son, Timur, watched cartoons. 
""I realise he can be hurt because of silliness of the neighbouring country, not a brother country anymore,"" said Alisa, who asked to be identified only by her first name.
Russia's build-up of tens of thousands of troops near the borders with Ukraine has stirred fears in Ukraine and Western countries that it is poised to invade, something Moscow denies.
Alisa joined the territorial defence forces a year and a half ago, earlier than many. In January, as the Russian troops massed, the government said it wanted to build reserve batallions up into a corps of up to 130,000 people.
Alisa said she has seen dozens of new people joining the training sessions each Saturday.
She began this weekend as she often does, putting on camouflage fatigues, taking one of her two small-calibre guns she keeps at home and heading to a training ground - a pine forest with sand dunes, an old railway and few abandoned construction sites.
Along with dozens of other volunteers, mostly men in their late 30s and 40s with civilian jobs, she then spent seven hours either with her weapon on the ground or on guard as a part of a small patrol tasked to protect a concrete building from enemy saboteurs.
She said the fact she has at least basic training is some comfort.
""If, God forbid, a war starts ... I know how to move from an unsafe point A to a safe point B,"" Alisa said.
""I understand how to do if I'm under fire. I know how to help Timur, friends, neighbours if they are caught in fire.""
EARLY STARTS
Alisa, a motorcycle fan, has visited more 50 countries along with her husband, also a biker. She is a media relations specialist at an organization that works in cyber security.
She tries not to skip training sessions herself even if she badly needs rest at the end of the working week.
""If we had peace time I would miss training if I was tired but now I make myself get up early for a session because now it's needed more than ever,"" she said.

Alisa said she likes gaining new skills that have built her self-confidence and courage, but hopes never to have to use them.
""I feel anger, hatred and I have my plans cancelled. It's all surreal for me and I don't get how such silly things can happen in a civilized world in the 21st century,"" she said.

While the two countries share the island of Hispaniola, they are worlds apart in terms of development. Crime-plagued Haiti is one of the poorest nations in the Americas while the Dominican Republic, a popular Caribbean tourist destination, has prospered in recent decades amid marked political stability.
Many Haitians cross the border clandestinely in search of work in the fields or in the construction industry in the Dominican Republic. 
""The benefit for both nations will be of great importance,"" said Dominican President Luis Abinader shortly before pushing the button to begin pouring concrete into the foundations of what will be the wall in the province of Dajabón, some 230 kilometers northwest of the capital.
About 500,000 Haitians and tens of thousands of their descendents live in the Dominican Republic, a Spanish-speaking nation of about 11 million people, according to the most recent immigration survey conducted in 2018.
Abinader estimated the border wall will reduce the smuggling of commercial goods, weapons and help fight organized crime in both nations.
He started the project, which aims to build a 164 kilometer wall, ahead of the anniversary of the Dominican Republic's independence from Haiti on Feb. 27, 1844. 
Abinader said the first phase of the project will be completed within nine months at the latest. 
The 20-centimetre-thick concrete wall topped by a metal mesh will be 3.9 meters (12.8 ft) high and will have fiber optics for communications, movement sensors, cameras, radars and drones.

The project also includes the construction of 70 watchtowers and 41 access gates for patrolling.

371,"<span>Feb 20, 2022 06:46PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -Police in Portland, Oregon, said they believe a shooting that left one woman dead and five people wounded at a protest over police violence on Saturday night was triggered by a clash between an armed homeowner and armed demonstrators.
The shooting took place as people gathered in northeast Portland on Saturday to protest the death of Amir Locke, the 22-year-old fatally shot earlier this month by law enforcement in Minneapolis during a no-knock apartment raid.
The Portland Police Bureau said in a statement on Sunday that a preliminary investigation indicated the incident ""started with a confrontation between an armed homeowner and armed protesters"" but that detectives were still struggling to gather evidence.
In an online briefing on Sunday afternoon, department spokesperson Nathan Sheppard said detectives believe numerous people either saw the shooting or recorded it on their phones but have not cooperated with police.
The police said they found one woman dead when they arrived at the scene in the Rose City Park neighborhood on Saturday night. They have not identified the deceased or the five wounded people who were taken to area hospitals for treatment.
Protesters at Normandale Park were getting ready to march when a man who lives close by confronted them and later opened fire, striking multiple people, the Oregonian reported on Sunday, citing a source with direct knowledge of the investigation.
The Portland-based newspaper said that at least one protester shot back at the man who had opened fire. Of the five wounded in the incident, the man is one of three people who suffered life-threatening injuries, the newspaper said.
The police believe the man acted alone and is not affiliated with any political group, the Oregonian said. 
The protester who shot back at the man was initially arrested on assault and weapons charges but will likely be released and the charges dropped, the newspaper said.
During the news briefing, Sheppard declined to offer any details on the investigation, including whether anyone has been arrested in connection with the shooting. Pressed on why he would not confirm or deny an arrest, Shepperd said it would be ""irresponsible"" due to the ""complicated"" nature of the incident.
Portland was rocked by months of anti-racism protests following the death of George Floyd, an African-American who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes in May 2020.

The city has also been a magnet for clashes between political extremists, with violent skirmishes breaking out between people associated with the far-right Proud Boys and members of antifa, the loosely organized anti-fascist movement.
Like many other big U.S. cities, Portland has seen a spike in murders over the past two years, a phenomenon experts have attributed partly to the social disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canadian police on Sunday secured the downtown core of the capital with fencing as city workers cleaned up trash and snow plows cleared streets after two days of tense standoffs and 191 arrests ended a three-week occupation of Ottawa.
Demonstrators had used hundreds of trucks and vehicles to block the city center since Jan. 28, prompting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to invoke rarely used emergency powers. Seventy-six vehicles had been towed, police said.
Stragglers on Sunday packed up a logistics depot the so-called ""Freedom Convoy"" had set up in a parking lot near the highway to supply the protesters camped several kilometers away in front of parliament, as police handed out flyers warning them to leave soon or risk arrest and a fine. 
""We were running support for the convoy and the people in the downtown core - food, fuel, basic necessities,"" said Winton Marchant, a retired firefighter from Windsor, Ontario. ""This was the base camp and we are cleaning up.""
The protesters initially wanted an end to cross-border COVID-19 vaccine mandates for truck drivers, but the blockade turned into a demonstration against Trudeau and the government.
On Saturday, police used pepper spray and stun grenades on the die-hard protesters who remained, clearing most of the area in front of parliament. Other demonstrators abandoned their positions in other parts of the downtown area during the night.
Those arrested so far face 389 different criminal charges, including obstructing police, disobeying a court order, assault, mischief, possessing a weapon and assaulting a police officer, Ottawa's Interim Police Chief Steve Bell told reporters. 
""We're not done with this operation yet,"" Bell said. Over the ""next several days"" police will determine ""how we maintain a presence and make sure that nobody returns to occupy our streets again,"" Bell said.
For the first time in weeks, there was only snow and silence downtown. The trucks blaring their horns were gone. One resident said he felt relief.
""We seem to have gotten over the hump,"" Ottawa resident Tim Abray told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (CBC). But Abray, a communications consultant, said the political division will not go away so easily.
Protesters who were filmed by police and have since left the city will be held to account, Bell said on Saturday.
""We will actively look to identify you and follow up with financial sanctions and criminal charges... This investigation will go on for months to come."" 
During the past two days of protests in Ottawa and in British Columbia, where a group temporarily shut down a border crossing south of Vancouver on Saturday, several TV reporters were harassed, insulted, threatened and pushed by demonstrators. 
Industry Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that such treatment of journalists was ""profoundly disturbing"".
One criminal investigation into the treatment of a member of the media is ongoing, Bell said, adding ""the media has been subjected to slurs, to abuse"".
Trudeau on Monday invoked emergency powers to give his government wider authority to stop the protests, including sweeping powers to freeze the accounts of those suspected of supporting the blockades, without obtaining a court order.
So far 206 bank and corporate accounts have been frozen, and one financial institution blocked a ""payment processor"" account holding C$3.8 million ($2.98 million), police said, adding that they were still collecting information on companies and people.
Parliament continued debate over the use of the emergency powers on Sunday, with a required vote and expected passage of the powers due on Monday. The powers were fundamental in coordinating police to break up the Ottawa protest, Bell said. 
Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair, suggested in an interview with the CBC that the extraordinary powers may not be needed much longer.

""We're tracking it hourly,"" he said. ""They will only be in place as long as they are needed to get the job done.""

CORFU, Greece (Reuters) -Firefighters battling for a third day a blaze on a ferry sailing from Greece to Italy recovered on Sunday the body of a passenger listed as missing, Greek authorities said.
It is the first reported fatality after rescuers managed to take at least 281 out of 292 passengers and crew to safety from a blaze which broke out on the Italian-flagged Euroferry Olympia early on Friday. 
The ferry had been on its way to the Italian port of Brindisi from Igoumenitsa in Greece when it was engulfed by flames off the island of Corfu in the Ionian Sea. 
Many of the passengers were truck owners or drivers transporting goods through Europe.
The dead man was found in the cabin of a truck in the ship's hold and had suffered serious burns, a fire brigade official said.
A total of 10 people, all Bulgarian, Turkish and Greek nationals, are still missing, according to the coastguard.
Earlier on Sunday rescue teams found a survivor, a man from Belarus, at the stern of the ferry, according to the coastguard, reviving hopes that other missing passengers could still be found alive.
Firefighters have been trying for days to contain the fire and cool scorching temperatures on the 183-metre (600 ft) ship to allow emergency crews to board and rescue any survivors. 
The cause of the blaze is still being investigated and a prosecutor has launched an inquiry, according to coastguard officials. 
Reuters footage showed rescuers climbing a stepladder to the vessel after a tug boat towed it closer to the shore.
Aerial footage released by the Greek coastguard on Friday showed rows of burnt trucks on the blackened deck after flames swept through the ship. The ferry was carrying 153 vehicles, the company said.

A group of truck drivers who survived the ordeal arrived back in Bulgaria in the early hours of Sunday.
""Once we were in the boats we saw the huge flames. Everything burned, the losses are big, but I am glad we are alive and we will see our families,"" truck driver Rumen Cholakov told Bulgarian Nova TV.

WINDSOR, England (Reuters) - News that Britain's Queen Elizabeth had tested positive for COVID-19 drew shock, concern and messages of goodwill from across the country on Sunday, with politicians and the public willing the 95-year-old to recover. 
On a wet and blustery day, a few sightseers gathered at the gates of Windsor Castle where the queen is receiving medical treatment for mild symptoms. Others went online to express support and message boards in the London Underground urged the monarch to ""take it easy"". 
Many said they were troubled by the news after the world's longest reigning monarch pulled out of a number of high-profile events and spent a night in hospital last October, igniting fears about her health. 
Julie and Rupert Wills, visiting Windsor to the west of London, said they loved the queen ""to bits"", with Rupert respecting her ability to just ""quietly get on with"" things. Sanil Solanki, 43, described her as the nation's mother. 
For 19-year-old Gerard Smith, the news had come as a shock. ""Everyone loves her,"" he said. ""She can't do wrong to anyone. She's been there my whole lifetime and the lifetime of almost everyone. It's sad to hear. Hopefully she makes it through."" 
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson led the official response, saying he was sure he spoke for the nation when he wished the queen a swift recovery and a rapid return to vibrant good health. 
Opposition leader Keir Starmer said: ""Get well soon Ma'am."" Many other politicians simply tweeted ""God Save The Queen"". 
The U.S. Embassy in London sent best wishes. The chief minister of Gibraltar, Fabian Picardo, described the queen as ""a rock"" in reference to the British territory's landscape. 
The widespread support for the queen follows the anniversary earlier this month when she quietly marked 70 years on the throne, the first British sovereign to do so. 
The Palace said the queen was showing mild symptoms and was expected to continue ""light duties"" over the coming week. 

In keeping with that, the queen released a statement shortly afterwards praising the British women's curling team for their Olympic gold medal in Beijing. 
""I know that your local communities and people throughout the United Kingdom will join me in sending our good wishes to you, your coaches and the friends and family who have supported you in your great success,"" she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration on Sunday refused to unleash sanctions on Russia ahead of a widely anticipated Russian invasion of Ukraine despite mounting criticism from Kyiv and domestic rivals.
The United States and Britain have repeatedly cautioned in recent days that Russia is about to launch a military invasion of Ukraine, a plan Russia denies. Sanctioning Vladimir Putin's government before he invades would just guarantee such a crisis happens immediately, U.S. officials argue. 
""The purpose of the sanctions in the first instance is to try to deter Russia from going to war. As soon as you trigger them that deterrence is gone,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken told CNN's ""State of the Union"" show.
The West has threatened Moscow with severe economic sanctions should it press ahead with an invasion that they say would punish state banks and Russian oligarchs, limit exports and cripple the economy.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and a growing chorus of critics argue that if the United States and its allies are so certain Putin plans to invade, they should apply sanctions now. 
""You tell me 100% that there will be war in a few days’ time. What are you waiting for?"" a frustrated Zelenskiy asked the audience at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, repeating an earlier call on the West to impose sanctions on Russia now instead of later.
""We will not need your sanctions after there is a bombardment, or after our state is shot at, or if we have no more borders, we do not have an economy, or parts of our state is occupied,"" Zelenskiy said.
Speaking to reporters in Munich, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said the sanctions that would be imposed would be some of the ""greatest if not the strongest"" in history, but echoed Blinken's view that there was still some way to stop Putin from invading. 
""We have agreed that the deterrence effect of these sanctions is still a meaningful one, especially because -- remember, also -- we still sincerely hope that there is a diplomatic path out of this moment. 
Republican Senator Ted Cruz, speaking on Fox News Sunday, questioned if the United States has done everything it can to stop Putin. ""Not remotely, and tragically, Europe is on the verge of war because of the weakness, the fecklessness of Joe Biden,"" he said.
Pentagon press secretary John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) argued that sanctioning Russia now would trigger an invasion. 
""If you punish someone for something they haven’t done yet then they might as well just go ahead and do it,” John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said on Fox News Sunday.

On Sunday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the United States and Britain would cut off Russian companies' access to U.S. dollars and British pounds if the Kremlin orders the invasion. He said the Western sanctions would go much further than he has previously suggested in public.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Novak Djokovic was looking forward to kick-starting his 2022 season in Dubai following his deportation from Australia, and said he would be the first to congratulate U.S. Open champion Danil Medvedev if the Russian ends his two-year reign at the top of the world rankings this week.
The 34-year-old Serbian will play competitively on Monday for the first time this year in his opening Dubai Duty Free Championships match against Italy's Lorenzo Musetti, ranked 57th in the world.
""I am as well prepared as I possibly can be and excited to again be able to tour,"" he told a press conference on Sunday.
Djokovic, who is chasing his 6th tournament win in Dubai, said he resumed training about 10 days after he was deported from Australia and had been playing tennis for the past three weeks.
""I did my best to put myself in a good position tennis-wise and mentally as well ... I'm really happy to be playing again.""
The world number one, who is not vaccinated against COVID-19, was flown out of Australia after an 11-day ordeal, at the discretion of the country's immigration minister over concerns the tennis star could fuel anti-vax sentiment.
Djokovic has said that he is not an anti-vaxxer and that his refusal to be vaccinated stems from uncertainty over how a coronavirus vaccination could affect his playing performance.
World number two Medvedev, who is playing in the Mexican Open this month, could dethrone Djokovic depending on how well each player performs in their respective tournaments.

""Eventually it's going to happen and if it happens this week, I'll be the first one to congratulate him,"" Djokovic said.
Medvedev was runner-up in last month's Australian Open.

MARIUPOL/DONETSK, Ukraine (Reuters) - Elderly men and women, some well past retirement age, are getting ready to fight on either side of the separatist conflict in Ukraine as tensions ratchet higher by the day.
Fighting between Russian-backed separatists and the Ukrainian army has been dragging on for eight years but an increase in shelling in recent days has deepened Western fears that Russia could use the conflict as a pretext to invade Ukraine - an accusation that Moscow denies.
In the Ukrainian port of Mariupol, less than 20 km (12 miles) from the nearest trenches, grizzled pensioners are among those coming forward to volunteer for Territorial Defence units where they receive basic weapons and first aid training. 
Anton, a welder in his late 50s, said he was sending his family away for safety to relatives in central Ukraine and staying to defend the city from potential attack.
""If it starts, I can literally sit on a bicycle and pedal straight to the trenches,"" he said.
Dmytro Bellykov, a pensioner in his 60s who first volunteered when the conflict broke out in 2014, said he would make his way to the recruitment centre on Monday.
""I want to make sure all my data are in order, so they don't forget about me,"" he said. ""I know weapons, I am not a bad marksman, I can repair weapons.""
Ukraine's most celebrated volunteer is Valentyna Kostyantynovska, 79, who came to prominence after she was filmed at a training ground handling a Kalashnikov assault rifle.
She said she had wanted to learn how to shoot ever since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. At the start of this year she joined the Territorial Defence and started training as a medic. ""But then I saw my dream, the machine gun ... and started learning how to use it,"" she told Reuters in Mariupol. 
""I cannot do much, I can help the wounded ... I will shoot and I know they will kill me,"" she said. ""And so it should be, so less young people would die.""
""TIRED OF WAITING""
On the opposite side of the conflict, a school gym in the separatist stronghold of Donetsk has been turned into an assembly point for reservists after a mass mobilisation was declared at the end of last week.
Reuters reporters saw about 50 men dressed in black or khaki, carrying backpacks and duffle bags. 
Among them were Vladimir Radkevich, 71, and his sons Roman and Denis, aged 45 and 34. The three said they had fought on the separatist side from 2014 but left the ranks in 2018, when the situation was calmer, and went to work as welders.
Now they are back, sensing a decisive moment in the long-running conflict.
""We said we'd return when it started again. To be honest, I felt it drawing me. Once you've been in the boiler, it's forever. This time it's going to be tougher, it's going to be mayhem,"" said Roman.
His father Vladimir said: ""We are united - these are Russian lands... We are already tired of waiting for this to end. It's time to end it.""
Leaders of the separatist areas of Donetsk and Luhansk began evacuating women and children to Russia at the end of last week, while raising their level of military alert. A text message sent to residents on Sunday said it was the ""sacred duty"" of men to join the defence of their fatherland.
Yury, a retired mining engineer aged 52, said the Ukrainian side was better prepared than in 2014 - ""there are instructors, newer equipment"" - and it would be tougher this time.

Alongside the older men, a young man with glasses said he was going to war for the first time.
After waiting in the gym for several hours, the two Radkevich brothers were placed in the same unit and left by bus on Saturday evening. Their father stayed behind, waiting for a decision on where he would be placed.

(Reuters) -Donald Trump's new social media venture, Truth Social, appears set to launch in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store on Monday, according to posts from an executive on a test version viewed by Reuters, potentially marking the return of the former president to social media on the U.S. Presidents Day holiday. 
In a series of posts late on Friday, a verified account for the network's chief product officer, listed as Billy B., answered questions on the app from people invited to use it during its test phase. One user asked him when the app, which has been available this week for beta testers, would be released to the public, according to screenshots viewed by Reuters.
""We're currently set for release in the Apple App store for Monday Feb. 21,"" the executive responded.
The launch would restore Trump's presence on social media more than a year after he was banned from  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's YouTube following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters, after he was accused of posting messages inciting violence.
On Feb. 15 Trump's eldest son Donald Jr. posted on Twitter a screenshot of his father's verified @realDonaldTrump Truth Social account with one post, or ""truth,"" that he uploaded on Feb. 14: ""Get Ready! Your favorite President will see you soon!"" 
Led by former Republican U.S. Representative Devin Nunes, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the venture behind Truth Social, will join a growing portfolio of technology companies that are positioning themselves as champions of free speech and hope to draw users who feel their views are suppressed on platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. So far none of the companies, which include Twitter competitors Gettr and Parler and video site Rumble, have come close to matching the popularity of their mainstream counterparts. 
""This week we will begin to roll out on the Apple App Store. That's going to be awesome, because we're going to get so many more people that are going to be on the platform,"" Nunes said in a Sunday appearance on Fox News' 'Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo'.
""Our goal is, I think we're going to hit it, I think by the by the end of March we're going to be fully operational at least within the United States,"" he added.
In addition to the post disclosing Monday's launch date, the screenshots seen by Reuters show the app is now at version 1.0, suggesting it has reached a level ready for public release. As late as Wednesday, it was at version 0.9, according to two people with access to that version. 
A representative for TMTG did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Apple's App Store listing indicates that Truth Social is expected to be released on Feb. 21, a date that a source familiar with the venture confirmed in January. But in recent weeks Nunes had said publicly that the app would launch by the end of March.
On Friday, Nunes was on the app urging users to follow more accounts, share photos and videos and participate in conversations, in an apparent attempt to drum up activity, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. 
Among Nunes' posts, he welcomed a new user who appeared to be a Catholic priest and encouraged him to invite more priests to join, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. 
NO WAY TO EDIT 'TRUTHS'
The chief product officer's other responses during Friday's question-and-answer session suggested the startup's features would resemble those of Twitter. 
Asked whether users would be able to edit their ""truths,"" the executive replied ""not yet."" The ability to edit posts after publication is something Twitter users have long sought.
The next significant feature released on the platform will be direct messages, or DMs, between users, the executive wrote. 
The company is also considering allowing users to sign up to receive notifications when others post content, the executive said. He signaled that the ability to block other users would be an important component.
""There will always be block functionality in the app,"" he wrote.
Truth Social will issue a policy on verified accounts ""in the coming weeks,"" the executive added.
Even as details of the app begin trickling out, TMTG remains mostly shrouded in secrecy and is regarded with skepticism by some in tech and media circles. It is unclear, for example, how the company is funding its current growth. 
TMTG is planning to list in New York through a merger with blank-check firm Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC), and stands to receive $293 million in cash that DWAC holds in a trust, assuming no DWAC shareholder redeems their shares, TMTG said in an Oct. 21 press release. 

Additionally, in December TMTG raised $1 billion committed financing from private investors; that money also will not be available until the DWAC deal closes.
Digital World's activities have come under scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, according to a regulatory filing, and the deal is likely months away from closing.

WINDSOR, England (Reuters) -Queen Elizabeth tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday, sharpening concerns about the health of the world's longest-reigning monarch two weeks after she marked 70 years on the British throne. 
The 95-year-old queen, who has been fully vaccinated against coronavirus, quipped just four days ago to Palace staff that she could not move much, and she spent a night in hospital last October for an unspecified ailment.
""The Queen has today tested positive for COVID,"" the Palace said. ""Her Majesty is experiencing mild cold like symptoms but expects to continue light duties at Windsor over the coming week.""
""She will continue to receive medical attention and will follow all appropriate guidelines,"" the Palace said. 
A number of staff have tested positive for COVID-19 at Windsor, the ancient castle where Elizabeth, the world's oldest monarch, spent much of her time during lockdowns designed to contain the pandemic.
Philip, the queen's husband of more than 70 years, died in April last year, aged 99. 
Their son, Charles, 73, the heir to the throne, earlier this month contracted COVID-19 for a second time. He had met the queen days before.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has said he nearly died from COVID-19 in 2020, was due to scrap coronavirus self-isolation rules as part of a ""living with COVID"" strategy that aims to achieve a faster exit from the pandemic than other major economies.
""I’m sure I speak for everyone in wishing Her Majesty The Queen a swift recovery from COVID and a rapid return to vibrant good health,"" Johnson said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
DEVOTION TO DUTY 
The queen quietly marked the 70th anniversary of her accession to the British throne in early February.
Elizabeth became the queen of Britain and more than a dozen other realms including Australia, Canada and New Zealand on the death of her father King George VI on Feb. 6, 1952, while she was in Kenya on an international tour.
She is the first British sovereign to spend seven decades on the throne in a dynasty that traces its origins back almost 1,000 years to Norman King William I and his 1066 conquest of England.
Elizabeth's achievement has been to maintain the popularity of the British monarchy in the face of seismic political, social and cultural change that threatened to make the world's most famous royal family an anachronism.
When she ascended the throne, Josef Stalin, Mao Zedong and Harry Truman were running the Soviet Union, China and the United States, respectively, while Winston Churchill was British prime minister.
Including Churchill, she has been served by 14 prime ministers - a quarter of the number in Britain since Robert Walpole 300 years ago. During her reign, there have been 14 U.S. presidents, all of whom she has met bar Lyndon Johnson.
Elizabeth's quiet devotion to duty has won her support and respect in the United Kingdom, and the broader Commonwealth, in contrast to the scandals that have engulfed other members of the royal family.
""She's an icon, she's an icon of the UK: she is an epitome of the UK in some ways, most people in the country have never known any monarch other than her,"" Steven Stepanian, who works as a consultant in London, told Reuters.
Shashi Vandrevala, a 72-year-old retiree, said: ""She has to get better, we can't afford to lose her yet.""
ROYAL FUTURE 
The queen has in recent years attempted to pass more duties to her heir, Charles, and to his eldest son, Prince William, and his wife, Kate. 
There are, though, concerns about the future. Such is the depth of respect for the queen that while she lives, the institution will be safe. What will follow is less certain.
Supporters see the queen as a unifying figure who bolsters Britain's prestige and economy. Opponents say the institution is a bastion of undeserved privilege, funded in part by taxpayers and undermined by some members' behaviour.
Prince Andrew, Elizabeth's second son, last week settled a lawsuit by Virginia Giuffre accusing him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager. Andrew, a former associate of Jeffrey Epstein, has denied accusations that he forced Giuffre to have sex at age 17 more than two decades ago.
Meanwhile, Prince Harry, once the Windsors' most popular member, and his American wife Meghan gave up their royal duties to move to Los Angeles. Meghan last year said concerns within the family had been raised over the skin colour of their son. 
She also accused the family of neglect, saying she ended up with suicidal thoughts after pleading for help and getting none. The queen said some recollections may vary. 
British police said last week they had begun an investigation into allegations in media reports that honours were offered to a Saudi national in return for donations to one of Prince Charles's charities.
For many British people, though, the queen is very special. 

As news of her COVID-19 infection spread, message boards in the London underground stations carried a goodwill message to the monarch, urging her to relax with her dogs.
""Get better soon Your Majesty - chill out with the Corgis,"" the message read. ""Get plenty of rest. You're simply the best. Thanks for being such a wonderful queen.""

A P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft was illuminated on Thursday while flying over Australia's northern approaches by a laser from a People's Liberation Army–Navy (PLA-N) vessel, potentially endangering lives, the defence department said.
Morrison said his government will demand answers from Beijing.
""I can see it no other way than an act of intimidation, one (...) unprovoked, unwarranted,"" Morrison said at a briefing. ""And Australia will never accept such acts of intimidation.""
Defence Minister Peter Dutton called the incident ""a very aggressive act"" that took place in Australia's exclusive economic zone. 
""I think the Chinese government is hoping that nobody talks about these aggressive bullying acts,"" Dutton told Sky News television. ""We're seeing different forms of it right across the region and in many parts of the world.""

The Chinese vessel was sailing east with another PLA-N ship through the Arafura Sea at the time of the incident, the department said. The sea lies between the north coast of Australia and the south coast of New Guinea.
Relations between Australia and China, its top trade partner, soured after Canberra banned Huawei Technologies Co Ltd from its 5G broadband network in 2018, toughened laws against foreign political interference, and urged an independent investigation into the origins of COVID-19.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Pro-Russian separatists said on Saturday they had uncovered a plan by Kyiv to seize territory they control in eastern Ukraine by force, and paraded a man they said was a Ukrainian spy.
Authorities in the Ukrainian capital quickly dismissed the alleged plan as a fake and have shrugged off spy allegations in the past, but such reports are contributing to a rise in tension. 
Fears are growing in Kyiv and the West that a false-flag operation - an act committed with the intent of pinning blame on another party - could be staged in eastern Ukraine and used as a pretext for Russia to attack.
Russia, which has massed forces near Ukraine, has denied plans to invade and dismissed talk of false-flag operations.
But it has said it is alarmed by the situation and separatist authorities in eastern Ukraine began a mass evacuation on Friday, citing fears of a Ukrainian offensive. 
The Ukrainian authorities deny planning any kind of assault, and fear that attempts to create a pretext for a Russian invasion are growing. 
On Saturday, separatists in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic said they had intercepted a plan to ""purge"" of the pro-Russian region of Russian speakers as part of a five-day operation to take the region by force.
In an interview broadcast on Russia's state Channel One television channel, a man whom the separatists said they had detained in the city of Donetsk said he had helped Ukraine blow up a separatist commander's jeep the night before and that he had smuggled weapons and explosives. 
""I was recruited in 2018,"" he was shown saying. 
He said his handler had told him to steer clear of tall apartment blocks in the city of Donetsk because it would be targeted by artillery and he risked being killed.
'HOSTILE AND INFLAMMATORY' 
Russian-backed rebels seized a swathe of eastern Ukraine and Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 after protests toppled Ukraine's pro-Russian leader. Kyiv says more than 14,000 people have been killed in the conflict in the east.
In the breakaway Luhansk region, local authorities said on Saturday a vehicle stuffed with explosives had been found parked on a road being used to evacuate people to Russia.
Authorities in the region also said explosions had torn through a local gas pipeline and a petrol station the previous night and described them as acts of sabotage which they suspected Ukraine was behind. 
In other incidents on Saturday, Russia's FSB security service said two shells landed on Russian territory near the border, Russia's Tass news agency reported. One hit a building in Rostov region but no one was hurt, it said.
Ukraine's military accused Russia of faking pictures of shells to make out they were Ukrainian, and said mercenaries had arrived in separatist-held eastern Ukraine to stage provocations in collaboration with Russian special forces. 
Helga Schmid, the secretary general of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) security watchdog, and Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau expressed concern about the growing rhetoric on Friday.
""We deplore the spreading of disinformation about an imminent military action by Ukrainian government forces; this critically affects the civilian population in the conflict zone,"" they said in a joint statement.

""The increasingly hostile and inflammatory rhetoric we have been hearing recently undermines efforts to foster peace, stability and security and increases the risks of further confrontation and escalation. It must stop.""
Moscow expressed surprise at the statement and questioned the impartiality of the OSCE.

DONETSK, Ukraine/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's strategic nuclear forces held exercises overseen by President Vladimir Putin on Saturday, and Washington accused Russian troops massed near Ukraine's border of advancing and being ""poised to strike"".
With Western fears of war rising, the White House said U.S President Joe Biden's national security team told him they still believed Russia could launch an attack in Ukraine ""at any time"" and he planned to convene his top advisers on Sunday to discuss the crisis.
Foreign ministers from the G7 group of rich nations said they had seen no evidence Russia is reducing its military activity in the area and remained ""gravely concerned"" about the situation.
After Kyiv and Moscow traded accusations over new shelling near the border, France and Germany urged all or some of their citizens in Ukraine to leave. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Russian forces were beginning to ""uncoil and move closer"" to the border.
""We hope he (Putin) steps back from the brink of conflict,"" Austin told a news conference in Lithuania, saying an invasion of Ukraine was not inevitable.
Russia ordered the military build-up while demanding NATO prevent Ukraine from ever joining the alliance but says Western warnings that it is planning to invade Ukraine are hysterical and dangerous. Moscow says it is pulling back, but Washington and allies say the build-up is mounting.
Washington and NATO say Moscow's main demands are non-starters, but in Ukraine fears are growing over Putin's plans. 
Venting his frustration at a security conference in Munich, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the global security architecture was ""almost broken"". He urged the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, Germany and Turkey to meet to draw up new security guarantees for his country.
""The rules that the world agreed on decades ago no longer work,"" Zelenskiy said. ""They do not keep up with new threats ... This is a cough syrup when you need a coronavirus vaccine.""
World Bank President David Malpass told Zelenskiy on Saturday the bank was readying funding to Ukraine of up to $350 million.
HYPERSONIC AND CRUISE MISSILES 
The Kremlin said Russia successfully test-launched hypersonic and cruise missiles at sea during the nuclear forces drills. Putin observed the exercises on screens with Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko from a ""situation centre"".
In his most pointed prediction so far, Biden said on Friday he was convinced that Putin has made the decision to invade Ukraine in the coming days, and Austin said on Saturday the nuclear forces exercises were stoking concerns around the world.
""President Biden continues to monitor the evolving situation in Ukraine, and is being updated regularly about events on the ground by his national security team,"" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement. ""They reaffirmed that Russia could launch an attack against Ukraine at any time."" 
G7 foreign ministers called on Russia to choose the path of diplomacy. ""As a first step, we expect Russia to implement theannounced reduction of its military activities along Ukraine'sborders. We have seen no evidence of this reduction,"" they said in a statement.
Zelenskiy said he had an ""urgent"" phone conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron and discussed possible ways of immediate de-escalation and political-diplomatic settlement. Macron is due to speak with Putin on Sunday.
The nuclear drills follow manoeuvres by Russia's armed forces in the past four months that have included a build-up of troops -- estimated by the West to number 150,000 or more -- to the north, east and south of Ukraine.
New helicopters and a battle group deployment of tanks, armoured personnel carriers and support equipment have been moved to sites in Russia near the border, according to U.S.-based Maxar Technologies (NYSE:MAXR), which tracks developments with satellite imagery.
Moscow-based analysts said Saturday's exercises were aimed at sending a message to take Russia's demands seriously. 
""Ignoring Russia's legitimate rights in this area adversely affects the stability not only on the European continent, but also in the world,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quoted by his ministry as telling his French counterpart by phone. 
A NATO official said the alliance relocated staff from Kyiv to the western city of Lviv and to Brussels for safety reasons. The United States and other countries have moved diplomats to Lviv.
SHELLING ALLEGATIONS 
Russian-backed rebels seized a swathe of eastern Ukraine and Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Kyiv says more than 14,000 people have been killed in the conflict in the east.
Separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine have declared a full military mobilisation after ordering women and children to evacuate to Russia, citing the threat of an imminent attack by Ukrainian forces, which Kyiv denied. 
Kyiv and Western leaders say the mobilisation, evacuation and increased shelling are part of a Russian plan to create a pretext for an invasion. 
Russia's FSB security service said two shells landed on Russian territory near the border, Russia's Tass news agency reported.
Ukraine's military accused Russia of faking pictures of shells to make out they were Ukrainian, and said mercenaries had arrived in separatist-held eastern Ukraine to stage provocations in collaboration with Russian special forces. 
Ukraine's foreign minister demanded an independent international investigation of the alleged incidents and the military said two soldiers had been killed in shelling by pro-Russian separatists in east Ukraine.
The two Russian-backed, self-proclaimed republics in Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions were hit by more than 1,400 explosions on Friday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said. And almost 2,000 ceasefire violations were registered in the area by OSCE monitors on Saturday, a diplomatic source told Reuters.
Multiple explosions were heard overnight into Sunday in the centre of the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk, a Reuters reporter said. The blasts' origin was not clear. There was no immediate comment from separatist authorities or Kyiv.

""It's really scary. I've taken everything I could carry,"" said Tatyana, 30, who was boarding a bus with her 4-year-old daughter. 
Russian news agencies said 10,000 evacuees had arrived in Russia. Separatist leaders say they aim to evacuate 700,000 people.

Flores was fired by the Dolphins in January and later filed the lawsuit alleging discrimination against Black candidates for top level coaching and management jobs.
Flores, who is Black, also accused Dolphins owner Stephen Ross of offering him $100,000 for each loss in 2019 as incentive to help the team land a higher draft pick and said his refusal to throw games ultimately cost him his job.
""I am excited about Brian Flores joining our coaching staff given his history of developing and teaching defensive players during his time in the NFL,"" said Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin. ""Brian's resume speaks for itself, and I look forward to him adding his expertise to help our team.""
Miami's firing of Flores was one of the more surprising head coach decisions following the 2021 National Football League season, given the Dolphins won eight of their final nine games after a 1-7 start.
In addition to the NFL and the Dolphins, the Denver Broncos and New York Giants were named in Flores' lawsuit, which contended his interviews for their vacant head coach positions were a sham aimed at satisfying a league rule that minority candidates must be considered for top coaching and staff jobs.
The NFL, Dolphins, Broncos and Giants have all denied Flores' accusations.
Flores' attorneys said that his lawsuit will continue.

""We congratulate coach Flores on his new position with the Steelers and thank coach Tomlin and the organization for giving him this great opportunity,"" attorneys Douglas H. Wigdor and John Elefterakis said in a statement.
""While coach Flores is now focused on his new position, he will continue with his race discrimination class action so that real change can be made in the NFL.""

CORFU, Greece (Reuters) -Twelve people are still missing after a blaze swept through a ferry sailing from Greece to Italy early on Friday, Greek authorities said on Saturday, as firefighters battled for a second day to control the fire and crews towed the vessel closer to the shore. 
Reuters live footage showed plumes of smoke pouring out of the Italian-flagged Euroferry Olympia as firefighters from a nearby vessel sprayed water onto the burning ferry in the Ionian Sea.
A total of 241 passengers and 51 crew were on board when the blaze broke out early on Friday and rescue vessels moved most of the 280 people who were rescued to the nearby island of Corfu.
The 183-metre (600-foot) ferry caught fire en route from Igoumenitsa, a port in Western Greece, to the Italian port of Brindisi, a nine-hour journey.
The missing passengers are from Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey and Lithuania, the Greek coastguard said, and their relatives faced an agonising wait for news.
""I'm very worried, I don't know what will happen,"" Ilias Gerontidakis, the son of a missing Greek truck driver, told state television from Corfu.
Aerial footage released by the Greek coastguard on Friday showed rows of burnt trucks on the blackened deck after flames engulfed the ship, owned by Grimaldi Lines. The ferry was carrying 153 vehicles, the company said.
As firefighters tried to cool scorching temperatures on the ship before emergency crews boarded it to resume search operations, the blazing ferry was towed closer to the shore for better protection against adverse weather, Greek coastguard and fire brigade officials said.
Late on Friday, Greek crews rescued two people, a Bulgarian and an Afghan citizen, who was not on the official list of missing people.
Bulgaria's Foreign Ministry said 127 Bulgarians were on board.
Most of those rescued were taken to hotels on Corfu, where some recounted their ordeal. 
""I have been coming and going for so many years, I have never experienced such a situation before,"" Greek truck driver, Giorgos Parlatzas, 50, who was evacuated from the ship, said from a Corfu hotel.
Consular staff from the passengers' home countries were in Corfu to help coordinate their safe return with the ferry company, a Reuters witness said.

A prosecutor has ordered an inquiry into the incident, the Greek coastguard said, adding that the captain and both first mates of the ship had been briefly detained to testify and were later released.
Authorities will have more evidence about the cause of the fire once the ship is tugged to a safe place, Shipping Minister Giannis Plakiotakis told Skai television.

The two Russian-backed, self-proclaimed republics in Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions are at the centre of a surge in tensions between Moscow and the West over a vast Russian military buildup near Ukraine.
The OSCE's Special Monitoring Mission that is deployed in the conflict zone said it had logged 553 explosions in Donetsk. 
A further 860 were reported in neighbouring Luhansk. Both numbers were valid as of 1630 GMT on Friday, it said in a statement released late on Saturday. 

The monitoring mission confirmed one civilian casualty in a government-controlled area of Donetsk. 
It put the total number of ceasefire violations on Friday at more than 1,500 compared with 870 the day before when monitors reported 654 explosions.

LONDON (Reuters) -Around 155,000 British homes were still without power late on Saturday after Storm Eunice knocked more than 1.3 million households off the grid the day before, energy companies said.
The fierce Atlantic storm brought record winds of up to 122 mph (196 kph) to Britain, killing three people and causing widespread disruption. At least six more deaths were reported in Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands.
Britain's Energy Networks Association, an umbrella group for power and gas companies, said 1.22 million customers out of the roughly 1.3 million affected by the storm had been reconnected as of 4 pm (1600 GMT) on Saturday. 
However 155,000 remained without power, mostly across southern England but also in the east of the country and in south Wales. At the start of the day, 226,000 lacked electricity.
""Strong winds across southern England are impacting restoration efforts,"" business and energy minister Kwasi Kwarteng said earlier in the day. ""We expect most customers to have supplies restored promptly,"" he added.
British energy companies have faced criticism after previous storms for being slow to reconnect more isolated properties.

Nearly 1 million homes lost power in November when a storm hit northeast England and eastern Scotland.
While power was restored to the vast majority of homes within 48 hours, more than 3,000 households did not regain access to mains power for a week or more, prompting the government to order a review of utility firms' preparedness.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former President Donald Trump took classified information to his Florida home after leaving the White House, the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration said in a letter to Congress on Friday about the 15 boxes of documents it recently recovered.
The Archives said it had informed the Department of Justice, which would handle any investigation.
""NARA has identified items marked as classified national security information within the boxes,"" David Ferriero, the archivist of the United States, said in a letter to Democratic U.S. Representative Carolyn Maloney, chair of the House of Representatives oversight committee.
Maloney's committee has been looking into Trump's handling of records by the Republican president, who left office in January 2021.
""These new revelations deepen my concern about former President Trump’s flagrant disregard for federal records laws and the potential impact on our historical record,"" Maloney said in a statement.
""The National Archives did not 'find' anything, they were given, upon request, presidential records in an ordinary and routine process to ensure the preservation of my legacy and in accordance with the Presidential Records Act,"" Trump said in a written statement. 
""If this was anyone but “Trump,” there would be no story here."" 
The letter from Ferriero also said that some White House staff conducted official business using nonofficial electronic messaging accounts that were not copied or forwarded into official electronic messaging accounts and that it was in the process of obtaining some of those missing records.
The Washington Post reported last week that some of the documents taken to Trump's home were marked as classified, which could intensify the legal pressure Trump or his aides could face.

The Presidential Records Act requires the preservation of memos, letters, notes, emails, faxes and other written communications related to a president's official duties. 
Claiming executive privilege, Trump sued unsuccessfully to stop the release of records from his White House, including to the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters.

MUNICH/KYIV (Reuters) -Reports that Ukraine has been shelling regions controlled by Moscow-backed separatists and inside the Russian border are ""pure lies"", Ukraine's president said on Saturday, adding that his country would not respond to provocations.
President Voldymyr Zelenskiy was addressing senior Western security officials at the annual Munich Security Conference amid reports of explosions inside Russian territory to Ukraine's east, and in breakaway regions of Ukraine.
""What was shown yesterday in the temporarily occupied territories, some shells allegedly flying from our side, some flying all the way to Rostov, these are pure lies,"" he said. ""They are blowing up something on their side.""
He urged Western countries not to wait for a possible Russian invasion to impose sanctions on Russia.
Russia, which has massed some 150,000 troops along Ukraine's eastern borders, has said that for its own long-term security it needs a commitment that Kyiv will never join the NATO military alliance.
But leaders of Western countries, which believe Russia is preparing a possible invasion of Ukraine, said Russia would face severe consequences if it attacked, warning Moscow against attempts to redraw Europe's borders.
""National borders should not be changed by force,"" U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said.
""We have prepared economic measures that will be swift, severe, and united,"" she said. ""We will target Russia's financial institutions and key industries.""
Both Ukraine and NATO members have refused to rule out Kyiv one day joining the alliance, though few expect that soon.
But, referring to an explosion at a kindergarten in the occupied east, Zelenskiy urged delegates not to let the rhetoric obscure the plight of ordinary people.
""Those kids aren't heading towards NATO. They are heading to their classrooms,"" he said.
'DABBLING IN HISTORY'
Many delegates at the conference called for a de-escalation by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who on Saturday presided over a nuclear preparedness exercise involving firing ballistic missiles.
""History has not yet been written: there is an exit that the Russian government can choose at any time,"" said German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock after a meeting of Western foreign ministers.
""Our common message to them is very clear: Don't make this fatal mistake. Withdraw your troops ... Let's talk.""
She said Western countries had agreed tailor-made sanctions packages that were ready to go in the case of various scenarios, including if Russia created a pretext for an invasion by accusing Ukraine of aggression.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Putin appeared to be guided by a particular understanding of history in his approach to Ukraine, but warned that down that path lay endless conflict.
""Putin has clearly been dabbling lately in Russian history,"" Scholz said, pointing to Putin's published texts lamenting the collapse of the Soviet Union and demise of ""historical Russia"" as well as his talks with the Russian leader this week.
He also dismissed Putin's talk of a genocide in east Ukraine as ""ridiculous"". 
The Russian foreign ministry retorted that Scholz's remark was ""unacceptable"", according to Interfax news agency.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, whose country and Russia are diplomatically aligned, had harsh words for all sides in the dispute, seeing a revived ""Cold War mentality"" in the confrontation.
He said no country, not even a superpower, should replace international norms with its own will.

But British Prime Minister Boris Johnson drew a parallel between Russia's intentions towards Ukraine and China's towards Taiwan, arguing that Western leaders had a duty to be firm. [L8N2UU0AS]
""If Ukraine is invaded, the shock will echo around the world. And those echoes will be heard in east Asia and will be heard in Taiwan,"" he said. ""People would draw the conclusion that aggression pays, and that might is right.""

BEIJING (Reuters) -Nine American figure skaters lost their appeal on Saturday for a ceremony at the Beijing Olympics to receive their silver medals in the team event after Russian teen Kamila Valieva's doping case forced a postponement.
Evan Bates, Karen Chen, Nathan Chen, Madison Chock, Zachary Donohue, Brandon Frazier, Madison Hubbell, Alexa Knierim and Vincent Zhou finished second behind the Russian Olympic Committee team in the competition on Feb. 7..
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) had decided no medals for the competition would be presented until the case of the Russian 15-year-old had been resolved - a matter that could take weeks or months.
""The decision of the IOC Executive Board of 14 February 2022 not to hold the medal ceremony for the figure skating team event during the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 stands,"" the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said in a statement after a panel hearing.
Japan finished third in the event, while Canada were fourth.
CAS director general Matthieu Reeb had said the application had not been filed by the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee, but by the nine members of the team.

Valieva tested positive for a banned heart drug after the Russian national championships on Dec. 25 but the result was not revealed until Feb. 8, the day after the Beijing team event.
Valieva, now back in Russia, was cleared to compete in the women's single event by CAS, sport's highest court, but stumbled to fourth place amid all the drama.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The head of a Russia-dominated military alliance that is sometimes called Moscow's answer to NATO has said his organisation could send peacekeepers to territory in eastern Ukraine controlled by Russia-backed rebels if needed.
The situation in two self-proclaimed pro-Russian republics in Ukraine's Donbass region is on a knife-edge after rebel leaders declared a full mobilisation of their forces and asked civilians to evacuate to Russia following shelling which Ukraine and the separatist rebels blame on each other.
In an interview conducted before that evacuation began, Stanislav Zas, secretary general of the Moscow-based Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), said the body could despatch peacekeepers to Donbass if there was an international consensus for such a deployment. 
""Hypothetically you can imagine it (such a deployment) if there were goodwill from Ukraine - it is after all their territory - if there was a U.N. Security Council mandate, and if it was needed and such a decision was supported by all our governments,"" Zas, a Belarusian lieutenant-general, told Reuters in what aides said was his first Western media interview.
Zas, whose organization last month deployed troops in the former Soviet Union for the first time in its 20-year history to help quell what the Kazakh authorities said was an attempted coup in Kazakhstan, said the only way to resolve the crisis in Ukraine was through negotiations. 
""I don't believe that the situation now will return to how it used to be when tanks were housed at their bases and soldiers in their barracks. It won't happen. There needs to be an understanding about the necessity to sit down at the table and agree something. It's a new reality,"" said Zas.
The CSTO draws on the armed forces of its six members: Russia, Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Russia, with overall active forces of 900,000, is by far the CSTO's most powerful member, and the organisation's unified military headquarters is headed by a Russian. 
Zas said the CSTO had a 17,000-strong force at constant readiness and a specialised peacekeeping force of nearly 4,000 troops. 
A CSTO deployment to Donbass seems unlikely for now, given the organisation's geopolitical allegiance and a view in the West that it is a tool of Russian influence. 
But the situation in eastern Ukraine is changing fast as Moscow attempts to compel Kyiv to hold direct talks with the rebels and grant the two regions they control a measure of autonomy within Ukraine.
RUSSIAN DEMANDS 
Backing its demands with what according to U.S. estimates is up to 190,000 troops surrounding Ukraine on three sides, Russia also wants the idea of NATO membership for Ukraine taken off the table forever. 
Kyiv has long spurned all those demands, viewing them as a ploy to give Russia influence over Ukraine's foreign and domestic policy via the rebels and as an attempt to thwart its turn to the West away from Moscow. 
Zas rejected the idea that the CSTO was a vehicle to promote Russian influence. He predicted East-West tensions would remain dangerously high until a deal was done on the security guarantees Moscow is seeking from the West, which he described as being in the interests of the wider region and the CSTO.
Among other demands, Moscow wants NATO to halt its eastward expansion and promise not to deploy offensive weapons in Ukraine and other nations close to Russia. 
Zas said the CSTO and its members would always carefully weigh any decision to use force. 
""We have colossal potential in our hands. We all understand that we need to be very careful with this scalpel,"" he said.
If needed, the CSTO could swiftly deploy huge numbers of troops, he said.

""Believe me, we can send as many as needed,"" Zas said. ""If we need 3,000, we'll send them. If we need 17,000 we'll send them. If we need more there'll be more. As many as are needed.""

With the United States warning of an imminent invasion, Scholz told the Munich Security Conference any attack would be a ""serious mistake"" with high ""political, economic and geostrategic costs"".
Russia denies planning an invasion. But there is ""no justification"" for the build-up of more than 100,000 Russian troops on Ukraine's borders, Scholz said, dismissing President Vladimir Putin's claims of genocide in east Ukraine's breakaway regions as ""ridiculous"".
Still, Russia had signalled both in his chat with Putin in Moscow earlier this week and in its response to Washington's security proposals that it still wanted to negotiate, Scholz said. Meanwhile the West was ready to negotiate over Russia's security demands ""without being naive"".
""We will differentiate clearly between untenable demands and legitimate security interests,"" he said.
Putin has clearly been dabbling lately in Russian history, Scholz said, pointing to his published texts lamenting the collapse of the Soviet Union and demise of ""historical Russia"" as well as their talks this week.
But the past can not be used to justify a redrawing of European borders which would undermine peace on the continent, the German leader said.

""If you go back far enough in the history books you can find grounds for wars that last a few hundred years and destroy our entire continent,"" Scholz said. ""Peace can only be preserved in Europe if borders are no longer shifted around.""
Scholz told the conference a multipolar world was clearly emerging as new powers arose. But that should not mean countries claiming spheres of influence for themselves, he said.

BRUNSWICK, Ga. (Reuters) - The prosecution and defense rested their cases on Friday in the hate crimes trial for three white Georgia men who have already been convicted of murdering Ahmaud Arbery as the young Black man jogged through their neighborhood.
Closing statements will be made on Monday and the case will then go to the jury, made up of nine white and three black jurors. Prosecutors in the trial, which began on Monday, set out to prove Travis McMichael, 36; his father Gregory McMichael, 66; and William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52, where motivated by racism in carrying out their crime. 
Arbery's killing in February 2020 was one of several of Black men and women, often at the hands of police, that helped spark racial justice protests in recent years. The federal prosecution of Arbery's killers is the first in which those who carried out such a high-profile murder are facing a jury in a hate-crime trial.
The McMichaels and Bryan were convicted by a state court last year and sentenced to life in prison. Prosecutors during the state trial did not raise racial animus, seeking only to prove the men were responsible for Arbery's death.
Over the past week, federal prosecutors called 20 witnesses and presented evidence that they said showed the three men have a long history of using slurs and making racist statements.
A prosecution witness testified on Friday that Travis McMichael, then her supervisor in the U.S. Coast Guard, subjected her to racist insults in 2011 after he learned that she had dated a Black man. 
Kristie Ronquille, who is white, testified that while with a group of people and Travis McMichael in a Coast Guard station mess deck, she recognized an NBA basketball player in a televised game, and told the group that she had dated the player, who is Black. 
Ronquille, who broke down while testifying, said McMichael seized on that and called her a ""nigger lover"" several times. 
Defense attorneys for the three men said their clients were not motivated by racism. Instead, the defense argued, they were concerned about security after a series of break-ins in their Satilla Shores neighborhood. The defense called just one witness.
Arbery was captured on security camera videos entering and looking at ongoing construction at a house - which was legal for him to do so under Georgia law, according to law enforcement witnesses who testified this week. The men said they thought Arbery was a thief. No evidence in the state or federal trials indicated that was the case.
Travis McMichael told police he shot Arbery in self-defense. Local authorities made no arrests for 10 weeks, only doing so after a cellphone video of the killing made by Bryan emerged on social media.

Travis McMichael said at a hearing last month that he was willing to plead guilty to attacking Arbery because of his ""race and color"" in a plea agreement that was opposed by Arbery's family.
Judge Lisa Wood rejected the agreement because it bound her to sentencing Travis McMichael to 30 years in federal prison before he was handed back to the state of Georgia to serve out the rest of his life sentence for murder.

Bachelet has long sought access to the western Chinese region to investigate accusations of abuse against ethnic Uyghurs. The issue has strained ties between Beijing and the West, sparking accusations of genocide from Washington and a U.S.-led diplomatic boycott by some countries of the Winter Olympics in Beijing.
""(China) rejects all kinds of biases, prejudices and uncalled-for accusations,"" Wang, who is also a Chinese state councillor, said by video at the Munich Security Conference when asked if Bachelet would have unrestricted access in Xinjiang.
Rights groups accuse China of widescale abuses against Uyghurs and other minority groups, including torture, forced labour and detention of one million people in internment camps. China says the camps are re-education and training facilities and denies any abuse, saying it is fighting religious extremism.

The so-called systematic forced labour or education camps are all lies and fabrication, said Wang.

YANQING, China (Reuters) -Organisers scrambled to reorganise the Alpine mixed team parallel race for the final day of the Beijing Olympics after high winds on Saturday forced the competition to be postponed.
Team officials and organisers agreed to hold the event, which is only its second edition, on Sunday at 9 a.m. (0100 GMT) despite several teams being originally scheduled to fly home.
The decision meant some teams had to rearrange their flights and accommodation bookings, but all the 15 nations entered in the competition confirmed they would participate on Sunday.
Olympics and International Ski Federation (FIS) officials said they were keen to complete the event and expected the weather to be ""a little better"", especially in the earlier part of the day.
A spokeswoman for the U.S ski team said that most of their squad and support staff had been due to leave early on Sunday but that changes were being made to allow them to stay.
Juan Antonio Samaranch, the head of the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) coordination commission for Beijing, told an IOC session that these issues were to be expected at a Winter Games.
""We had weather issues but this is Winter Games. We are coping with the difficulties still left but this is winter and we are here to celebrate exactly that: winter,"" he said.
WEATHER FORECAST
The closing ceremony for the Beijing Games is on Sunday at 8 p.m. The weather forecast for Sunday is for slightly better wind conditions earlier in the day.
On Saturday at 9 a.m., gusts were recorded as between 24 and 28 metres per second. On Sunday gusts are forecast between 19-22 m/s at that time.
The weather also disrupted competition at the National Cross-Country Centre in Zhangjiakou.
The men's 50km cross-country mass start, one of the sport's blue riband events, was postponed by an hour and shortened to 30km due to the high winds.
Not everybody in the field was happy with the decision. 
""Of course athletes' health comes first but we knew it was gonna be cold... Look to other sports who moved their events a day earlier. This is not the way to go if we want to develop our sport!"" Irish skier Thomas Maloney Westgaard tweeted.
The women's 30km cross-country mass start was later brought forward from 2:30 p.m. (0630 GMT) on Sunday to the earlier time of 11 a.m. (0300 GMT) because of expected high winds. 
The men's freeski halfpipe final went ahead on Saturday but gusts of wind kicked up snow and skiers lost momentum on the pipe, with several crashing, as temperatures dropped to minus 22 Celsius (minus 7.6 Fahrenheit). 

""It was gnarly today. And there wasn't even a discussion about postponing or waiting a little bit or anything,"" British skier Gus Kenworthy said.
The women's 12.5km biathlon event, originally scheduled for Saturday, was moved forward to Friday due to weather concerns.

MOSCOW/KYIV/DONETSK (Reuters) - Russia's Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine within days, U.S. President Joe Biden said on Friday after separatists backed by Moscow told civilians to leave breakaway regions on buses, a move the West fears is part of a pretext for an attack. 
In one of the worst post-Cold War crises, Russia wants to stop Kyiv joining NATO and accuses the West of hysteria, saying it has no plans to invade, while the United States and allies are adamant the military build-up continues. 
Warning sirens blared in Donetsk and Luhansk on Friday after rebel leaders there announced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people to Russia. 
""We have reason to believe the Russian forces are planning to and intend to attack Ukraine in the coming week, in the coming days,"" Biden told reporters at the White House, adding that Kyiv would be a target. 
""As of this moment, I am convinced that he has made the decision."" 
Late on Friday, Ukraine's military intelligence said Russian special forces had planted explosives at social infrastructure facilities in Donetsk, and it urged residents to stay at home. The Russian Federal Security Service did not immediately reply to a request for comment. 
Citing correspondents on the ground, Russian news agencies later reported that two explosions hit Luhansk, one of the main cities in Ukraine's breakaway People's Republic of Luhansk, and a section of a gas pipeline in the area caught fire. 
Earlier, separatist leaders in Donetsk and Luhansk issued video statements in which they announced the evacuations and accused Ukraine of preparing to attack both regions soon - an accusation Kyiv said was false. 
But at least one of the videos appeared to have been created on Wednesday before the latest flare-up in shelling began, according to metadata, embedded in the footage. That raised suspicions among Western analysts although it can be overwritten.
Asked about the evacuations, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said they were a ""good example"" of what Washington fears. 
""We have ... long predicted for all of you that the Russians would take part in pretexts or steps that would lay a predicate for either war or to create confusion or spread misinformation on the ground,"" she told reporters. 
Hours after the evacuation announcement, a jeep exploded outside a rebel government building in the city of Donetsk.
Reuters journalists saw the vehicle surrounded by shrapnel, a wheel thrown away by the blast. Russian media said it belonged to a separatist official.
Many families in the mostly Russian-speaking area have already been granted citizenship by Moscow and within hours, some were boarding buses at an evacuation point in Donetsk, where authorities said 700,000 people would leave.
Irina Lysanova, 22, said she was packing to travel with her pensioner mother: ""Mama is a panicker,"" she said. Her father, Konstantin, 62, was not going. ""This is my motherland,"" he said. 
The evacuation started after the conflict zone saw what sources described as the most intense artillery bombardment for years on Friday.
Ukraine was the most painful loss for Russia of the 14 former republics under its control prior to the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union.
Russian-backed rebels seized a swathe of eastern Ukraine in 2014, the same year that Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimea region. Kyiv says that more than 14,000 people have since died in the conflict in the east. 
As the Kremlin shows off its military capacity on several fronts, Putin was to supervise exercises of its strategic nuclear missile forces on Saturday.
'SHOOTING EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING'
Russia has released footage to show it is withdrawing troops from the border but the United States instead believes there has been a ramp-up to between 169,000-190,000 troops, from 100,000 at the end of January.
New helicopters and a battle group deployment of tanks, armored personnel carriers and support equipment have deployed in Russia, near the border, according to U.S.-based Maxar Technologies (NYSE:MAXR), which tracks developments with satellite imagery. 
The Kremlin has tens of thousands of troops staging exercises in Belarus, north of Ukraine, that are due to end on Sunday. Belarus' leader Alexander Lukashenko met Putin on Friday, saying beforehand the soldiers could stay as long as needed. 
Western countries fear a conflict on a scale unseen in Europe at least since the Yugoslav and Chechen wars of the 1990s, when hundreds of thousands died and millions fled. 
The evacuation piled further pressure on Russia's rouble currency and other assets.
A diplomatic source with years of experience of the conflict described Friday's shelling as the most intense since major combat there ended with a 2015 ceasefire. ""They are shooting - everyone and everything.""
German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said she did not think a fully-fledged invasion was the most likely scenario but that Russia could carry out a coup in Ukraine, attack critical infrastructure or instigate violence it would blame on Kyiv. 
Kyiv also said a full-scale invasion was unlikely.
Since toppling a pro-Russian president, Ukraine has staged joint military exercises with NATO and taken delivery of weapons including U.S. Javelin missiles and Turkish drones. 
Putin says Ukraine's growing ties with the alliance could make it a launchpad for missiles targeting Russia. 
As the crisis deepens, the West is also weighing its non-military options. 
Banning Russia from the SWIFT financial system is unlikely to be included in an initial sanctions package in the event of an invasion, a White House official said on Friday, confirming a Reuters report. 

How allies should respond to aggressions beyond an all-out invasion is far from agreed, U.S. and European officials said amid differences within the EU. 
""Those closest to Russia, such as Hungary, will be against any sanctions short of a military invasion,"" according to one senior diplomat.

A P-8A Poseidon - a maritime patrol aircraft - detected a laser emanating from a People's Liberation Army – Navy (PLA-N) vessel, the Defence Department said in a statement. 
""Illumination of the aircraft by the Chinese vessel is a serious safety incident,"" the department said. ""Acts like this have the potential to endanger lives. We strongly condemn unprofessional and unsafe military conduct."" 
The Chinese vessel was sailing east with another PLA-N ship through the Arafura Sea at the time of the incident, the department said. The sea lies between the north coast of Australia and the south coast of New Guinea. 
The defence department said that both ships have since transited through the Torres Strait and were in the Coral Sea. 
Relations between Australia and China, its top trade partner, soured after Canberra banned Huawei Technologies from its 5G broadband network in 2018, toughened laws against foreign political interference, and urged an independent investigation into the origins of COVID-19. 
In 2019, Chinese maritime militia vessels initiated a series of laser attacks on Australian pilots while flying over the South China Sea, according to a report by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).

Taboubi, who has been UGTT leader for five years, has taken a cautious stance during the turbulent months since President Kais Saied seized executive powers in a move his foes call a coup.
The union's blessing is seen as vital for any effort by Tunisia's authorities to implement economic reforms demanded by foreign donors in return for a financial rescue package to avert a looming crisis that threatens to bankrupt Tunisia.
Its stance will also be crucial for Saied's plans to remake Tunisian politics after he suspended the elected parliament, brushed aside the democratic constitution to say he could rule by decree and brought the judiciary under his own control. 
With more than a million members and the ability to shut down Tunisia's economy with strikes, the UGTT is widely seen as the most powerful political player in the country and a rare organisation that might withstand presidential authority. 
Saied has so far largely ignored the UGTT's repeated requests to take part in a broad-based political and economic dialogue over the crisis and his plans to rewrite the constitution and after meeting Taboubi in July, he did not see him again until January.
Taboubi's re-election took place at the union's congress, a meeting held every five years and the final statement emphasised its demand for an inclusive process for major changes that Saied is pushing in the political and justice systems.

The president has in effect suspended the constitution to say he can rule by decree and has seized control of judicial appointments, moves his critics say undermine rule of law. 
UGTT's request recalls the role it played after the 2011 revolution that brought democracy and triggered the Arab spring, when it won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2015 after joining other civil society groups to avert dangerous street polarisation.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China would back Russia diplomatically and perhaps economically if it invades Ukraine, worsening Beijing's already strained relations with the West, but would stop short of providing military support, experts said.
U.S. President Joe Biden said on Friday that Russia's Vladimir Putin had decided to invade Ukraine within days, a claim Russia denies.
China's foreign ministry has repeatedly blamed the United States for ""spreading false information"" and creating tensions, urging it to respect and address Russia's demands for security guarantees.
In a show of solidarity, Putin visited Beijing for the Feb. 4 opening ceremony of the Olympics, declaring with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping a deepening ""no limits"" strategic partnership. Chinese state media said the two countries stood ""shoulder to shoulder in upholding justice in the world"".
A Russian invasion into Ukraine would test China's resolve to put those supportive words into action, especially given China's oft-stated foreign policy principle of non-interference.
China almost certainly would not want to be involved militarily, experts familiar with Beijing's thinking say. 
Although China and Russia have moved beyond ""marriage of convenience"" to a quasi-alliance, relations between the giant neighbours are far from a formal alliance requiring one to send troops should the other face threats, said Shi Yinhong, an international relations professor at Renmin University.
China has consistently called for the Ukraine crisis to be resolved peacefully through dialogue.
""Just as China does not expect Russia to help it militarily in the case of war over Taiwan, Russia does not expect China to help militarily over Ukraine, nor does it need such help,"" said Li Mingjiang, associate professor at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.
VOTING NO
Instead, China would show it is a reliable friend by not joining the international chorus of condemnation if Russia invades Ukraine.
China was the only country to vote with Russia last month in a failed bid to stop the 15-member U.N. Security Council from meeting, at the request of the United States, on Russia’s troop build-up on Ukraine’s borders.
That went further than in 2014, when China abstained from voting on a U.S.-drafted Security Council resolution urging countries not to recognise Russia's annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region.
Experts also said China could expand economic cooperation with Russia that would blunt the impact of sanctions promised by the West if there is an invasion.
After Russia's invasion of Crimea, several Chinese state banks, including China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China provided loans for Russian state-owned banks that were sanctioned by the West. 
NOT A WAR IT WANTS
China would prefer that Russia not invade Ukraine.
""With the international world so polarised, it's possible the United States and the West would be unified in isolating or sanctioning China together with Russia,"" said Shi.
Earlier this month, U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said Chinese companies would face consequences if they sought to evade any export controls imposed on Moscow in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
A person familiar with U.S. thinking told reporters the technology-related sanctions and export controls that Washington is planning with allies is beyond China’s ability to backfill.
""We are prepared to take actions against any foreign country or entity that would circumvent those,"" said the person.

Beijing also does not want the headache of the economic fallout of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, especially in a year when Xi is poised to secure an unprecedented third term in office, prioritising stability.
An invasion would also show that China's repeated calls for all sides including Russia to resolve the Ukraine crisis peacefully have fallen upon Putin's deaf ears, raising doubts about its effectiveness as an interlocutor, said Shi.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday lost a bid to dismiss lawsuits accusing him of inciting the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.
In a lengthy written ruling https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/akpezndgovr/Mehta%20order%20Jan%206%202022.pdf, Judge Amit Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said three lawsuits by Democratic members of Congress and two police officers could proceed toward trial.
Mehta agreed to dismiss Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani and Trump's eldest son Donald Trump Jr., who were named as co-defendants, from the lawsuits.
Looming large in the litigation is a Supreme Court case from 1982 holding that presidents are shielded, or immune, from lawsuits over their official acts.
Mehta ruled Trump was not immune from the lawsuits, determining that the then-president's fiery speech before the Capitol attack was not within the scope of his official presidential duties.
""To deny a President immunity from civil damages is no small step. The court well understands the gravity of its decision,"" Mehta ruled. ""But the alleged facts of this case are without precedent, and the court believes that its decision is consistent with the purposes behind such immunity.""
Jesse Binnall, a lawyer for Trump, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Trump and his co-defendants have argued that their remarks preceding the Jan. 6 attack were free speech protected by the U.S. Constitution.
The Democratic lawmakers, including U.S. representatives Eric Swalwell and Jerry Nadler, have invoked an 1871 law passed to fight the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan that prohibits political intimidation.
The lawsuits alleged a conspiracy between Trump and rioters to halt Congress's certification of President Joe Biden's election victory.
Without ruling on the merits of that theory, Mehta said the allegation was sufficiently detailed to proceed toward discovery, a process in which litigants exchange evidence and take testimony.

""From these alleged facts, it is at least plausible to infer that, when he called on rally-goers to march to the Capitol, the President did so with the goal of disrupting lawmakers’ efforts to certify the Electoral College votes,"" Mehta wrote. 
Joseph Sellers, an attorney representing the Democratic lawmakers, said the ruling breaks new legal ground and ""demonstrates the extraordinary nature of the conduct of which then-President Trump was engaged.""

MUNICH (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to meet Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskiy in Munich on Saturday, in what is likely to be a powerful display of diplomatic support for the European nation, a day after President Joe Biden said he is ""convinced"" Russia had made a decision to invade Ukraine.
Harris will also deliver a highly anticipated address warning Russia that an invasion would likely lead to an even bigger NATO footprint on its doorstep and that it will face huge financial costs if it invades Ukraine, according to a senior U.S. administration official who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity.
Her message will, however, make clear the United States remains open to diplomacy ""even at this late hour,"" the official said, even as Biden and other administration officials have given dire warnings that the window for diplomacy is narrow.
On Friday, Harris met NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and leaders from three Baltic nations and said Russia must show it is open to diplomacy, while heralding unity in the 30-member NATO alliance and warning Moscow of severe consequences if it invades Ukraine.
President Biden, who spoke later in the day, said Putin has decided to invade Ukraine, and that he continues to spread false information to try to build a pretext for a military strike that could happen in days.
Russia, which has said it has no plans to invade, wants to stop Kyiv from joining NATO and accuses the West of hysteria. On Friday, separatists backed by Moscow told civilians to leave breakaway regions on buses, a move the West fears is part of a pretext for an attack. 
The Russian defense ministry said on Friday that Putin would oversee exercises by Russia's nuclear forces involving the launch of ballistic and cruise missiles. The senior U.S. administration official called the decision ""escalatory and unfortunate.""
Asked if the United States is concerned about whether Zelenskiy should travel to Munich for meetings tomorrow, the senior administration official said, ""No. That's really his call. It's really up to him to decide where he needs to be.""

Biden, when asked the same question, said ""that's a judgment for him to make.""
Zelenskiy has long said that, while he believes Russia is threatening to attack his country, the likelihood of an imminent invasion has been overstated by Western allies, responding to Moscow's efforts to intimidate Ukraine and sow panic.

CORFU, Greece, (Reuters) -Nine passengers were missing after a blaze engulfed a ferry sailing from Greece to Italy early on Friday and firefighters battled to rescue people trapped on the ship, authorities said. 
A total of 240 passengers and 51 crew were on board the Italian-flagged Euroferry Olympia when the fire broke out, and rescue vessels took most to the island of Corfu where ambulances were waiting.
""It was so unreal, it was a bit like the Titanic but it was real,"" David Waller, a 58-year old truck driver who was rescued and was staying at a hotel on Corfu, told Reuters. 
The Greek fire brigade said two men trapped in the ship's garage had been rescued, lifted by helicopter, one of whom was not on the official list of missing people. Firefighters were trying to reach at least another three trapped.
Grimaldi Lines, the owner of the vessel, said earlier that tugboats were sailing to the area to help recover the ship. 
Aerial footage released by the coastguard showed rows of burnt trucks on the blackened deck after flames swept through the 183-metre (600-foot) ferry that had been making a nine-hour journey through the night.
""The worst thing is the cars in the garage are glued next to each other, there is no escape route,"" one Greek truck driver, who did not give his name, said after arriving on Corfu.
The cause of the blaze was still being investigated, Greek authorities said. 
At least 10 people had been taken to a Corfu hospital, most with breathing problems, a Greek health ministry official told state television.
Earlier on Friday, passengers huddled in yellow blankets on an Italian rescue vessel as huge plumes of smoke poured out of the ferry, one video showed. The words ""May Day"" were repeatedly blasting from the speakers, in the footage uploaded on Greek news website Proto Thema.
The ferry sailed from Igoumenitsa, the largest port in western Greece, and was headed to the Italian port of Brindisi. It carried 153 vehicles, many of them trucks, Grimaldi Lines said.
The fire broke out when the ship was near Corfu in the Ionian Sea. Hours after the alarm was raised, the vessel was still ablaze, drifting in Albanian waters, Grimaldi Lines said, adding that there were no fuel spills or environmental damage.
""At around 3.30-4.00 a.m. I smelled smoke,"" Rumen Metodiev, a Bulgarian truck driver, told Bulgaria's BNT channel. ""The trucks and the documents, everything burned. There was no chance to put out the fire,"" he said. 
Bulgaria's foreign ministry said 127 of its citizens were on board.
Grimaldi Lines spokesman Paul Kyprianou told Reuters that there were indications the fire started in one of its holds. The company was making every effort to help the passengers - most of them from Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey - get home, he added. 
""The flames were incredibly high, we were a few miles away from the ferry when it happened,"" Colonello Felice Lodovico Simone Cicchetti from Italy's financial police, who took part in the rescue operation, said. 

""The fire was so big and fast that in a matter of five minutes it became unmanageable for the people aboard."" 
In 2014, 10 people were killed when the car ferry Norman Atlantic carrying 466 passengers and crew caught fire while sailing from Greece to Italy.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Hong Kong until recently had an enviable record battling COVID-19, but as an Omicron wave now overwhelms the city, the steps that saved lives are making life unbearable for many of its 7.4 million people.
Like an immune system overreacting and harming the person it is meant to protect, the ""dynamic zero-COVID"" policies that had crushed the virus in Hong Kong have contributed to current woes, experts say. Patients lie in beds in cold, wet parking lots outside overflowing hospitals, isolation facilities are filling up and thousands queue for hours outside testing venues.
A 60-fold spike in daily infections this month prompted the government recently to modify its COVID-eradication policies, but the authorities continue aiming to wipe out the virus. The impact of zero tolerance will remain for some time, epidemiologists say.
Hong Kong's strict pandemic policies have limited coronavirus infections to around 40,000 with 259 deaths, far fewer than in other major cities. Asian rival Singapore, with 5.7 million people, has reported more than half a million cases and some 900 deaths.
Under zero-COVID, Hong Kong authorities essentially closed the border and hospitalised even asymptomatic coronavirus-positive people and isolated close contacts with infected people. A person showing little or no symptoms could spend weeks in hospital, then move to an isolation facility for several more weeks before being allowed to return to normal life.
In return, most people in the global financial hub could go about their work and social lives with few restrictions.
The government leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, has said Hong Kong ""cannot surrender to the virus"" and that containing the outbreak ""is now of paramount importance"", as she seeks the people's understanding for inconveniences caused by the policies.
""Elimination was initially the best strategy for Hong Kong,"" but is no longer appropriate, said Dr David Owens, a founding partner of OT&P clinic.
""Once effective vaccinations became available, the negative framing and policy around zero-covid adversely impacted vaccination rates, especially in the vulnerable,"" he said. ""The messaging was not only unscientific, it paradoxically increased the risk to population health.""
The government did not respond to a request for comment on whether its zero-covid policy had contributed to the current problem.
As the highly transmissible COVID variant tests the healthcare system and public patience, the authorities have made a subtle transition from elimination to mitigation, adjusting policies frequently, based on the severity of symptoms and availability of beds and isolation rooms.
Asymptomatic carriers may now go to quarantine facilities or even home and close contacts may isolate at home.
'INSANE AND CRUEL'
But the healthcare system is stretched to breaking as infections soar.
Plans for mass-testing from next month will likely be ineffective, some epidemiologists say, without a full mainland-style city lockdown - something Lam has ruled out.
""Zero-COVID can’t last forever,"" said Peter Collignon, professor of microbiology at the Australian National University. Sticking to the goal ""can lead to poor resource allocation and priorities.""
Tracing, testing, treatment and quarantine resources still target every infection instead of prioritising high-risk groups, such as the elderly, causing widespread frustration. 
Zero-COVID messaging, some epidemiologists fear, may encourage complacency and false hopes among the largely unvaccinated elderly that the city may again become virus-free and stay that way. More than 60% of residents over age 80 have not been vaccinated, although some 85% of the entire population has had at least one shot.
Bars, gyms and beauty salons are shut, many unable to stay afloat. Around 900,000 students are out of school, while most people have resumed working from home, reminiscent of early 2020. 
The economy is likely to contract this year after last year's rebound from the city's longest recession, some analysts say. And the isolation and economic uncertainty threaten a mental health epidemic, psychologists say. 
""It's insane and cruel,"" said a 41-year-old resident whose family went through five weeks of hospital and government quarantine, including separation from their two toddlers.
""Nowhere else in the world is doing this.""
Hong Kong has asked Beijing for help. More than a hundred million rapid tests are on the way from the mainland, and the authorities plan to boost testing, build more isolation facilities and ensure food supplies after vegetable shortages this month.
But some health experts forecast daily infections rocketing to as much as 30,000 by the end of March from 3,629 on Friday, far outpacing efforts to increase capacity.
Epidemiologists at the University of Hong Kong have warned that only a costly, months-long, full lockdown would eliminate infections. And while that would return the city to where it was in December, Omicron could strike again, causing renewed chaos, they say.

Residents, who at the start of the pandemic went beyond government recommendations to keep their friends and family safe, have started to lose faith.
“The government wants to achieve dynamic zero-COVID, which has basically made citizens more troubled and confused, because I believe that no virus can be eradicated completely,” said 39-year-old Hang Tang.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden said on Friday that Russia President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine, and that he continues to spread false information to try to build a pretext for a military strike that could happen in days. 
""As of this moment I am convinced that he has made the decision (to invade),"" Biden told reporters in Washington. ""We have reason to believe that,"" he added, citing U.S. intelligence assessments. 
His comments came after a phone call with the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, Britain, the European Union and NATO, the White House said. 
The leaders pledged to continue pursuing diplomacy while preparing to impose swift, coordinated economic costs on Russia should it choose further conflict, according to a White House readout of the call. 
They also discussed efforts to ensure the defense and security of NATO’s eastern flank, the White House said. 
Biden's administration has said a diplomatic solution remains possible if Russia chooses, but that Washington and its European allies are prepared to enact harsh punishments if Moscow opts to invade. 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov planned to meet Feb. 24 in Europe, Biden said, but he warned any Russian military action before that would show Russia has ""slammed the door shut on diplomacy."" 
Meanwhile, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris met NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, expressing concern amid the build-up and vowing to stay in close contact with NATO and U.S. allies.
""We feel very strongly about and will always be committed to the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty,"" Harris told reporters. ""We remain of course supportive of diplomacy as it relates to the dialogue and discussions we've had with Russia, but we are also committed to taking corrective actions.""

Blinken also addressed the conference on Friday, saying Washington remained ""deeply concerned"" that Russia was planning to attack Ukraine within days. 
U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also urged de-escalation in a call with his Russian counterpart on Friday, the Pentagon said.

LONDON (Reuters) -An Atlantic storm battered northwestern European on Friday with record winds of up to 122 miles per hour, killing at least nine people, knocking out power for tens of thousands and shredding the roof of London's O2 arena. 
Storm Eunice, which brewed in the central Atlantic and was spun up from the Azores towards Europe by the jet stream, posed a danger to life, Britain's Meteorological Office said.
The storm hit western England, making landfall in Cornwall, where waves lashed the coast, sending plumes of spray over the roofs of cottages, Reuters pictures showed
A woman was killed in London when a car in which she was travelling was crushed by a tree and a man in a vehicle in Liverpool died due to flying debris. Another man died after a vehicle collided with a fallen tree in the southern English county of Hampshire.
In the Netherlands, four people were killed by toppled trees. In Belgium, high winds brought a crane down onto the roof of a hospital and a British man died after being blown from his boat into the water.
A man died in Ireland after being struck by a falling tree while clearing storm debris, RTE reported. 
High winds in London shredded the white domed roof of the O2 arena which has hosted stars from The Rolling Stones to Beyonce and Rihanna. Tall buildings in London trembled as wind whistled through Canary Wharf. 
In Wales, waves crashed over Aberystwyth promenade, some as high as houses. More than 100,000 people were hit by power cuts as lines were torn down and ancient trees keeled over.
""Storm Eunice is really packing a punch,"" Met Office Chief Meteorologist Frank Saunders said. ""We only issue red weather warnings when we think there is a threat to life from the weather.""
The Met Office said a gust of 122 mph (196 kph) was recorded at The Needles on the Isle of Wight, provisionally a record for the most powerful gust ever recorded in England.
Later on Friday, the Met Office said the fiercest winds from the storm were heading towards Scandinavia and northern mainland Europe where warnings had been issued.
Planes were buffeted so strongly by gusts at some British airports that pilots were forced to abandon landings. A live stream of Heathrow Airport's runway was being watched by more than 200,000 people online. 
A total of 436 flights were cancelled across the United Kingdom amid record winds from storm Eunice, according to Cirium data.
TROOPS ON STANDBY
More than 100,000 buildings were left without power, distributors said. Ferries and trains were cancelled. 
""Storm Eunice - There will be NO Transport for Wales trains running on this date,"" an announcement board said at Aberystwyth station. All trains in Kent, southern England, were cancelled.
""We are closing all routes in Kent, and all lines in SE London are blocked by trees,"" Network Rail Kent & Sussex said. ""Please do not travel.""
BA said it was cancelling a number of flights and that there would be significant disruption. 
Danish ferry operator DFDS said in a statement posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that its ferries between Dover (NYSE:DOV) and Calais have been suspended due to high winds.
In the Netherlands, Schiphol airport cancelled about 390 flights, a spokesperson said.
Off the Belgian coast, two ships, one tanker and one cargo, were at one point adrift and got stuck in a windfarm. The cargo was safely towed away, without causing any damage, the tanker, carrying 31,000 tons of fuel, was still waiting for help.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear President Joe Biden's bid to rescind a hardline immigration policy begun under his predecessor Donald Trump that forced tens of thousands of migrants to stay in Mexico to await U.S. hearings on their asylum claims.
The justices will hear a Biden administration appeal of a lower court ruling that reinstated the so-called ""remain in Mexico"" policy after the Republican-led states of Texas and Missouri had sued to maintain the program. Biden suspended the policy, which changed longstanding U.S. practice, shortly after taking office last year. 
The Supreme Court fast-tracked the case so it can be argued during its current term in April, with a ruling expected by the end of June. 
Trump's administration said what it called a security and humanitarian crisis along the U.S.-Mexican border justified refusing to allow migrants seeking asylum, because of a fear of persecution in their home countries, to enter the United States ahead of hearings before immigration judges. The policy is formally called the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP).
Prior administrations had used the federal immigration provision at issue in the case, which took effect in 1997, on a limited basis, court papers said. 
The Biden administration said the provision is clearly discretionary and that the lower court's decision means that every presidential administration ""has been in continuous and systematic violation"" of the law since it was created. 
Roughly 68,000 people fell under the policy from the time it took effect in 2019 until Biden suspended it in 2021.
Biden's fellow Democrats and immigration advocates criticized the Trump policy, saying migrants stuck in Mexican border cities have faced kidnappings and other dangers.
Texas and Missouri challenged the Biden administration's move to scrap the policy, including a memo terminating the program issued last June. 
After a federal judge reinstated the program, the Supreme Court last August refused a Biden administration request to block that ruling while the government pursued an appeal. 
The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in December upheld the judge's decision, ruling that Biden's action violated both federal immigration and administrative law. The 5th Circuit said that because the government does not have the capacity to detain all migrants who are not eligible for admission pending a hearing, it must maintain ""remain in Mexico."" 
In its appeal to the Supreme Court, Biden's administration said it is being ""forced to reinstate and continue implementing indefinitely a controversial policy"" that exposes migrants to safety risks, harms relations with Mexico and is not the best tool for deterring illegal immigration. 
The administration also said that the lower courts are unacceptably interfering with the historically broad authority that U.S. presidents have held over immigration and foreign affairs - a principle that the Supreme Court has long endorsed including in cases when Trump was president. 

The number of migrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border has soared to record highs recently, with Trump's fellow Republicans criticizing Biden's immigration policies. 
Biden's administration has left in place a separate Trump-era order that lets U.S. border authorities, because of the COVID-19 public health crisis, rapidly expel migrants caught at the border without giving them a chance to seek asylum in the United States.

(Reuters) -A Minnesota judge on Friday sentenced former police officer Kimberly Potter to two years in the fatal shooting of Black motorist Daunte Wright during a traffic stop, a lighter sentence than the roughly seven years in prison sought by prosecutors.
Potter, 49 -- who mistook her handgun for her Taser in firing on Wright, 20, as he resisted officers who pulled him over in a Minneapolis suburb last April -- was found guilty by a jury in December of first-degree and second-degree manslaughter.
""This is a cop who made a tragic mistake,"" said Judge Regina Chu, who became emotional as she handed down the 24-month sentence, two-thirds of which is to be served in prison and the remaining third on supervised release.
Chu said Potter was required to make a split-second decision during a ""chaotic and tense"" encounter with Wright and that the evidence presented at trial justified the veteran policewoman's intended use of a Taser to protect another officer at the scene.
But she said a sentence of probation, which Potter's lawyers had argued for, was not enough to account for the loss of life.
""In this case, a young man was killed because Officer Potter was reckless,"" Chu said, calling the case one of the saddest in her career. ""Rightfully, there should be some accountability."" 
The shooting in Brooklyn Center triggered multiple nights of protests there. It occurred just a few miles north of where Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, was standing trial for killing George Floyd, a Black man whose 2020 death during an arrest helped set off demonstrations around the nation and the world over racism and killings by police.
In rendering her decision, the judge made a point of distinguishing Potter's actions from those of Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes and was convicted of murder. Both former officers are white.
Daunte Wright's mother Katie Wright expressed anger that Chu was emotional in delivering the sentence but not during Wright's victim-impact statement in court on Friday. She blasted the two-year punishment as too lenient and questioned the sincerity of Potter's tearful testimony at trial. 
""Kim Potter murdered my son, and he died April 11. Today the justice system murdered him all over again,"" Wright said outside the courthouse. ""White woman tears trumped justice.""
Prosecutors had sought a sentence of seven years and two months, in line with state guidelines for first-degree manslaughter. Under state law, defendants facing multiple charges for the same act are sentenced only for the most serious count.
But Judge Chu appeared to side with the arguments for leniency put forward by Potter's lawyers, who cited her lack of a prior criminal record and her complaint-free 26 years on the police force. One of her attorneys, Paul Engh, said on Friday that Wright had been an ""aggressor"" in resisting arrest.
Chu also said she believed that Potter, who broke down in giving brief remarks on Friday, had shown deep remorse. 
""I am so sorry that I hurt you so badly,"" Potter said in court on Friday in comments directed at Wright's family. ""My heart is broken and devastated for all of you.""
Potter has not appealed her conviction, and has not indicated she plans to appeal.

Potter and a second officer pulled Wright over because there was an air freshener illegally hanging from his mirror and his vehicle registration tab had expired. They then learned of a warrant for his arrest on a misdemeanor weapons charge and tried to detain him. Wright resisted, breaking free from the second officer. 
Potter then shouted, ""Taser, Taser, Taser!"" and fired at Wright with her handgun, video from her body-worn camera showed. Potter testified that she feared for the life of a third officer who had entered the car through the passenger side.

WASHINGTON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The United States and its allies have mapped out detailed plans for coordinated, severe sanctions if Russian troops physically invade Ukraine, but how they should respond to other kinds of aggressions is far from agreed, U.S. and European officials say.
That ambiguity could slow the pushback Russian President Vladimir Putin will face if Russia repeats past tactics like identifiable cyberattacks, a disinformation campaign, or stepped-up support for pro-Russian separatists.
Senior European diplomats, requesting anonymity, told Reuters there had been some planning for ""a range of scenarios"" and various contingencies, including the kind of cyberattack seen in Ukraine this week that has yet to be conclusively linked to Russia, but any coordinated response would require additional consultations.
While there is general agreement that sanctions would be ready within 48 hours of an ""invasion,"" discussions around what, exactly, the trigger point would be continue, they said. 
""You can think of thousands of scenarios"" that Russia could execute in or around Ukraine that would raise the question of whether sanctions were merited, said one senior EU official. ""It is a purely and highly political discussion in the end,"" the official said.
Germany, a key ally in the coordinated response given its strong trading ties with Russia, has argued hard both in public and behind closed doors for what it calls ""strategic ambiguity"" about the plans to keep Putin guessing.
For all the talk of a ""massive"" EU sanctions package, European diplomats say Russia's closest friends in the bloc - Hungary, Italy, and Austria - have an understanding that these will only be imposed if there is a Russian military attack. 
The hyperfocus on a physical invasion has taken some of the attention off other irregular warfare threats, but it also reflects differences among the allies on how to respond to non-military actions, one U.S. official said.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Sweden has suggested a discussion about a course of action if Putin never attacks and reduces troop levels slightly, but sits on the border with Ukraine, massively pressuring the Ukrainian economy and firing off the occasional cyberattack. 
The rest of the bloc is not keen to delve into this scenario, because it threatens to open up EU divisions and break the united front, several officials said. 
""Many EU countries do not want to get into a discussion about what else might merit sanctions, be it cyber or a sustained military presence on Ukraine's borders but no invasion, because those closest to Russia, such as Hungary, will be against any sanctions short of a military invasion,"" said one of the senior diplomats. 
Others, including Poland, argue that the EU should only respond if this type of harassment of Ukraine continues ""indefinitely.""
A second U.S. official noted that it was also difficult to plan for the wide range of actions Russia could take. Telegraphing U.S. and allied plans now could allow Putin to do a more precise cost-benefit analysis, giving him a potential advantage.
The White House was forced to clarify the U.S. definition of ""invasion"" in January as military troops across the border, after President Joe Biden told reporters a ""minor incursion"" might bear a lower cost.
U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters this week that Biden believed that in order for sanctions to be effective, they needed to be imposed if Putin moved against Ukraine, not beforehand.

The most important factor was that the West remained strong and united in its effort to deter Putin, he said.
The priority now was to avoid what increasingly looked like ""an imminent military invasion"" of Ukraine, one of the diplomats said.

(Reuters) - The wife of a former U.S. naval engineer pleaded guilty on Friday to helping her husband try to sell secrets about U.S. nuclear submarines to an unknown foreign country.
The guilty plea by Diana Toebbe, 46, was part of a deal with prosecutors that calls for her to get a much shorter prison sentence than her husband.
Her husband, Jonathan Toebbe, 42, admitted on Monday to conspiring with his wife to disclose restricted data, a violation of the Atomic Energy Act that carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. [nL1N2UP1XA]
His plea agreement calls for him to face a likely sentence of between 12 years to 17 years in prison. Dianne Toebbe pleaded guilty to the same offense, but her plea deal calls for a sentence in the range of three years.
Both defendants will be sentenced at later court hearings that have not yet been scheduled.
Prosecutors alleged in an October indictment that the Toebbes tried to sell government secrets about nuclear submarine propulsion to an unidentified foreign country. 
Jonathan Toebbe, who had a top-secret security clearance, communicated with an undercover FBI agent posing as a foreign official over the course of several months, the Justice Department said.
At one point, Toebbe hid a digital memory card containing documents about submarine nuclear reactors in half a peanut butter sandwich at a ""dead drop"" location in West Virginia while his wife acted as a lookout, according to the department.

The memory card contained ""militarily sensitive design elements, operating parameters and performance characteristics of Virginia-class submarine reactors,"" it said.
An FBI agent testified during a court hearing in October that Toebbe asked for $5 million in cryptocurrency in exchange for the secret submarine information. A payment the FBI made to Toebbe worth about $100,000 has not been located, the agent said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -New York will seek to make the city's subway system safer by increasing police patrols and expanding outreach to the mentally ill, Governor Kathy Hochul and Mayor Eric Adams said on Friday, responding to a series of recent attacks on passengers.
The plan will expand psychiatric services in the city and, starting next week, send teams of clinicians, social workers, and police officers to urge mentally ill and homeless New Yorkers in the subway to seek help, they said.
An unusual number of passengers have been pushed onto the subway tracks by random assailants in recent months, including a Manhattan woman, Michelle Go, who was killed in January. Her murder was seen as part of a surge in hate-driven attacks against Asian Americans.
""The vast majority of the unhoused and mentally ill, let's be clear on this, are not dangerous,"" Adams told reporters at a Manhattan subway station. But ""we have to be honest"" about the increase in subway violence due to spiking homelessness in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
The outreach teams will canvass subway platforms, stairwells and entrances to make contact with homeless individuals and follow up with housing support for them. Riders will see an increased police presence, Adams said, promising that officers would not be ""heavy handed.""

Speaking at the news conference, Hochul said the plan sought to reassure frightened riders, such as ""Asian women who go down in the subway and have to literally have their back against the wall because of the very real fear that something could happen to them.""
The plan builds on other recent efforts to crack down on subway crime. Since the city's police department began sweeping the subway system more frequently in January, officers have conducted more than 115,000 station inspections city-wide, said Keechant Sewell, the New York City police commissioner.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lawmakers in Oregon and California are calling for tougher legislation to protect election workers in response to a continuing wave of threats and harassment inspired by former President Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 vote was rigged against him.
In Oregon, legislators are considering a measure that would make it a felony to harass or threaten election workers while they are performing their official duties, state officials said. The measure would also exempt the personal information of election workers, such as home addresses, from certain public records.
""In the months leading up to and since the 2020 election, election workers across the country have faced verbal abuse, harassment and violent threats on their lives,” Oregon Secretary of State Shemia Fagan, a Democrat, told state lawmakers on Tuesday. “As we head into the 2022 election season, we must do all we can to protect election workers against physical harm fueled by misinformation.”
Oregon joins at least nine other states considering stronger protections for election administrators who have faced a campaign of terror inspired by Trump’s baseless claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 vote. Reuters documented more than 850 threats and hostile messages to election workers and officials nationwide in a series of investigative reports. 
Reuters' reporting “made it clear that we had to do something to address the unprecedented rise in threats and harassment targeting election workers,” said Ben Morris, spokesperson for Fagan. The coverage “has been incredibly helpful in making the case for the bill.” 
California is also considering legislation to provide stronger protections for frontline workers who administer elections. State Senator Josh Newman, a Democrat, introduced a bill on Wednesday that would give election workers the option of keeping their home addresses private. The measure is aimed at reducing harassment by preventing the public release of personal information online or on social media platforms.
“Once your personal information is on the internet, there's no shortage of people that may act on that information, especially when triggered,” said Newman. “It's got to be terrifying.”

The bill would allow election workers to enroll in California’s existing privacy protection programs that are available to survivors of domestic violence, judges and politicians, among others. 
“U.S. election officials are overworked, underpaid, understaffed and now under attack, as has been well documented by Reuters,” said Kim Alexander, president of the California Voter Foundation, who helped draft the bill. “We also need law enforcement to intervene whenever election officials are harassed or threatened and prosecute attackers wherever possible to help deter this kind of heinous behavior.”

BAMAKO (Reuters) -Mali's ruling military junta on Friday asked France to withdraw troops from its territory ""without delay"", calling into question Paris' plan for a four- to six-month departure and highlighting the breakdown in relations between the two countries.
Colonel Abdoulaye Maiga, a junta spokesman, said France's decision on Thursday to withdraw forces that have been fighting an Islamist insurgency was a unilateral move that violated military accords between Mali and France.
""In view of its repeated breaches of the defence agreements, the government invites French authorities to withdraw (French forces) without delay,"" Maiga said, speaking on national television.
Maiga repeated the sentence three times, but did not give a deadline.
Announcing the French troop withdrawal on Thursday, President Emmanuel Macron said it would take four to six months.
In response to Maiga's comments, Macron told reporters at an EU summit the withdrawal would be ""implemented in an orderly manner so we can continue to ensure the security of MINUSMA (the U.N. peacekeeping force in Mali) and the security of our forces.""
The U.N. force is examining how its military operations will be impacted by the departure of French troops, the force's commander Kees Matthijssen said on Friday, stressing a commitment to continue supporting Mali. 
Relations between Paris and its former colony have deteriorated in recent weeks after the junta went back on an agreement to organise an election in February and proposed holding power until 2025.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Friday that Mali's capacity to fight against Islamist groups on its territory was now Mali's problem as French and allied forces will move to neighbouring countries to help reinforce national armies.
Mali has been the epicentre of a fight against militants linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State in the region. The departure of the foreign troops could complicate efforts to tackle the groups that have killed thousands and displaced over a million.

Neighbouring Niger's President Mohamed Bazoum said separately on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that his nation had accepted that French and European special forces move across the border from Mali to combat jihadists and try to secure the border area.
West African coastal nations have seen increased attacks from the militants in recent weeks and are also expected to host some foreign troops if needed.

""I expect an agreement in the coming week, the coming two weeks or so,"" the EU official said. ""I think we have now on the table text that are very, very close to what is going to be the final agreement,"" the official said.
Reuters reported on Feb. 17 details of a possible deal negotiated by envoys from Iran, Russia, China, Britain, France, Germany, the European Union and United States.
""Most of the issues are already agreed. But as a principle in this kind of negotiations, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. So we still have...some questions, some of them rather political and difficult to agree,"" the official said.

The official said a deal was necessary as Iran's sensitive uranium enrichment programme was moving ahead quickly. Iran has always denied it is seeking nuclear weapons.
""On the ground they are advancing very much at a speed that is not compatible with the long-term survival of the JCPOA,"" the official said, referring to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, as the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers is formally titled.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The EU welcomed more than 40 African leaders to Brussels on Thursday in an effort to reassert its influence on a continent where China and Russia have made hefty investment inroads, and where many felt let down by Europe's COVID-19 vaccines rollout.
The European Union will offer several packages of support at the summit to bolster health, education and stability in Africa, and will pledge half of a new 300 billion euro ($340.9 billion)investment drive launched to rival China's Belt and Road Initiative.
But the meeting also takes place just as France and its allies fighting Islamist militants in Mali said on Thursday they would begin their military withdrawal from the country.
European and other wealthy nations were heavily criticised for hoarding protective equipment and later vaccines during the pandemic, with some African leaders saying the slow pace of donations could lead to ""vaccine apartheid"".
By the start of February, only 11% of Africans were fully vaccinated against the coronavirus - far fewer than in richer parts of the world. 
Sierra Leone President Julius Maada Bio challenged Europeans to remember there are ""human beings on the other side"" in Africa who have been left behind in the unequal global response to COVID-19, adding this has security implications.
There was also dismay over Europe's travel bans on South Africa after the Omicron variant was detected there late last year.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said he and other African leaders would raise the issue of intellectual property rights for COVID vaccines and treatments. Many developing countries want these rights waived, but face opposition from rich nations, including many in the EU.
THORNY ISSUES
Tensions run deeper on other issues between two continents with colonial ties, including over migration flows and the erosion of democracy in several African countries, some of which have recently seen coups d'etat including Mali.
Frank Mattheis, an expert in regional studies at the United Nations University, said the summit would seek to highlight areas where cooperation is promising and avoid thorny issues.
The European Commission announced this week that the EU and the Gates Foundation would invest more than 100 million euros in the next five years to help set up an African medicines regulator to boost the continent's drugs and vaccine production.
The race to establish the African Medicines Agency (AMA) comes after the pandemic exposed the region's dependence on imported vaccines.
Just over 5% of medicines and 1% of vaccines consumed by Africa's population of 1.2 billion people are produced locally. The EU says it will provide support to help Africa produce 60% of the vaccines it needs by 2040.
Part of the funding for the AMA will come from 150 billion euros to be mobilised for Africa over the next seven years under the EU's Global Gateway scheme.
Separately, the European Investment Bank announced on Thursday it would make available 500 million euros in cheap loans to African countries to strengthen healthcare systems. That credit line is expected to mobilise a total of 1 billion euros in private and public investments, the bank said. 
W. Gyude Moore, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Global Development, welcomed the investment pledge and said he hoped it would start a partnership of true equals.

""But there is a long history of unfulfilled promises like this when it comes to the EU and Africa, so the African Union, while cautiously optimistic, will remain sceptical until this pledge is converted into projects on the ground.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats are in jeopardy of losing their long-time firewall against new voting restrictions in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin should Republicans who support such curbs win competitive governors' races in those states in November.
Republican victories in the three states could have profound implications for the 2024 presidential election. Nicknamed the ""blue wall"" after helping President Joe Biden defeat Donald Trump in 2020, they also were home to challenges from Republican officials trying to overturn the election's results.
Doug Mastriano, a state senator running for governor in Pennsylvania, worked with Trump’s lawyers to challenge the 2020 outcome. James Craig, a leading Republican gubernatorial candidate in Michigan, has called for an audit of the election results. 
Rebecca Kleefisch, the top Republican contender for Wisconsin’s governor, filed a lawsuit seeking to prevent the use of drop boxes in upcoming elections. 
“They say every election is the most important of our lifetime. Well, this one is,” said Kadida Kenner, executive director of the non-partisan New Pennsylvania Project, a group that works to register new voters. 
The governors' contests, like lower-ticket races involving everything from secretaries of state to county clerks, have taken on increased significance given Republican efforts to roll back voting rights and oversee election administration ahead of 2024.
Since Trump's defeat, the three states' Republican-controlled legislatures have been dedicated to passing limits on absentee and mail-in voting, among other things. Democratic governors Tony Evers of Wisconsin, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania stood in their way.
With Evers and Whitmer now facing tough re-election fights and Wolf unable to run again due to term limits, voting rights advocates are scrambling to warn voters of the stakes. Political analysts consider all three races to be toss-ups. 
A Democratic super PAC, American Bridge, said on Wednesday it would spend $10 million in a new effort to target Republican candidates in races for governor, secretary of state and other local offices who it believes will undermine the fair administration of elections. The ""blue wall"" states will be part of the push.
Kenner's group is advocating to keep the widespread mail-in voting Pennsylvanians enjoyed during the pandemic, as well as seeking to register 50,000 new voters this year.
A voting-rights group in Michigan, Voters Not Politicians, is recruiting volunteers to go into their communities to argue that the election system is not broken, that the 2020 election was free of fraud and that the sweeping measures advocated by Republicans in the state aren't necessary.
Election analysts say it may be difficult to craft a resonant voting-rights message in a year where Americans likely are preoccupied with other issues such as inflation and education. 
""It really has to be articulated to the electorate that we are at extraordinary time,"" said Rachel Bitecofer, co-founder of StrikePAC, a Democratic voting-rights super PAC.
Her message to voters: ""A Democratic governor is the only thing standing between a free and fair 2024 election.""
VOTING RIGHTS FIGHT
On Tuesday, days after launching a bid for Wisconsin's governorship, Republican state Representative Timothy Ramthun staged a rally at the state capitol that called for the 2020 election to be overturned. Some in the crowd carried banners that said, ""Trump Won."" 
That evening, Evers, who analysts say may be most at risk in the three governor's races, warned in an address to the state that ""we must not take for granted"" the right to vote. 
Like other governors, Evers has dealt with a surfeit of challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic, economic upheaval, supply chain woes, school closings and a spike in violent crime, all of which have taken a toll on his popularity. Biden's sinking approval rating has also become a drag on Democratic governors.
Last year, Evers vetoed a Republican package that included provisions that would make it more difficult to cast absentee ballots. Republicans in the state Senate last week introduced a new version of the measure. 
The lead sponsor, Senator Duey Stroebel, said the legislature's review of the 2020 election justified the changes.
“These elections bills are necessary to fix loopholes, ambiguities and weaknesses in Wisconsin’s election law,” said Stroebel, a Republican. “It is highly unlikely these problems altered the outcome of the 2020 election, but improved election procedures would greatly increase public confidence in the results.”
The nominal favorite in the Republican primary for governor, former lieutenant governor Kleefisch, recently asked the state Supreme Court to invalidate the use of ballot drop boxes. Another gubernatorial candidate, businessman Kevin Nicholson, has said they are illegal.
In an environment where Democrats are vulnerable, analysts said too tight a focus on claims of election irregularities could alienate swing voters in the general election.
“This is something Republicans care about,” Jacob Rubashkin, an analyst in Washington who tracks governor’s races. “This is not a winning issue writ large.”
Pennsylvania's governor's race holds extra consequence for future elections. The state's governor appoints the secretary of state, who oversees election administration.
Attorney General Josh Shapiro is replacing Wolf on the Democratic ticket. A poll conducted this month by the Trafalgar Group showed former U.S. Representative Lou Barletta, an ardent Trump supporter, leading the pack of more than a dozen Republican gubernatorial candidates, followed by Mastriano.

After the November 2020 election, Mastriano convened what he called a field hearing featuring Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani to examine whether there was widespread fraud. Later, he traveled to Washington for the Jan. 6 rally and took part in protests outside the U.S Capitol. 
This week, the select congressional committee investigating the Capitol siege subpoenaed Mastriano, asking for details about a plan to submit an alternate slate of electors from his home state.

(Reuters) - Thousands of Texas voters' mail-in ballots for midterm primary elections have been rejected for failing to comply with new Republican-backed identification requirements passed in the wake of former President Donald Trump's false claims of widespread fraud, county officials said.
Election officials in six of the state's largest counties, which are collectively home to about a third of Texas' population, are reporting unprecedented rates of invalid ballots, almost entirely because voters are neglecting to include an ID number on the envelope as the new law demands.
That has officials scrambling to try to help voters correct the errors, less than two weeks before the state holds the nation's first primary election in which the Democratic and Republican voters will choose their candidates for the Nov. 8 midterm elections that will determine control of the U.S. Congress for the next two years. 
In Harris County, home to Houston and 4.7 million people, 3,475 ballots representing about 35% of those received by Tuesday could not be accepted because voters did not fill in the correct number. In past years, the overall rejection rate was between 5% and 10%.
The vast majority of ballots appeared to have been cast by registered voters who simply made an honest mistake, officials said.
""These layers don't provide more security, but they are providing more rejection,"" said Isabel Longoria, the top election official in Harris, the state's most populous county. ""Election administrators are in this very bizarre situation where it's our job to help voters vote ... and we're having to reject ballots at a rate we've never seen before.""
The number of rejected votes is certain to rise, given that the majority of mail-in ballots have not yet arrived at clerks' offices ahead of the March 1 primary.
Officials in Dallas County, the state's second-most populous with 2.6 million residents, said they were sending back 26% of mail-in ballots, much higher than in previous elections.
In Collin County, a district just north of Dallas with roughly 1 million people, 25% of mail-in ballots are being rejected, according to Bruce Sherbet, the county's election administrator.
Among other large Texas counties, Hidalgo election officials reported sending back 189 ballots of the 3,189 they had received, while at this time in the 2018 elections they had returned none.
In El Paso County, 270 of the 581 ballots – 46% – received on Tuesday were missing an ID number, said Lisa Wise, the elections administrator. 
In Williamson County, north of Austin, about a quarter of ballots have arrived with no ID number, Christopher Davis, the election administrator, said.
Reuters reached out to officials in Texas' 12 most populous counties. The others either did not respond to requests for comment or said they did not yet have data to share.
The findings present an early look at how a wave of new restrictions on voting over the past year, largely passed by Republican-held legislatures, could affect turnout in the Nov. 8 elections. 
""We've never heard of anything near as high as this,"" said James Slattery, an attorney with the Texas Civil Rights Project.
Texas lawmakers approved the voting restrictions last September after a months-long effort by Democrats to block it that included lawmakers fleeing the state. It was one of many efforts in Republican-controlled states to pass new limits after Trump falsely claimed he lost the 2020 election because of widespread fraud.
When asked about the higher than usual rejection rates, Texas Secretary of State John Scott's office referred Reuters to a statement it issued on Wednesday that laid out voters' options for correcting rejected ballots.
Some county election officials said they thought the early problems would prove short-lived as voters get accustomed to the new requirements. 
""I think it's gonna improve,"" said Sherbet, of Collin County, noting that the law does give voters who failed to fill out the number an opportunity to. ""It was just a rough start.""
REMEMBERING DECADES-OLD APPLICATIONS
The increased rejection rate follows a similar rise in the number of rejected mail-in ballot applications, which also carried a new ID requirement this year. Under the law, known as SB 1, absentee voters must include either a driver's license number or a partial Social Security number on both the application and the ballot itself.
If the number doesn't match what is in a voter's record, the paperwork must be fixed. Voting rights advocates have cited cases in which older voters may not recall which number they used at the time they first registered, perhaps decades ago.
Republican lawmakers argue the bill, which also imposed other restrictions such as barring drive-through voting, prevents election fraud and ensures public confidence. Democrats and civil rights groups point out voter fraud is exceptionally rare in the United States and say the bill is intended to depress turnout.
""Anytime you add a step to the process ... you lose voters who are making a good-faith effort to cast their ballot,"" said Katya Ehresman, the grassroots organizer for Common Cause Texas, a nonpartisan group that advocates for government reform. 
Texas limits voting by mail to voters who are over 65 years old, disabled, ill, in jail, due to give birth immediately or out of their home county on Election Day.
Administrators said they have added temporary staff to call voters and alert them to the missing ID numbers, as well as mail rejected ballots back to voters so they can fix the defect.
TIME RUNS SHORT
But the March 1 election is fast approaching. Harris County on Thursday stopped returning rejected ballots, due to concerns that there wasn't time for a ballot to go back and forth through the mail by election day, Longoria said.
Williamson County and Collin County have stopped sending ballots back this week as well, instead relying on calls to try to reach voters. But not everyone can be reached by phone.
""We're trying to triage them as best as we can,"" Davis said.
The newly designed envelopes for mail-in ballots utilize a secrecy flap that covers up the ID number to protect voters' privacy. Officials said they fear voters are not seeing that part of the form as a result.

The new law has also left some county clerks unclear on exactly how defective ballots can be fixed. Davis said he understood that voters could use the state's online voting portal to do so, but Longoria said she believed voters either had to send in a new envelope or come to an office.
""The bigger issue is not who's right or who's wrong, but even election administrators are confused about how the system works,"" Longoria said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Police warned protesters occupying central Ottawa of ""imminent"" action to clear them from the capital and began making some arrests on Thursday to end a crisis that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned was threatening public safety. 
Truckers opposing coronavirus mandates have blocked roads in downtown Ottawa for nearly three weeks, the centerpiece of a movement that has inspired anti-government protests in other countries and temporarily shut border crossings with the United States. 
Threats of fines and jail helped convince protesters to retreat this week from four U.S. border points. Police have issued similar warnings in Ottawa, where interim Police Chief Steve Bell said they were committed to driving protesters out.
""We've been bolstering our resources, developing clear plans and preparing to take action. The action is imminent,"" Bell told reporters. ""To those engaged in the unlawful protests - if you want to leave under your own terms, now is the time to do it.""
Police were seen arresting several protesters on Thursday evening, including two of the main fundraisers and organizers, Chris Barber and Tamara Lich.
Officers handcuffed Barber and placed him in the back of a police vehicle, a video posted to the organizers' Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page showed. Later they arrested Lich, a video on the organizers' Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) page showed.
""Hold the line,"" she is heard saying as she was escorted away.
There was no immediate police comment.
The arrests marked an escalation of police activity that has drawn the defiance of protesters, who honked their horns in unison earlier on Thursday in violation of a court order. Others shrugged off the warnings and soaked in a portable hot tub set up near a door to parliament.
""I ain't going anywhere,"" said Pat King, one of the organizers of the protest. ""I haven't overstayed my welcome. My taxes paid for me to be here."" 
Police said they would restrict access to downtown Ottawa and that officers had begun erecting barriers around government buildings. They have also distributed leaflets warning truck drivers and others of ""severe penalties"". 
While officers have not physically removed people, the increased police presence has demonstrators bracing for action and urging one another to remain calm. 
""If the police escalate, we're not going to escalate,"" said Chris Dacey, who says he has been at the protests every day since they started on Jan. 28. ""We're not going to respond to any type of aggression ... We're here (until) the prime minister talks to us."" 
Heavy snow began falling on Thursday evening and up to 12 inches (30 cm) could accumulate by Friday morning, Environment Canada said.
'THREAT TO SAFETY'
Some 400 vehicles are parked outside parliament and the prime minister's office, paralyzing downtown. Calling the blockades a threat to democracy, Trudeau invoked emergency measures on Monday giving his government temporary powers to clamp down.
""The blockades and occupations are illegal. They're a threat to our economy, the relationship with trading partners, they're a threat to supply chains and the availability of essential goods like food and medicine. They're a threat to public safety,"" Trudeau said on Thursday. 
The demonstrators initially protested against cross-border COVID-19 vaccine mandates for truckers and other restrictions. But they have made clear their opposition to Trudeau and some say they want to see him forced from office. 
Canadian officials have warned of extremist elements among demonstrators who they say want to overthrow the government. But Trudeau toned down his rhetoric in remarks to lawmakers on Thursday.
""Canadians continue to have the right to free expression, the right to protest peacefully, but occupying the downtown of our major cities, protesting and blocking border crossings is unacceptable,"" he said.
In an open letter to politicians, the organizers of the self-styled ""Freedom Convoy"" told Trudeau's government: ""End the mandates, end the vaccine passports. This is why we are here."" 
Protesters had earlier blocked Ontario's Ambassador Bridge to Detroit, a vital trade route that is North America's busiest land border crossing. Before being cleared on Sunday, the bridge blockade had damaged U.S.-Canada trade. 
""(The) kind of conduct that we have seen at our borders puts into serious question the integrity and the security of this country,"" Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino told the House of Commons. 
Police in Windsor, Ontario, said they had foiled a suspected attempt to re-establish barriers near the bridge this week. And in Ottawa, authorities have received reinforcements from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, with more officers expected. 

One Ottawa protester predicted demonstrations would continue even if police tried to clear them out and make arrests. 
""I imagine most people are going to kneel down and stay peaceful,"" said Sean, who declined to give his last name. ""Nobody's going to fight, nobody's going to get violent if they need to be arrested.""

428,"<span>Feb 17, 2022 10:30PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -A New York state trooper who has accused former Governor Andrew Cuomo of sexual harassment sued Cuomo and a top aide on Thursday, stating that she was subjected to discrimination and retaliation after making the allegations.
The woman, identified in court documents only as Trooper 1, says that Cuomo touched her inappropriately on at least two occasions and made repeated comments on her appearance. 
""Given the threats and victim-shaming that Trooper 1 has faced after she testified truthfully about being sexually harassed in the workplace by the former governor, she has made the decision to proceed with this lawsuit anonymously with the hope that she can vindicate her legal rights and move on with her life,"" attorney Valdi Licul said in a written statement. 
""We will not be deterred by the ex-Governor’s bullying tactics,"" Licul said. ""He is only making his legal problems worse by lashing out at his victim with false and defamatory statements intended to further retaliate against her.”
A Democrat who ran New York for a decade, Cuomo resigned in August after multiple women who worked for him accused him of unwanted sexual advances and contact. He denied touching anyone inappropriately and said his efforts to be a friendly boss may have been misinterpreted as flirtation.
In January, the last county prosecutor investigating allegations from one of several women said he had no legal basis to pursue a case, meaning Cuomo would not face criminal charges related to the sexual harassment claims that led to his resignation.
A spokesman for the 64-year-old former governor, Rich Azzopardi, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that the latest lawsuit was based on allegations that prosecutors had already dismissed.
Azzopardi also said the law firm representing the trooper was ""widely known to use the press to extort settlements on behalf of anonymous claimants."" 
The trooper accuses a longtime aide to Cuomo, Melissa DeRosa, of helping cover up the governor's misdeeds. 

A lawyer for DeRosa said on Twitter that the aide had had little interaction with the trooper and called the lawsuit ""beyond frivolous."" 
The state police are also named in the lawsuit, which was posted online by New York media.

(Reuters) - U.S. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy on Thursday endorsed a primary challenger to Republican Representative Liz Cheney, a prominent critic of former President Donald Trump.
McCarthy, who represents California, said in a statement he will back Harriet Hageman in the Republican primary in Wyoming set for August.
The move comes almost two weeks after the party censured Cheney and Representative Adam Kinzinger for joining House Democrats in an investigation into the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
Cheney was among 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump on a charge of incitement of insurrection in connection with the attack.
""I am proud to endorse Harriet Hageman for Congress,"" McCarthy said. ""The most successful Representatives in Congress focus on the needs of their constituents, and throughout her career, Harriet has championed America's natural resources and helped the people of Wyoming reject burdensome and onerous government overreach.""
Hageman, a land-use lawyer, is among several candidates seeking to unseat Cheney from Wyoming's lone House seat in Washington.

The race has mobilized out-of-state donors to contribute to Cheney's campaign. Hageman has stressed that a majority of the funds that her campaign has collected came from Wyoming residents who can cast a ballot in the primary. 
McCarthy joins Trump and Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky in backing Hageman.

(Reuters) -The family of a Black teenager who was pinned to the ground and arrested by New Jersey police following a fight with a white teenager at a local mall has retained the attorney in the George Floyd wrongful death case, Benjamin Crump, to represent them.
""This is another example of the kind of racial bias that we need to root out of our system of policing,"" Crump said in a written statement on Thursday.
A video that went viral on social media showed the two teens fighting in a sitting area at the Bridgewater Commons Mall at the weekend when two officers arrived. One officer sat the white teen on a couch while the other threw the Black teen to the ground. 
Crump said the officer pinned down his client, eighth grader Z'Kye Husain, and handcuffed him because officers believed his skin color made him more of a threat than the white teen involved in the scuffle.
""We have requested that the Somerset County Prosecutor’s Office assist us in this matter and are requesting patience as we strictly adhere to the New Jersey Attorney General’s Internal Affairs Directive (regarding such cases),"" the Bridgewater Township Police Department said.
The white teenager who fought with Husain was apparently not taken into custody at the scene. Police have not identified him.
""I’m deeply disturbed by what appears to be racially disparate treatment in this video,"" New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Wednesday. 
The use of force by police against young Black men has prompted calls for reforms nationwide. 
Floyd, 46, died in May 2020 under the knee of then-Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin as he was being arrested on suspicion of passing a counterfeit bill, a case that touched off a summer of street protests in major U.S. cities.
Chauvin was convicted of murder in 2021 and sentenced to 22-1/2 years in prison.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) -U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken laid out at the United Nations Security Council on Thursday how Washington believes Russia could seek to invade Ukraine, warning that Moscow was preparing to attack its neighbor in the ""coming days.""
Blinken, as other U.S. officials have done over the past two weeks, accused Russia of planning to manufacture a pretext for an attack on Ukraine that could include ""a fake, even a real, attack using chemical weapons,"" and said: ""Russia may describe this event as ethnic cleansing or a genocide.""
Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Vershinin rejected Blinken's statement a ""regrettable"" and ""dangerous"" move that further fuels tensions. He said Russian forces remain on Russian territory and some units were already returning to their bases following exercises. 
Blinken pushed Moscow to announce ""with no qualification, equivocation or deflection"" that it will not invade Ukraine. 
""State it clearly. State it plainly to the world, and then demonstrate it by sending your troops, your tanks, the planes back to their barracks and hangars and sending your diplomats to the negotiating table,"" Blinken said.
Russia has denied it wants to invade Ukraine. The crisis, however, has prompted the U.S.-led NATO alliance to shore up its presence in member states closer to Russia or Ukraine. Ukraine is not a NATO member and Russia does not want it to be allowed to join.
Blinken made his U.N. appearance at a meeting of the 15-member council on the Minsk agreements, which aim to end an 8-year-long conflict between the Ukrainian army and Russian-backed separatists in the east of the country.
""I am here today not to start a war, but to prevent one,"" he said.
Tensions between Moscow and Western capitals are high following weeks of United States accusations that Russia has deployed up to 150,000 troops near Ukraine's borders for an invasion. Moscow accuses the West of hysteria.
Blinken said U.S. information indicated that Russian forces ""are preparing to launch an attack against Ukraine in the coming days"" and had identified main targets, including the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. Blinken said he has asked Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to meet in Europe next week.
Britain's Minister for Europe and North America, James Cleverly, told the Security Council: ""Russia has deployed the forces necessary to invade Ukraine, and now has them readied for action.""
'CIRCUS'
Russian deputy minister Vershinin had appealed to council members not to turn the meeting ""into a circus"" by presenting a ""baseless accusation saying that Russia allegedly was going to attack Ukraine."" 
""I think we've had enough speculation on that,"" Vershinin said. ""We have a long ago clarified everything and explained everything.""
A senior U.S. official said earlier on Thursday that Russia could use the Security Council meeting as part of a bid to ""establish a pretext for a potential invasion"" after Russia shared a document containing allegations that war crimes had been committed in southeastern Ukraine.
The Russian document, circulated to council members and seen by Reuters, accuses Ukrainian authorities of ""exterminating the civilian population"" in eastern Ukraine. 
The U.S. official rejected the Russian claims as ""categorically false.""
Referring to ethnic Russians living in eastern Ukraine, Vershinin told the council they ""are still presented as foreigners in their own country"" and targeted by the Ukrainian military. He told council members they would be ""horrified"" by the document Russia had shared with them. 
Earlier on Thursday, Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian government forces traded accusations of firing shells across the ceasefire line in eastern Ukraine, in what Kyiv said appeared to be a ""provocation.""

Yaşar Halit Çevik, chief monitor of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, told the Security Council that while some 500 explosions had been recorded overnight, ""the tension may seem to be easing.""
The U.N. Security Council has met dozens of times to discuss the Ukraine crisis since Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014. It cannot take any action because Russia is a veto-power along with France, Britain, China and the United States.

(Reuters) -A Colorado elections clerk was sued on Thursday after he copied data from voting machines with the help of two men with ties to groups supporting the false conspiracy theory that the 2020 election was stolen from former Republican President Donald Trump.
    Dallas Schroeder, who oversees elections in Elbert County, east of Denver, was sued by Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold for making two copies of his county's voting system hard drives and then handing the images to ""unauthorized people"", according to the lawsuit.
In the civil lawsuit, filed in Elbert County District Court, Griswold demands that Schroeder return the copies and hand over the device he used to make them.
Schroeder did not immediately respond to a Reuters email for comment.
    Schroeder is the second Colorado elections clerk to come under scrutiny for allegedly breaching voting systems as part of an ""election integrity"" effort by Trump supporters who falsely claim the 2020 election was marred by fraud. Suspected breaches are under investigation in other states, including in Michigan, where authorities last week said an unnamed third party had been given unauthorized access to a county voting system.
    In August, the FBI opened an investigation into a suspected security breach of voting equipment in Mesa County in western Colorado. Griswold, a Democrat, has accused Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters of facilitating that breach.
    Peters and Schroeder, both Republicans, have denied any wrongdoing.
Peters announced on Monday she was running for Colorado Secretary of State.
    In a January court filing, Schroeder said he made copies of his county's voting system hard drives last August.
    He said he was ""provided instructions"" on the phone by Shawn Smith and Mark Cook, prominent election-denial activists, and used a device provided by Cook.
    Smith and Cook are associates of Mike Lindell, the pro-Trump chief executive of My Pillow Inc., and an election conspiracist.
Cook did not immediately respond to an email and call seeking comment. There was no immediate response to a request for comment from Smith, sent through the U.S. Election Integrity Plan group with which he is affiliated.

    Schroeder said he gave the hard drive copies to his attorney, John Case, and another unnamed attorney. He said he made the copies to preserve election records before a scheduled update to the systems. Schroeder is also suing Griswold, demanding an audit of the 2020 results.
In Michigan last week, Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson claimed an unnamed third party had been given unauthorized access to a county voting system.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's support of vaccine mandates in fighting COVID-19 helped him win re-election five months ago, but now he looks increasingly isolated as restrictions are being lifted around the world.
Denmark, the Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden, Norway, Israel, Britain and Spain and most of the United States are easing or lifting COVID restrictions, and most of Canada's provincial governments are rolling them back, too.
But Trudeau has doubled down on federal vaccine mandates and this week invoked emergency powers to seek an end to weeks of protests against his government's pandemic restrictions. 
Protesters have occupied the core of Ottawa since late January and last week cut off major trade corridors to the United States. 
Trudeau is trying to regain control, but has drawn sharp criticism even from some of his own Liberal Party lawmakers, including Nate Erskine-Smith, who said ""divisive rhetoric"" should be dropped.
""The challenge for the Prime Minister is that he's looking dogmatic at not pragmatic,"" said independent pollster Nik Nanos, founder of Nanos Research.
""This protest movement has put a spotlight on him being ... divisive, because the fact of the matter is all Canadians are frustrated,"" Nanos said, adding it would now be tougher for Trudeau to win another election, whenever it may come.
While most Canadians approve of the mandates and 80% are vaccinated, after two years many are tiring of pandemic restrictions. 
During the protests, the majority of the country's 10 provinces - including Ontario and Quebec - began lifting them, saying they moved because of the rapidly falling COVID-19 case numbers in the past few weeks, rather than due to pressure from demonstrators.
""The world is done with (the pandemic), so let's just move forward,"" Ontario Premier Doug Ford said on Tuesday. 
Ford said he would lift proof-of-vaccination requirements used by non-essential businesses like restaurants on March 1. A Leger survey from last week said a third of Canadians think now is the time to lift all restrictions.
Trudeau says vaccination remains the best way to get through the pandemic, defending the mandates despite the sharp reduction in cases linked to the Omicron variant.
The Trudeau government's approval rating fell six percentage points between Jan. 12, before the protests began and Feb. 8, while they were ongoing, an Abacus Data poll said this week. 
Last week, one of Trudeau's own lawmakers, Joel Lightbound, accused the prime minister of being divisive when he embraced vaccine mandates as a wedge issue in last year's campaign. 
""It's time to stop dividing Canadians, to stop pitting one part of the population against another,"" Lightbound said on Feb. 8. ""Time to stop with the division and the distractions. It's time to choose positive, not coercive methods.""
A handful of backbench legislators, including Erskine-Smith, have since expressed support for some of Lightbound's views. While Lightbound resigned as Quebec caucus chair, he remains a Liberal lawmaker.
Trudeau ""has got a political emergency with his own caucus, in his own party"", said Candice Bergen, leader of the Conservative Party, on Wednesday. She took over as leader of the opposition Conservative Party after her predecessor was ousted earlier this month for not fully embracing the protests.
The Liberals say the recent election makes it clear what Canadians want.
""We campaigned on vaccine mandates, and parties that supported vaccine mandates got the majority in the house. And that's why we were able to do them as soon as we got elected,"" said a senior Liberal Party source when asked about the criticism from within the party.
The vaccine mandate for federal workers introduced after the election has brought the vaccination rate among federal employees to 98.2%. One for cross-border truckers that started in January and sparked the ongoing protests has helped bring the vaccination rate to 90% among international drivers. 

When Trudeau this week invoked emergency powers to put an end to the protests, he recognized that there was a split in public sentiment.
""I know people are frustrated. I hear it ... But blockading streets and critical infrastructure and depriving your neighbors of their freedoms"" is not the right way to protest, he said.

Sexual assault and harassment in the U.S. military is largely underreported, according to the military itself, and the Pentagon’s handling of it has come under renewed scrutiny.
This year President Joe Biden signed an executive order to make sexual harassment an offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 
In December, lawmakers passed the National Defense Authorization Act which included an overhaul of the military justice system. It would take decisions on whether to prosecute cases of rape and sexual assault out of the hands of military commanders, though activists have said it does not go far enough.
The annual report said there had been 131 reports of sexual assault during the 2020-2021 academic year, up from 88 the year before, though there was little in-person learning during the 2019-2020 academic year because of the coronavirus pandemic. 

The highest number of reports before was 122 during the 2018-2019 academic year. 
The U.S. Air Force academy saw the largest number of reports last year at 52, followed by 46 at West Point and 33 at the Naval academy in Annapolis, Maryland.

(Reuters) -Prominent civil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton said on Thursday that Amir Locke was killed for being Black in America, telling mourners at a church in Minneapolis Thursday that ""enough is enough.""
Hundreds of people gathered to mourn Locke, the 22-year-old fatally shot by law enforcement in a Minneapolis apartment during a no-knock raid. It was the latest in a series of killings to spark outrage over police treatment of racial minorities.
Sharpton delivered a eulogy for Locke after a public viewing at Shiloh Temple International Ministries, a church that serves a metropolitan area where two high-profile killings of Black men attracted national attention in the past two years.
Sharpton, who leads the civil rights non-profit National Action Network, had eulogized Daunte Wright at the same church in April 2021. Wright was shot and killed during a traffic stop in a nearby suburb.
Wright's death came about a year after the killing of George Floyd, who died when a Minneapolis police officer used his knee to pin Floyd's neck to the ground in May 2020. Floyd's death, captured on a video that went viral, sparked a summer of protests over racial injustice across the United States and abroad. 
Sharpton called for action from local politicians to pass legislation banning no-knock warrants.
""If they had passed the no-knock law in Minneapolis, we wouldn't be at a funeral this morning,"" Sharpton said from the pulpit. ""I stand here to say you are going to pass the Amir Locke law. Enough is enough. We are no longer going to be your nameless suspects.""
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has placed a moratorium on no-knock searches and some state lawmakers are seeking to enact legislation to limit them.
Locke's family described him as an aspiring rap artist who was loving to everyone. Sharpton said he was a ""clean, stand-up guy.""
Locke was shot and killed by police who obtained a no-knock warrant to search the apartment as part of a homicide investigation. He was not named in the warrant.
Court documents released last week showed the warrant had been approved because the homicide in question had involved a firearm capable of penetrating police body armor.

Days after his death on Feb. 2, police released video footage of the raid. It showed Locke holding a gun as he twisted beneath a blanket on a sofa after being roused by officers. Police say he pointed the gun at officers before they opened fire. Locke's family disputes that. 
Protests in downtown Minneapolis have drawn hundreds of demonstrators. They said Locke had a right to possess a weapon in his own home and was never given the chance to disarm himself in the chaotic moments as police stormed into his apartment without warning.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Misinformation about science is increasingly prevalent and a significant public health threat that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will focus on fighting, incoming Commissioner Robert Califf said on Thursday.
Califf, who was sworn in on Thursday, did not specify any particular misinformation the FDA should fight, but millions of Americans still refuse COVID-19 vaccines, with many conservative media outlets and Republicans in the U.S. Congress spreading doubt about their effectiveness.
Healthcare workers say misinformation is the single most important factor influencing people who refuse to get vaccinated while COVID-19 kills around 2,200 Americans a day, the majority of whom are unvaccinated.
""These kinds of distortions and half-truths that find their way into the public domain do enormous harm, both by leading people to behavior that is detrimental to their health and by causing them to eschew interventions that would improve their health,"" said Califf.
""A purely reactive mode is not appropriate, particularly in this new era of social media,"" he told FDA staff in a public letter outlining his priorities, adding that the agency will be more proactive in providing the public with health information.
Pandemic response will remain the FDA's primary focus, Califf said, but it will apply the lessons learned to speed the development of new treatments to other diseases like cancer.
The Senate narrowly confirmed Califf on Tuesday after some senators had argued his ties to the pharmaceutical industry or views on birth control made him unfit to lead the FDA.
Calif, 70, previously served as commissioner under President Barrack Obama. He takes the helm at the FDA for a second time 13 months after it last had a permanent leader.
Some senators criticized the FDA response to the opioid crisis under his leadership. Califf said the crisis was a key priority and that current efforts had come up short.

""With over 100,000 deaths from overdose in the past year alone, we must accept that all the hard work so far has not been enough,"" he said.
Califf said he also plans to focus on tobacco harm-reduction and preventing electronic cigarette use among young people.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - A powerful winter storm was barreling through the eastern half of the United States on Thursday, bringing a variety of weather threats to the area that included heavy snow, damaging thunderstorms and the potential of isolated tornadoes.
The National Weather Service (NWS) issued winter storm, strong wind and thunderstorm warnings and watches for the wide swath of the nation stretching 1,500 miles (2,400 km) from western Oklahoma to northern Maine from Thursday afternoon into Friday.
The system was expected to dump a quick burst of snow on an area from Oklahoma to Michigan and into the Northeast while threatening Mississippi and Tennessee up through Ohio and into the Northeast with severe thunderstorms, the NWS said. 
""It's a pretty potent large-scale storm system that's got a lot of different hazards associated with it depending on where folks,"" are said NWS meteorologist in Matt Beitscher, who is based in St. Louis. ""In our area, the road conditions are pretty treacherous."" 
Snowfall exceeding 2 inches (5 cm) per hour and winds reaching 40 miles per hour (64 kph) could severely reduce visibility on roadways, with the heaviest snowfall of up to 8 inches in the region that stretched from western Oklahoma to northern Maine, the weather service said. 
Some 200 flights were canceled in and out of Chicago's O'Hare International Airport while another 270 were canceled from and to Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport. In all, about 1,000 flights had been canceled in the United States on Thursday, Flightaware.com reported. 
The storm was forecast to also spark potentially strong thunderstorms in the Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama and Arkansas where it could produce damaging wind gusts, large hail, and isolated tornadoes. 
Rainfall of up to 2 inches was expected in this region, with locally higher amounts, causing the threat of flash flooding. 
The storm was also packing strong southerly winds reaching 50 mph could which could down power lines and cause hazardous travel conditions from the South and into the Ohio Valley. Wind gusts could reach as high as 65 mph on Thursday night in parts of southern New England, the weather service said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Trump-era U.S. Attorney engaged in ""unbecoming"" conduct when he publicly bashed a federal prosecutor for signing a letter that was critical of then-Attorney General Bill Barr's order to pursue investigations into voting irregularities in the 2020 presidential election, a new report has found.
Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz said on Thursday that the ex-U.S. Attorney made inappropriate comments about one of the prosecutors in his office during a press conference.
The press conference came after Barr penned a controversial memo ordering U.S. Attorneys offices to pursue ""substantial"" allegations of voting irregularities.
Critics said the order was improper because it gave credence to President Donald Trump's false claims the election was stolen, and it prompted the department's top lawyer overseeing voter fraud investigations at the time to resign from that position in protest. 
Ultimately Barr concluded there was no evidence of wide-spread voter fraud.
At a press conference, a reporter asked the U.S. Attorney about the letter, which was signed by a number of assistant U.S. Attorneys (AUSA), including one in his office.
In response, the U.S. Attorney ""sought to undermine the AUSA’s professional reputation by referencing that the spouse of the AUSA who signed the letter had previously worked for two U.S. Attorneys General of the previous administration,"" the report says, thereby inappropriately suggesting the AUSA was motivated by partisan political considerations.
Those comments ""constituted poor judgment, was unbecoming of a U.S. Attorney or any DOJ leader, and reflected poorly on DOJ,"" Horowitz found.
It also ran contrary to internal department guidance, which urged leadership to refrain from commenting negatively because the letter was legally protected free speech.
The report does not identify the former U.S. Attorney, but its description closely matches a November 2020 press conference held by Scott Brady, the former U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania.

At that event, Brady said one of the prosecutors who signed the letter ""was married to the former chief of staff of Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch"" and had added his name ""unbeknownst to anyone in leadership"" and without talking to an ethics adviser.
Brady, now an attorney with Jones Day, could not be immediately reached for comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is completing a review of an enforcement initiative aimed at combating Chinese espionage and intellectual property theft, an examination that former officials and critics expect will result in a shift away from its controversial targeting of academic researchers.
The so-called ""China Initiative"" was launched in 2018 during the Trump administration and spearheaded by former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Its stated goal has been to broadly counter what the department said were ""Chinese national security threats.""
Previous administrations have probed academics for allegedly sharing proprietary information with China. However, the Trump Justice Department expanded the effort by investigating professors at U.S. universities over whether they disclosed financial ties to China when seeking federal grant funding and scrutinizing visiting Chinese scholars from military affiliated universities. 
But following the collapse of several cases against researchers and blowback from civil rights groups and some lawmakers who said the program has fueled racial profiling of Chinese scientists, the Biden Justice Department launched a review of the initiative.
    Former officials and stakeholders say they expect the Justice Department will shift away from prosecuting professors, cases that university faculty say have chilled research and scared Chinese American academics.
They also expect the department to remove the word ""China"" from the program's name, amid concerns that label could fuel anti-Asian rhetoric. 
""The cases they brought against professors had nothing to do with spying or espionage,"" said U.S. Representative Ted Lieu, Democrat of California. ""It was simply racial profiling.""
Matthew Olsen, who leads the department's National Security Division, has been reviewing the initiative and is expected to complete the effort ""soon,"" a Justice Department spokesman said. 
Lieu and other members of the Congressional Asian Pacific Caucus met with Olsen last month to discuss the initiative amid the review.
""He definitely understood our concerns,"" Lieu said.
But supporters and critics of the program alike say the department is unlikely to fully abandon the initiative and instead re-focus on state-sponsored espionage and trade secret theft investigations, potentially leaving some critics unsatisfied.
    ""For us certainly, any sort of rebranding of the China Initiative and simply dropping the name China from it would not be enough for us,"" said John Yang, the head of the Asian American Justice Center. 
The China Initiative still has support from key officials within the Justice Department, including FBI Director Christopher Wray, who in a recent speech said the bureau has over 2000 active trade theft cases and opens a new case involving China every 12 hours.
""There is just no country that presents a broader threat to our ideas, our innovation, and our economic security than China,"" Wray said.
FLAWED EVIDENCE
The China Initiative has led to some high-profile cases, including its bank fraud case against Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou. Other notable cases include one accusing Chinese officials of hacking American companies, and the department's Operation Fox Hunt case alleging Chinese officials traveled to the U.S. to harass dissidents into returning home to face charges. 
However, the controversy surrounding the cases in academia has cast the program in a negative light.
At least 20 academic researchers have faced charges, including Charles Lieber, a Harvard University professor convicted in December of concealing his ties to China in connection with federally funded research.
But almost half of the academic cases were based on flawed evidence or premises, resulting in at least nine prosecutions out of some 20 cases being dismissed before trial or ending in acquittals.
Most recently, the department dropped charges last month against Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Gang Chen, after prosecutors admitted they could not prove he had hidden ties to China when seeking federal grant funds.
Moreover, a November survey by Chinese American advocacy group https://www.committee100.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/C100-Lee-Li-White-Paper-FINAL-FINAL-10.28.pdf Committee of 100 and the University of Arizona found about 42% of non-U.S. citizen Chinese scientists say they are now inclined to leave the United States because of the China Initiative and the FBI investigations.
Andrew Lelling, the former Massachusetts U.S. attorney under Trump, said he supported the China Initiative, but now agrees that the department should shift away from targeting academics.

""All the universities now focus more on transparency,"" he said, adding that the program has affected how academics share information about their relationships. 
""All of the researchers in international collaborations are now scared to not disclose them.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Hong Kong's coronavirus battle intensified on Thursday as authorities reported that new cases had multiplied by 60 times so far this month, and the city's leader said city-wide testing was being considered in the global financial hub.
Hospitals have been overwhelmed with some patients, including the elderly, left lying on beds outside in chilly, sometimes rainy weather, in shocking scenes that prompted an apology from authorities in the Chinese-controlled city.
Schools, gyms, cinemas and most public venues are shut and many office employees are working from home. But many residents are fatigued by the harsh restrictions imposed to protect against the pandemic, even as most other major cities in the world adjust to living with the virus.
Health authorities reported a record 6,116 confirmed cases on Thursday, up from 4,285 the previous day, with a further 6,300 preliminary positive cases. That takes the total since January to more than 16,600. There were 24 new deaths.
The jump in cases is the biggest test yet of the city's ""dynamic zero COVID"" policy, but leader Carrie Lam said this week that the city ""cannot surrender to the virus.""
Some media reports, citing unidentified sources, said the government planned to test up to 1 million people each day from March. Those who fail to comply would be fined HK$10,000 ($1,282).
Lam told reporters later, while greeting the arrival of several mainland Chinese health experts to help with the outbreak, that ""city-wide virus testing is a plan we are considering now.""
Local media cited her as saying 300,000 tests could be conducted daily by the end of this month. 
The government did not respond to a request for comment. 
""Because of the severe number of cases we need to speed up admission to hospitals and community isolation facilities,"" Undersecretary for Food and Health Chui Tak-yi told reporters. ""The government is trying to ease all these bottlenecks.""
Quarantine facilities had reached capacity and hospital beds were more than 90% full, authorities said.In a move to free up beds for isolation, Lam said late on Wednesday she had spoken to local hotel owners and planned to make up to 10,000 hotel rooms available for COVID-19 patients.
RETAILERS BATTERED
Lam's comments came after Chinese President Xi Jinping told Hong Kong's leaders that their ""overriding mission"" was to stabilise and control the coronavirus.
The surge in cases and tighter rules have battered the city's retail sector, with the Retail Management Association (HKRMA) on Thursday saying retail traffic was down 40% from December.
""If the pandemic gets worse and if our rents are kept at the level now ... we will not survive,"" said Annie Tse, chairwoman of HKRMA. ""Since protests and COVID it's been almost three years, how much more cash can we burn?,"" she said, referring to anti-government demonstrations in 2019.
The association, which represents around 9,000 retail outlets and employs over half of the local retail workforce, urged the government to force developers to provide rent relief for tenants and include the sector in an anti-epidemic fund. 
HKRMA expects flat year-on-year growth for retail sales for the January-June period, and said growth would easily sink into negative territory in the second half if the situation persists.
Hong Kong has adopted the same ""dynamic zero"" coronavirus strategy employed by mainland China to suppress outbreaks.
But the scale and speed of the highly contagious Omicron variant has left authorities scrambling. Hospitals are operating at maximum or over capacity and long queues have formed outside testing centres, with some people waiting hours.
Authorities said they could no longer keep up their testing and isolation mandates, resulting in a backlog that could not keep pace with the daily infection numbers.
China has said it would help Hong Kong bolster its testing, treatment and quarantine capacity, and secure resources from rapid antigen kits and protective gear to fresh vegetables.
Hong Kong has recorded around 35,000 infections since the start of the pandemic, and more than 250 deaths, far fewer than other similar-sized major cities.

However, medical experts have warned that daily cases could surge to 28,000 by the end of March amid worries about high levels of vaccine hesitancy among the elderly.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department has tapped a seasoned computer crimes prosecutor to lead its new national cryptocurrency enforcement team and announced on Thursday that the FBI is launching a unit for blockchain analysis and virtual asset seizure.
The creation of the FBI's ""virtual asset exploitation"" unit comes after the Justice Department's largest-ever financial seizure earlier this month. It charged a married New York couple with allegedly laundering bitcoins now valued at over $4.5 billion that were stolen in the 2016 hack of the digital currency exchange Bitfinex.
U.S. regulators under President Joe Biden have been ratcheting up their scrutiny of the crypto industry in the wake of a series of high-profile cyberattacks last year on the largest U.S. fuel pipeline network and the world's largest beef supplier. Ransomware groups often demand their fees in bitcoin.
In some of those cases, the FBI has been able to track down and recover some of the ransom. 
Cryptocurrencies rely on blockchain technology, a database shared across a network of computers, in which records are difficult to change once added.
In a speech at the Munich Cyber Security Conference in Germany, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco announced that Eun Young Choi, a prosecutor who led the case against a Russian hacker who helped steal information about more than 80 million JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) & Chase Co customers, will lead the department's cryptocurrency enforcement team.
Choi, who most recently served as Monaco's senior counsel, worked for nearly a decade as a cybercrime coordinator and assistant U.S. attorney in New York, according to her LinkedIn profile. the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York.
""We are issuing a clear warning to criminals who use cryptocurrency to fuel their schemes,"" Monaco said. 
""We also call on all companies dealing with cryptocurrency - we need you to root out cryptocurrency abuses. To those who do not, we will hold you accountable where we can.""

Monaco also announced the creation of a new international virtual currency initiative, and said the department will be aggressive about disrupting cyber threats, even at the risk of tipping off cybercriminals and jeopardizing potential charges.
""Moving forward, prosecutors, agents, and analysts will now assess - at each stage of a cyber investigation - whether to use disruptive actions against cyber threats, even if they might otherwise tip the cybercriminals off and jeopardize the potential for charges and apprehension,"" she said.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Russian teenage figure skater Kamila Valieva tumbled to fourth place in the women's singles event on Thursday, yielding to the pressure of a doping controversy that has rocked the Beijing Games.
In a final twist that ensures a medal ceremony will go ahead on Friday, Valieva's compatriots Anna Shcherbakova claimed the gold medal and Alexandra Trusova took the silver, while a beaming Kaori Sakamoto of Japan claimed the bronze medal.
After stumbling to the ice more than once, 15-year-old Valieva gave one last forced smile to the judges and masked her face with her hand as she skated head down towards the exit with her supporters shouting ""Molodets!"" ""Molodets!"" (Bravo, bravo).
The skating prodigy, favourite for gold ahead of the Games, had been hoping to shut out the noise of a doping scandal after testing positive for a banned substance in late December, news of which only broke on Feb. 8 - a day after she helped the Russian Olympic Committee win the team competition.
Decked out in a sparkling black and red dress and bright red gloves, she kept her composure for 30 seconds and landed her opening quadruple Salchow jump. 
But she then faltered after a triple Axel and made a number of uncharacteristic stumbles after that in a free skate routine set to Maurice Ravel's ""Bolero"".
After coming to a stop, she threw one hand forward in open frustration at a performance that was nowhere near her usual high standards, and ended almost 50 points below her own world record score on 224.09.
Shcherbakova claimed gold with a total score of 255.95 ahead of Trusova on 251.73. Japan's Sakamoto scored 233.13.
In the stands, loud cheers and applause had greeted Valieva's arrival on the ice, and her fans chanted her name after her stumble - while the camera shutters went into overdrive.
Valieva was left sobbing in the ""kiss and cry"" area after her performance, while her coach Eteri Tutberidze, who also trains Shcherbakova and Trusova, underlined the pressure the teenage skaters are under.
""Why did you let it go? Explain it to me, why? Why did you stop fighting completely? Somewhere after the axel you let it go,"" Tutberidze demanded of the distraught Valieva.
POOR KID
""This is a moment where you genuinely have to say - that poor kid. She should not have ever been put in this position,"" former U.S. skater Ashley Wagner wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
""She shouldn’t have been out on that ice, she shouldn’t have been put in a position where she became the face of a problem bigger than her."" 
In a high-octane routine, Valieva's team mate Trusova, the 2021 world championships bronze medallist, attempted five quads to the soundtrack of ""Cruella"" and the Stooges's ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" for a season's best free skate score of 177.13.
Fellow 17-year-old Shcherbakova's free skate was not as powerful, but the world champion skated with accuracy as she landed two quads early in her programme.
""I’m glad I managed my nerves and worries and showed my maximum at the right time and place,"" said Shcherbakova, whose heart went out to Valieva.
""Of course I was very worried about her during the skate because from the first jump it was clear that the skate was not doing great. I really understand what an athlete feels in those moments.""
Shcherbakova, Trusova and Sakamoto came back for the podium ceremony, staying on the ice for several minutes to soak up a moment they probably thought was not going to happen.
""I wasn't expecting to place in the top three so I’m just overjoyed,"" said a delighted Sakamoto.
The medal ceremony will take place on Friday at 1945 Beijing time (1145GMT). 
Valieva tested positive for a banned heart drug after the national championships on Dec. 25 but the result was not revealed until Feb. 8. She was eventually cleared to compete in the women's single event by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Monday.
She came into Thursday's skate as the hot favourite and it was expected that the medal ceremony would not go ahead because of the unresolved doping case.

Valieva is one of the youngest athletes to have a positive test revealed at the Olympics, prompting questions about the role of the adults around her and the continuing scourge of Russian doping in international sport.
It has also fueled a debate over raising the age limit for figure skating.

VIENNA (Reuters) - A U.S.-Iranian deal taking shape to revive Iran's 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers lays out phases of mutual steps to bring both sides back into full compliance, and the first does not include waivers on oil sanctions, diplomats say.
Envoys from Iran, Russia, China, Britain, France, Germany, the European Union and United States are still negotiating details of the draft accord amid Western warnings that time is running out before the original deal becomes obsolete. Delegates say much of the text is settled but some thorny issues remain. 
The broad objective is to return to the original bargain of lifting sanctions against Iran, including ones that have slashed its crucial oil sales, in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear activities that extend the time it would need to produce enough enriched uranium for an atomic bomb if it chose to. 
Iran has breached many of those restrictions and pushed well beyond them in response to the U.S. withdrawal from the deal in 2018 and its reimposition of sanctions under then-President Donald Trump. While the 2015 deal capped uranium enrichment at 3.67% fissile purity, Iran is now enriching to up to 60%, close to weapons grade.
Iran insists its aims are wholly peaceful and that it wants to master nuclear technology for civil uses. But Western powers say no other state has enriched to such a high level without developing nuclear weapons and Iran's advances since the U.S. walkout mean the 2015 deal will soon be totally hollowed out.
The draft text of the agreement, which is more than 20 pages long, stipulates a sequence of steps to be implemented once it has been approved by the remaining parties to the deal, starting with a phase including Iran suspending enrichment above 5% purity, three diplomats familiar with negotiations said. 
The text also alludes to other measures that diplomats say include unfreezing about $7 billion in Iranian funds stuck in South Korean banks under U.S. sanctions, as well as the release of Western prisoners held in Iran, which U.S. lead negotiator Robert Malley has suggested is a requirement for a deal.
Only once that initial wave of measures has been taken and confirmed would the main phase of sanctions-lifting begin, culminating in what many diplomats call Re-Implementation Day - a nod to the original deal's Implementation Day, when the last nuclear and sanctions-related measures fell into place.
The duration of these phases has not yet been agreed, and the text includes an X for the number of days between the milestone days such as Re-Implementation Day, diplomats say. Various officials have estimated the time from an agreement until Re-Implementation Day at between one and three months.
Iran will return to core nuclear limits like the 3.67% cap on enrichment purity, diplomats said.
OIL WAIVERS
As in the original deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the new agreement entails the United States granting waivers to sanctions on Iran's lifeblood oil sector rather than lifting them outright. That requires renewing the waivers every few months.
""On oil exports, under the deal, (former U.S. President Barack) Obama and Trump used to issue 90- to 120-day waivers and renewed them consistently until Trump stopped after exiting the pact. Those waivers have been agreed to be issued again,"" a Middle Eastern diplomat briefed on the talks said.
Diplomats involved in the talks, which began 10 months ago, have said it remains unclear whether an agreement will indeed be reached, citing the now hackneyed principle that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. 
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Wednesday Iran must decide within a matter of days whether to take the leap, and other officials have said the next couple of days will be crucial.
Stubborn issues that remain include Iran's demand that the United States guarantee it will not withdraw again. Western officials say this is impossible to give an iron-clad assurance on given the difficulty in binding future governments. 
The Middle Eastern diplomat and an Iranian official indicated, however, that Tehran was prepared to accept a lesser measure - that in the event of a U.S. violation of the pact, Iran would be allowed to enrich to up to 60% purity again.

The Islamic Republic and Western powers have previously clashed over whether the U.S. withdrawal gave Iran the right to breach the deal under the original text, as Tehran did, as well as over what constitutes a breach.
The lifting of some particularly sensitive sanctions could also require Iranian and U.S. officials to meet directly, several diplomats have said. Iran has so far refused face-to-face meetings. Any such move would happen at the end of negotiations, the Iranian and Middle Eastern officials said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A single activist helped turn the tide against NSO Group, one of the world’s most sophisticated spyware companies now facing a cascade of legal action and scrutiny in Washington over damaging new allegations that its software was used to hack government officials and dissidents around the world.
It all started with a software glitch on her iPhone. 
An unusual error in NSO’s spyware allowed Saudi women’s rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul and privacy researchers to discover a trove of evidence suggesting the Israeli spyware maker had helped hack her iPhone, according to six people involved in the incident. A mysterious fake image file within her phone, mistakenly left behind by the spyware, tipped off security researchers.
The discovery on al-Hathloul's phone last year ignited a storm of legal and government action that has put NSO on the defensive. How the hack was initially uncovered is reported here for the first time.
Al-Hathloul, one of Saudi Arabia’s most prominent activists, is known for helping lead a campaign to end the ban on women drivers in Saudi Arabia. She was released from jail in February 2021 on charges of harming national security.
Soon after her release from jail, the activist received an email from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) warning her that state-backed hackers had tried to penetrate her Gmail account. Fearful that her iPhone had been hacked as well, al-Hathloul contacted the Canadian privacy rights group Citizen Lab and asked them to probe her device for evidence, three people close to al-Hathloul told Reuters.
After six months of digging through her iPhone records, Citizen Lab researcher Bill Marczak made what he described as an unprecedented discovery: a malfunction in the surveillance software implanted on her phone had left a copy of the malicious image file, rather than deleting itself, after stealing the messages of its target. 
He said the finding, computer code left by the attack, provided direct evidence NSO built the espionage tool.
“It was a game changer,” said Marczak “We caught something that the company thought was uncatchable.”
The discovery amounted to a hacking blueprint and led Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to notify thousands of other state-backed hacking victims around the world, according to four people with direct knowledge of the incident.
Citizen Lab and al-Hathloul’s find provided the basis for Apple’s November 2021 lawsuit against NSO and it also reverberated in Washington, where U.S. officials learned that NSO’s cyberweapon was used to spy on American diplomats.
In recent years, the spyware industry has enjoyed explosive growth as governments around the world buy phone hacking software that allows the kind of digital surveillance once the purview of just a few elite intelligence agencies.
Over the past year, a series of revelations from journalists and activists, including the international journalism collaboration Pegasus Project, has tied the spyware industry to human rights violations, fueling greater scrutiny of NSO and its peers.
But security researchers say the al-Hathloul discovery was the first to provide a blueprint of a powerful new form of cyberespionage, a hacking tool that penetrates devices without any interaction from the user, providing the most concrete evidence to date of the scope of the weapon.
In a statement, an NSO spokesperson said the company does not operate the hacking tools it sells – “government, law enforcement and intelligence agencies do.” The spokesperson did not answer questions on whether its software was used to target al-Hathloul or other activists.
But the spokesperson said the organizations making those claims were “political opponents of cyber intelligence,” and suggested some of the allegations were “contractually and technologically impossible.” The spokesperson declined to provide specifics, citing client confidentiality agreements. 
Without elaborating on specifics, the company said it had an established procedure to investigate alleged misuse of its products and had cut off clients over human rights issues.
DISCOVERING THE BLUEPRINT
Al-Hathloul had good reason to be suspicious - it was not the first time she was being watched. 
A 2019 Reuters investigation revealed that she was targeted in 2017 by a team of U.S. mercenaries who surveilled dissidents on behalf of the United Arab Emirates under a secret program called Project Raven (NASDAQ:RAVN), which categorized her as a “national security threat” and hacked into her iPhone.
She was arrested and jailed in Saudi Arabia for almost three years, where her family says she was tortured and interrogated utilizing information stolen from her device. Al-Hathloul was released in February 2021 and is currently banned from leaving the country. 
Reuters has no evidence NSO was involved in that earlier hack.
Al-Hathloul’s experience of surveillance and imprisonment made her determined to gather evidence that could be used against those who wield these tools, said her sister Lina al-Hathloul. “She feels she has a responsibility to continue this fight because she knows she can change things.” 
The type of spyware Citizen Lab discovered on al-Hathloul’s iPhone is known as a “zero click,” meaning the user can be infected without ever clicking on a malicious link.
Zero-click malware usually deletes itself upon infecting a user, leaving researchers and tech companies without a sample of the weapon to study. That can make gathering hard evidence of iPhone hacks almost impossible, security researchers say.
But this time was different.
The software glitch left a copy of the spyware hidden on al-Hathloul’s iPhone, allowing Marczak and his team to obtain a virtual blueprint of the attack and evidence of who had built it.
“Here we had the shell casing from the crime scene,” he said.
Marczak and his team found that the spyware worked in part by sending picture files to al-Hathloul through an invisible text message.
The image files tricked the iPhone into giving access to its entire memory, bypassing security and allowing the installation of spyware that would steal a user's messages.
The Citizen Lab discovery provided solid evidence the cyberweapon was built by NSO, said Marczak, whose analysis was confirmed by researchers from Amnesty International and Apple, according to three people with direct knowledge of the situation. 
The spyware found on al-Hathloul’s device contained code that showed it was communicating with servers Citizen Lab previously identified as controlled by NSO, Marczak said. Citizen Lab named this new iPhone hacking method ""ForcedEntry."" The researchers then provided the sample to Apple last September.
Having a blueprint of the attack in hand allowed Apple to fix the critical vulnerability and led them to notify thousands of other iPhone users who were targeted by NSO software, warning them they had been targeted by “state-sponsored attackers.”
It was the first time Apple had taken this step. 
While Apple determined the vast majority were targeted through NSO’s tool, security researchers also discovered spy software from a second Israeli vendor QuaDream leveraged the same iPhone vulnerability, Reuters reported earlier this month. QuaDream has not responded to repeated requests for comment.
The victims ranged from dissidents critical of Thailand's government to human rights activists in El Salvador.
Citing the findings obtained from al-Hathloul’s phone, Apple sued NSO in November in federal court alleging the spyware maker had violated U.S. laws by building products designed “to target, attack, and harm Apple users, Apple products, and Apple.” Apple credited Citizen Lab with providing ""technical information"" used as evidence for the lawsuit, but did not reveal that it was originally obtained from al-Hathloul's iPhone. 
NSO said its tools have assisted law enforcement and have saved ""thousands of lives."" The company said some of the allegations attributed to NSO software were not credible, but declined to elaborate on specific claims citing confidentiality agreements with its clients.
Among those Apple warned were at least nine U.S. State Department employees in Uganda who were targeted with NSO software, according to people familiar with the matter, igniting a fresh wave of criticism against the company in Washington.
In November, the U.S. Commerce Department placed NSO on a trade blacklist, restricting American companies from selling the Israeli firm software products, threatening its supply chain.
The Commerce Department said the action was based on evidence that NSO’s spyware was used to target “journalists, businesspeople, activists, academics, and embassy workers.” 
In December, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden and 17 other lawmakers called for the Treasury Department to sanction NSO Group and three other foreign surveillance companies they say helped authoritarian governments commit human rights abuses.

“When the public saw you had U.S. government figures getting hacked, that quite clearly moved the needle,” Wyden told Reuters in an interview, referring to the targeting of U.S. officials in Uganda.
Lina al-Hathloul, Loujain’s sister, said the financial blows to NSO might be the only thing that can deter the spyware industry. “It hit them where it hurts,” she said.

(Reuters) -Florida's House of Representatives passed a bill to ban abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy late on Wednesday, a measure several Republican-led states are pushing as the U.S. Supreme Court weighs the constitutionality of such limits.
The approval on a party-line 78-39 vote moments before midnight sent consideration of the legislation to the state Senate, which is expected to pass the measure in the near future. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has likewise signaled his support for the bill.
Enactment in the Tallahassee statehouse would significantly reduce access to late-term abortions for women across the U.S. Southeast, many of whom travel hundreds of miles to end pregnancies in Florida because of stricter abortion laws in surrounding states. 
Republican lawmakers around the country have introduced bills mirroring a 15-week abortion ban enacted by Mississippi in 2018 and now under review by the Supreme Court on appeal, after lower courts blocked the measure as unconstitutional. Arizona's Senate and West Virginia's House passed similar 15-week abortion bans on Tuesday.
The Supreme Court has indicated its willingness to allow Mississippi's law to stand, even though it conflicts with the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision establishing a woman's right to end her pregnancy before a fetus is viable, typically around 24 weeks. Besides seeking reinstatement of its abortion law, the state of Mississippi has asked the high court to overturn Roe v. Wade altogether.
Florida's measure makes exceptions to the 15-week rule only in cases when the mother is at risk of death or ""irreversible physical impairment,"" or if the fetus has a fatal abnormality. No exceptions for rape or incest are included.
Final action on the measure followed several hours of passionate debate between opponents and supporters of the bill.
Representative Robin Bartelman, a Democrat and self-described ""Catholic for choice,"" said the bill inserts the will of legislators into the most private of healthcare decisions, adding: ""I feel as a woman it is my right to make choices about my body.""
Republican David Borrero countered that Roe v. Wade was a fundamentally flawed ruling that should be overturned because it ""failed to recognize the humanity and the personhood of the unborn.""
The state currently permits abortions up to 24 weeks without a mandatory waiting period, meaning a woman can terminate her pregnancy the day she arrives at a clinic.
A 2017 survey by the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights advocacy research group, counted 65 abortion-providing sites in Florida that year, more than triple the number of any other state in the South.
""So a 15-week abortion ban would have a very big impact on access to care for Floridians and those in the South,"" Elizabeth Nash, a Guttmacher state policy expert, told Reuters.

Anti-abortion legislators hope the 15-week bans would withstand legal challenges as Mississippi's case is pending. The Supreme Court's ruling in that case is expected this spring. 
Florida's bill would take effect July 1 if enacted.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian leader Vladimir Putin has secured some wins in his confrontation with the West over Ukraine, but it's too early to discern an end to a crisis that could yet morph into a new Cold War even if conflict is averted, Kremlin watchers said.
The United States has rubbished Moscow's assertion it was partially pulling back troops massed near Ukraine, saying that Russia was instead still building them up and remained positioned for an imminent invasion if it chose.
Moscow, which denies that, accuses the West of ignoring its key security demands, but top diplomat Sergei Lavrov told Putin on Monday to allow more time for diplomacy even as Putin said he did not want to be dragged into tortuous negotiations.
For Putin, the procession of foreign dignitaries flying in for talks, including France's president, Germany's chancellor and two British ministers is already a win, pushing Moscow's security worries to the top of the world agenda.
""His biggest achievement is that he's got the West's attention,"" said Andrey Kortunov, head of RIAC, a think-tank close to Russia's foreign ministry. ""At least they are now fully aware of Russia's position and narrative... I think it's a major accomplishment and let's see what happens next and whether he can claim anything on top of that."" 
The West has dismissed as outlandish many of Moscow's security demands, which include a proposal for NATO to pull back its infrastructure to 1997 lines, to end the alliance's expansion and to declare a veto on Ukraine joining. 
But Washington has offered talks on some matters. 
U.S. President Joe Biden said on Tuesday that concrete ideas were on the table to ""establish a security environment in Europe"" involving new measures on arms control, transparency and strategic stability. 
""Of course this is not exactly what Russia wanted, but I think realistically speaking this is what Russia could have expected to get,"" Kortunov said. 
SANCTIONS, NATO UNITY
To be sure, Russia's build-up near Ukraine - which Biden estimated at more than 150,000 troops on Tuesday - has entailed reputational costs, galvanised NATO, and seen Ukraine receive a flood of military aid.

Worried by Russian moves, NATO has also deployed additional troops to Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and is drawing up plans for new combat units in central and southeastern Europe.
""As so often, their military intimidation has proven to be counterproductive and has only focused Western minds on the necessity to defend Europe against Russia. It has strengthened NATO unity,"" said Keir Giles, an associate fellow at Chatham House. 
DECISIVE WEEK
Tensions surged again on Thursday after Russian-backed rebels and Ukrainian forces traded accusations of firing shells across the ceasefire line in eastern Ukraine. Britain accused Russia of attempting to fabricate a pretext to invade.
This week is seen as a decisive moment that could take the crisis into a new phase.
Huge military exercises in Belarus, to Ukraine's north, are due to end on Sunday. Moscow continued to announce troop withdrawals from annexed Crimea on Thursday and the Kremlin rebuffed the West's scepticism, saying the process took time. 
""If we actually see the beginning of a troop withdrawal, then we'll be able to say this phase of the crisis is over. It's too early to relax,"" said Volodymyr Fesenko, head of the Kyiv-based Penta think-tank. 
Sir John Sawers, the former head of Britain's MI6 intelligence service, told the BBC on Wednesday that the crisis could be at a turning point, though he said Putin still had various military options in Ukraine. 
""I think in some ways, President Putin will think he's ahead on points on this,"" Sawers said. He listed Moscow's promotion of its security concerns, the intimidation of Ukraine and the highlighting of Europe's dependence on Russian natural gas. 
Putin this week gained a new tool to pressure Ukraine over the conflict in its east after Russian lawmakers asked him to recognise the independence of the Russian-backed breakaway regions there, analysts said. 
Recognising those self-proclaimed republics would derail the peace process based around the 2014-2015 Minsk agreements to end the fighting. 
A NEW COLD WAR? 
Fesenko said that, even if Russia did ease the crisis by pulling back troops now, Moscow could easily move them back again rapidly as it did last spring. 
He said that could entail the scenario of a kind of new Cold War opening up in which the tension and political confrontation is consolidated and becomes more constant. 

""I think this is the most likely because Putin can't retreat and he can't step back out of principle,"" he said. 
""The numbers could fluctuate, but troops would remain and the political confrontation remain. This of course will be a little different to what we had during the Soviet Union, but nevertheless this confrontation will be here for a fairly long time.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris will meet world leaders including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Munich this week, her highest-profile foreign trip yet, as the Biden administration tries to prevent a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Senior U.S. officials said on Wednesday they suspect Russia has increased its already heavy presence on the Ukraine border by up to 7,000 troops in the last few days, and they did not believe Russia's assertion it is withdrawing troops.
Harris will arrive at the Munich Security Conference on Friday. She also plans to meet German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, and the leaders of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, the officials said.
During her trip, a diplomatic test of her vice presidency, Harris will discuss a ""path to de-escalation"" in the Ukraine crisis, the officials said.
She will also discuss economic measures that would be deployed in the event of an invasion as well as America's readiness to further reinforce NATO allies on its eastern flank.
""She is not going with any deliverables per se because the key objective for her trip now is to focus on this fast-changing, evolving situation, the tremendous challenge that we are facing now,"" one of the officials said.
The Munich conference, launched by Western nations at the height of the Cold War to address military conflicts, takes place on Feb. 18-20. 
The U.S. officials did not say what contingency plans are in place should an invasion of Ukraine occur while Harris is overseas. ""We are in a fluid situation,"" one said.

White House officials say President Joe Biden's decision to send Harris to the Munich conference amid the tension over Ukraine demonstrates his confidence in her.
Harris has also sought to burnish her foreign policy credentials on previous trips to meet leaders in Central America, Asia and Europe.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Efforts to strengthen global health security will only succeed if the role of the World Health Organization (WHO) is enhanced, the agency's head said on Thursday, as its biggest donor, Washington, proposed a new global pandemic prevention fund.
Speaking via video link at a G20 meeting of finance leaders, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was responding to the idea of a separate global health fund tasked with delivering emergency funds, vaccines and other medical needs. 
""It's clear that at the centre of this architecture, the world needs a strong and sustainably financed WHO ... with its unique mandate, unique technical expertise and unique global legitimacy,"" Tedros told a panel in the Indonesian capital.
""Any efforts to enhance the governance, systems, and financing of global health security can only succeed if they also enhance WHO's role,"" he said.
During the discussion, Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza said, ""The WHO must remain at the centre of the global health architecture,"" adding, ""We need to work even more to create a stronger architecture on health policies.""
At a separate discussion, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urged G20 members to back the proposed fund for pandemic prevention and preparedness..
Seeking to dispel reservations raised by some among the world's 20 biggest economies, Yellen said it would not siphon off money needed to strengthen the WHO, or create a new multilateral body.
""We don’t see this as a pool of money that sits idly waiting to respond to the next pandemic,"" she said, adding that the new fund would spur investment in disease detection and surveillance systems against future crises.
World Bank Group President David Malpass told the same panel the agency was ""working rapidly on a new financial intermediary fund ... to increase financing for pandemic preparedness and response.""
Indonesia is the host of the G20 this year.
Last week, its health minister questioned if the WHO was best placed to raise capital for a global health fund required to deliver emergency aid, including money, vaccines and diagnostics, in a future pandemic.
Under the current system, said the minister, Budi Gunadi Sadikin, countries were ""basically on their own"" in securing vaccines and vital medical supplies.

Top WHO donor the United States is also pushing for the creation of a separate fund, directly controlled by donors, that would finance prevention and control of health emergencies.
Strengthening the global health architecture is one of President Joko Widodo's priorities during Indonesia's leadership of the G20.

The details of the incidents could not be independently confirmed, and the initial reports suggested they were on a similar scale to ceasefire violations that have been common throughout the eight year conflict.
But they come at a time of global concern over the prospect of a wider war, with more than 100,000 Russian troops near the Ukrainian frontier. Moscow denies it is planning an invasion and has said this week it is pulling back some troops, though Western countries say they are not convinced.
The separatists accused government forces of opening fire on their territory four times in the past 24 hours, while Ukraine accused the rebels of firing shells, including some that struck a kindergarten, causing shell-shock to two civilians.
A Reuters photographer in the town of Kadiivka in Ukraine's rebel-held Luhansk region heard the sound of some artillery fire from the direction of the line of contact but was not immediately able to assess the details of the incident.
Kyiv and its Western allies have repeatedly said in recent weeks that they believe Moscow could use an incident in the separatist conflict as justification for an invasion. Russia, for its part, has accused Kyiv of trying to provoke an escalation to recapture rebel territory by force.
A diplomatic source said a longstanding monitoring mission from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe had recorded multiple shelling incidents along the line of contact in the early hours of Thursday.
Since a 2015 ceasefire brought an end to major combat in the separatist conflict, the OSCE has typically reported dozens of ceasefire violations each day, with significant shelling or clashes leading to injuries or death several times a month.
The self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic, one of two rebel regions, said Ukrainian forces had used mortars, grenade launchers and a machine gun in four separate incidents on Thursday.
""Armed forces of Ukraine have crudely violated the ceasefire regime, using heavy weapons, which, according to the Minsk agreements, should be withdrawn,"" the separatists said in a statement.
Referring to the rebels, Ukraine's military said: ""With particular cynicism, the Russian occupation troops shelled the village of Stanytsa Lugansk in the Luhansk region. As a result of the use of heavy artillery weapons by terrorists, shells hit the kindergarten building. According to preliminary data, two civilians received shell shock.""

Russia's lower house of parliament voted on Tuesday to ask President Vladimir Putin to recognise the two self-proclaimed separatist republics as independent.
The Kremlin has signalled Putin has no immediate plans to do so.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's military has stepped up operations along the Afghan border in recent weeks after a spate of militant attacks that has dashed any hope the frontier might see more peace and stability after the end of the war in Afghanistan.
Islamist and separatist factions have killed at least 14 Pakistani soldiers in attacks over the past month, three of them carried out by fighters entering from Afghanistan, the Pakistani military said.
Afghanistan's new Taliban rulers, struggling with a humanitarian crisis, have denied that Afghan territory was used in any of the attacks.
But despite such assurances, disputes linked to the border, which has been a bone of contention between the neighbours for decades, could undermine their relations.
The Pakistani military said six insurgents were killed in the latest clash in the resource-rich southwestern province of Balochistan on Wednesday. 
""Operations to eliminate such perpetrators of terrorist acts in Pakistan will continue,"" the military said in a statement. 
A top Pakistani security official with direct knowledge of border operations told Reuters: ""We have stepped up intelligence-based operations to ensure that we deny entry to militants."" 
Large areas on the Pakistani side of the border were out of the control of the government for decades, ruled by fiercely independent Pashtun tribes, whose communities often straddle both sides of the unmarked border.
But Pakistan is determined to end all that, aiming to bring the rugged Pashtun lands under central rule and to demarcate the border with a fence, and control who comes and goes with a tight border-control system, another Pakistani official said.
""We're targeting anyone, whether separatists or Islamists militants, who is a threat,"" said the second official, who also declined to be identified.
'FRIENDS'
Pakistan has enjoyed good relations with the Afghan Taliban for years even though Pakistan was officially an ally of the United States during its 20-year occupation of Afghanistan.
But as Pakistan grapples with violence by Pakistani Islamists and separatists, its appeals to the Taliban to control their side of the border have not brought the action it hopes to see.
Increasingly frustrated, Pakistani officials have been pressing the Taliban to deny space and resources to the militants, an appeal repeated by National Security Adviser Moeed Yusuf when he visited Kabul last month.
Yusuf's office did not respond to a request for comment.
In Kabul, the Taliban reject suggestions Afghan territory is used for attacks into Pakistan and hope talks can solve the problem.
""We're trying to solve such actions through diplomatic ways,"" defence ministry spokesman Enayatullah Khowarazmi told Reuters.
The Taliban tried late last year to facilitate talks between Pakistan and an alliance of al-Qaeda linked militants known as the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), or Pakistani Taliban. But the talks fell apart after a few weeks.
Despite the frustrations, Pakistani officials rule out the chance of any serious deterioration in relations with the Afghan Taliban.
""We're budding friends,"" one of the officials said.
The Pakistani military's information office did not respond to a request for comment about the scope of its operations and what the military would do if the attacks from Afghan soil continued.
Another source of friction is Pakistan's determination to finish fencing the 2,600 km (1,615 mile) border that was drawn by British colonial rulers with no consideration for the Pashtun tribes it divided. It has never been recognised by any Afghan government.
Taliban fighters have at times stopped Pakistani forces from putting up the fence, just as forces of the old U.S.-backed Afghan government used to do.

Taliban Defence Minister Mullah Yaqoob says his government had not given anyone permission to fence the border. 
""We've not taken any decision about the fencing,"" he told Afghan state-owned RTA TV last week.

MOSCOW/KYIV (Reuters) - There is a growing Russian military presence at Ukraine's borders, Western countries warned on Wednesday, as Estonia said battle groups were moving ahead of a likely attack to occupy ""key terrain,"" contradicting Moscow's insistence of a pullback.
More armored vehicles, helicopters and a field hospital have been spotted, Britain's defense intelligence chief said in rare public comments. 
Up to 7,000 more troops have moved to the border in recent days, including some arriving on Wednesday, a senior official in U.S. President Joe Biden's administration said, without providing evidence. 
World powers are engaged in one of the deepest crises in East-West relations for decades, jostling over post-Cold War influence and energy supplies as Russia wants to stop Ukraine ever joining the NATO military alliance.
Western nations have suggested arms control and confidence-building steps to defuse the standoff, which has prompted them to urge their citizens to leave Ukraine because an attack could come at any time. Russia denies it has any plans to invade.
""There's what Russia says. And then there's what Russia does. And we haven't seen any pullback of its forces,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in an interview on MSNBC. 
""We continue to see critical units moving toward the border, not away from the border."" 
Estonian intelligence is aware of around 10 battle groups of troops moving toward the Ukrainian border, where it estimates about 170,000 soldiers are already deployed, said Mikk Marran, director general of the Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service.
The attack would include missile bombardment and the occupation of ""key terrain,"" he added. 
""If Russia is successful in Ukraine, it would encourage it to increase pressure on the Baltics in the coming years,"" he said. ""The threat of war has become the main policy tool for Putin.""
Russia's defense ministry said its forces were pulling back after exercises in southern and western military districts near Ukraine, and Moscow's ambassador to Ireland insisted forces in western Russia would be back to their normal positions within three to four weeks.
It published video that it said showed tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, and self-propelled artillery units leaving the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014.
But NATO military commanders are drawing up plans for new combat units that diplomats said could be deployed in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia. 
Such units - designed to buy time for additional soldiers to reach the front line if needed - already exist in Poland and the Baltic states.
Britain will double the size of its force in Estonia and send tanks and armored fighting vehicles to the small Baltic republic bordering Russia as part of the NATO deployment. 
'DAY OF UNITY' 
Ukraine also increased the number of border guards on its frontier with Belarus, Russia's ally, where some 9,000 Russian troops are estimated to be involved in military exercises.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who is criss-crossing the country to help bolster Ukrainians' morale, observed drills by his armed forces that included Javelin anti-tank missiles. 
Wednesday was designated a patriotic holiday in response to reports Russia could invade on that day. ""No one can love our home as we can. And only we, together, can protect our home,"" he said.
People raised flags and played the national anthem to show unity against fears of an invasion. 
The government said a cyberattack that hit the defense ministry was the worst of its kind the country had seen, pointing the finger at Russia, which denied involvement.
U.S. officials were as yet unable to say who was responsible, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said.
'MORE TROOPS ON WAY'
The risk of Russian aggression against Ukraine would remain high for the rest of February and Russia could still attack Ukraine ""with essentially no, or little-to-no, warning,"" according to a senior Western intelligence official. 
NATO said it could prove Russia's failure to pull back its soldiers with satellite imagery. ""More troops are on their way,"" said Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.
Moscow has accused the West of hysterical war propaganda after repeated warnings of a possible attack.
Russia sees Ukraine joining NATO as a threat to its security and has said it is ready to reroute energy exports to other markets if it is hit by sanctions, which Washington and its allies have threatened if it invades.
Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said sanctions against Russian banks would be ""unpleasant"" but the state would ensure all bank deposits and transactions were secured.
Despite the war of words, diplomatic efforts continue.
Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz underscored the ""importance of continued transatlantic coordination"" on a call on Wednesday, the White House said.
Ukraine has asked the U.N. Security Council to discuss on Thursday a bid by Russia's parliament to recognize self-proclaimed separatists. 

British foreign minister Liz Truss is due to visit Kyiv this week and Blinken will travel to Germany for the Munich Security Conference, which starts on Friday, to coordinate with allies. 
""The door continues to be open to diplomacy,"" said Psaki.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Police in the Canadian capital Ottawa on Wednesday warned truck drivers blockading the downtown core to depart or face arrest in crackdown seeking to end a three-week-old protest over COVID restrictions.
Interim Police Chief Steve Bell vowed ""to take back the entirety of the downtown core and every occupied space"" in ""coming days."" 
Federal Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino accused extremist groups of helping organize protests in Ottawa and at U.S. border crossings and repeated suggestions that some actors wanted to overthrow the Liberal government.
Police handed leaflets to truckers that said, ""You must leave the area now. Anyone blocking streets ... may be arrested."" Police also ticketed some of the hundreds of vehicles blocking Ottawa's downtown core. 
At least one large rig left while some demonstrators put the leaflets into a toilet placed in front of a truck. Some truckers blew their horns in violation of a court order forbidding such behavior.
Wendell Thorndyke, who has parked in front of parliament for 21 days, insisted he had no intention of leaving. ""We think it's cute. They turned all the cops into meter maids,"" he said as he filled his engine with oil.
In a video posted by CTV reporter Mackenzie Gray on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Tamara Lich, a prominent fundraiser for and organizer of the Ottawa protest, demanded an end to all state-of-emergency declarations, vaccine mandates and COVID-19 restrictions 
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday invoked the little-used Emergencies Act, giving the Liberal government more powers to end the protest.
Sources told Reuters that frustration with the failure of police to lift blockades at the border and in the capital ultimately drove Trudeau to seek emergency powers.
Mendicino said there were links between protesters in the capital and members of a far-right organization who were charged in an Alberta border blockade earlier in the week. 
Police arrested 13 people in the blockade at the town of Coutts, Alberta and seized weapons. Four members of the group have been charged with conspiracy to commit murder.
""What we're beginning to see emerge now are the hallmarks of a sophisticated and capable organization of a small number of individuals .... driven by an extreme ideology that would seek ... to overthrow the existing government,"" he said.
Mendicino spokesperson Alex Cohen said the minister was referring to the group Diagolon, which the Canadian Anti-Hate Network describes as a far-right network espousing conspiracy theories. A body armor vest seized by police in Coutts had a patch with Diagolon's emblem, a black background with a white diagonal stripe. 
""I hope he (Mendicino) was not referring to me or any of my friends because that would be extremely dangerous language,"" Jeremy MacKenzie, the group's de facto leader, told Reuters. 
""I think they are looking for a bogie-man to detract from the (protest) movement and what the convoy people are trying to achieve.""
Police in Windsor, Ontario said they intercepted a small convoy of trucks on Tuesday that they suspected wanted to reinstate a blockade on the Ambassador Bridge to Detroit, which is crucial to trade with the United States.
Protesters blocked the bridge for six days before being removed on Sunday. The incident prompted U.S. President Joe Biden to express his concerns to Trudeau. 
Canadian border guards on Wednesday turned back My Pillow founder Mike Lindell and a truck carrying 10,000 pillows for the protesters because he was unvaccinated and had not taken a pre-arrival COVID-19 test, a government source said.

In a telephone interview, Lindell, a vocal supporter of former U.S. President Donald Trump, denied he had been at the border. But he said his truck had obtained a permit and would try crossing again on Thursday.
""Tomorrow morning, we're coming across the border,"" said Lindell. ""And we'll be in Ottawa, we hope, by the afternoon delivering the pillows.""

ST. PAUL, Minn. (Reuters) -Two of the three former Minneapolis police officers on trial for violating George Floyd's civil rights testified on Wednesday that they deferred to their ex-colleague Derek Chauvin's years of seniority as he knelt on the handcuffed Black man's neck for more than nine minutes.
Taking the stand in his own defense, J. Alexander Kueng, told the jury that he was a rookie cop still on probation during the deadly arrest of Floyd, 46, on May 25, 2020, fearful of discipline or dismissal by his seniors.
He testified that the Minneapolis police academy had drilled into him a deeply hierarchical culture where the authority of senior officers such as Chauvin, who had been his field training officer earlier that year, was never to be questioned.
Earlier in the day, his co-defendant Tou Thao, 36, repeatedly told the jury in U.S. District Court in St. Paul he assumed Floyd must be fine and not in need of medical intervention because Chauvin was an experienced police officer. 
Chauvin, who is white, was sentenced to 22-1/2 years in prison for murdering Floyd in a separate state trial last year, and later pleaded guilty to the federal charges of violating Floyd's rights. The killing was captured on a widely seen cellphone video that also shows Thao stood nearby keeping increasingly alarmed bystanders up on the sidewalk while Kueng and their co-defendant Thomas Lane, 38, pin down Floyd's legs.
Prosecutors have said the defendants ignored both their own training and basic common sense, violating Floyd's right to not face excessive force or be denied medical aid in police custody.
Kueng, a 28-year-old Minneapolis native who described himself as mixed race, testified that he had received minimal police training on either the duty to intervene or the dangers of not moving a handcuffed prone person onto their side to make it easier for them to breathe.
He said he had been trained that an officer should intervene with a colleague when ""you see something obviously wrong,"" saying the examples he had been given were an ""officer kicking, punching or hitting a handcuffed subject, typically in the face.""
His lawyer Thomas Plunkett read aloud a section of the Minneapolis police training manual on following orders that ""instant and unquestioned obedience is demanded.""
""You don't think about it, you don't second guess it, you just follow it,"" Kueng said.
Kueng and Lane, another rookie only a few days out of field training, were the first to respond to the Cup Foods store where Floyd had been accused of passing a fake $20 to buy cigarettes.
Chauvin arrived with Thao as the two rookies struggled to get the handcuffed Floyd to stay in the back of their squad car.
""I've never been involved in a struggle like I had with Mr. Floyd,"" Kueng said, adding that seeing the arrival of Chauvin, his former trainer, made him think he was doing something wrong.
Chauvin was widely respected in the force, Kueng said.
""He was very quiet, but he had a high level of experience, he was by the book,"" Kueng said. ""He was upright, fair but tough.""
Kueng can later be seen on a body-worn camera video telling Chauvin he cannot find Floyd's pulse after Floyd has stopped moving, but he testified on Wednesday he mistakenly believed Floyd was still breathing when the ambulance arrived and so did not think there was a medical emergency.

His co-defendant Thao rejected the repeated suggestion by a prosecutor that he should have listened to shouted demands from bystanders for officers to get off an unconscious Floyd and to check his pulse.
""I don't take orders from them,"" he said, saying instead he deferred to Chauvin's authority. ""I think I would trust a 19-year veteran to figure it out.""

BOSTON (Reuters) -A private equity financier was sentenced on Wednesday to 15 months in prison for participating in a vast U.S. college admissions fraud scheme by conspiring to pay bribes to secure spots for his children at top schools.
The sentence imposed on John Wilson, the founder of Hyannis Port Capital, was the longest that any of the dozens of parents, coaches and other defendants charged in the ""Varsity Blues"" college admissions scandal have received to date.
U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton in Boston issued the sentence a week after sentencing another parent, former Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) executive Gamal Aziz, to a year in prison after both men were convicted in the first trial to result from the scandal.
Prosecutors argued Wilson, 62, deserved a longer sentence as his attempts at securing his children spots at the University of Southern California, Harvard, and Stanford with $1.2 million in bribe payments involved more extensive crimes.
""I hope you and others get the message and that you spend the rest of your life and considerable fortune making up your egregious conduct,"" Gorton said.
He also fined Wilson $200,000, ordered him to pay $88,546 in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service and required him to perform 400 hours of community service.
Defense lawyer Noel Francisco promised a ""powerful appeal"" of Wilson's conviction on bribery, fraud, tax and conspiracy charges.
Prosecutors allege that dozens of wealthy parents conspired with California college admissions consultant William ""Rick"" Singer to rig college entrance exams and secure the admission of students as fake athletic recruits through bribery.
Singer pleaded guilty in 2019. Thirty-six other parents charged in the case have pleaded guilty as well.
Prosecutors said Wilson in 2014 paid $220,000 to secure the admission of his son to USC as a water polo recruit.
About $100,000 went to a USC account controlled by Jovan Vavic, a water polo coach who took bribes to designate the children of Singer's clients as recruits, prosecutors said. Vavic faces trial next month on related charges and has pleaded not guilty.

Prosecutors said Wilson later in 2018 paid $1 million in bribes to have his twin daughters admitted to Harvard and Stanford as sailing recruits.
Wilson has denied wrongdoing, arguing he believed his money would be used for university donations. He apologized, though, ""for any negative effect my actions have had on the trust and confidence people have in the college admissions process.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A federal judge on Wednesday said he needs more time before ruling on whether right-wing Oath Keepers militia founder Stewart Rhodes should be released from jail as he awaits trial on a charge of seditious conspiracy for his alleged role in plotting the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. 
During a court hearing that lasted over 90 minutes on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said he wants pretrial services to vet a proposal by Rhodes' defense team for their client to live with third-party custodians before making a decision.
He added that even if he does let Rhodes out of jail before trial, he would not be allowed to hold down a job during the day or travel freely.
""If I were to release him, it would be under the same strict conditions, which is 24-hour house arrest, no access to the Internet,"" Mehta said. ""It would be about as strict as it gets, without being behind bars.""
Rhodes, 56, is the most high-profile defendant of the more than 725 people charged with playing a role in the attack by then-President Donald Trump's supporters. 
He is one of 11 members or associates of the Oath Keepers facing a seditious conspiracy charge.
He is accused of spearheading a conspiracy to block the certification of the presidential election by recruiting co-conspirators and even stationing armed ""quick-reaction force"" units outside of Washington to be ready to stop the peaceful transfer of power.
His attorneys disputed claims that Rhodes poses a danger and should be detained.
""There was no conspiracy to overthrow the government,"" Rhodes' attorney James Bright said.

Prosecutors argued on Wednesday that Rhodes poses a risk of flight and a threat. 
Even though Rhodes did not ultimately activate the quick-reaction forces that were staged outside the city, the intent to attack was there, federal prosecutor Kathryn Rakoczy said.

While such interactions are not rare between the United States and Russia, it comes at a particularly delicate time and amid a heightened concern about any accidents or miscalculations. 
Russian aircraft came close to three U.S. Navy P-8A while they were flying in international airspace over the Mediterranean.
""While no one was hurt, interactions such as these could result in miscalculations and mistakes that lead to more dangerous outcomes,"" Captain Mike Kafka, a Pentagon spokesman, said. 
A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said in one of the incidents the Russian aircraft came within several feet of one of the U.S. Navy planes. 
The interaction was first reported by CNN. 
While the United States has said it will not send U.S. troops to Ukraine if Russia invades Ukraine, Washington has sent thousands of additional troops to Eastern Europe to help reassure NATO allies. 
U.S. President Joe Biden warned on Tuesday that more than 150,000 Russian troops were still massed near Ukraine's borders.

The United States has a number of aircraft close to Ukraine, including those being used to collect intelligence on the Russian buildup.

BRUNSWICK, Ga. (Reuters) - The gunman convicted of murdering Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man in Georgia, repeatedly used racist language in text messages with friends, and also shared a music video of a white supremacist singer, jurors at his federal hate crimes trial heard on Wednesday. 
Travis McMichael, who along with his father and neighbor are on trial, left a racist digital footprint stretching back to at least 2013 and, in the case of the neighbor, continued even after the murder of Arbery, 25, in 2020, FBI agent Amy Vaughan, tasked with processing the digital evidence in the case, told jurors. 
Arbery's killing was one of several of Black men and women, often at the hands of police, that helped spark racial justice protests in recent years. The federal trial of Arbery's killers is the first in which those who carried out such a high-profile killing are facing a jury in a hate-crime trial.
McMichael, 36, claimed he shot Arbery in self-defense immediately after the incident, and local authorities made no arrests for 10 weeks, only doing so after a cellphone video of the killing made by Bryan emerged on social media, igniting widespread ire. 
Jurors in the coastal town of Brunswick (NYSE:BC) saw Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) posts that McMichael made lauding vigilantism, including one in which he said that he keeps his shotgun, which he used to murder Arbery, loaded with what he thought was a more powerful ""high-brass"" shell that would ""rip somebody to shreds."" 
Vaughan said that messages from McMichael, his father Greg McMichael and their neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan were extracted from their cellphones and Facebook profiles. Numerous messages were shown and read aloud to jurors. 
The FBI was not able to unlock Greg McMichael's iPhone -- the agency has often battled Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the encryption of its phones -- but Vaughan said the agency managed to retrieve some messages from his online phone backups. 
Travis McMichael, Gregory McMichael, 66; and Bryan, 52, were convicted by a state court last year and sentenced to life in prison for chasing Arbery through the streets of their mostly white neighborhood and shooting him dead. Prosecutors in the new federal trial say Arbery was targeted because he was Black. 
Defense attorneys for the three men said their clients were not motivated by Arbery's race, but rather by security fears after a series of break-ins in their Satilla Shores neighborhood. Prosecutors contend racial ill will was at the heart of the three men's actions when they pursued him while he was on a Sunday afternoon jog.
In one text message Travis McMichael sent to a friend, he discusses how happy he was to leave the Coast Guard and to be working as a government contractor, saying: ""Love it, zero niggers work with me."" 
In another instance, McMichael sent a video via Facebook message to a friend. Attached to the message was a song titled ""Alabama Nigger"" by Johnny Rebel, a recording artist whose work explicitly supported white supremacy. The song played over a video of a Black child dancing.

In text messages sent to a friend, Bryan said he was upset that his daughter had started dating a Black man, and in one text message he used a racial epithet to refer to the man. 
During the state trial last year, prosecutors did not focus on racial animus as a motivating factor in the crime. They only sought to prove the men were responsible for Arbery's death, regardless of motive.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Supreme Court dismissed an appeal by Bloomberg on Wednesday as judges ruled that a person under criminal investigation has in general a reasonable expectation of privacy until charged, a decision with far-reaching consequences for media reporting.
Some media groups said the ruling would curtail public interest journalism as it set such a high bar for privacy cases. 
Bloomberg reported in 2016 that a U.S. citizen who worked for a regional division of a listed company operating overseas had been interviewed by a UK law enforcement body as part of an investigation into allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption at the company.
The individual, named only as ZXC in the judgment, claimed he had a reasonable expectation of privacy and brought a claim for misuse of private information against Bloomberg - which competes with Reuters to deliver financial data and news - and sought damages. 
The investigation is ongoing and no-one employed by the company, referred to only as ""X Ltd"", has been charged with any offence, the Supreme Court said. 
Bloomberg's reporting, the Supreme Court said, had relied on a confidential letter of request sent by UK law enforcement to a foreign state that sought information about the individual. The letter was headed ""confidential"" and such letters are recognised as confidential by Britain's interior ministry, the court said.
Damages of 25,000 pounds ($34,000) were awarded by a different court in 2019 and a Bloomberg appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. Bloomberg appealed to the Supreme Court in Bloomberg LP v ZXC. 
""The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal,"" the court said in a summary. 
""It holds that, in general, a person under criminal investigation has, prior to being charged, a reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of information relating to that investigation.""
Judges Nicholas Hamble and Ben Stephens gave the judgment. President of the Supreme Court Robert Reed, Judge David Lloyd-Jones and Judge Philip Sales agreed with the judgment, the court said. 
Bloomberg said the decision would prevent reporters from doing their jobs because it removed appropriate scrutiny of companies and individuals. 
Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait wrote in an opinion piece that the court's decision ""should frighten every decent journalist in Britain"" as it would hinder reporting on potential wrongdoing by the rich and powerful. 
""There is no dispute about the truth of our reporting; instead, ZXC claimed that our article was an invasion of his privacy,"" Micklethwait wrote. 
The Society of Editors, which represents some British media organisations, said the judgment would have a chilling effect on public interest journalism.

""Not only does the ruling fundamentally go against the principle of open justice, but there is also a real risk that the bar is now so high for privacy cases that legitimate public interest journalism will go unreported,"" the Society said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ken Kurson, a former editor of the New York Observer newspaper who was pardoned in January 2021 by then-U.S. President Donald Trump, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to two misdemeanor charges after being accused of spying on his former wife by accessing her computer.
The 53-year-old Kurson entered his plea before state Supreme Court Justice Josh Hanshaft in Manhattan, according to the office of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.
Kurson had been charged last August with eavesdropping and computer trespass, both felonies, for using spyware to obtain his wife's passwords and access her Gmail and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) accounts between September 2015 and March 2016, around the time they were divorcing.
He agreed instead to plead guilty to attempting both crimes.
If Kurson completes 100 hours of community service and does not commit another crime within a year, he can withdraw that plea and instead plead guilty to second-degree harassment, a lower level misdemeanor, Bragg's office said.
A lawyer for Kurson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Kurson had also been charged in October 2020 by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn with cyberstalking three people, including at least one he blamed for the breakdown of his marriage.
Trump's pardon ended that case, but U.S. presidents cannot pardon people for state crimes.
""We will not accept presidential pardons as get-out-of-jail-free cards for the well-connected in New York,"" Bragg's predecessor Cyrus Vance said when bringing the state charges.
Kurson was the Observer's editor in chief from 2013 to 2017. The newspaper was once owned by Trump's son-in-law and Kurson's friend Jared Kushner, and endorsed Trump for president in 2016.

Bragg inherited a criminal investigation that Vance began into Trump and his business practices.
Vance also charged former 2016 Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who also received a presidential pardon, with mortgage fraud and other crimes. That case was dismissed last February on double jeopardy grounds.

(Reuters) - Sea levels around the United States will rise up to a foot over the next 30 years due to climate change, as much as they have risen in the previous century, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) projected in a report on Tuesday.
The forecasts that sea levels along the U.S. shoreline will rise 10-12 inches (25-30cm) on average by 2050. Sea levels will tend to be higher along the Atlantic and Gulf shores, because of greater land subsidence there, than along the Pacific coasts.
In addition to more frequent bouts of coastal inundation associated with storm surges, rising sea levels are leading to increasing episodes of flooding from high tides alone.
Damaging coastal floods typical of today's sea levels, weather conditions and infrastructure are expected to occur more than 10 times as often in the next 30 years, Nicole LeBoeuf, director of NOAA's National Ocean Service, said in a summary of the report.
""I can tell you with complete confidence that these are not the kind of changes that we grew up with,"" said LeBoeuf, a native of the Texas Gulf Coast.
The study, designed as a planning tool to mitigate and adapt to rising sea levels predicted, has a high degree of certainty over the next three decades, regardless of any efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet, NOAA officials said. But NOAA suggests additional sea level increases further into the future could be curtailed by tougher action to lower greenhouse gas emissions.
""This new data on sea rise is the latest reconfirmation that our climate crisis ⁠— as the president has said ⁠— is blinking 'code red,'"" Gina McCarthy, the White House national climate advisor to U.S. President Joe Biden, said in the study's summary.
Karen Collins, an assistant vice president for the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, said the NOAA report reflected insurer industry calls for stronger building codes and increased funding for mitigation efforts.
""Insurers are continuing to invest in better tools to help identify, predict and underwrite future catastrophe risk, and similarly underscore the important role state and local governments play in promoting responsible land use policies in high-risk areas, such as low-lying coastal areas at risk from sea level rise,"" Collins said.

The NOAA report, prepared in collaboration with several federal agencies, draws on a combination of tide gauge measurements, satellite observations and analysis from the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to determine sea level rise projections around the country.
NOAA officials said the report builds on and supports previous findings from the IPCC and other entities about sea level rise, which experts say is caused primarily by melting ice sheets and glaciers as global temperatures increase.

BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) -The relatively short shelf life of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc's COVID-19 vaccine is complicating the rollout to the world's poorest nations, according to officials and internal World Health Organization documents reviewed by Reuters. 
It is the latest headache to plague the COVAX vaccine-sharing project, co-led by the WHO and aimed at getting shots to the world's neediest people. 
Initially, poorer countries and COVAX lagged richer countries in securing vaccine supplies, as wealthier nations used their financial might to acquire the first available doses. 
As vaccine production ramped up and richer states began donating excess doses, some countries - particularly in Africa – are now struggling to administer the big shipments.
The need to turn down vaccines with short shelf lives, along with the initial inequality, hesitancy and other barriers, has contributed to a much lower vaccination rate in Africa where only around 10% of people have been immunised, compared with more than 70% in richer nations.
Many vaccines are arriving with only a few months, and sometimes weeks, before their use-by date, adding to the scramble to get shots in arms. Some countries have had to destroy expired doses, including Nigeria which dumped up to 1 million AstraZeneca vaccines in November. 
The problem with a short shelf life largely concerns AstraZeneca, according to COVAX data and officials.
An internal WHO document reviewed by Reuters detailing vaccine stocks in several central and west African countries for the week ending Feb. 6 highlighted the problem.
Most of the 19 listed African nations had expired AstraZeneca doses, compared to a handful of countries with expired doses from other manufacturers. Of the total expired doses declared by those countries in the week, about 1.3 million were AstraZeneca, 280,000 Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), 15,000  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and 13,000 Russia's Sputnik, the document shows.
Many more vaccines are expected to be rejected as African nations and COVAX said that from January they would not accept vaccines with less than two-and-a-half months' shelf life.
Yet Benin received 80,400 AstraZeneca doses from COVAX on Jan. 30, set to expire on Feb. 28. It also got 100,000 doses of the Sputnik Light vaccine from Russia, with the same expiry date - but outside the COVAX initiative. Vaccines from other manufacturers had a much longer shelf life, according to the document.
""Since January 2022, COVAX is shipping vaccines to countries on demand, ensuring that countries get the right volume at the right time,"" said Phiona Atuhebwe, a vaccine expert at WHO Africa.
Asked about the internal document, seen by Reuters, she said: ""WHO is fully cognizant of the pressure that short shelf life doses put on delivery strategies and systems amid weak infrastructure and low demand."" 
Two and a half months of shelf life is the minimum duration African countries reckon they need to administer the shots.
AstraZeneca, COVAX's second-biggest supplier after  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), said that since the start of the global rollout, more than 250 million of its shots left factories with less than two-and-a-half months before expiry.
Short shelf life is not generally a problem for a wealthy country with expertise and infrastructure. But without systems in place, it can be insurmountable. 
A spokesperson for Anglo-Swedish AstraZeneca said vaccines had to undergo scrupulous quality checks and pointed to the fact that the company was a major player in supporting vaccination drives in poorer nations. With donations from rich countries included, more AstraZeneca vaccines have been distributed by COVAX than any other shot. 
""AstraZeneca has supplied 2.6 billion vaccine doses globally, approximately two thirds of which have gone to low and lower middle-income countries,"" the spokesperson said.
""Almost nine out of 10 doses released from our manufacturing sites ready for donation have a shelf life of at least two and a half months which is consistent with the rest of our supply chains,"" the spokesperson added.
CLOCK TICKING
The volumes of delivered vaccines vastly outnumber wasted doses, but the losses have been substantial thanks in part to the time pressures. This has led to AstraZeneca shots being turned down even before being shipped.
Taking into account only donated doses, which represent nearly half the billion vaccines distributed by COVAX, about 30 million AstraZeneca shots were rejected or deferred last year by poor nations, said Gavi, the nonprofit that co-runs COVAX alongside the WHO. That amounts to a quarter of AstraZeneca's donated shots via COVAX.
Many were later re-assigned to other countries, Gavi added, noting that more than 95% of them were AstraZeneca. It did not say where to.
Millions of additional AstraZeneca doses shared by the EU, COVAX's biggest donor, have not been distributed yet, according to an EU internal document reviewed by Reuters. 
The main problem is the vaccine's shelf life of just six months from the date of bottling, the shortest among COVAX's top suppliers, several COVAX and EU officials told Reuters.
In addition, the company's quality checks can themselves sometimes take months.
COVAX's complex system to assign doses to countries, and donors' requests to deliver them to selected nations, often further eat into the vaccine's short life, leaving sometimes only a few weeks before they expire. 
Quality checks are conducted by all vaccine makers, but the time constraints are less of an issue for COVAX's other top suppliers. Johnson & Johnson's vaccines last two years when frozen, Pfizer's last nine months and Moderna's seven months, according to storage instructions approved by the WHO.
Millions of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines could also go wasted, some African countries warned in the WHO document, with the problem being linked usually to low vaccine uptake and insufficient cold-chain equipment to distribute these shots in remote regions.
EXTENDING SHELF LIFE
Gavi said it has encouraged AstraZeneca to apply to the WHO for an extension of the expiration date, but talks have not led yet to a formal application. AstraZeneca said the process is complex due to its vast global network of companies manufacturing its vaccine. 
One of its production partners, the Serum Institute of India, has been granted WHO approval for a nine-month shelf life, after it was initially authorised only for six. But other batches produced by AstraZeneca in the rest of the world have only six.
""We are currently in discussions with the World Health Organisation ... but this is a complex task which requires data to be collected from across our global manufacturing network,"" a spokesperson for AstraZeneca said.
A WHO spokesperson did not comment on the talks.

On average, African countries have used two-thirds of received doses, but that drops to 11% in Burundi and 15% in Congo, with other large countries, including Madagascar, Zambia, Somalia and Uganda, having used only about one-third, Gavi said, citing figures from late January. 
Gavi said the total wastage rate was around 0.3% of doses delivered by mid-December. It declined to share more updated figures, but said the rate was expected to rise.

UDUPI, India (Reuters) -Senior schools reopened in the Indian state of Karnataka on Wednesday a week after authorities closed them in the face of protests against a ban on female students wearing the hijab Muslim head covering in class.
A court is deliberating the recent ban on school girls wearing the hijab imposed by Karnataka authorities, the latest issue of contention involving India's Muslim minority, who make up about 13% of the Hindu-majority country's 1.35 billion people.
Protests against the ban by some Muslim students and parents earlier in the month drew counter protests by Hindu students who draped saffron-coloured shawls around their necks. That colour and garment is worn by Hindus.
The ban is on the wearing of the hijab in classrooms, not elsewhere on school premises. However, some schools have asked students and even some teachers to take off their hijab or the more enveloping burqa upon entering the school.
Students wearing olive-green uniforms, some in the hijab, walked hand-in-hand on Wednesday into the Government Girls Senior School P.U. in Udupi district, where the protests started this month. Male and female police stood guard.
All of the students were allowed, including the girls in hijabs, despite a ruling from the state's High Court considering the hijab ban last week that schools should bar all religious clothing in classrooms, including the saffron shawls worn by Hindus, until further instructions.
It was not clear if the students had to remove their hijabs before lessons started.
At a nearby government senior school, authorities waiting at the gate turned away a student after she refused to take off her black burqa. Reuters could not determine if the authorities had given her the option of taking off the burqa before heading to class.
""This is so unfair,"" student Afra Ajmal Asabi told reporters about the ban on the hijab.
""I don't know what will be the court judgement. If they allow us to (wear the hijab), we'll sit in class or we'll ... leave.""
The court is hearing further arguments on Wednesday. 
A lawyer for six Muslim students challenging the ban earlier told the court his clients had always covered their heads in class and they were seeking permission to keep wearing headscarves in the colours of their school uniforms.

The southern state of Karnataka is governed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and the uproar comes as it campaigns for several important state assembly elections this year.
Karnataka's state election will be held next year while India is due to hold its next general election by May 2024.

MOSCOW/KYIV (Reuters) -Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday called on the country's people to fly flags and sing the national anthem in unison on Feb. 16, a date that some Western media say Russian could invade.
Ukrainian government officials stressed that Zelenskiy was not predicting an attack on Wednesday, but responding skeptically to the foreign media reports.
""They tell us Feb. 16 will be the day of the attack. We will make it a day of unity,"" Zelenskiy said in a video address to the nation.
""They are trying to frighten us by yet again naming a date for the start of military action,"" Zelenskiy said. ""On that day, we will hang our national flags, wear yellow and blue banners, and show the whole world our unity.""
Zelenskiy has long said that, while he believes Russia is threatening to attack his country, the likelihood of an imminent invasion has been overstated by Western allies, responding to Moscow's efforts to intimidate Ukraine and sow panic.
Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskiy's chief of staff, told Reuters the president was responding in part ""with irony"" to media reports of the potential date of the invasion.
""It is quite understandable why Ukrainians today are skeptical about various 'specific dates' of the so-called 'start of the invasion' announced in the media,"" he said. ""When the 'start of the invasion' becomes some sort of rolling tour date, such media announcements can only be taken with irony.""
Zelenskiy's office released a decree calling for all villages and towns in Ukraine to fly the country's flags on Wednesday, and for the entire nation to sing the national anthem at 10 a.m. It also called for an increase in salaries of soldiers and border guards.
U.S. officials said they were not predicting an assault ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin on a specific day, but repeated warnings that it could come at any time.
""I won't get into a specific date, I don't think that would be smart. I would just tell you that it is entirely possible that he could move with little to no warning,"" Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) told reporters. Earlier, Kirby said Moscow was still adding to its military capabilities on the Ukrainian frontier.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington, which has already sent most of its diplomats home, was moving its remaining diplomatic mission in Ukraine from Kyiv to the western city of Lviv, much further from the Russian border. He cited a ""dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces"".
Blinken said Washington was offering Ukraine up to $1 billion in sovereign loan guarantees to calm markets.
The State Department issued a travel advisory recommending that U.S. citizens leave Belarus, which borders both Russia and Ukraine. 
Russia has more than 100,000 troops massed near the border of Ukraine. Russian political leaders deny Western accusations that it is planning to invade, but say it could take unspecified ""military-technical"" action unless a range of demands are met, including barring Kyiv from ever joining the NATO alliance.
Russia suggested on Monday that it would keep talking to the West to try to defuse the security crisis. 
In a televised exchange, Putin was shown asking his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, whether there was a chance of an agreement to address Russia's security concerns, or whether it was just being dragged into tortuous negotiations.
Lavrov replied: ""We have already warned more than once that we will not allow endless negotiations on questions that demand a solution today.""
But he added: ""It seems to me that our possibilities are far from exhausted ... At this stage, I would suggest continuing and building them up.""
Western countries have threatened unprecedented sanctions if Russia invades. The Group of Seven large economies (G7) warned on Monday of ""economic and financial sanctions which will have massive and immediate consequences on the Russian economy"".
After speaking with the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he still believed ""from his own analysis, his own hopes"" that there would not be a conflict, a U.N. spokesperson said.
Moscow says Ukraine's quest to join NATO poses a threat. While NATO has no immediate plans to admit Ukraine, Western countries say they cannot negotiate over a sovereign country's right to form alliances.
ECONOMIC DAMAGE
Ukraine has already suffered economic damage from the standoff. A surge in the price of 5-year credit default swaps on Ukrainian sovereign bonds suggested that markets gave Kyiv a 42% probability of defaulting.
Ukraine International Airlines, the nation's biggest airline, said its insurers had terminated coverage for some of its aircraft.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz held talks with Zelenskiy in Kyiv. Scholz is due to fly to Moscow on Tuesday, following visits by French President Emmanuel Macron and two British ministers went last week.

Scholz said he saw ""no reasonable justification"" for Russia's military activity on Ukraine's border, and that ""we are ready for a serious dialogue with Russia on European security issues"". He announced a credit of 150 million euros ($170 million) for Ukraine.

MOSCOW/BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has faced accusations of weak leadership in the Ukraine crisis and of being too soft on Russia, but his unexpectedly combative stance in talks in the Kremlin with President Vladimir Putin has earned him plaudits.
Political pundits wondered how the mild-mannered Scholz, who took office in December, would fare on Tuesday stepping into ""the lion's den"".
Russian officials have been known to publicly taunt or seek to outplay visitors in a test of their mettle. Putin invited his Labrador into a meeting in 2007 with Angela Merkel, Scholz's predecessor as chancellor, despite her well-known fear of dogs.
But while maintaining his trademark quiet, measured tone, Scholz also proved quite assertive at a joint news conference with Putin during a day-trip to Moscow that was part of frantic diplomacy to avert a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
When Putin criticised NATO, saying it had launched a war in Europe by bombing Serbia in 1999, Scholz hit back, saying this was done to prevent genocide, a reference to the persecution of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
Putin countered that Russia considered the treatment of ethnic Russians in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine to be genocide. In a solo news conference later, Scholz said Putin's use of the word genocide was wrong.
Scholz also poked fun at Putin's fears of NATO's eastern enlargement, given it was not on the agenda any time soon, and at the Russian leader's lengthy time in power.
""I don't quite know how long the president plans to stay in office,"" he said, with a grin towards Putin, who has led Russia as president or prime minister for more than two decades. ""I have a feeling this could be a long time, but not forever.""
Asked later by reporters about the jousting with Putin, Scholz smiled, saying this had given a flavour of what had been ""intense"" four-hour talks.
""In Moscow, Olaf Scholz finally puts his foot down,"" wrote Germany's top-selling Bild newspaper, which has been critical of the Social Democrat chancellor's performance.
Der Spiegel weekly said Scholz's trip had marked a ""kind of foreign policy emancipation"".
'BERLIN IS WAKING UP'
On the fundamental issue at stake, critics say Scholz still ceded too much to Russia by minimising the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO. His comment prompted Germany's ambassador to the United States, Emily Haber, to tweet a clarification that ""Ukraine has the sovereign right to seek NATO membership"".
Putin may also have chosen not to confront Scholz too aggressively as Russia still has comparatively close relations with Germany compared to those with other Western countries, said Marcel Dirsus, Non-Resident Fellow at the Institute for Security Policy at Kiel University.
However, the mere fact of the Moscow visit, along with Scholz's performance, suggest, Dirsus added, that ""Berlin is waking up, they've realised this is a serious situation one can't sit out, and their inaction is interpreted as indirect support for Moscow. And they've toughened their stance.""
Scholz also voiced concerns at the joint news conference about human rights and media freedoms in Russia, and the first question went to a journalist from Deutsche Welle travelling in his delegation. The Kremlin said this month it was shutting the German channel's Moscow operations down.
Scholz later met various Russian activists.
His more assertive tone could go some way to restore his credibility as a player in Europe. French President Emmanuel Macron had taken the lead lately on the Ukraine crisis in Europe with a Moscow visit, albeit with mixed results.

Gwendolyn Sasse, senior fellow at Carnegie Europe, said it was also important that Scholz demonstrated he was speaking for Europe, not just Germany. He headed to Moscow only after meeting in person with the leaders of France, Poland, the Baltic states, and Ukraine. Macron had visited Moscow before going to Kyiv.
""He will have delivered the message that Europe is united,"" Sasse said. ""And that's exactly what the Kremlin doesn't want.""

Moscow announced a partial pullback of forces from near Ukraine on Tuesday. The move was met with scepticism, however, and U.S. President Joe Biden said that more than 150,000 Russian troops were still amassed near Ukraine's borders.
World powers are engaged in one of the deepest crises in East-West relations for decades, jostling over post-Cold War influence and energy supplies as Moscow wants to stop the former Soviet neighbour ever joining the NATO military alliance.
On Wednesday morning, video footage showed what the defence ministry said were tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and self-propelled artillery units leaving the Crimean peninsula that Moscow seized from Kyiv in 2014. 
""Combat equipment and military personnel will be delivered by military trains to the units' permanent deployment points,"" the defence ministry said. ""Upon arrival, the equipment will be serviced and prepared for carrying out the next phase of combat training.""

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Frustration with the failure of Canadian police to lift blockades at the border and in the capital, along with scenes of protesters lounging in hot tubs near Parliament, ultimately drove Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to seek emergency powers, three sources said on Tuesday.
Trudeau on Monday invoked the little-used Emergencies Act, signaling the federal government was taking control of a situation local and provincial police have struggled to resolve as protests against pandemic restrictions dragged on. 
Discussions on invoking the rarely used powers first began on Thursday as the blockade of the Ambassador Bridge, a key U.S.-Canada trade artery between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, entered its third day, two of the sources, who are familiar with the discussions, said. 
""The Windsor police kind of let it happen,"" one of the sources said. All requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation. Windsor police asked for more resources, which the province provided.
The bridge blockade led to the temporary shutdown of several car plants before police finally cleared it on Sunday after six days, and after a concerned call from U.S. President Joe Biden to Trudeau. 
Meanwhile, protesters who had paralyzed parts of Ottawa since Jan. 28 were getting more entrenched, and there was growing concern about the presence of ""nefarious elements"" among the protesters. Police in Alberta later seized guns and ammunition from a group linked to a border protest. 
""The prime minister was quite mad,"" said a government source, referring to a Thursday meeting of the federal Incident Response Group, made up of Trudeau's top advisers. ""He said we need to get out in front of this.""
""He was demanding solutions"" at the meeting, a third source familiar with the matter said, adding Trudeau was saying: ""Let's put everything on the table and say, what are the good ideas here?"" 
The third source said the government realized last week that ""enforcement wasn't happening"" after initially waiting to see how provincial authorities and local police responded. 
""He also needed to know fully that ... we have given it enough time for it to work or not work, or partially work, and think about what more we need to do,"" the source said. ""He didn't want to jump ahead of things that were happening."" 
Ottawa police initially said their objective was to de-escalate. Later they asked both the provincial and federal governments for more resources, saying they were outnumbered. 
The addition of chaotic scenes from Ottawa on the weekend, including hundreds of residents turning out to block another convoy from joining the protesters, proved too much, two of the sources said.
Police stood by as protesters bathed in a hot tub and partied into the night directly in front of parliament and below the prime minister's office.
""This past weekend in Ottawa really drove some people over the edge, the hot tub, the stage, and ... the impotence of the police to do something about it,"" the source said.
Police chief Peter Sloly resigned on Tuesday amid criticism of his force's performance, city officials said on Tuesday. 
The Ottawa protest involves some 360 trucks and vehicles, several hundred protesters, and a large cache of funds from donors in the United States and Canada.
""If you're asking for one factor, it was Ottawa ... the Ottawa situation is completely out of control. We just went through a third weekend of no enforcement,"" said the second source.
Concerns that protesters may re-occupy border crossings and disrupt crucial trade flows with the United States and affect publicly safety also factored into the decision, the sources said. 
Another factor was the specter of violence when police in Alberta on Monday arrested 11 people and seized guns and ammunition. 
""There are organized nefarious elements that are involved with these things,"" said the second source, citing the Alberta gun seizure.
""There's an element here that is ... trying to subvert the normal course of our democracy, which has to be protected, regardless of who's the government,"" the third source said.

""That's really the difference between this and other protests that we've seen.""

468,"<span>Feb 16, 2022 06:31AM ET</span>","WELLINGTON (Reuters) - An anti-vaccine mandate protest outside New Zealand's parliament swelled in numbers on Wednesday, with hundreds of people ignoring a warning from police that their vehicles would be towed away if they did not leave voluntarily. 
Inspired by truckers' demonstrations in Canada, protesters have blocked several roads around Wellington's 'Beehive' parliament for nine days with trucks, vans and motorcycles, and camped out on the lawns in front of the distinctive building.
""There has been an influx of protesters at Parliament today, including children. However, the crowd had been orderly,"" Assistant Police Commissioner Richard Chambers told reporters, estimating there were about 450 vehicles blocking the site.
""This is a very complex situation and we are mindful of the tactics we need to take so that the situation is not escalated,"" Chambers added.
Police gave protesters an ultimatum on Tuesday to move out or officials would start towing and seizing vehicles. 
Chambers said on Wednesday police had made some progress in engaging with protest leaders and about a dozen vehicles had left voluntarily. 
The protest started as a stand against COVID-19 vaccine mandates but those demonstrators have been joined by groups calling for an end to pandemic restrictions as well some drawing attention to other social issues like censorship and rights of the ethnic Maori community. At the peak of the protest, thousands of demonstrators were estimated to be involved.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has referred to the demonstrations as an ""imported"" phenomenon and rejected calls to remove all restrictions at a time New Zealand is experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases due to the Omicron variant. 
New daily cases are at a pandemic peak, with more than 1,100 reported on Wednesday after some restrictions were eased this month. 

A country of five million people, New Zealand has some of the lowest COVID-19 case numbers in the world, largely due to tough coronavirus border curbs and social restrictions. It has reported a total of around 22,300 infections, including 53 deaths. 
The country's borders are still closed, with tens of thousands of expatriate New Zealanders cut off from families.

TAPACHULA, Mexico (Reuters) -A dozen undocumented migrants on Mexico's southern border sewed their mouths shut on Tuesday in a bid to convince the country's immigration authority to grant them passage toward the U.S. border.
The migrants, mostly Central and South Americans, helped each other seal their lips using needles and plastic threads, leaving a small space to consume liquids and using alcohol to wipe away drops of blood from the stitches, Reuters images show.
""The migrants are sewing their lips together as a sign of protest,"" said Irineo Mujica, an activist at the demonstration. ""We hope that the National Migration Institute can see that they are bleeding, that they are human beings.""
Mexico's migration agency (INM) said in a public statement that ""it is worrying that these measures have been carried out with the consent and support of those who call themselves their representatives, with the intention of pressuring authorities on an attention already provided.""
Some were carrying their children when they staged the dramatic protest in Tapachula, a border city with Guatemala, which for months has been filled with thousands of migrants waiting for papers to be able to freely cross the country.
""I'm doing it for my daughter,"" said Yorgelis Rivera, a Venezuelan. ""She has not eaten anything in the last few hours and I see no solution ... from the authorities.""
""We are like prisoners here,"" Rivera said, adding she has been waiting for a response from Mexico's migration agency for more than a month.
The agency said it continues to attend cases, adding priority is has been given to those who make up vulnerable groups, such as children, adolescents, pregnant women, victims of crime, people with disabilities and the elderly.
The institution said it receives more than a hundred applicants at their offices in the southern city every day.

In recent years, the number of migrants arriving in Mexico fleeing violence and poverty has jumped. In 2021, Mexico recorded an 87% increase in the number of asylum applications, mainly from Haitians and Hondurans.
The United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) recently said Mexico should consider new aid programs amid a surge in the arrival of foreigners, many of them Venezuelans, for whom Mexico now requires a visa.

(Reuters) - Remington Arms will pay $73 million to the families of five children and four adults killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, the families said on Tuesday, marking the first time a gunmaker has agreed to a major settlement over a mass shooting in the United States. 
Twenty students and six adults were killed on Dec. 14, 2012, in Newtown, Connecticut, by gunman Adam Lanza, who used a Remington Bushmaster AR-15 rifle to shoot his way into the Sandy Hook Elementary School after killing his mother at home. 
Remington Arms will pay $73 million to the families and release all the discovery and disposition material to the public. The settlement will be paid through insurance policies, lawyers for the families said in a statement. 
""Today marks an inflection point when our duty of care to our children as a society finally supersedes the bottom line of an industry that made such an atrocity like Sandy Hook possible,"" said Veronique De La Rosa, whose son Noah was killed in the shooting, during a news conference. 
Attorneys for Remington Arms did not respond to a request for comment. 
The nine families sued in 2014 and spent years in the courts trying to hold Remington liable, despite a U.S. law that protects gunmakers and dealers from most civil litigation and two bankruptcy filings by Remington.
The Sandy Hook families found a way around that legal protection for gunmakers by claiming that Remington's marketing of firearms contributed to the massacre.
""These families would do everything to give it all back for just one more minute. That would be true justice,"" said Josh Koskoff, an attorney for the families. 
Koskoff said the case focused on the marketing of the gun, the AR-15, which was originally made for combat and for decades only appealed to small civilian market. 
After the Cerberus private equity firm bought Remington in 2007, it launched aggressive campaign that pushed sales of AR-15s through product placement in first-person shooter videogames and by touting the AR-15 as an effective killing machine, Koskoff said.
Sales rose from 100,000 AR-15 in 2005 to 2 million in 2012, Koskoff added.
MASS SHOOTINGS CONTINUE
The settlement with Remington comes as the United States continues to be marred by mass shootings and gun violence.
A government-funded research project released in February found that of all the mass shootings that took place between 1966 and 2019, more than half took place since 2000, with 20% of them occurring between 2010 and 2019.
Gun control advocates have been encouraged by the Sandy Hook legal strategy, including New Jersey's attorney general, who is investigating Smith & Wesson's marketing.
Mexico filed a U.S. lawsuit last year seeking $10 billion from several gunmakers, accusing them of marketing their weapons to the country's gangs.
New York last year enacted a law that allows firearm sellers, manufacturers and distributors to be sued for creating a ""public nuisance"" that endangers the public's safety and health. Gun manufacturers have challenged the law in court.

Gun advocacy groups have also been using the courts and state legislatures to expand gun rights and have scored victories at the Supreme Court in 2008 and 2010 that established an individual's right to keep a gun at home for self-defense.
(This story officially corrects to show the case was on behalf of five children and four adults after an initial press statement about the settlement said five adults and four children)

KYIV/MOSCOW/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Kyiv appeared to blame Russia for a cyber attack on Tuesday as U.S. President Joe Biden warned that more than 150,000 Russian troops were still amassed near Ukraine's borders after Moscow's announcement of a partial pullback was met with scepticism. 
World powers are engaged in one of the deepest crises in East-West relations for decades, jostling over post-Cold War influence and energy supplies as Moscow wants to stop the former Soviet neighbour ever joining the NATO military alliance.
Western nations have suggested arms control and confidence-building steps to defuse the standoff, which has prompted them to urge their citizens to leave Ukraine because an attack could come at any time. Russia denies it has any plans to invade. 
On Tuesday, the Russian defence ministry published footage to demonstrate it was returning some troops to base after exercises. Biden said the United States had not verified the move. ""Our analysts indicate that they remain very much in a threatening position."" 
Hours after Moscow's announcement, Ukraine said the online networks of its defence ministry and two banks were overwhelmed in what is called a distributed denial-of-service. The manoeuvre works when hackers flood a network with unusually high volumes of data traffic to paralyse it.
Although Kyiv did not name who was behind the incident, a statement suggested it was pointing the finger at Russia. 
""It is not ruled out that the aggressor used tactics of dirty little tricks because its aggressive plans are not working out on a large scale,"" said the Ukrainian Centre for Strategic Communications and Information Security, which is part of the culture ministry.
Ukrainian bank Privatbank users reported problems with payments and a banking app, while Oshadbank said its systems had slowed down.
Russia's Federal Security Service did not immediately reply to a request for comment from Reuters. 
""If Russia attacks the United States or our allies through asymmetric means like disruptive cyber attacks against our companies or critical infrastructure, we're prepared to respond,"" Biden said in televised remarks from the White House.
One European diplomat said the hacking was concerning because a full military attack on Ukraine would likely be preceded by a cyber attack.
""It could mean a physical attack is imminent, or it could mean Russia is continuing to mess with Ukraine,"" the diplomat said, on condition of anonymity. While such attacks are difficult to attribute, the diplomat said there was no doubt that Russia was behind them. 
'MEANINGFUL DE-ESCALATION'
The White House said energy prices could be hit if sanctions are imposed on Moscow following an invasion as diplomatic efforts continued on Tuesday to resolve the crisis. 
Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on a call that there needed to be ""verifiable, credible, meaningful de-escalation"" by Moscow.
Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron discussed their readiness to hit Russia with ""severe consequences"" over the crisis. 
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said there ""are signs from Moscow that diplomacy should continue"" but also that Russia often left military equipment behind after exercises, creating the potential for forces to regroup.
At a joint news conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Russian President Vladimir Putin referred only briefly to the troop moves.
Putin told reporters Russia would not be satisfied with talk that Ukraine was not ready to join NATO any time soon and was demanding that the issue be resolved now.
""As for war in Europe... about whether we want it or not? Of course not. That is why we put forward proposals for a negotiation process, the result of which should be an agreement on ensuring equal security for everyone, including our country,"" he said.
Russia has been pressing for a set of security guarantees from the West and says it can exercise troops on its own territory as it sees fit. 
Russia's show of force near Ukraine's borders has prompted months of frantic Western diplomacy and drawn threats of severe sanctions if it invades.
The Kremlin sought to portray its moves as proof that Western talk of war had been both false and hysterical.
""February 15, 2022 will go down in history as the day Western war propaganda failed. Humiliated and destroyed without a single shot fired,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.
The defence ministry published footage showing tanks and other armoured vehicles being loaded onto railway flatcars. Western military analysts said they needed more information to judge the significance of the latest troop movements.
Commercial satellite images taken on Sunday and Monday showed a flurry of Russian military activity at several locations near Ukraine.
Russian shares, government bonds and the rouble rose sharply on hopes the situation was easing, and Ukrainian government bonds rallied. Major stock indices rose in the United States and Europe.

Oil tumbled over 3%, retreating from a seven-year high. 
""The situation is very fluid, but today is definitely a calmer day,"" said Robert Yawger, executive director of energy futures at Mizuho. ""It's going to be a minute-to-minute, day-to-day type of thing.""

472,"<span>Feb 15, 2022 08:15PM ET</span>","(Reuters) -Novak Djokovic is prepared to miss the French Open and Wimbledon rather than have a COVID-19 vaccination but is not an anti-vaxxer, the world number one said in his first interview since his failed attempt to play at the Australian Open.
After an 11-day rollercoaster involving two visa cancellations, two court challenges and five nights in two stints at an immigration detention hotel, the unvaccinated Djokovic was deported before the tournament began.
The debacle deprived the 34-year-old the chance to win a record-extending 10th Australian Open and a men's record 21st Grand Slam title.
Instead career-rival Rafa Nadal won the title and moved to 21 and with Djokovic unwilling to have a vaccine limiting where he might be able to play, the Serb is jeopardising his dream of ending his career with the most Grand Slam titles.
""I understand the consequences of my decision,"" Djokovic told the BBC, adding that he had been prepared not to travel to Australia due to his unvaccinated status.
""I understand that not being vaccinated today, I am unable to travel to most of the tournaments at the moment. Yes, that is the price that I'm willing to pay.
""Because the principles of decision making on my body are more important than any title or anything else.""
Encouragingly for Djokovic's hopes of trying to defend his French Open and Wimbledon titles, travel rules in France and Britain have been eased for unvaccinated travellers and they no longer need to undergo quarantine.
His prospects of playing in the United States, including the U.S. Open, look bleak at the moment, however, as vaccination certificates remain compulsory.
Defending his right to shun vaccines, Djokovic, who follows a strict diet, said: ""I just don't have enough clarity of how the COVID vaccine will affect me and whether it's going to create a certain effect on my game and I wouldn't have the benefits that I would normally have.""
However, he said he respected the global vaccine programme and did not entirely rule out having a jab in the future.
""I understand that globally, everyone is trying to put a big effort into handling this virus and seeing, hopefully, an end soon to this virus,"" he said.
""As of today this is kind of my decision and my stance and I know I will suffer the consequences. I keep my mind open and you know, we'll see what happens.""
MELBOURNE SAGA
Djokovic fuelled widespread anger in Australia when he was given a medical exemption from mandatory COVID-19 vaccination to compete at Melbourne Park on grounds that he had recently contracted the virus.
But he was detained by immigration authorities on arrival, released by a court order and then detained again before eventually being deported.
The case stoked global debate and Australian Immigration Minister Alex Hawke said Djokovic could be a threat to public order in the country because his presence would encourage anti-vaccination sentiment.
""I have never said I am part of that movement. No-one in the whole process, during Australian saga has asked me for my stance or opinion on vaccination. No-one,"" Djokovic, who insists he had followed all the rules in travelling to Australia, said.
""I was really sad and disappointed with the way it all ended for me in Australia.
""The reason why I was deported from Australia was because the Minister for Immigration used his discretion to cancel my visa based on his perception that I might create some anti-vax sentiment in the country or in the city, which I completely disagree with.""
He did apologise for meeting a French journalist for an interview before leaving for Australia, having already had a positive COVID-19 test result, saying suggestions he did not take the virus seriously were wrong.
""Should I have advised them? Absolutely. It was my mistake and I own it.""
Djokovic, who is set to return to action in Dubai next week, was also asked about his time in the detention hostel.
""Definitely it wasn't pleasant, but I don't want to be sitting here and complaining because I stayed around seven days and some people there have stayed for years. It has deeply touched me.
""My hardship was nothing close to what these people are going through.""

Djokovic also said he had found it hard to watch the final.
""I didn't want to watch the match because I wanted to be on the court,"" the Serb said. ""I was very neutral, I didn't cheer for anyone as I wanted to be there so badly.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden made an impassioned appeal to Russian President Vladimir Putin to step back from war with Ukraine on Tuesday, speaking starkly of the ""needless death and destruction"" Moscow could cause and international outrage Putin would face.
In a nationally televised speech, Biden said the United States estimates that 150,000 Russian troops now encircle Ukraine, a higher number than previous estimates of about 100,000. He said reports that some forces had withdrawn were welcome, but they were unverified and an invasion remained very much a possibility.
Biden said diplomacy remains a live option to wind down the crisis and urged Russia to engage. If Russia invades Ukraine, the United States and its allies are prepared to respond with penalties aimed at exacting economic pain and global isolation, he said.
""The United States is prepared no matter what happens,"" he said.
Much of Biden's remarks were aimed squarely at Putin, who has demanded that NATO not accept Ukraine as a member and stop any further eastward expansion. Biden's threats of repercussions for Russia have yet to persuade Putin to back down.
""The United States and NATO are not a threat to Russia. Ukraine is not threatening Russia. Neither the U.S. nor NATO have missiles in Ukraine. We do not, do not have plans to put them there as well. We are not targeting the people of Russia. We do not seek to destabilize Russia,"" said Biden.
The American president also appealed directly to Russian citizens.
“To the citizens of Russia: you are not our enemy, and I don’t believe you want a bloody, destructive war against Ukraine,"" Biden said. 
The human and strategic costs would be “immense” for Russia if it attacks, he said. ""The world would not forget that Russia chose needless death and destruction,"" Biden said. 
The president said the United States is ""not seeking direct confrontation with Russia"" and that American soldiers were not going to fight in Ukraine. But, he said if Russia were to attack Americans in Ukraine, ""we will respond forcefully.""
He warned that a Russian invasion would cause ""consequences here at home,” including energy costs. 
The speech came on a day that Ukraine said it had been hit by a cyberattack and appeared to blame Russia.
Biden issued a warning for Russia not to engage in cyberattacks.
""If Russia attacks the United States or our allies through asymmetric means like disruptive cyberattacks against our companies or critical infrastructure, we're prepared to respond,"" he said. 
NEW ARMS CONTROL, NATO UNITY 
Biden spoke to Putin on Saturday and with Ukraine President Volodomyr Zelenskiy on Sunday, and has warned repeatedly of steep costs for Moscow, including sanctions against Russian businesses and oligarchs. But he has laid out a road map for a peaceful resolution, including talks on missile deployments and military exercises to try to reduce tensions in the region. 
The United States ""has put on the table concrete ideas to establish a security environment in Europe. We’re proposing new arms control measures, new transparency measures, new strategic stability measures,” that apply to NATO and Russia alike, he said on Tuesday.
In his speech, Biden said the United States and its NATO allies are prepared for whatever happens.
""We are ready to respond decisively to a Russian attack on Ukraine, which remains very much a possibility,"" Biden said.
Reports that Russia had withdrawn some military units ""would be good but we have not yet verified that,"" he said.

""Indeed, our analysts indicate that they remain very much in a threatening position,"" he said, citing ""more than 150,000 troops encircling Ukraine and Belarus and along Ukraine’s border."" 
""An invasion remains distinctly possible,"" Biden said.

OTTAWA/CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) -Ottawa's police chief resigned on Tuesday after criticism that he did not do enough to stop COVID-19 protests that have paralyzed Canada's capital city and forced Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to invoke emergency powers. 
A trucker-led movement calling on the government to lift vaccine mandates has occupied parts of downtown Ottawa since late January and blocked U.S. border crossings, inspiring similar protests around the world even as Canada moves to lift some health restrictions.
Protesters retreated from the Ambassador Bridge to Detroit and two other crossings after threats of fines and jail time. But hundreds of trucks are still blocking downtown areas, raising questions over Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly's handling of the crisis.
Diane Deans, chair of the Ottawa police board, said the city had reached ""mutually agreeable separation"" with Sloly, without saying why he had stepped down. 
Critics alleged he was too permissive toward protesters who at the peak of their movement had parked 4,000 trucks and vehicles near Canada's parliament, prime minister's office and other government buildings. 
In a statement announcing his resignation, Sloly said he had done ""everything possible to keep this city safe and put an end to this unprecedented and unforeseeable crisis."" His defenders had voiced fears the use of force by police could stoke violence.
Trudeau sought on Monday to beef up policing by invoking the Emergencies Act, which empowers his government to cut off protesters' funding and reinforce provincial and local law enforcement with federal officers. 
'OUR RIGHT TO PROTEST'
Protesters blocked the Ambassador Bridge, a vital trade corridor between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit and a choke point for the region's automakers, for six days before police on Sunday cleared those who ignored orders to retreat. 
Two other U.S. crossings reopened Tuesday after police cleared protesters from one and demonstrators voluntarily left the other, officials said. People blocking a fourth crossing in Manitoba province were expected to leave by Wednesday, police said. 
Protesters decided to leave the crossing in Coutts, Alberta, after the Royal Mounted Canadian Police seized weapons from a group that had aimed to cause harm if officers started clearing people, the town's mayor, Jim Willett, said. 
""The federal government will have to look at protecting borders very differently than they have in the past to stop this from happening again,"" Willett said. 
With new COVID-19 cases falling, Canada's health ministry said on Tuesday it would ease entry for fully vaccinated international travelers. But officials deny they are loosening curbs to appease protesters, saying instead that the limits are no longer needed to contain infection.
In downtown Ottawa, protesters camping out in frigid temperatures vowed to defy Trudeau's emergency orders until their demands for a lifting of all pandemic-era mandates are met.
""It's our right to protest. We're not doing anything wrong,"" said Gord, a trucker from Manitoba who is parked in front of parliament. He declined to give his last name. ""We're not leaving. We've dug in this long.""
EMERGENCY MEASURES, FINANCING
Trudeau activated the Emergencies Act after concluding that law enforcement could not cope with the protesters, especially in Ottawa. He says the measures, which require parliamentary approval, will be limited and targeted.
""This illegal occupation needs to end ... the measure of success will be, can we get our supply chains back? Can we end the disruption to livelihoods of people who rely on trade to the United States?"" Trudeau told reporters.
The emergency measures bring crowdfunding platforms under terror-finance oversight and authorize Canadian banks to freeze accounts suspected of financing the protesters, who officials say have received about half their funds from U.S. supporters.
A U.S.-based website, GiveSendGo, became a prime conduit for money to the protesters after mainstream crowdfunding platform GoFundMe blocked donations to the group. 
An Ontario court last week ordered GiveSendGo to freeze all funds supporting the blockade, but it said it would not comply.

The leak website Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDoS) has leaked GiveSendGo donor files relating to the Canadian protests, known as the ""Freedom Convoy"" campaign. DDoS said on Sunday the campaign had raised more than $2 million in donations. 
DDoS leaked donor information related to a similar campaign on Tuesday.

(Reuters) - P.J. O'Rourke, the American journalist, political satirist and best-selling author who rose to fame as editor-in-chief of the now-defunct humor magazine National Lampoon, has died at the age of 74.
Grove Atlantic, a New York-based publisher of his books, confirmed that he passed away Tuesday morning after a battle with lung cancer.
""P.J. was one of the major voices of his generation. He was also a close friend and partner for more than 40 years,"" said Grove Atlantic CEO and publisher Morgan Entrekin, adding that O'Rourke played a key role in helping the company stay independent.
""His insightful reporting, verbal acuity and gift at writing laugh-out-loud prose were unparalleled.""
Patrick Jake O'Rourke authored more than 20 books whose topics included politics, economics and cars. Two of them topped the New York Times Bestsellers list: ""Parliament of Whores,"" in which he used humor to explain the innerworkings of Washington, D.C., and ""Give War a Chance,"" a book about international conflict and crisis.
His work also appeared in publications like Rolling Stone, The Atlantic Monthly, Vanity Fair and The Daily Beast, among others. 
After growing up in Toledo, Ohio and graduating from Miami University in Ohio, O'Rourke left the Midwest for the East Coast to attend Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. He launched his writing career at small newspapers in Baltimore and New York.
O'Rourke joined National Lampoon in the early 1970s and later assumed the roles of managing editor and editor in chief. Later in his career he was the H.L.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Andrew has settled a U.S. lawsuit by Virginia Giuffre accusing him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager, potentially sparing him further embarrassment in a lurid case that helped precipitate his fall from grace.
The settlement, which includes an undisclosed payment, was revealed on Tuesday in a filing in Manhattan federal court, where Giuffre had sued the Duke of York last August. The prince did not admit wrongdoing in the settlement.
Giuffre's case had focused on Andrew's friendship with the late Jeffrey Epstein, the financier and sex offender who she said also sexually abused her. The filing said Andrew regrets his past association with Epstein. 
In the joint filing, lawyers for Giuffre, 38, and Andrew, 61, said their settlement in principle calls for the prince to make a ""substantial donation"" to Giuffre's charity in support of victims' rights.
""Prince Andrew has never intended to malign Ms. Giuffre's character, and he accepts that she has suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks,"" the filing said.
Andrew has denied accusations that he forced Giuffre, who now lives in Australia, to have sex at age 17 more than two decades ago at the London home of Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's mansion in Manhattan and Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
A trial in the case had been expected to begin late this year. Andrew would have had to give testimony under oath.
""It is known that Jeffrey Epstein trafficked countless young girls over many years,"" the filing said. ""Prince Andrew regrets his association with Epstein, and commends the bravery of Ms. Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others. He pledges to demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims.""
'QUESTION MARK'
The statement represented a marked departure from a 2019 BBC interview in which Andrew, who is Queen Elizabeth's second son, failed to show sympathy toward Epstein's victims and refused to apologize for his friendship with the financier.
The royal family in January removed Andrew's military titles and royal patronages and said he will no longer be known as ""His Royal Highness.""
Andrew was defending against Giuffre's lawsuit as a private citizen. For now, his legal exposure in the United States to similar claims appears to be over.
Penny Junor, a British royal biographer, called the settlement a ""prudent"" means to limit further damage to the royal family, but that Andrew's reputation will likely be permanently scarred.
""I fear there is no chance he will come back to public duties,"" Junor said. ""A question mark will always hang over him.""
Buckingham Palace declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the prince declined to comment beyond the court filing. A lawyer for Andrew did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
David Boies, a lawyer for Giuffre, said: ""This event speaks for itself.""
Andrew faces no criminal charges, and none will result from Giuffre's lawsuit because it was a civil case.
The office of U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in Manhattan has been investigating Epstein's sex trafficking and considered Andrew at least a potential witness, or ""person of interest https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/prince-andrew-a-person-interest-epstein-probe-source-2021-08-16.""
Andrew had previously declined the office's interview requests, former U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said in June 2020, the month before Maxwell's arrest.
A spokesman for Williams did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
GIUFFRE 'FEARED DEATH'
In court papers in the lawsuit, Giuffre said she ""feared death or physical injury to herself or another and other repercussions for disobeying Epstein, Maxwell and Prince Andrew due to their powerful connections, wealth and authority.""
She also said that in Manhattan, Maxwell forced her to sit on Andrew's lap as he touched her, and Andrew forced her to engage in sex acts against her will.
U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan refused to dismiss Giuffre's lawsuit last month, without ruling on its merits. He also said it was premature to decide whether Giuffre's 2009 civil settlement with Epstein also shielded Andrew. Epstein had paid Giuffre $500,000 to end her Florida lawsuit accusing him of sexual abuse, without admitting liability.
Andrew's lawyers had contended that Giuffre's lawsuit was ""baseless"" https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/prince-andrew-seeks-dismissal-accuser-giuffres-lawsuit-2021-10-29 and that she was seeking ""another payday,"" after also receiving ""millions of dollars"" in a 2017 settlement of her civil defamation lawsuit against Maxwell.
Epstein killed himself at age 66 in a Manhattan jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

Maxwell, 60, was convicted in December of recruiting and grooming underage girls for Epstein to abuse between 1994 and 2004. She is seeking a new trial https://www.reuters.com/world/us/some-ghislaine-maxwell-jurors-initially-doubted-accusers-juror-says-2022-01-05.
Giuffre sued Andrew less than a week before the expiration of a New York state law providing a two-year window to sue over child abuse dating back decades.

ST PAUL, Minn. (Reuters) -Tou Thao, one of three former Minneapolis police officers on trial for violating George Floyd's civil rights, told a jury on Tuesday he did not realize Floyd was dying as an officer knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes.
Testifying in his own defense at a federal trial that hinges on when police should intervene in colleagues' misconduct, Thao said he assumed Floyd's heart must still be beating because he never saw the other officers try to revive the 46-year-old handcuffed Black man, as their training demanded.
Thao, 36, is accused with J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane of willfully violating Floyd's right to receive medical care as he lay dying, unable to properly breathe facedown beneath the knee of their former colleague, Derek Chauvin. Thao and Keung face a second count of depriving Floyd of his rights in their roles as government officials by failing to stop Chauvin's use of excessive force.
Cellphone video of the arrest on May 25, 2020, led to protests against racism and police brutality around the world. Chauvin, who is white, was convicted of Floyd's murder last year at a separate state trial. 
Thao took the stand in U.S. District Court in St. Paul to convince jurors that he handled a chaotic scene in accordance with his training and with concern for the well-being of Floyd and the arresting officers. His testimony marks the first extensive public comment by any of the officers involved in the arrest. His two co-defendants say they will also testify.
Thao can be seen on videos a few steps away from Floyd, keeping back horrified onlookers who scream at police to check Floyd's pulse as he falls unresponsive. The arrest occurred outside a grocery store where the man was accused of using a fake $20 bill. 
Questioned by his lawyer, Robert Paule, Thao said he believed that Chauvin and the other two officers, who were pinning down Floyd's legs, were checking Floyd's pulse, and was falsely reassured by seeing none of them stop to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
""Logically, if they're not doing CPR, I assume he's still breathing and fine,"" Thao testified, agreeing with his lawyer that police are trained to start CPR as soon as possible if they cannot find a pulse. 
Floyd received no medical aid until after his limp body was lifted into an ambulance, several minutes after he fell unresponsive.
Thao testified that he had confirmed with other officers that an ambulance had been called, and saw his role as a ""human traffic cone,"" making sure oncoming traffic steered clear.
Jurors watched video from Thao's body-worn camera that shows Thao arriving to find Kueng and Lane struggling to get a handcuffed Floyd to stay in the back of a police car. Floyd screams repeatedly that he is claustrophobic and cannot breathe.
""Not to besmirch, but I've never seen this much of a struggle,"" Thao testified, saying he had been an officer for eight years by that time. ""It was obvious that he was under the influence of some kind of drugs."" 
He said Floyd was incoherent and impossible to calm, and he feared the man might be having a dangerous reaction to drugs. A medical examiner, who ruled that Floyd was killed by the police restraint and neck compression, found fentanyl and methamphetamine in Floyd's blood.
Thao said it was normal during training sessions to see an officer using a knee near the neck to pin down a person they were arresting. Jurors were shown photographs of Thao and his classmates using such restraints.
""Were you ever instructed that using knees was improper technique?"" Paule asked his client.
""No,"" Thao replied. 
Over three weeks of witness testimony, prosecutors have sought to show the jury that all three men were well trained in their duty of care to the public. In cross-examination by prosecutor LeeAnn Bell, Thao agreed on Tuesday that he had an obligation to intervene if he saw a crime, and that it was a crime for a police officer to use excessive force.
""You don't get a pass just because you're a police officer, right?"" Bell asked. Thao agreed.
A POOR UPBRINGING
Thao told the jury he grew up in a poor, refugee household: His parents, members of the Hmong ethnic group, fled to Minnesota from Laos. 

He said he was inspired to become an officer when, as a child, he let Minneapolis police into his house to arrest his father for threatening Thao and his mother with a gun. 
According to court filings based on police records, Thao was cited at least seven times while being trained in the field over several months in 2012 for shirking his duties, sometimes pretending not to see violations of the law in order to minimize his workload.

478,"<span>Feb 15, 2022 04:22PM ET</span>","ROME (Reuters) - Italy's Constitutional Court on Tuesday turned down a request to hold a national referendum on the right to die after proponents of the move collected over a million signatures in support.
Italian right-to-die advocates seek to partly abrogate sanctions imposed on those who assist in the suicide of patients who have incurable illnesses or suffer intolerable pain and have already had palliative care.
In a statement, the Constitutional Court said repealing punishments would not safeguard the minimum constitutional standards governing the protection of human life, ""particularly for the weak and the vulnerable"".
In 2019, the court partially decriminalised assisted suicide under certain conditions if local health authorities and an ethics board approved, but it also advised that parliament should pass a law regulating the practice.
Marco Cappato, one of the leading advocates of a referendum, said the court's decision was ""a bad news for those who suffer and will have to (face) even longer unbearable suffering against their will"".
Right-to-die proponents last year collected more than twice the 500,000 signatures needed to seek approval of a referendum.
Parliament is debating a law that would allow terminally ill patients to seek assisted suicide through the national health system and protect doctors from any legal suits against them.
""The Constitutional Court's decision must push parliament to approve the law on assisted suicide,"" Enrico Letta, leader of the centre-left Democratic Party (PD), wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 

Italian political parties remain deeply split on the issue, with the centre-left generally supporting it and the centre-right opposed. Pope Francis recently condemned assisted suicide as an unacceptable deviation from medical ethics.
A poll by the SWG research group in 2019 showed 92% of Italians who were asked said they were in favour of allowing assisted suicide and euthanasia. Some 45% said they favoured it generally and 47% were in favour in certain situations.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia's lower house of parliament voted on Tuesday to ask President Vladimir Putin to recognise two Russian-backed breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent and the European Union told Moscow not to follow through. 
The move by the State Duma, if approved, could further inflame a wider standoff over a Russian military build-up near Ukraine that has fuelled Western fears that Moscow could attack. Russia denies any invasion plans and has accused the West of hysteria. 
Recognition of the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics could kill the Minsk peace process in eastern Ukraine, where a conflict in the region known as Donbass between government forces and Moscow-backed separatists has cost 15,000 lives.
""Kyiv is not observing the Minsk agreements. Our citizens and compatriots who live in Donbass need our help and support,"" Vyacheslav Volodin, the State Duma speaker, wrote on social media.
Volodin, a member of the pro-Putin ruling United Russia party, said the appeal would be sent to the Kremlin immediately. It was not clear how long the Kremlin would take to review it. 
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told reporters: ""If the decision on recognition is taken, Russia will de facto and de jure withdraw from the Minsk agreements with all the attendant consequences."" 
At a news conference in Moscow, Putin declined to be drawn out on how he plans to respond. He said Russians were sympathetic to the residents of the Donbass region, but he wanted the regions' problems to be resolved through the Minsk accords. 
Using stark language that Germany's visiting Chancellor Olaf Scholz dismissed as ""wrong"", the Kremlin leader said Russia considered the treatment of ethnic Russians in the Donbass region as ""genocide"". 
Moscow casts the conflict in east Ukraine as a civil war, but Ukraine and the West say Russia helps the separatists with its own ground forces, something Moscow denies. 
Russia has issued more than 700,000 passports to residents of eastern Ukraine since separatists seized territory there in 2014 shortly after Russia annexed Crimea, souring relations with Kyiv and the West. 
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on the substance of the parliament's appeal, saying that no decision had been taken on it. But he added that the pro-Russian separatist region was a matter of great concern for Russians. 
He said that Russia had repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to the Minsk peace process and that it still wanted it to be implemented. 
The European Union's top diplomat warned Moscow against recognising the regions, saying it would be a clear violation of the Minsk agreements and that Brussels supported Ukraine's independence and sovereignty.
Recognising the regions is one of several options that Russia ""want to have in place in order not to cramp their style when they choose to respond to whatever the U.S. may do over the next few days,"" said Keir Giles, an associate fellow at Chatham House. 

Four-way peace talks between Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany were held last week but ended without a breakthrough. 
After the talks, Ukraine said it would not yield to pressure from Moscow to negotiate directly with the separatists, while Russia accused Kyiv of putting forward absurd proposals.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -The family of a woman killed during filming of the Western ""Rust"" filed a wrongful death suit against actor Alec Baldwin and others on Tuesday, claiming they disregarded several industry-wide practices meant to keep movie sets safe.
The suit was filed in Santa Fe County, New Mexico, on behalf of Matthew Hutchins, husband of late cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, and the couple's 9-year-old son. 
""The lawsuit names Alec Baldwin and others who are responsible for the safety on the set and whose reckless behavior and cost-cutting led to the senseless and tragic death of Halyna Hutchins,"" attorney Brian Panish told a news conference in Los Angeles.
Halyna Hutchins was killed and director Joel Souza was wounded when a gun Baldwin was using during a rehearsal fired off a live bullet. The movie was being filmed at Bonanza Creek (NYSE:BCEI) Ranch in New Mexico.
The ""30 Rock"" and ""Saturday Night Live"" actor has said he was told the gun was ""cold,"" an industry term meaning it is safe to use, and that he did not pull the trigger. Baldwin's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.
Panish said Baldwin bore ""a significant portion of liability"" because he was holding the weapon that killed Hutchins. 
The attorney showed an animated recreation of what he believed happened inside the church where actors were filming when the shooting occurred. He said he did not believe the weapon was defective.
""The gun cannot fire unless the trigger is engaged and the hammer is back,"" Panish said. ""So he had the gun. He says he pulled the hammer back. It fired. She was killed."" 

The incident is still under investigation by New Mexico authorities. No criminal charges have been filed.
The wrongful death suit named about two dozen defendants in addition to Baldwin, including armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed and assistant director David Halls. Representatives for Gutierrez Reed and Halls did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's constituent assembly began formally debating on Tuesday motions for a new Constitution to replace a market-focused one dating back to the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet, a text that could reshape the world's top copper-producing nation.
Embryonic plans to nationalize mining, the creation of a one-chamber Congress, water rights, and protections for indigenous territories are some of the more edgy motions the assembly will discuss and vote on in over 20 plenary sessions.
""In this period we are going to see what is really going to remain in the proposed Constitution,"" said constituent assembly president Maria Elisa Quinteros, noting that the text would face a nationwide referendum planned for September.
The new Constitution - which comes as Gabriel Boric, a 36-year-old leftist former student protest leader, is set to take office as president in March - could mark the Andean country's most dramatic political and social shift since its return to democracy in 1990.
The new Constitution has sparked jitters among investors and mining firms, raising a challenge to the country's market-oriented economic model, which dates back to the so-called Chicago Boys economists during the time of Pinochet's bloody military rule.
On the discussion list are water and property rights, central bank independence, and labor practices. Other themes include animal rights, feminist education, protection of the natural world, and the legalization of cannabis.
The proposals will be debated in coming months and will need approval by two-thirds of delegates, some 103 votes. If approved they would face a process of modifications before a second definitive vote to be included in the final text. If rejected they would go back to the commission to be revised or discarded.
The potential for sharp shifts in the country has caused some alarm among conservatives, though Quinteros sought to allay fears, saying there had been lots of ""misinformation"" around the process and that the motions were at an early stage.
But those fears have seen some loss of support for the process, with a survey from private pollster Cadem showing that the proportion of people who currently intended to vote to approve the new Constitution had fallen to 47% from 56%.
The constitutional body, elected last year, is dominated by independent and left-leaning representatives, some with roots in the 2019 protest movement that broke out over inequality in one of the region's wealthiest countries.

Kenneth Bunker, director of consultancy Tresquintos, said this was an important moment for ""concerns"" to be raised to avoid ""wacky"" motions moving forward and undermining trust in the process. But Bunker still thought the new constitution would eventually pass, though it would create a challenge for Boric's new government.
""In the short term, the government of Gabriel Boric, if this Constitution comes to pass, will have a real challenge to balance the social infrastructure with the political and economic situation in Chile today,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. federal judges were the target of more than 4,500 threats and other inappropriate communications last year, the head of the U.S. Marshals Service said on Monday, adding that his office is concerned about the rise of domestic extremism in America.
""The increase in our judicial ... threat investigations and inappropriate comments have been going up quite frankly for a couple of years,"" Ronald Davis, director of the U.S. Marshals Service, told journalists in a conference call. He said the threat risk is ""growing exponentially.""
Federal law enforcement officials have sounded alarm bells about a growing tide of threats posed by white supremacists and anti-government activists, many of whom have touted former Republican President Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was stolen.
Earlier this year, Attorney General Merrick Garland launched a task force aimed at combating threats targeting state election workers and volunteers, an effort that so far has led to two criminal cases. 
Garland has also instructed the FBI to work with local officials to monitor an increase in threats to school boards, which have faced an onslaught of criticism over issues ranging from mask mandates to the teaching of critical race theory.
The threats to judges were varied and in some cases came from disgruntled defendants, Davis said.

In one example, a self-described anti-feminist attorney in 2020 shot and killed the son of federal judge Esther Salas at her home in New Jersey. In the attack, Roy Den Hollander also wounded Salas's husband. Hollander was later found dead in an apparent suicide in upstate New York.
The U.S. Marshals Service is tasked with protecting courts across the country's 94 federal district courts, in addition to transporting prisoners and helping to locate fugitives.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Russian teenager Kamila Valieva dominated the Olympic ice on Tuesday night, fighting back tears as she completed a skate that put her at the top of the short programme standings with a doping cloud hanging over her.
The 15-year-old has been engulfed by a doping scandal in Beijing, but was cheered by spectators as she took to the ice for first time since news of her failed drugs test.
For two minutes and 40 seconds, millions around the world watched her every move, her music, In Memoriam by Kirill Richter, almost drowned out by the clicking of cameras.
Valieva tested positive for a banned heart drug after the national championships on Dec. 25, but the result was not revealed until Feb. 8, after she and her Russian Olympic Committee team mates had competed in the team competition in Beijing.
After dazzling the fans with a near-perfect free skate on Feb. 7, Tuesday's routine got off to a less than perfect start.
Valieva had been expected to execute three high-flying triple jumps. But in front of her coach Eteri Tutberidze and doctor Filipp Shvetsky, also now in the harsh spotlight, she stumbled on the opening triple Axel - having fallen twice as she attempted that jump during afternoon practice.
Alina Zagitova and Evgenia Medvedeva, gold and silver medallists at the previous Winter Games in Pyeongchang who were also trained by the formidable Tutberidze, were also watching from the stands at the Capital Indoor Stadium.
Valieva, wearing a flowing crystal-encrusted purple dress, completed her triple Lutz-triple toeloop combination, but her score of 82.16 way was below the 90.18 score she got at the team event.
RUSSIAN SWEEP HOPES
Such is her dominance, however, that it was still enough to put her ahead of fellow Russian Anna Shcherbakova, the world champion, on 80.20, and third-placed Kaori Sakamoto of Japan with a score of 79.84.
Alexandra Trusova, also representing the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC), was fourth earning a score of 74.60, leaving the 'Quad Squad' with hopes of a medals sweep by the Russians, the first in women's figure skating history at the Olympics.
It would also be Tutberidze's personal hat trick as she also trains the 17-year-olds Shcherbakova and Trusova.
Valieva did not attend the post-event news conference while Shcherbakova declined to comment on her team mate's situation.
The leading skaters progress to the free skate on Thursday, where no medals will be awarded if Valieva, whose positive drug test has cast a shadow over the entire Beijing Games, finishes in the top three.
""I feel sorry for anyone who gets on the podium. They won’t get that experience, and it is such a big part of the Olympic Games - to get the medals,"" said British skater Natasha McKay.
""I can only speak for myself and that I advocate for clean sporting,” said U.S. skater Mariah Bell.
""That’s the whole idea of the Olympics and our careers, in general.""
Valieva was cleared to compete by sport's highest court, but will not face a hearing for her doping charge until well after the end of the Games. Olympic officials cannot award the medals until the doping case is resolved.

Her defence argued in the Court of Arbitration for Sport that her positive test was caused by a mix-up with her grandfather's heart medication, an IOC official said.
The banned drug is meant to treat chest pain but can add to an athlete's endurance.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva has argued that her positive drug test was caused by a mix-up with her grandfather's heart medication, an Olympic official said on Tuesday.
The 15-year-old's defence was revealed as Beijing braced for an unprecedented Olympic moment - the world's top figure skaters will compete in the evening's single competition with the likelihood they will not receive medals at the Winter Games.
Denis Oswald, the International Olympic Committee's permanent chair of the disciplinary commission, said Valieva claimed there was a mix-up at a Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) hearing into whether she should be allowed to continue competing.
""Her argument was this contamination happened with a product her grandfather was taking,"" Oswald said. 
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), IOC, Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) and Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) did not immediately respond to Reuters emails after Oswald's comments.
The Russian teenager was cleared by CAS to compete in the women's single event after a panel of three judges agreed with RUSADA's decision to lift a ban on her. 
CAS, however, did not address the merits of her drug case, which now awaits a RUSADA hearing that is not expected until well after the Winter Games end.
Valieva was tested at her national championships on Dec. 25, but the positive test for the banned angina drug trimetazidine was not revealed until Feb. 8, after she had already competed at the Beijing Games in the team event. 
WADA has questioned why the Russian anti-doping authority took so long to report the result.
'B' SAMPLE NOT TESTED
Earlier, Oswald said in a press conference that Valieva's ""B"" sample had yet to be analysed, despite the initial positive result.
Under anti-doping rules, an athlete's urine is tested twice. If an athlete's 'A' sample is positive for a banned substance the testing lab must inform the authority responsible for the sample. In the case of Valieva, that is RUSADA.
The athlete can waive their right to have a ""B"" sample tested, but by doing so concedes the drug charge against them. 
Otherwise, the disciplinary procedure against the athlete cannot start until both the 'A' and 'B' sample are tested.
RUSADA did not respond to inquiries about why the 'B' sample had not been tested. 
GLOBAL OUTRAGE 
CAS's decision to let Valieva compete, on the grounds that maintaining the suspension would cause her irreparable damage, has prompted outrage from athletes and officials around the world.
If Valieva finishes in the top three of the women's single event, which starts at about 6 p.m. on Tuesday with the short programme and ends with the free skate on Thursday, the medal ceremony will not be held during the Winter Games. 
Valieva, who wowed the world by performing quadruple jumps in the team event, is the overwhelming favourite for the single.
The dazzling form of her team mates Anna Shcherbakova and Alexandra Trusova means the Russians have a real chance at a clean sweep of the podium. 
The delayed medal ceremony for the Feb. 7 team event, in which the U.S., Japan and Canada finished behind the Russian Olympic Committee, also cannot go ahead because of Valieva's positive result.
""We want to allocate the medal to the right person,"" Oswald told a press conference.

Valieva spoke to Russia's Channel One after practice on Monday.
""These (past few) days have been very difficult for me,"" she said. ""It's as if I don't have any emotions left. I am happy but at the same time I am emotionally tired.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgian employees will be able to work a four-day week after the government on Tuesday agreed a new labour accord aimed at bringing flexibility to an otherwise rigid labour market.
Speaking after his seven-party coalition federal government reached a deal overnight, Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said the coronavirus pandemic had forced people to work more flexibly and combine their private and working lives. 
""This has led to new ways of working,"" he told a press conference.
Employees who request it will be able to work up to 10 hours per day if trade unions agree, instead of the maximum 8 now, in order to work one day less per week for the same pay.
Belgians will also be able to choose to work more during one week and less the following one, allowing people to better manage their work-private life, in case of co-parenting for example.
""I think that giving flexibility to employees is a great idea actually so you can organise yourself differently, maybe have a three day weekend, organise yourself if you have children, it's easier,"" 44-year-old musician Amaury Massion told Reuters TV.
The agreement also introduces the right to disconnect after normal working hours for companies with more than 20 employees.

It sets out new rules for so-called platform workers -- people employed by internet platforms like Uber (NYSE:UBER) -- including new criteria for considering them employees.
Belgium aims at an employment rate of 80% for 2030, against 71.4% at the end of last year.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Hungary and Poland are turning increasingly authoritarian, a European rights group said on Tuesday, a day before the European Union's top court rules on whether to cut funding to member states flouting democratic rights and freedoms. 
The Berlin-based Civil Liberties Union for Europe singled out the two formerly communist EU countries in a broader report highlighting how the rule of law has deteriorated across the 27-nation bloc during the coronavirus pandemic. 
The umbrella advocacy, which brings together rights groups from 17 EU countries, said Hungary and Poland were ""seizing further control of the justice system, civil society and media, while cutting basic human rights and fuelling divisions by scapegoating migrants and other minority groups"".
Warsaw and Budapest deny wrongdoing and accuse the EU of imposing liberal values alien to what they say are their traditional, conservative and Catholic societies.
Hundreds of billions of euros are at stake in the rule of law battles in the EU. The bloc's cohesion and international standing have been damaged by the increasingly bitter dispute.
Thirty-six billion euros in recovery funds earmarked for Poland, and 7 billion euros for Hungary, are already frozen over their track record on democratic rights and values. 
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has accused the EU of waging a cultural ""jihad"" on Hungary, while Warsaw has threatened to retaliate by stalling progress in other EU policies where decisions are made by consensus.
If, as expected, the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice upholds the EU's new policing tool, the bloc would take some weeks to start the process of cutting funds. 
That means no money would actually be forfeited before the Apr. 3 election in Hungary where Orban faces the tightest race yet since his 2010 landslide victory. 

It could take until the end of the year or early 2023 to get to that point, if ever, according to one EU official. 
A senior EU diplomat expected the ""cash-for-democracy"" sanction to eventually be enacted but said it would have to be applied carefully so as not to risk blocking decisions on climate or foreign policy. The diplomat predicted much more horse-trading ahead.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Catholic groups on Tuesday accused Italy's Church of an ""institutional failure"" to confront clergy sexual abuse, and demanded an independent national inquiry mirroring ones conducted in France and Germany.
A collective of nine groups - seven headed by women - issued the demand during the launch of a campaign called ""Beyond the Great Silence"" and a hashtag, #ItalyChurchToo, inspired by the international #MeToo movement against sexual harassment.
In an online news conference, Paola Lazzarini, head of Women in the Church, called for the opening of the archives of ""all dioceses, convents and monasteries"", damages for victims and the uncovering of the truth, ""however painful"".
Globally, revelations of sexual abuse by clergy have so far cost the Church hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation.
The Italian campaign aims to increase public pressure on the Church and the government for a national inquiry going back decades, and rejects assertions from some Italian Catholic leaders that the Church has the resources to do the work itself. 
""Only independent investigations (elsewhere) have overcome the Church's resistance to recognise its own institutional failure,"" said anti-abuse advocate Ludovica Eugenio.
Any Italian investigation ""absolutely has to be impartial,"" added Francesco Zanardi, head of Rete l'Abuso (The Abuse Network). 
Pope Francis has expressed shame at the Church's inability to deal with sexual abuse cases and said it must make itself a ""safe home for everyone"". 
The Vatican had no comment on Tuesday.
Italian bishops are due to decide in May on what type of abuse inquiry, if any, the country will hold.
Antonio Messina, 28, one of victims who participated in the news conference, says he was repeatedly abused when he was a minor by an adult seminarian who went on to become a priest.
Without providing details, he said local church authorities in his home town had tried to buy his silence. ""The Church is not able to handle this (investigation),"" he said.
The German study, released in 2018, showed 1,670 clergymen abused 3,677 minors from 1946 to 2014. The French investigation, released last year and covering seven decades, said more than 200,000 children were abused in Catholic institutions.
Zanardi said the figures would be higher in predominately Catholic Italy because the country has traditionally had many more priests.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -NATO defence ministers are expected this week to set in motion a plan that could establish four multinational battlegroups in southeastern Europe in response to Russia's military build-up in Ukraine, four diplomats said.
Allied ministers meeting on Wednesday and Thursday will decide whether to order their military commanders to draw up plans to deploy battlegroups of some 1,000 troops each to Bulgaria and Romania, and possibly to Slovakia and Hungary.
With NATO meeting as the United States warns of an imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine, diplomats told Reuters that ministers are likely to agree to direct commanders to come up with a detailed plan for the four battlegroups on land.
""There will be a tasking that allows us to escalate but also to de-escalate if Russia pulls back its military,"" a senior NATO diplomat said, stressing that any new battlegroups would be on top of recent allied offers by Britain, the United States and others of ships and planes to reinforce NATO's eastern flank.
U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith told reporters that ministers would discuss ""additional enhancements"" but declined to give more details. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said: ""We're also going to consider a more long-term adjustment of posture, including considering the battlegroup in Romania.""
They spoke as Russia said some troops near Ukraine were returning to their bases after military exercises, easing concerns over a potential invasion. But Stoltenberg also said that while he saw signs for optimism, he had not seen yet seen any sign of de-escalation on the ground. 
Ukraine is not a NATO member and the alliance is under no treaty obligation to defend it. Reinforcements in the Black Sea would show resolve in the strategically important region, and in countries such as Hungary and Slovakia that border Ukraine. 
Any final decision on deployments would come later on, although both France and Bulgaria have offered to lead the battlegroups in Romania and Bulgaria respectively. With Budapest wary of provoking Russia, Hungary could stand up a battalion entirely of its own troops, under NATO command, diplomats said. 
'4,000 VS 130,000'
The move would be NATO's biggest shift in force posture since it set up its ""Enhanced Forward Presence"" battlegroups in Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland - backed by tanks, air defences and intelligence and surveillance units - in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. 
Any deployments would go against Moscow's security demands for the alliance to withdraw troops from eastern Europe. But envoys said an increased troop presence of 4,000 troops was not comparable to the estimated 130,000 Russian troops and equipment to the north, east and south of Ukraine.
NATO insists that the battlegroup format used in the Baltics is not a permanent stationing of troops, rather a ""persistent"" presence of rotating soldiers to serve as a tripwire for a larger response force should Russia invade NATO territory.

A French presidency official said French troops will deploy to Romania only after a NATO decision and that the designing and arming the battlegroups would still take time because allies must come forward to participate. ""There will be a debate within the North Atlantic Council and we are basically aiming for a deadline of a few months,"" the official said.
NATO could also consider a multinational force led by France in Romania that would coordinate allied exercises in eastern Europe and allow troops to flow in and out of the region without establishing a formal presence.

A ministry spokesman said in a video published online that while large-scale drills across the country continued, some units of the Southern and Western military districts have completed their exercises and started returning to base.
Video footage published by the defence ministry showed some tanks and other armoured vehicles being loaded onto railway flatcars.
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Kyiv would ""believe in de-escalation"" only after it sees Russia's pullout, the Interfax Ukraine news agency reported.
""We continously hear different statements from the Russian federation, so we have a rule ... we believe what we see. If we see the pullout we will believe in deescalation,"" the report quoted Kuleba as saying. 
Russia has amassed over 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders, prompting fears of an invasion, especially as Moscow's Feb. 10-20 joint drills with Belarus mean that Ukraine is almost encircled by the Russian military.
Russian markets reacted positively to the news and the rouble, which has been under pressure due to fears of fresh Western sanctions in the event of a war, gained 1.5% shortly after the defence ministry announcement.

Although Moscow has denied ever planning to attack Ukraine, it has demanded legally binding guarantees from the United States and NATO that Kyiv will not be allowed to join the military bloc. Washington and Brussels have so far refused to make such pledges.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was expected in Moscow later on Tuesday to meet President Vladimir Putin in a high stakes mission to avert war.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin heads to Brussels on Tuesday for talks with NATO allies and to visit U.S. troops in Poland as Washington remains focused on the risk of a large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Austin's departure came as Russia said some of its military units were returning to their bases after exercises near Ukraine. It was unclear how many units were being withdrawn, and by what distance.
U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, did not immediately comment on the Russian statements. Earlier they had reiterated their concerns over Moscow's buildup of an estimated 130,000 troops to the north, east and south of Ukraine. 
""We have consistently presented a path of diplomacy and we have consistently been disappointed by Russia's interest in engaging substantively. So I will not tell you that I am optimistic at this point,"" a senior U.S. defense official said.
While it denies plans to invade Ukraine, Moscow has said it could take unspecified ""military-technical"" action unless a series of demands are met, including promises from NATO never to admit Ukraine and to withdraw forces from Eastern Europe. 
NATO MEETING
NATO defence ministers will meet on Wednesday and Thursday and are expected to set in motion a plan that could establish four multi-national battlegroups in southeastern Europe in response to Russia's military build-up in Ukraine, three diplomats told Reuters.
The move would be NATO's biggest shift in force posture since it set up its ""Enhanced Forward Presence"" battlegroups in Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland - backed by tanks, air defences and intelligence and surveillance units - in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.
Ukraine is not a NATO member and the alliance is under no treaty obligation to defend it. President Joe Biden's administration has also stressed that U.S. troops will not fight nuclear-armed Russia and he has withdrawn U.S. military trainers from Ukraine.
However, Biden is sending additional U.S. troops to Europe, including to Poland, where Austin is scheduled to meet Polish leaders. He will also meet U.S. and Polish forces at Powidz Air Base later this week. 
Austin will also travel to Lithuania, which has supplied Ukraine with Stinger anti-aircraft missile systems and ammunition. 

Ukraine has bolstered its armed forces with weapons from allies, including U.S. and British anti-tank systems and Turkish drones, but U.S. officials say Russia clearly retains ""overwhelming"" military superiority.
""The Ukrainians absolutely have the will to fight,"" the senior U.S. official said. ""But at the same time, what the Russians could bring to bear is quite overwhelming.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is completing a review of an enforcement initiative aimed at combating Chinese espionage and intellectual property theft, an examination that former officials and critics expect will result in a shift away from its controversial targeting of academic researchers.
The so-called ""China Initiative"" was launched in 2018 during the Trump administration and spearheaded by former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Its stated goal has been to broadly counter what the department said were ""Chinese national security threats.""
Previous administrations have probed academics for allegedly sharing proprietary information with China. However, the Trump Justice Department expanded the effort by investigating professors at U.S. universities over whether they disclosed financial ties to China when seeking federal grant funding and scrutinizing visiting Chinese scholars from military affiliated universities. 
But following the collapse of several cases against researchers and blowback from civil rights groups and some lawmakers who said the program has fueled racial profiling of Chinese scientists, the Biden Justice Department launched a review of the initiative.
    Former officials and stakeholders say they expect the Justice Department will shift away from prosecuting professors, cases that university faculty say have chilled research and scared Chinese American academics.
They also expect the department to remove the word ""China"" from the program's name, amid concerns that label could fuel anti-Asian rhetoric. 
""The cases they brought against professors had nothing to do with spying or espionage,"" said U.S. Representative Ted Lieu, Democrat of California. ""It was simply racial profiling.""
Matthew Olsen, who leads the department's National Security Division, has been reviewing the initiative and is expected to complete the effort ""soon,"" a Justice Department spokesman said. 
Lieu and other members of the Congressional Asian Pacific Caucus met with Olsen last month to discuss the initiative amid the review.
""He definitely understood our concerns,"" Lieu said.
But supporters and critics of the program alike say the department is unlikely to fully abandon the initiative and instead re-focus on state-sponsored espionage and trade secret theft investigations, potentially leaving some critics unsatisfied.
    ""For us certainly, any sort of rebranding of the China Initiative and simply dropping the name China from it would not be enough for us,"" said John Yang, the head of Asian Americans Advancing Justice.
The China Initiative still has support from key officials within the Justice Department, including FBI Director Christopher Wray, who in a recent speech said the bureau has over 2000 active trade theft cases and opens a new case involving China every 12 hours.
""There is just no country that presents a broader threat to our ideas, our innovation, and our economic security than China,"" Wray said.
FLAWED EVIDENCE
The China Initiative has led to some high-profile cases, including its bank fraud case against Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou. Other notable cases include one accusing Chinese officials of hacking American companies, and the department's Operation Fox Hunt case alleging Chinese officials traveled to the U.S. to harass dissidents into returning home to face charges. 
However, the controversy surrounding the cases in academia has cast the program in a negative light.
At least 20 academic researchers have faced charges, including Charles Lieber, a Harvard University professor convicted in December of concealing his ties to China in connection with federally funded research.
But almost half of the academic cases were based on flawed evidence or premises, resulting in at least nine prosecutions out of some 20 cases being dismissed before trial or ending in acquittals.
Most recently, the department dropped charges last month against Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Gang Chen, after prosecutors admitted they could not prove he had hidden ties to China when seeking federal grant funds.
Moreover, a November survey by Chinese American advocacy group https://www.committee100.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/C100-Lee-Li-White-Paper-FINAL-FINAL-10.28.pdf Committee of 100 and the University of Arizona found about 42% of non-U.S. citizen Chinese scientists say they are now inclined to leave the United States because of the China Initiative and the FBI investigations.
Andrew Lelling, the former Massachusetts U.S. attorney under Trump, said he supported the China Initiative, but now agrees that the department should shift away from targeting academics.

""All the universities now focus more on transparency,"" he said, adding that the program has affected how academics share information about their relationships. 
""All of the researchers in international collaborations are now scared to not disclose them.""

492,"<span>Feb 15, 2022 05:16AM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration released a report on Tuesday detailing recommendations to boost competition in its defense industrial base because rapid consolidation has created a national security risk.
The number of aerospace and defense prime contractors to the Defense Department - a group known as the defense industrial base - has shrunk from 51 to just 5 since the 1990s, the report said. It added that 90% of missiles come from 3 sources.
Having only a small number of sources for defense needs ""can pose mission risk and, particularly in cases where the existing dominant supplier or suppliers are influenced by an adversary nation, pose significant national security risks,"" the report said. 
The document, mandated by a July executive order signed by President Joe Biden, added that a lack of competition also limits incentive for firms to innovate, and results in higher costs to taxpayers.
The paper comes on the heels of U.S. arms maker  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) calling off plans to acquire rocket engine maker Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (NYSE:AJRD) Inc for $4.4 billion amid opposition from U.S. antitrust enforcers.

The document recommends the Pentagon work with antitrust regulators to prevent an excess of mergers, entice newcomers into the marketplace, and stop a handful of firms from withholding key intellectual property.
The report also urges the Defense Department to shore up its supply chain in crucial areas including missiles, batteries, critical materials and microelectronics.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday activated rarely used emergency powers in an effort to end protests that have shut some U.S. border crossings and paralyzed parts of the capital. 
Under the Emergencies Act, the government introduced measures intended to cut off protesters' funding and took steps to reinforce provincial and local law enforcement with federal police.
""The blockades are harming our economy and endangering public safety,"" Trudeau told a news conference. ""We cannot and will not allow illegal and dangerous activities to continue."" 
But the Canadian Civil Liberties Association said the government had not met the standard for invoking the Emergencies Act, which is intended to deal with threats to ""sovereignty, security and territorial integrity,"" the group said. 
The ""Freedom Convoy"" protests, started by Canadian truckers opposing a COVID-19 vaccinate-or-quarantine mandate for cross-border drivers, have drawn people opposed to Trudeau's policies on everything from pandemic restrictions to a carbon tax. Copycat trucker protests have also sprung up in Israel, France, Australia and New Zealand. 
Protesters blockaded the Ambassador Bridge, a vital trade route between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, for six days before police cleared the protest on Sunday while others have shut down smaller border crossings in Alberta, Manitoba and British Columbia. Protests in Ottawa, the nation's capital, entered a third week.
Protesters camped in front of the Canadian Parliament, some of whom want the prime minister to meet with them, said the latest steps were excessive. ""It’s an extreme measure that isn’t necessary,"" said protester Candice Chapel.
CUTTING OFF FUNDS 
The financial measures bring crowdfunding platforms under terror-finance oversight, authorize Canadian banks to freeze accounts suspected of funding the blockades and suspend insurance on vehicles in the protests, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said. 
""We are making these changes because we know that these (crowdfunding) platforms are being used to support illegal blockades and illegal activity which is damaging the Canadian economy,"" Freeland said. 
Canadian authorities have said about half of the funding for the protests has come from U.S. supporters. Toronto-Dominion Bank last week froze two personal bank accounts that received C$1.4 million ($1.1 million) for the protests. 
A U.S.-based website, GiveSendGo, became a prime conduit for money to the protesters after mainstream crowdfunding platform GoFundMe blocked donations to the group. An Ontario court last week ordered GiveSendGo to freeze all funds supporting the blockade, but it said it would not comply.
Amid criticism that the police approach to demonstrations has been too permissive, Trudeau will use federal officers to back up provincial and local forces. ""Despite their best efforts, it is now clear that there are serious challenges to law enforcement's ability to effectively enforce the law,"" he said. 
In the western Canadian province of Alberta, police said they broke up a group that was armed and prepared to use violence to back a blockade at a border crossing with the United States.
The Canadian Parliament must approve the use of the emergency measures within seven days, and the left-leaning New Democrat party said it would support Trudeau's Liberal minority government to pass the measures. 
Ontario, which declared a state of emergency on Friday, backed the move. But premiers in Alberta, Quebec, Manitoba and Saskatchewan opposed the plan. Quebec's Premier Francois Legault said using emergency powers risked putting ""oil on the fire.""

Trudeau said the measures would be geographically targeted and time limited. 
Ontario said it will speed up its plan to remove proof-of-vaccination requirements and lift pandemic-related capacity limits for many businesses while Alberta ended its mask requirements for school children on Monday.

MANAMA (Reuters) -Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett arrived in Bahrain's capital Manama on Monday in the highest-level visit since the countries established relations under a 2020 U.S.-sponsored deal based in part on shared worries about Iran.
Bennett will meet with Bahraini Crown Prince and Prime Minister Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, his office said. 
""The leaders will discuss additional ways to strengthen bilateral ties ... especially the advancement of diplomatic and economic issues, with an emphasis on technology and innovation,"" it said in a statement.
The two-day trip to Bahrain, home to the U.S. Navy's Gulf headquarters, comes amid heightened tensions after missile attacks on the neighbouring United Arab Emirates by Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis. Israel also normalised ties with the UAE in 2020.
Speaking to reporters before take-off, Bennett said he hoped the visit would be a ""message of goodwill ... and a shared stance against common threats"". 
Israel has stepped up cooperation with the Gulf states. Manama hosted Israel's defence minister on Feb. 2 and has said an Israeli military officer will be posted in Bahrain as part of an international coalition.
The outreach by Bahrain's Sunni Muslim monarch has been criticised by an opposition led by the Shi'ite majority. The country has seen protests in solidarity with the Palestinians.
There were brief protests in several Shi'ite villages ahead of Bennett's visit, activists told Reuters. Footage and photos posted on Bahrain's dissolved opposition group al-Wefaq's social media accounts showed dozens of protesters marching, chanting slogans and holding up Bahraini flags. 
Israel has offered to cooperate with its new Gulf partners on air defence, but has not specified whether this might include selling the short-range rocket interceptor Iron Dome.
Such sales in the past have been subjected to questions of whether the systems would be secure and not be shared with Israel's enemies. There has also been concern it would pose a commercial challenge to U.S. defence exports.

But a U.S. official saw no problem in Washington were Israel to go ahead with Iron Dome sales in the Gulf.
""There's a lot of interest in Iron Dome"" in the region, said the official, who could not be identified by name.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is relocating its Ukraine embassy operations from the capital Kyiv to the western city of Lviv, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday, citing a ""dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces.""
The move comes as U.S. officials warned that Moscow was continuing to amass more than 100,000 troops near Russia's border with Ukraine and in neighboring Belarus, and could at any time launch a devastating attack, including on Kyiv. Moscow denies Western accusations that it is planning an invasion.
""An incursion into Ukraine could entail massive violence, massive destruction, and the loss of life would not discriminate between Americans, Ukrainians"" or others, State Department spokesman Ned Price told a news briefing.
Blinken said in a statement that the decision to move the embassy operations to Lviv - roughly 50 miles (80 km) from Ukraine's western border with Poland - was taken out of concern for the safety of the staff.
Most embassy staff have already been ordered to depart Ukraine and U.S. citizens have been advised to leave the country by commercial means.
Blinken said that relocating the embassy operations ""in no way"" undermined U.S. support for Ukraine's ""sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" and that U.S. diplomats would ""remain engaged"" with the Ukrainian government.
The United States is continuing to press Moscow for a diplomatic resolution, he said.
Price, however, told reporters that it was ""unclear to us whether Russia is interested in... pursuing a diplomatic course.""
Washington, he said, took note of comments that Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made in a televised meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin that Moscow would press on with diplomatic efforts to extract security guarantees from the West.
""What we have not taken note of is any indication of de-escalation"" by Russian forces, Price continued.
Relocating the embassy operations, he said, was based on an assessment ""of what we are seeing on the ground with our own eyes, which is a continued and unprovoked Russian buildup."" 

""It is a distinct possibility, perhaps more real than ever before, that Russia may decide to proceed with military action,"" he said.
The top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, Charge d'Affaires Kristina Kvien, will work from Lviv, and the U.S. mission in Kyiv will be protected by Ukrainian National Guard Police, he said.

MOSCOW/KYIV (Reuters) -Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday called on the country's people to fly flags and sing the national anthem in unison on Feb. 16, a date that some Western media say Russian could invade.
Ukrainian government officials stressed that Zelenskiy was not predicting an attack on Wednesday, but responding skeptically to the foreign media reports.
""They tell us Feb. 16 will be the day of the attack. We will make it a day of unity,"" Zelenskiy said in a video address to the nation.
""They are trying to frighten us by yet again naming a date for the start of military action,"" Zelenskiy said. ""On that day, we will hang our national flags, wear yellow and blue banners, and show the whole world our unity.""
Zelenskiy has long said that, while he believes Russia is threatening to attack his country, the likelihood of an imminent invasion has been overstated by Western allies, responding to Moscow's efforts to intimidate Ukraine and sow panic.
Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskiy's chief of staff, told Reuters the president was responding in part ""with irony"" to media reports of the potential date of the invasion.
""It is quite understandable why Ukrainians today are skeptical about various 'specific dates' of the so-called 'start of the invasion' announced in the media,"" he said. ""When the 'start of the invasion' becomes some sort of rolling tour date, such media announcements can only be taken with irony.""
Zelenskiy's office released a decree calling for all villages and towns in Ukraine to fly the country's flags on Wednesday, and for the entire nation to sing the national anthem at 10 a.m. It also called for an increase in salaries of soldiers and border guards.
U.S. officials said they were not predicting an assault ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin on a specific day, but repeated warnings that it could come at any time.
""I won't get into a specific date, I don't think that would be smart. I would just tell you that it is entirely possible that he could move with little to no warning,"" Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) told reporters. Earlier, Kirby said Moscow was still adding to its military capabilities on the Ukrainian frontier.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington, which has already sent most of its diplomats home, was moving its remaining diplomatic mission in Ukraine from Kyiv to the western city of Lviv, much further from the Russian border. He cited a ""dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces"".
Blinken said Washington was offering Ukraine up to $1 billion in sovereign loan guarantees to calm markets.
The State Department issued a travel advisory recommending that U.S. citizens leave Belarus, which borders both Russia and Ukraine. 
Russia has more than 100,000 troops massed near the border of Ukraine. Russian political leaders deny Western accusations that it is planning to invade, but say it could take unspecified ""military-technical"" action unless a range of demands are met, including barring Kyiv from ever joining the NATO alliance.
Russia suggested on Monday that it would keep talking to the West to try to defuse the security crisis. 
In a televised exchange, Putin was shown asking his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, whether there was a chance of an agreement to address Russia's security concerns, or whether it was just being dragged into tortuous negotiations.
Lavrov replied: ""We have already warned more than once that we will not allow endless negotiations on questions that demand a solution today.""
But he added: ""It seems to me that our possibilities are far from exhausted ... At this stage, I would suggest continuing and building them up.""
Western countries have threatened unprecedented sanctions if Russia invades. The Group of Seven large economies (G7) warned on Monday of ""economic and financial sanctions which will have massive and immediate consequences on the Russian economy"".
After speaking with the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he still believed ""from his own analysis, his own hopes"" that there would not be a conflict, a U.N. spokesperson said.
Moscow says Ukraine's quest to join NATO poses a threat. While NATO has no immediate plans to admit Ukraine, Western countries say they cannot negotiate over a sovereign country's right to form alliances.
ECONOMIC DAMAGE
Ukraine has already suffered economic damage from the standoff. A surge in the price of 5-year credit default swaps on Ukrainian sovereign bonds suggested that markets gave Kyiv a 42% probability of defaulting.
Ukraine International Airlines, the nation's biggest airline, said its insurers had terminated coverage for some of its aircraft.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz held talks with Zelenskiy in Kyiv. Scholz is due to fly to Moscow on Tuesday, following visits by French President Emmanuel Macron and two British ministers went last week.

Scholz said he saw ""no reasonable justification"" for Russia's military activity on Ukraine's border, and that ""we are ready for a serious dialogue with Russia on European security issues"". He announced a credit of 150 million euros ($170 million) for Ukraine.
($1 = 0.8838 euros)

BRUNSWICK, Ga. (Reuters) - A federal prosecutor in Georgia said on Monday that three white men on trial for hate crimes in the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, had a long history of using racial epithets and undoubtedly killed him because of his race.
Arbery did nothing to deserve his fate, Barbara Bernstein, deputy chief of the Department of Justice's civil rights division, told the U.S. District Court in the coastal town of Brunswick (NYSE:BC) in her opening statement.
Gregory McMichael, 66, his son Travis McMichael, 36, and neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52, were convicted last year of shooting dead Arbery after chasing him in pickup trucks through their mostly white neighborhood because they wrongly suspected he may have been guilty of a crime.
Unlike last year's state trial, the federal hate-crimes trial will focus more squarely on the motive for the killing and whether the defendants targeted Arbery because he was Black, as the prosecution alleges.
Arbery's killing was one of several murders of Black men and women, often at the hands of police, that helped spark recent racial justice protests around the world. The federal trial of Arbery's killers is one of the first in which those who carried out a high-profile killing are facing a jury in a hate-crime trial. ""Most of this trial will be about why the defendants did what they did,"" Bernstein said.
Bernstein said if Arbery, an avid runner, had been white, he would have been able to go for an afternoon jog unmolested and ""been home in time for Sunday supper.""
""Instead, he went out for a jog, and ended up running for his life. Instead, he ended up bleeding to death, alone and scared, in the middle of the street,"" she told the court.
As Bernstein talked to the jury, Arbery's parents sat in the front of the public gallery looking somber and shaking a little. His father, Marcus Arbery, sighed as Ahmaud Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, put her arm on Marcus Arbery's shoulders. 
Bernstein cited several messages posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and elsewhere in which all three men used racial epithets.
She especially highlighted the words of Travis McMichael - who shot Arbery - who she said had made violent and racist statements on social media, including calling Black people ""monkeys"" and ""subhuman savages."" He had also told a friend that he was glad to have left the Coast Guard because he no longer had to work with or be around Black people, she added.
She said the jury would hear from a witness how Gregory McMichael ""went on a racist rant about Black people.""
Bernstein said Bryan used a racial epithet in an online post after learning four days before Arbery's death that his daughter was dating a Black man.
USING THE N-WORD
Defense attorneys for the three men said in their opening statements that they found their clients' use of racial epithets deeply offensive, but emphasized it was no reason to convict them. They said the men were not motivated by Arbery's race.
""I can't stand before you and say my client has never used the 'N-word',"" said Amy Copeland, the attorney for Travis McMichael. ""He did. He left a digital footprint over several years."" 
But Copeland said Travis McMichael had chiefly been concerned with cases of theft that had left his neighborhood on high alert when he decided to chase down Arbery.
Trial experts told Reuters that the challenge for the prosecutors will be to back up the evidence of racist utterances with evidence that on the day of the shooting the three men were motivated by racial animus. 
The court is scheduled to hear from Special Agent Richard Dial of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, who has previously testified that Bryan told his office that Travis McMichael uttered a racial slur as Arbery lay dying.
Bryan's attorney, Pete Theodocion, tried to distance his client from the McMichaels, saying that when he joined the McMichaels in chasing Arbery he assumed ""he (Arbery) did something wrong, but not because of his race.""
Travis McMichael said at a hearing last month that he was willing to plead guilty to attacking Arbery because of his ""race and color"" after reaching a plea agreement with prosecutors.

But he changed his mind after Judge Lisa Wood rejected the agreement, saying she could not accept it because it bound her to sentencing McMichael to 30 years in federal prison before he was handed back to the state of Georgia to serve out the rest of his life sentence for murder. 
She said she needed more information to know whether a 30-year sentence was just, and cited emotional testimony from Arbery's family.

COMMENTARY
THE CANADIAN CIVIL LIBERTIES ASSOCIATION 
The standard for invoking the Emergencies Act ""has not been met,"" the Canadian Civil Liberties Association said in a statement.
The Act exists for situations that seriously threaten ""the ability of the Government of Canada to preserve the sovereignty, security and territorial integrity of Canada"" and that ""cannot be effectively dealt with under any other law of Canada,"" adding the use of such legislation ""should not be normalized.""
GOLDY HYDER, CEO OF BUSINESS COUNCIL OF CANADA
""We recognize the gravity of the federal government’s decision to invoke the Emergencies Act. Having called on the federal government to show national leadership, we welcome this as a step toward ending illegal blockades across the country and upholding the rule of law.""
PHIL BOYLE, ASSOCIATE CHAIR FOR LEGAL STUDIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WATERLOO
""It seems an interesting strategic move there to go after the money. That seems appropriate. One of the things that worked in Windsor, with the Ambassador Bridge, was the threat of taking away their licenses. If your livelihood depends on license, you’re going to think twice before putting that at risk. So that might very well work with the case of Ottawa,"" Boyle told Reuters.
""No doubt there will be some litigation to come of this, considering it’s never been done before... If these emergency measures are targeted within a particular province... Trudeau would only do it if he had the relevant province on board. Maybe that would lessen the potential for litigation.""
""I wonder, how does this Federal emergencies order square with the (Ontario) provincial emergencies order that was just ordered on Friday? I don't think we've ever been in a situation where both the provincial and the federal government have, at the same time, invoked extraordinary emergency measures.""
JACK LINDSAY, DEPARTMENT CHAIR FOR APPLIED DISASTER AND EMERGENCY STUDIES AT BRANDON UNIVERSITY IN MANITOBA
""It seems that they’re mostly going to focus on orders and regulations relating to finance... and that's a fairly effective tool,"" Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) told Reuters.
""I suspect following the money and then turning the money off is probably a good strategy and not one that's easily done... temporary short-term measures that wouldn't normally be acceptable can be put in place.""
""They can certainly do things quicker, which is certainly the intention of these orders and regulations under the Emergencies Act. To be able to do things when it's useful rather than six months later when you've gone through all the regular democratic processes and regulations or an Act changed. 
""I imagine this will start of week full of political discourse over whether the government overstepped or not.""
LORI WILLIAMS, POLITICS PROFESSOR, MOUNT ROYAL UNIVERSITY, CALGARY
""There's the danger this could create more problems, that's why this has to be done with the cooperation of premiers and if they don't want help, then the federal government needs to hang back. It has to be very targeted, very strategic and very restrained, because these are enormous powers that are being implemented.""
ONTARIO PREMIER DOUG FORD
""I'll support the federal government and any proposals they have to bring law and order back to our province, to make sure we stabilize our businesses and trade around the world as the world is watching us right now, wondering if it's a stable environment to open up businesses and expand businesses,"" Ford told reporters.
""These occupiers, they're doing the total opposite what they say they're there to do. They're hurting hundreds of thousands of families, millions of jobs across the province."" 
ADAM BUTTON, CHIEF CURRENCY ANALYST AT FOREXLIVE
""The protest hasn't been a material market mover of the Canadian dollar but ending the protest with emergency powers would remove the tail risk of a longer disruption."" 
QUEBEC PREMIER FRANCOIS LEGAULT 
Legault told reporters that imposing the act risks putting ""oil on the fire"" by further polarizing the population and argued that local police in the mostly-French speaking province have the situation under control.""
""I was very clear with the Prime Minister, that the federal emergency act must not apply in Quebec. I think we don't need it. I think that at this moment it would not help the social climate. There’s a lot of pressure right now and I think we have to be careful. So it’s about time we put all Quebecers together. But I can understand that enough is enough in Ottawa. You can protest but you cannot do what they are doing since two weeks.""
ALBERTA PREMIER JASON KENNEY
""We would prefer that the Emergencies Act not be invoked, but if it is we would very much prefer that it not be applied to Alberta,"" Kenny told a media briefing.
MANITOBA PREMIER HEATHER STEFANSON
""In my view, the sweeping effects and signals associated with the never-before-used Emergencies Act are not constructive here in Manitoba, where caution must be taken against overreach and unintended negative consequences. While the situation is very different in Ontario, this ultimate federal legislation should only be considered on a measured and proportional basis, in locations where it is truly needed,"" Stefanson told reporters.
SASKATCHEWAN PREMIER SCOTT MOE
""The illegal blockades must end, but police already have sufficient tools to enforce the law and clear the blockades, as they did over the weekend in Windsor. Therefore, Saskatchewan does not support the Trudeau government invoking the Emergencies Act. If the federal government does proceed with this measure, I would hope it would only be invoked in provinces that request it, as the legislation allows,"" Moe told reporters
LEAH WEST, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, AT CARLETON UNIVERSITY

""The federal government must consult with provinces and Cabinet must believe the protests rise to the level of a national emergency. Can it truly be said the security of Canada is threatened by largely non-violent protests? Certainly, our sovereignty and territorial integrity are not at risk,"" West tweeted.""

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The billionaire e-commerce mogul who last year led the world's first all-private space crew launched into orbit said on Monday he plans to help bankroll up to three more such missions with SpaceX, independent of NASA's human spaceflight program.
Jared Isaacman, founder and CEO of Shift4 Payments Inc, said his new ""Polaris (NYSE:PII)"" collaboration with fellow billionaire and SpaceX chief Elon Musk could launch its first four-member crew as early as the fourth quarter of this year.
Dubbed Polaris Dawn, the mission would aim to set a new orbital altitude record and feature the world's first commercial spacewalk, while also testing the laser-based communications system of SpaceX's Starlink satellite network, Isaacman said in a message online.
If successful, the initiative would mark yet another milestone in the growing commercialization of space, for which human exploration was long the sole domain of professional astronauts.
As he did in the history-making ""Inspiration4"" flight that carried a quartet of private citizens into orbit last September aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, Isaacman plans to serve as mission commander of the Polaris Dawn mission.
A spokesman told Reuters that Isaacman and SpaceX ""are investing in the mission together"" but not revealing any financial details.
Isaacman, an experienced jet pilot who flew in the Black Diamond civilian aerobatics squadron and co-founded a private air force of fighter planes for military training, introduced his three Polaris Dawn crewmates on a conference call from Los Angeles on Monday.
Although none is a professional astronaut, all have close career ties to the aerospace field.
The Polaris Dawn pilot is retired U.S. Air Force combat pilot Scott Poteet, a former Shift4 executive and mission director for Inspiration4.
Rounding out the crew will be two lead space operations engineers from SpaceX - Sarah Gillis, who oversees the company's astronaut training program, and Anna Menon, who manages crew operations development. Both have also served as SpaceX mission control operators.
Plans call for a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket to launch the Polaris Dawn from Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, and for the crew to spend up to five days in orbit. 
To achieve Isaacman's objective of reaching the highest altitude ever in Earth orbit, Polaris would have to surpass the all-time record 850 miles (1,368 km) set in 1966 by NASA's Gemini 11 mission.
The planned spacewalk, set for much lower orbit at about 310 miles (500 km) over the Earth, would prove an especially challenging feat as the first ever ""extravehicular activity,"" or EVA, attempted by non-professional astronauts.
A second Polaris mission would, like the first, make use of the Falcon 9-Crew Dragon combo that has become the SpaceX workhorse for numerous NASA missions.
But the third flight envisioned for the Polaris program would break ground as the first human flight aboard Musk's next-generation Starship, which SpaceX is developing for eventual missions to the moon and Mars.
Undertaking the maiden crewed flight of a brand-new spacecraft without seasoned professional astronauts would stray from longstanding practice at SpaceX, which relied on NASA veterans to fly its first human missions of the Falcon 9 and Crew Dragon.

Polaris is not the only commercial space outfit looking to send its own crew to orbit in the near future. 
SpaceX plans separately to launch a four-person private crew of the Houston-based spaceflight company Axiom to the International Space Station on March 30 for what would be the first all-private flight to dock at the orbiting research laboratory. The debut Axiom crew includes a retired NASA astronaut and a former Israeli fighter pilot.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's presidential candidates formally began campaigning on Tuesday in what is set to be the tightest race in 20 years between its two main parties, dominated by scandals that have allowed a third challenger to potentially play the role of kingmaker.
Polls say voters are looking for a president who can clean up polarised politics and corruption, and tackle the runaway housing prices and deepening inequality that have dogged Asia's fourth-largest economy. 
Curbing North Korea's weapons tests and resuming talks would be a plus, but even a record month of missile testing by Pyongyang in January hasn't made foreign policy a key issue for the March 9 vote in South Korea.
But the major issues named in the polls have been overshadowed by scandals and petty controversies, ranging from allegations of abuse of power to spats over one candidate's relationship with a shaman and an anal acupuncturist. 
Fourteen candidates have signed up since official registration opened on Sunday, with Lee Jae-myung, the flag-bearer of the ruling Democratic Party, facing off against Yoon Suk-yeol, from the conservative main opposition People Power Party. 
Dubbed the ""unlikeable election"" due to high disapproval ratings and smear campaigns waged by both sides, Lee and Yoon are neck and neck in polls, although Yoon has maintained a slight lead in recent weeks. 
A survey released on Sunday by Realmeter showed 41.6% of respondents favoured Yoon and 39.1% picked Lee, while Southern Post put Yoon just 0.5% ahead with 35.5%.
That would contrast with the last three presidential elections, which were largely predictable. The upcoming contest could be the closest since 2002 when an opposition challenger lost to former President Roh Moo-hyun by a 2.33% margin, or 570,980 votes. 
""This is the foggiest election we've seen in a while, it's very rare that a likely winner had yet to emerge just three weeks before the vote,"" said Bae Jong-chan, a political analyst who runs the Insight K think tank.
A former governor of Gyeonggi province, Lee shot to prominence through his aggressive handling of the coronavirus pandemic and his advocacy of universal basic income. 
Yoon is a political novice, but has gained popularity thanks to his image as a staunch prosecutor-general who steered high-profile investigations into corruption scandals engulfing aides to former President Park Geun-hye and current President Moon Jae-in.
But growing frustration over mainstream politics and controversy involving both candidates' families have been a fillip for Ahn Cheol-soo, a renowned software mogul and doctor who is a minor opposition contender.
MERGED CAMPAIGN
Ahn formally offered on Sunday to merge campaigns with Yoon, saying it would expedite a ""overwhelming victory"" and national unity. 
His latest ratings hovered between 7-8% after peaking at 15%. Polls indicated a convincing victory if Yoon and Ahn unite, although it was not clear if all Ahn's supporters would automatically follow him on a combined ticket.
Some officials from Yoon's campaign have also called for a merger, floating the idea of forming a coalition government and appointing Ahn as prime minister. 
Yoon said he would give the proposal ""positive consideration"" but said he was not entirely happy about Ahn's call to use a poll to pick which of the two men would lead the ticket.
A Yoon aide said his campaign would prefer a negotiation between the candidates to determine the flag-bearer. Ahn said he was open to talks but would not accept unilateral demands for him to step down. 
Ahn's rise has come amid deepening voter disgust over controversies involving the families of both Lee and Yoon. 
Lee, who has apologised over his son's illegal gambling, faces a possible criminal investigation over allegations that he illegally hired a provincial government employee to serve his wife as a personal assistant, and let her misappropriate government funds through his corporate credit card.
Lee and his wife have apologised for causing public concern and said they would cooperate with any investigation. 
Yoon, meanwhile, has apologised for his wife's inaccurate resume when she applied for teaching jobs years ago, and denied accusations from Democrats that a shaman who is close to his wife was deeply involved in his campaign.
He has also denied ties to an anal acupuncturist.
Lee's campaign raised new allegations on Sunday that Kwon Oh-soo, chairman and the largest shareholder of Deutsch Motors Inc., a BMW car dealer in South Korea, sponsored Yoon's wife's company in a bid to evade investigations while Yoon worked as a prosecutor. Kwon was arrested last year on charges of manipulating his firm's stock prices. 

The ruling Democratic Party also criticised Yoon at the weekend for putting his feet on a train seat without taking off his shoes as lacking a sense of citizenship and public etiquette. 
Yoon's campaign hit back, accusing the Democrats of levelling groundless allegations even after Lee vowed to cease negative campaigns.

ST. PAUL, Minn. (Reuters) -Two former Minneapolis police officers, Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng, told a U.S. judge on Monday they planned to testify in their own defense against federal charges that they violated George Floyd's civil rights during a deadly 2020 arrest.
A lawyer for Thomas Lane, the third police officer on trial at the U.S. District Court in St. Paul, had previously said Lane would also testify in his own defense, but told Judge Paul Magnuson on Monday that Lane was still considering his decision.
Derek Chauvin, the white police officer convicted at a separate state trial last year of murdering Floyd, has already pleaded guilty to federal charges of violating the 46-year-old Black man's civil rights by failing to give medical aid.
A cellphone video of the dying, handcuffed Floyd pleading for his life before falling motionless as Chauvin knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes caused outrage in May 2020, spurring huge daily protests against racism and police brutality in cities around the world.
The teenager who made that video, Darnella Frazier, was the last witness called by prosecutors from the U.S. Department of Justice's civil rights division before they rested their case on Monday after about three weeks of testimony.
She was in tears within a few moments of taking the stand, prompting the judge, who has tried to limit displays of emotion before the jury, to pause proceedings.
""I'm sorry, I can't do it, I'm sorry,"" she said about testifying, shaking.
Frazier, now an 18-year-old student, returned to the stand later to say she started recording because it was plain to her that Floyd was in need of help.
""He just looked defeated on the ground,"" she said, echoing testimony she gave at Chauvin's state trial in Minneapolis last spring. ""George Floyd repeated himself over and over he couldn't breathe. I asked the officer, 'How long do you have to hold down someone who's saying he couldn't breathe.'""
Prosecutors have argued that Thao, Kueng and Lane all had a duty to intervene to stop Chauvin from killing Floyd. 
They have all pleaded not guilty and will take turns to present their defense cases through their lawyers beginning on Tuesday.
Lawyers for Kueng and Lane have noted they were rookies only days out of what they argue was an inadequate training program by the Minneapolis Police Department. Lawyers for all three men have said they all sought to look out for Floyd's medical needs but ultimately could not be held responsible for Chauvin's deadly conduct.

Prosecutors have called officials from the Minneapolis Police Department to testify that the trainees are told how it can be dangerous not to roll a restrained person on their side and that they must intervene if they see misconduct.
Chauvin is expected to be sentenced to more than two decades in prison, and his three former colleagues would face years in prison if convicted. They also face a separate state trial in June on charges of aiding and abetting Floyd's murder.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Russian President Vladimir Putin's massive troop buildup along Ukraine's border has left the West struggling to pinpoint if or when he might actually launch a military campaign.
U.S. intelligence has been closely monitoring troop, equipment and other moves in the region, while trying to factor in international events, like the Beijing Olympics and an upcoming meeting of Western allies. 
Only Putin knows for sure what he will do, U.S. officials concede. But that hasn't stopped the United States and its allies from trying to make more specific predictions as it warns citizens and embassies in potential danger, putting a strain on relations with Ukraine.
Russia has more than 100,000 troops massed near the border of Ukraine. It denies Western accusations that it is planning an invasion, but says it could take unspecified ""military-technical"" action unless a range of demands are met, including barring Kyiv from ever joining the NATO alliance.
The White House stressed an attack could be imminent on Monday, a message it has repeated often in recent days. 
""We are in the window where an invasion could happen at any time,"" said White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. ""It could begin this week."" 
Many Western nations warned citizens to leave Ukraine late last week, prompting some top Ukrainian lawmakers and business leaders to leave the country, too. 
On Monday, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy asked them to come back in a video address to the nation.
""They tell us Feb. 16 will be the day of the attack,"" he said, without saying who 'they' was. That stirred confusion in global markets and a sell-off in the S&P 500 index. [MKTS/GLOB]
Ukrainian officials stressed that Zelenskiy was not predicting an attack on that date, however, but responding with skepticism to foreign media reports pinpointing Wednesday.
The Pentagon said Monday to expect anything but a warning from Putin.
""I won't get into a specific date, I don't think that would be smart. I would just tell you that it is entirely possible that he could move with little to no warning,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) told reporters.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said last week that Russia might not wait until the Winter Olympics in China end on Feb. 20, a reversal of a commonly-held belief that Putin would not want to spoil Chinese President Xi Jinping's big sports event with a war.
The Munich Security Conference in Germany, an international gathering of foreign policy leaders on Feb. 18-20, could be another trigger. The Crimea crisis unfolded while the Munich conference was held in 2014, focused on violent clashes between the government and opposition in Ukraine.

Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters cited ""public conflict over the integrity of 2020's presidential election results"" in announcing her bid for secretary of state.
""Colorado deserves a secretary of state who will stand up to the Biden administration that wants to run our country into the ground with nationalized elections,"" Peters, a Republican, said in a statement.
Numerous courts, state officials and members of Trump's own administration have rejected his claims of widespread voting fraud as false.
The FBI said in August that it had opened an investigation into a suspected security breach of voting equipment in Mesa County - a violation that Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold has accused Peters of facilitating.
Griswold, who de-certified the county's election machines after the breach, said in a statement that Peters was ""unfit"" to hold her position, calling her a ""danger"" to the state's elections.
""She works with election deniers, spreads lies about elections, was removed from overseeing the 2021 Mesa County election, and is under criminal investigation by a grand jury,"" Griswold said.
Peters, who has denied any wrongdoing, announced her candidacy earlier on a show hosted by former Trump advisor Steve Bannon.
Mesa County District Attorney Dan Rubinstein and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser have also revealed a grand jury investigation into the suspected breach, including allegations that equipment was tampered with.
Peters' move comes a few days after Wisconsin state Representative Timothy Ramthun, a Republican who has falsely claimed that Trump won the battleground state over President Joe Biden, launched his candidacy for Wisconsin governor.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Faced with truckers' protests popping up across the nation, and hampering cross border trade, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday became the only Canadian leader since his father 50 years ago to declare a state of emergency in peacetime.
Trudeau unveiled a series of tough measures to tackle funding for the protests, including letting banks freeze accounts linked to the protests without a court order, and said federal police will help end the blockades.
But despite the apparent parallels, historians say there are big differences between Trudeau's announcement and the one his father made in October 1970.
For one, Liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau put troops on the streets after a small militant group of Quebec separatists had kidnapped a diplomat and a provincial cabinet minister.
His son, facing one of the biggest crises since taking office in 2015, made clear that deploying the military was not in the cards as he tried to end protests sparked by truckers opposing COVID-19 vaccine mandates for cross-border trips.
Canada was not facing the kind of public emergency the act had been designed to tackle, said Leah West, a professor and national security expert at Ottawa's Carleton University.
""I'm kind of shocked to be honest that the government of Canada still actually believes that this meets the definition to even invoke the act,"" she told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
Trudeau told reporters he was invoking the 1988 Emergencies Act because law enforcement needed more help. 
""This is about keeping Canadians safe, protecting people's jobs and restoring confidence in our institutions,"" he said.
His father, Pierre Trudeau, took more decisive action after the Quebec kidnappings. Asked by a reporter how far he would go, Trudeau replied ""Just watch me"", which became one of the main catchwords of Canadian politics. 
Three days later he invoked the War Measures Act, the predecessor to the Emergencies Act, and sent troops into Quebec and other provinces. The crisis ended, but only after the separatist group killed the cabinet minister.
""What's striking about this time is we've had no violence, nothing like that,"" said University of Toronto professor emeritus Nelson Wiseman.
Justin Trudeau, asked on Friday about the parallels with his father's experience in 1970, replied that ""my values are deeply informed by the way I've been brought up, not just by my father but by experiences as a Canadian"" before adding that ""every situation is different"".
The Canadian Parliament must approve the use of the measures within seven days and has the power to revoke them.
Shortly after the protests began, ""Emergencies Act"" quickly became a trending topic on social media as some Canadians called for federal government to act, frustrated by what they saw as police inaction.
Canadians also demanded Trudeau use the act in early 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic hit the country to restrict the movement of people and goods. The government did not enact it, saying it was a last resort.

One person happy to draw parallels was Maxime Bernier, leader of the populist People's Party of Canada, who strongly opposes vaccine mandates.
""Trudeau will invoke the Emergencies Act for the first time since his father did so over 50 years ago, not because there is an emergency and a major threat to Canadians' security, but because HE is losing face"", Bernier, who has appeared at the Ottawa protests, tweeted.

The Pilatus PC-12 single-engine passenger plane went down on Sunday afternoon, prompting a search that included a lifeboat crew, helicopter, C-130 aircraft and other assets, Coast Guard spokesperson Edward Wargo said.
A U.S. Marine Corps air traffic controller reported that the plane was seen behaving erratically on radar then disappeared from the screen, the Coast Guard said in a statement.
The search could continue through the night, Wargo said.
The plane crashed into the water about 18 miles (29 km) northeast of Michael J. Smith Field, a public airport in Beaufort, North Carolina, about 2 p.m. (1900 GMT) on Sunday, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement.
The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate, the FAA said.

The National Medical Products Administration said Paxlovid is approved to treat adults who have mild to moderate COVID-19 and high risk of progressing to a severe condition. Further study on the drug needed to be conducted and submitted to the authority, it said.
It is not immediately clear if China is already in talks with Pfizer to procure the pill. 
""This is an important milestone in our fight against COVID-19,"" a Pfizer representative said in a statement, without providing information about procurement.
The approval is a boost to Pfizer which expects $22 billion in 2022 sales of the treatment.
Pfizer executives have said the company is in active discussions with over 100 countries about Paxlovid, and has the capacity to provide 120 million courses if needed.
While a number of vaccines are available worldwide to help prevent infection and serious illness, including one made by Pfizer, there are limited treatment options for people infected with COVID-19.
Pfizer in December said final trial results showed its treatment reduced the chance of hospitalisation or death by 89% in COVID-19 patients at risk of severe illness given the treatment within three days of the onset of symptoms, and by 88% when given within five days of onset.
The United States is paying around $530 for each course of Paxlovid and $700 for each course of rival COVID-19 pill molnupiravir developed by Merck & Co. 
China has kept daily number of new COVID-19 patients with confirmed symptoms to below 250, and sometimes fewer than 10, in the past year. 

The number is small for its 1.4 billion population and by global standards, thanks to China's approach of quickly containing any local flare-ups as soon as possible and its weeks-long quarantine requirement for most travellers arriving from abroad. 
China has yet to approve any COVID-19 vaccines developed by foreign drugmakers but has vaccinated 87.1% of its entire population by Feb. 7 using several domestically developed shots.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A former U.S. Navy engineer charged with attempting to sell secrets about nuclear submarines to a foreign power pleaded guilty on Monday as part of a deal with prosecutors.
A U.S. Justice Department lawyer unveiled the agreement with nuclear engineer Jonathan Toebbe during a court hearing in West Virginia federal court.
Toebbe, 42, admitted to conspiring with his wife to disclose restricted data, a violation of the Atomic Energy Act that carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.
Toebbe's 45-year-old wife, Diana, who was charged with helping her husband, is still facing criminal charges. She has pleaded not guilty.
Toebbe's plea agreement calls for him to face a likely sentence of between 12 years to 17 years in prison.
The plea deal ""indicates that the government likely had a very strong case and saw this conduct as posing a very serious risk to national security,"" said Brandon Van Grack, a national security lawyer at Morrison & Foerster not involved in the case.
Prosecutors alleged in an October indictment that the Toebbes tried to sell government secrets about nuclear submarine propulsion to an unidentified foreign country. 
Toebbe, who had a top-secret security clearance, communicated with an undercover FBI agent posing as a foreign official over the course of several months, the Justice Department said.
At one point, Toebbe hid a digital memory card containing documents about submarine nuclear reactors in half a peanut butter sandwich at a ""dead drop"" location in West Virginia while his wife acted as lookout, the Justice Department said.

The memory card contained ""militarily sensitive design elements, operating parameters and performance characteristics of Virginia-class submarine reactors,"" according to the Justice Department.
An FBI agent testified during a court hearing in October that Toebbe asked for $5 million worth of cryptocurrency in exchange for the secret submarine information. A payment made by the FBI to Toebbe worth about $100,000 has not been located, the agent testified.

LONDON/TORONTO (Reuters) -A website devoted to disseminating leaked data says it was given reams of information about donors to a Canadian movement opposed to pandemic health measures after a fundraising platform popular with supporters of the group allegedly suffered a hack.
Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDoS) said on its website late on Sunday that it had 30 megabytes of donor information from the U.S.-based Christian fundraising site GiveSendGo, including names, email addresses, ZIP codes and internet protocol addresses. 
The funding of the Canadian protests has emerged as a key point of interest as authorities in Ottawa and elsewhere try to get a grip on rallies led by truckers that have been blockading cities and border crossings across Canada with demands that include the deposition of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. 
In an email on Monday, a GiveSendGo spokesperson said that the site was still soliciting donations to the ""Freedom Convoy 2022"" campaign and that donations were not being refunded. The spokesperson did not immediately comment on the hack itself.
The site, however, appeared to be offline. Website visitors were met with a message that it was under maintenance and ""we will be back very soon."" 
GiveSendGo had previously asserted it was not subject to a Canadian court order that froze these funds.
A journalist at the Daily Dot digital news outlet said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that the GiveSendGo site suffered a hack overnight and had its front page briefly replaced by a clip from the movie ""Frozen"" and a manifesto accusing it of supporting ""an insurrection in Ottawa."" 
Reuters could neither immediately confirm the hack nor the leak claims, although Distributed Denial of Secrets has a long record of hosting leaked data from right-wing organizations, including the far-right Patriot Front and the Oath Keepers.
DDoS said that because the donor information contained sensitive personal information, it would not be making the data available publicly but would instead be offering it to ""journalists and researchers."" 
DDoS describes itself as a non-profit devoted to enabling the free transmission of data in the public interest.

GiveSendGo became a prime conduit for money to the protesters after mainstream crowdfunding platform GoFundMe blocked donations to the self-declared Freedom Convoy. Earlier this month the group said it had raised $8 million for the protests.
North America's busiest trade link reopened for traffic late on Sunday, ending a six-day blockade, Canada Border Services Agency said, after Canadian police cleared the protesters fighting to end COVID-19 restrictions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Monday it was extending its target date to complete an environmental review of the proposed SpaceX Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket program in Boca Chica, Texas, to March 28.
The FAA's previous target date was Feb. 28. The FAA noted that completing the environmental review does not guarantee that a vehicle operator license will be issued, which must also meet FAA safety, risk and financial responsibility requirements.
More than 19,000 public comments were received on the draft environmental review by FAA, which said it ""is continuing consultation and coordination with other agencies.""
SpaceX founder Elon Musk said on Thursday he was ""highly confident"" his new SpaceX Starship, designed for voyages to the moon and Mars, will reach Earth orbit for the first time this year.
The FAA is deciding whether the planned build-out in Texas poses a significant environmental impact to the area - including an adjacent wildlife reserve - and must therefore undergo a far more extensive study before expanded operations at SpaceX's rocket production facility and spaceport in Boca Chica can be licensed.
Asked Thursday what he knew about the status of the FAA review, Musk said, ""We don't have a ton of insight into where things stand with the FAA. We have gotten sort of a rough indication there may be an approval in March. But that's all we know.""
Even in a ""worst-case"" scenario, in which a full environmental impact statement were required or legal wrangling over the issue threatened to drag on, Musk said SpaceX has a fall-back plan.
The company would shift its entire Starship program to the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, where SpaceX already has received the environmental approval it needs, Musk said.

Such a move would cause a setback of six to eight months, he added.
In any case, SpaceX is still shooting for a 2023 launch of what it calls the world's first private lunar mission, flying aboard a Starship to loop around the moon and return to Earth.

The United States will free up half of the $7 billion in frozen Afghan central bank assets on U.S. soil to help Afghans struggling with a humanitarian crisis and hold the rest to possibly satisfy terrorism-related lawsuits against the Taliban.
""If the United States does not deviate from its position and continues its provocative actions, the Islamic Emirate will also be forced to reconsider its policy towards the country,"" said a statement from the Taliban released by its spokesman on Monday.
""The Islamic Emirate strongly rejects Biden's unjustified actions as a violation of the rights of all Afghans,"" it added.
Biden's plan calls for half of the funds to remain in the United States subject to ongoing litigation by U.S. victims of terrorism, including relatives of those who died in the Sept. 11, 2001, hijacking attacks.
""The 9/11 attacks had nothing to do with Afghans,"" the Taliban statement said.
While none of the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackers were Afghan, the mastermind of the attacks, al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, was given refuge by the then Taliban government.
The statement said the United States will face ""international blame"" and damage its relations with Afghans if the decision was not reversed. 
Separately, in an interview to Afghan state media RTA, Mullah Yaqoob - the acting Afghan defence minister and the son of Taliban founder Mullah Omar - also termed the decision ""cruel"". 

""No Afghan was involved in that incident (9/11) at all,"" said Yaqoob, whose father was the Taliban's supreme leader at the time of the attacks and refused to hand over bin Laden, following which the United States sent in its military to Afghanistan.
The invasion started a 20-year war that ended only last year after the United States and other international militaries pulled out of Afghanistan, leaving the Taliban to take over once again.

With his team trailing late in the game, Kupp came to the rescue in a 79-yard drive during which he converted a fourth down and caught four passes, including his second touchdown of the game with 85 seconds left in a 23-20 win.
Kupp finished the game with eight catches for 92 yards and two touchdowns, the first which came early in the second quarter and gave the hometown Rams a 10-point lead.
""Just the perfect team, the perfect setup. I'm just so thankful for everyone that's been around me,"" Kupp, who is only the eighth wide receiver to be named Super Bowl MVP, told reporters. ""It still really hasn't hit me.""
Kupp, who was drafted 69th overall by Los Angeles in 2017, entered the playoffs fresh off one of his most dominant regular seasons, as he became the first player since 2005 to lead the NFL in receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns.
The 28-year-old Kupp was just as efficient in the playoffs and found a way to come through in the Super Bowl even though an injury to Rams receiver Odell Beckham Jr. in the first half allowed the Bengals' secondary to double-team him.
One the Rams' final drive, with the Bengals doing everything in their power to contain Kupp, he managed to make four catches for 39 yards and drew several penalties that helped set up the one-yard touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford.

When presented with the MVP award on the field, Kupp deflected the praise and credited his performance to those around him.
""Man, just so proud of this team, the way we prepared, the way we loved on each other, trusted each other,"" Kupp said. ""I don't know. I just don't feel deserving of this. God is just so good.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In the past year, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has deployed thousands of National Guard troops to the southern U.S. border, begun building a new border barrier, and arrested migrants for allegedly trespassing on private property.
The two-term Republican governor has taken the lead in opposing Democratic President Joe Biden's immigration reforms, earning him an endorsement by former President Donald Trump. 
But as Abbott runs for a third term, conservative candidates challenging him in a March 1 Republican nominating contest contend he is still not tough enough on illegal immigration.
Allen West, a former Republican U.S. congressman, says Texas should arrest and deport immigrants who enter the United States illegally - something states do not have the power to do - if the federal government refuses to act. The ""porous border"" shows how Abbott's approach has failed, West argues.
Don Huffines, a businessman and former state senator, wants to close Texas' bridges with Mexico to most inbound traffic and deploy the entirety of the state's National Guard to the border.
Abbott spokesperson Renae Eze rejected criticism of the governor's immigration record, saying that Texas had been forced to step up after Biden ""abdicated"" his responsibilities to safeguard the border. 
While opinion polls show Abbott has a sizable lead over both West and Huffines, he will likely face the most competitive gubernatorial primary of his career. The attacks from his right flank show how even the staunchest Republican border hawks face pressure to be ever more stringent on the issue in the run-up to the election.
Trump rewrote the party's immigration playbook after he successfully campaigned in 2016 on building a border wall and blocking the entry of refugees, often employing nativist language to describe his goals. The current election cycle shows Trump's influence persists even after losing the presidency in 2020 - and that some candidates are going further.
""No issue grabs the attention of Republicans like immigration and border security do,"" said James Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas. Republican primary voters have a seemingly ""unlimited appetite"" for tough immigration measures, Henson added. 
CALLS FOR MORE ACTION
Some 68% of Republicans in Texas say border security or immigration are the top issues facing the state, according to an October 2021 University of Texas poll. And while Republicans broadly approve of Abbott's immigration policies, according to surveys, the polling suggests they want even more action.
The tougher border proposals pushed by Abbott's challengers demonstrate how Republican candidates are trying to out-Trump each other on an issue that remains a powerful galvanizing force for the party's primary voters, despite economic issues and tensions around COVID policies dominating headlines.
And for Republicans in competitive primaries, a tough stance on immigration is a way to differentiate themselves without risking backlash from voters, said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist.
Republicans across the country have made immigration a major focus heading into the Nov. 8 congressional election, where Democrats risk losing control of Congress, stymieing Biden's legislative agenda.
Candidates can tap into voter outrage over record-high attempted border crossings and the cost of providing public services to migrants, a message amplified by the country's popular conservative media like Fox News.
Liberal advocacy groups say Republicans are demonizing migrants who come to the United States seeking refuge, distorting the economic effects of immigration, and trying to capitalize on xenophobic fears over the fate of the country's white majority.
'EVERY STATE IS A BORDER STATE'
As Republican candidates work to burnish their hardline immigration credentials, some are turning to Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump's restrictive immigration agenda.
Miller is formally advising Republican hedge fund CEO David McCormick (NYSE:MKC) in his campaign for a U.S. Senate seat in Pennsylvania and informally speaking with other candidates, he told Reuters.
McCormick last week visited the Arizona town of Yuma near the Mexican border - some 2,400 miles (3,900 km) from Pennsylvania's capital Harrisburg. ""Every state is a border state when Joe Biden and his administration incentivize illegal immigration,"" he said in a written statement.
In Arizona, Kari Lake, the Trump-endorsed Republican frontrunner for governor, agrees with Texas' border crackdown but has vowed to go further.
Lake, a former anchor at a local Fox affiliate in Arizona, wants to forge an alliance among like-minded states to deport immigrants in the United States illegally, which is a federal responsibility.
Some Republican primary candidates are even taking aim at legal immigration, once a major plank of the party's pro-business stance. 
""We need to have a full immigration moratorium,"" said Trump-endorsed Joe Kent, an Army veteran running in a Washington state primary against U.S. Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler.

It remains to be seen if enough voters will back the hardliners. Lake narrowly leads the field of Republican candidates for Arizona governor. McCormick entered the race for the U.S. Senate seat in Pennsylvania about a month ago and public polling has yet to gauge his standing.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Sport's highest court on Monday cleared 15-year-old Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva to continue competing in the Beijing Winter Olympics, but the teenager's doping charge remained a stain on the Games.
No Olympic medals will be awarded at the women's singles event on Thursday if Valieva finishes in the top three, with Games chiefs saying they would only present the prizes once her doping case was resolved.
The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) upheld an earlier decision by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) to lift a ban on Valieva.
The skating prodigy took to the Beijing ice half an hour after the CAS ruling, executing a flawless practice run of the short programme she will skate in Tuesday's women's singles, the first day of the two-skate event.
CAS cited the fact that Valieva was a ""protected person"" under World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) rules as one of the ""exceptional circumstances"" underpinning its decision.
Preventing Valieva from competing at the Olympics would have caused the teenager irreparable harm, CAS said in its ruling.
The figure skater is one of the youngest athletes to face a doping charge during an Olympics, prompting global outrage at the role of the adults around her and the continuing scourge of Russian doping in international sports.
The CAS ruling drew mixed reactions.
""Let's go Kamila!"" Russian ice dancer Nikita Katsalapov said at the Capital Indoor Stadium after winning a silver medal and learning about the decision.
In contrast, Sarah Hirshland, CEO of the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee, said in a statement after the ruling: ""This appears to be another chapter in the systematic and pervasive disregard for clean sport by Russia.""
WADA said it was disappointed with the ruling which was not in accordance with its own code.
""The doping of children is evil and unforgivable,"" WADA President Witold Banka told Reuters. ""My message to clean athletes is that we will do everything to investigate this case properly.""
DOPING NOT ADDRESSED
The CAS ruling did not address the merits of Valieva's drug case. That now sits in the hands of anti-doping authorities.
No timeline nL8N2UP3HT has been given for adjudicating her case. Many fear it will not be resolved by the end of the Games.
WADA said it was up to RUSADA to first hold a hearing on the positive drug test.
""As it does for every case, WADA will review the outcome to make sure it is in line with the code and, if appropriate, can appeal the case to CAS,"" it said.
The Russian Olympic Committee called for a ""full and impartial"" investigation into the case.
U.S. Anti-Doping Agency CEO Travis Tygart said: ""Only time will tell if she (Valieva) should be competing in these Games and whether or not all of her results will be disqualified"".
IOC spokesman Mark Adams said the awarding of medals for the team event could not go ahead until the doping case was addressed. The IOC said in a statement that it would be inappropriate for the ceremony to take place during the Games.
The U.S. came second in the team event, with Japan third. Canada finished fourth.
The Kremlin said it hoped Valieva and her team mates would receive their medals soon. 
LATE NOTIFICATION
Valieva tested positive for the banned heart medication Trimetazidine on Dec. 25 at the Russian National Championships, but the result was not revealed until Feb. 8 after she had competed in the team event at the Winter Games.
The Russian dazzled the skating world by becoming the first person ever to successfully land quad jumps in the women's Olympic competition.
CAS emphasised the ""serious issues of untimely notification of the results"" in its decision.
""Such late notification was not her fault, in the middle of the Olympic Winter Games,"" the ruling said.
WADA blamed RUSADA for not asking the laboratory to fast-track Valieva's sample in order for it to be analysed before the Olympics.
""According to information received by WADA, the sample in this case was not flagged by RUSADA as being a priority sample when it was received by the anti-doping laboratory in Stockholm, Sweden,"" it said.
""This meant the laboratory did not know to fast-track the analysis of this sample.""
Tygart said it was another case of Russia not following the rules.
""In addition to athletes and the public, this young athlete has been terribly let down by the Russians and the global anti-doping system that unfairly cast her into this chaos,"" he said.

American former Olympic champion Tara Lipinski posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR): ""At the end of the day, there was a positive test and there is no question in my mind that she should not be allowed to compete. 
""Regardless of age or timing of the test/results. I believe this will leave a permanent scar on our sport.""

Gun-control advocate Manuel Oliver unfurled a sign that read ""45K people died from gun violence on your watch"" above a picture of his son Joaquin Oliver. The teenager was among 17 people killed in the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, the deadliest high school shooting in the United States. 
""The whole world will listen to Joaquin today. He has a very important message,"" Oliver said in a video he posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) as he wore a helmet and safety gear from atop the 150-foot (46 m) crane as police officers watched below. 
Oliver added that he has yet to get a meeting he had requested with President Joe Biden. 
Biden said in a statement on Monday that his administration has working to reduce gun crime by curbing the number of untraceable guns, cracking down on gun dealers who violate the law and promoting safe firearm storage. 
""As we remember those lost in Parkland, we also stand with Americans in every corner of our country who have lost loved ones to gun violence or had their lives forever altered by a shooting,"" he said. 
The accused shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was a former student who had been expelled from Parkland. He opened fire on Feb. 14, 2018, with an AR-15-style rifle inside the South Florida high school, killing 14 students and three staff members and injuring 17 others. 
Cruz pleaded guilty in October to 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted murder. A jury will decide if he faces the death penalty or spends the rest of his life in prison without parole during a sentencing trial starting in April.

Like many other Parkland parents and students, Oliver has become a vocal advocate against gun violence since the shooting, calling on federal lawmakers to address the issue. The 54-year-old artist has also traveled across the country, building ""Walls of Demand"" murals in honor of his son.
""As we mark this day of solemn remembrance, and every day, let us renew our commitment to ending the horrors of gun violence, restoring safety to our schools, workplaces and houses of worship,"" U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement.

LONDON (Reuters) - Russian mercenaries with ties to Moscow's spies have increased their presence in Ukraine in recent weeks, stoking fears among some NATO members that Russia could try to engineer a pretext for an invasion, three senior Western security sources said.
    They said their concerns had strengthened in recent weeks that a Russian incursion into Ukraine could be preceded by an information war, and cyber attacks on Ukraine's critical infrastructure such as electricity and gas networks.
    Russia could also use the mercenaries to sow discord and paralyse Ukraine through targeted assassinations and the use of specialised weaponry, the sources said.
The United States warned again on Sunday that Russia could stage a ""false flag"" operation inside Ukraine to justify an invasion.    
    ""It is likely that Russian mercenaries, under the direction of the Russian state, will be involved in any hostilities in Ukraine, potentially including a pretext for an invasion,"" said one Western security source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
    The Western security sources said mercenaries were deploying from Russian private military companies (PMCs) with close ties to the Federal Security Service (FSB), the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB, and the GRU military intelligence agency.
    Among those deployed in recent weeks was a former GRU officer who also worked in the Wagner mercenary group. The former officer has gone to Donetsk, one of two regions in eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russian separatists since 2014, the sources said.
    Reuters was unable to ascertain what the former officer, whose identity was not provided, had been tasked with doing. Reuters was also unable to reach the Wagner Group for comment. 
The Kremlin told Reuters on Monday that Russia was not strengthening its presence on Ukrainian territory and that Russian troops had never been present there and were not now. 
The Russian Defence Ministry declined to comment when asked in writing on Friday about the Western allegations. 
    The Russian mercenary groups have supplied weapons, experienced special operations personnel and military training to pro-Russian militias in eastern Ukraine, the sources said. 
    The sources also told Reuters that some operatives of the Wagner mercenary group have been embedded on the Ukrainian border after training at a GRU base near the southern Russian city of Krasnodar.
    Reuters was unable to independently verify the information about the activities of Russian mercenaries in eastern Ukraine.
Other Russian mercenary groups linked to the FSB and GRU have also increased their activities in Ukraine since the start of the year, the sources said.
    Reuters could not reach the mercenary groups in Ukraine for comment. 
    'HYBRID WAR
    The United States has expressed fears that Russia could use mercenaries, special operations forces and other grey-zone warfare techniques to delegitimize Kyiv ahead of invasion, several U.S. officials told Reuters. 
    The Pentagon referred Reuters to remarks by Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) who said earlier this month that Russia was seeking to fabricate a pretext for an invasion.
    Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Wagner and other private groups neither represent the Russian state nor are paid by it, though he says they have a right to operate provided they do not break Russian law.

    The European Union imposed sanctions on Wagner last year, accusing it of fuelling violence, looting natural resources and destabilising countries around the world.    
    Russia denies it plans to annex another part of Ukraine and Putin says the West is sowing hysteria in a crude attempt to lure Russia into war after ignoring the Kremlin's concerns about NATO enlargement after the Cold War.

VIENNA (Reuters) -Iran is ""in a hurry"" to strike a new nuclear accord as long as its national interests are protected, its foreign minister said on Monday as Tehran and the United States resumed indirect talks on salvaging Tehran's 2015 agreement with world powers.
The talks, with European intermediaries shuttling between the two, have been held in Vienna since April amid growing Western fears about Tehran’s accelerating nuclear advances, seen by Western powers as irreversible unless a deal is struck soon. 
The 2015 deal limited Iran’s enrichment of uranium to make it harder for Tehran to develop material for nuclear weapons, in return for a lifting of international sanctions against Tehran.
But it has eroded since 2018 when then-President Donald Trump withdrew the United States and reimposed far-reaching sanctions on Iran. The Islamic Republic has since breached the deal's limits and gone well beyond, rebuilding stockpiles of enriched uranium, refining it to higher fissile purity and installing advanced centrifuges to speed up output.
""Iran is in a hurry to reach agreement in Vienna..., but this should be within the framework of our national interest,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian told a news conference in Tehran.
He urged Western powers to stop ""playing with time"".
Western leaders say time is running out for a viable accord and have accusing Iran of stalling to increase its leverage.
Parties involved in the talks, which resumed last week after a 10-day break, have voiced hope about restoring the pact despite what Tehran has said are ""key outstanding issues that require political decisions by the West"". 
""Talks are not at a dead end...Iran has already taken its political decision by staying in the deal despite the U.S. withdrawal,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said. 
REMAINING GAPS 
A senior Iranian official told Reuters that ""some 30% of difficult issues remain to be resolved but it is possible to reach a deal by early March"". A Western diplomat said ""reaching a deal is possible around early March, if all goes well."" 
After eight rounds of talks, key bones of contention include Iran’s demand for a U.S. guarantee of no more sanctions or other punitive steps in future, and how and when to restore verifiable restrictions on Iran’s nuclear activity.
A second Iranian official said Tehran was also insisting on being able to seal and store its advanced centrifuges inside Iran, rather than dismantling and sending them abroad, as Western powers have called for. 
He said Iran further wants the removal of some 300 extra sanctions on Iranian entities and individuals not related to the nuclear deal. 

U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has said it will remove curbs inconsistent with the 2015 pact if Iran resumes compliance with it, implying Washington would leave in place sanctions imposed under terrorism or human rights measures.
U.S. officials have said the Biden administration cannot guarantee that a U.S. government would never renege on the agreement because it is classified as a non-binding political understanding, not a legally binding treaty.

BEIJING (Reuters) - The world's top anti-doping authority will investigate the entourage of 15-year-old Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva who tested positive for a banned drug, plunging her into a doping scandal at the Beijing Winter Olympics.
Valieva, whose Olympic future will be decided after a Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) hearing that started at 8:30 p.m. Beijing time (1230 GMT), effortlessly completed a clean run-through of her short programme in practice on Sunday. 
Watching from the sidelines were her three coaches, Eteri Tutberidze, Sergei Dudakov and Daniil Gleikhengauz, as well as the team doctor Filipp Shvetsky and a physiotherapist.
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) said in a statement to Reuters on Sunday that it would ask its independent Intelligence and Investigations Department to investigate the coaches, doctors and other adults surrounding the athlete.
Earlier, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it had formally asked WADA to launch an investigation. 
WADA also said that the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) has indicated it had already started investigating the entourage because Valieva is a minor. 
From the hotel where the athlete's fate was being decided, CAS Director General Matthieu Reeb told reporters that he expected Valieva to testify via video link and that the hearing could go on all night.
""We don't know how long it will take,"" Reeb said. ""It could be a long night. We have many parties involved. All are represented by lawyers.""
The athletes and all parties involved would testify via video link. 
""All the lawyers, all the parties will be on video. The athlete will be on-line and will testify on-line,"" Reeb said. ""We suppose she will speak in Russian and we will have an interpreter.
""We can expect it will be a long night. After the meeting we will tell the media when we will announce the final decision. It will be tomorrow afternoon but at what time we don't exactly know yet,"" he said.
BANNED HEART DRUG
Valieva tested positive for a banned heart drug at her national championships last December, but it took more than six weeks for her to be notified, allowing her to compete in Beijing.
Her future at the Games, and a gold for the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) in the team event that she dominated on Monday, now hang in the balance amid a global outcry over Moscow's doping history.
Tutberidze, the most sought-after figure skating coach in Russia, has not responded to Reuters emails. 
On Saturday, she said she was certain Valieva was ""clean and innocent"" in an interview with Russian state television.
At 15, Valieva is one of the youngest athletes to have a positive test revealed at the Olympics, prompting outrage and questions about the role of the adults around her and the continuing scourge of Russian doping in international sport.
The IOC set up the entourage commission in 2010 as positive drug cases of athletes mounted in the 2000s, especially with the re-testing of samples of past Olympics.
Russia's state-backed doping scandal after the 2014 Sochi Olympics made more apparent that athletes often did not act alone but were supported by a network, including medics, coaches, agents and family and friends.
The commission can sanction individuals for a number of violations that include doping, unsportsmanlike conduct and harassment. Sanctions can range from reprimands to permanent exclusion from the Olympics.
On Sunday, however, it was Valieva's future at the Games that was being debated. A panel of three judges for CAS were hearing arguments from the IOC, WADA and International Skating Union to reinstate a ban lifted by the Russian Anti-Doping Authority on Feb. 9.
At stake is Valieva's entry in the women's singles event on Tuesday. CAS has said it will notify all parties on Monday.

The fate of the gold medal that has not been awarded for the Feb. 7 women's team event is likely to take longer to clear up. The United States and Japan are also waiting in the wings for their medals.
""The athletes are a bit disappointed that they have to wait for the medal ceremony to happen -– they had really worked so hard for that medal,"" said Japan's chef de mission, Hidehito Ito.

(Reuters) - Federal prosecutors are expected to tell a jury on Monday why they have brought hate-crimes charges against three white men who were convicted of murdering Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, in a mostly white neighborhood in Georgia in 2020.
A state court found Travis McMichael, 36, his father Gregory McMichael, 66, and neighbor, William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52, guilty of murder and other charges. All were sentenced to life in prison, with only Bryan given possibility of parole after 30 years.
Now they are on trial for federal hate-crimes charges in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia.
WHAT IS A FEDERAL HATE CRIME?
A federal hate crime is a criminal act committed based on race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, and or gender identity.
GREGORY MCMICHAEL 
* Interference with rights - a hate crime - specifically for ""willfully, by force and threat of force, injure, intimidate and interfere with Ahmaud Arbery, an African American man, because of Arbery's race and color."" The charge carries a maximum of life in prison.
* Attempted kidnapping, punishable by 20 years in prison.

(Reuters) - Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, was jogging through a mostly white neighborhood on Feb. 23, 2020, when he was chased by three white men in two trucks, and shot and killed about two miles (3.2 km) from his mother's house near Brunswick (NYSE:BC), Georgia. 
His killing sparked national outrage when cellphone video of the shooting emerged months later and the public learned that local authorities had declined to arrest his pursuers. 
The men who chased Arbery told police they thought he committed a crime and were trying to make a citizen's arrest. The men were all convicted in state court last year for murder and now face a federal hate-crimes trial.
WHO WAS AHMAUD ARBERY?
Ahmaud Marquez Arbery was a lifelong resident of the coastal, south Georgia city of Brunswick. He was known as ""Maud"" or ""Quez"" to his friends, and was the son of Marcus Arbery Sr. and Wanda Cooper-Jones. He had a big, easy smile and ran every day unless there was a drenching rain, his family said.
Arbery worked long hours at a truck washing company and at his father's landscaping business. He'd frequently be seen by neighbors lifting weights in his mother's driveway or playing basketball. He often sang freestyle rap.
FOOTBALL DREAMS
Arbery was a former linebacker for his high school football team, the Brunswick Pirates. Despite lacking the typical heft of a linebacker, his speed and agility on the field made him a local star. He once dreamed of playing for the National Football League, but at 5-foot-10 (1.8 meters) he wasn't big enough, his family said.
His coach at Brunswick High School, where Arbery graduated in 2012, retired his football jersey, No. 21, in honor of the star player at a ceremony in 2020.
LEGAL TROUBLES
Arbery had a few brushes with the law, incidents that his family says he was putting behind him.
In 2013, a year after graduating from high school, he went back on campus to attend a basketball game and was found with a pistol in his waistband. He was given five years of probation.
In 2017, he was arrested for attempted shoplifting of a television from a local Walmart (NYSE:WMT). A judge extended the term of his original probation, which he was still serving when he died, court records show.
Defense attorneys wanted to tell the jury about those incidents, but the judge said no, ruling that the defendants could not have known anything about Arbery's legal troubles or probation status.
FUTURE

Apart from his football dreams, Arbery wanted to become an electrician, following in the footsteps of three of his uncles, his family said. 
Right after high school, he attended South Georgia Technical College for about a year and half but dropped out when money got tight. His aunt, Theawanza Brooks, said that Arbery had been saving up to continue his studies.

INGLEWOOD, Calif. (Reuters) -The Los Angeles Rams rallied late to beat the Cincinnati Bengals 23-20 on Sunday to deliver a Hollywood ending to the Super Bowl, securing the franchise's first championship since returning to the West Coast six years ago. 
With his back against the wall, Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford kept his poise to engineer a 15-play drive that ended with a one-yard touchdown pass to Super Bowl MVP Cooper Kupp with 1:25 left to play. 
Rams defensive lineman Aaron Donald wrapped up Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow on the final play to seal the win under the lights of the team's home field. 
""I'm just so happy,"" an emotional Donald said after the game. 
""I wanted this so bad. I dreamed this, man. I feel amazing. It's surreal, look at this,"" he said as confetti rained down on the veteran lineman and his teammates.
RESILIENT RAMS
The Rams were forced to dig deep after they lost star wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. to a knee injury in the second quarter and fell behind 20-13 in the third. 
The ability to overcome setbacks is what makes the team special, head coach Sean McVay told reporters.
""I can't say enough about the resilience of this team,"" McVay said. 
""Guys stepped up when they had to. That's what makes this team great. That's why they are world champs."" 
With the victory, the Rams joined last year's Tampa Bay Buccaneers as the only teams to win a Super Bowl on their home field. 
The franchise's only other Super Bowl championship came 22 years ago when they were based in St. Louis. The win also helps ease the pain of finishing runner-up to New England three years ago.
The Rams drew first blood on Sunday when Beckham made a leaping grab in the end zone for a 7-0 lead to ignite the blue-and-gold clad Rams fans on a hot day in Inglewood. 
The Rams added to their lead when Stafford found Kupp in the corner of the end zone for a touchdown in the second quarter, but a bad hold by Johnny Hekker denied the team the extra point as the Rams took a 13-3 advantage. 
The Bengals responded with a 75-yard drive capped when running back Joe Mixon threw a touchdown pass to Tee Higgins over the fooled Rams secondary to cut the deficit to 13-10, a score that held until halftime. 
BENGALS BOUNCE BACK
The second half could not have started any better for the Bengals as Burrow uncorked a 75-yard touchdown strike to Higgins on the first offensive play after the break.
Higgins appeared to pull Rams cornerback Jalen Ramsey down by the face mask before making the catch but no flag was thrown and the Bengals took their first lead of the game, 17-13. 
Moments later, Stafford's pass bounced off the hands of receiver Ben Skowronek and ended up in the arms of Chidobe Awuzie for an interception that led to a Bengals field goal and a 20-13 lead. 
A Matt Gay field goal cut the Cincinnati advantage to four points and the high-powered Rams defense finally began to put pressure on Burrow, sacking him for a seventh time in a play that saw the young quarterback come up hobbled and holding his right knee.
Burrow remained in the game but was unable to outduel Stafford down the stretch. 
""It hurts,"" Burrow told reporters. 
""We put a lot of work into going out and executing and performing well, and it didn't turn out the way we wanted, so it's disappointing.""
The action played out in front of a full house of more than 70,000 fans. Last year's Super Bowl in Tampa was limited to 25,000 spectators due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The game also marked the coming out party for the new $5.5 billion SoFi Stadium, which is set to host major sporting events including World Cup matches in 2026 and the Olympics in 2028.

The temperature at kickoff was 82 degrees Fahrenheit (28 degrees Celsius), two degrees short of the record for a Super Bowl. Inside the unique stadium, which has no walls or air conditioning but does have a semi-translucent roof, it was toasty but pleasant. 
Next year's Super Bowl will be held on Feb. 12 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.

WASHINGTON/KYIV (Reuters) -Russia could invade Ukraine at any time and might create a surprise pretext for an attack, the United States said on Sunday, as it reaffirmed a pledge to defend ""every inch"" of NATO territory.
Russia has more than 100,000 troops massed near Ukraine, which is not part of the Atlantic military alliance, and Washington - while keeping open the diplomatic channels that have so far failed to ease the crisis - has repeatedly said an invasion is imminent.
Moscow denies any such plans and has accused the West of ""hysteria"".
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, on the eve of a trip that takes him to Kyiv on Monday and Moscow for talks with President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, called for Russia to de-escalate and warned of sanctions if Moscow did invade. 
A German official said Berlin did not expect ""concrete results https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-hopes-putin-meet-will-yield-insight-into-his-aims-govt-source-2022-02-13"" but diplomacy was important.
In what could amount to a major concession to Moscow, Ukraine's ambassador to Britain told the BBC Kyiv could drop its bid to join NATO to avoid war.
Ambassador Vadym Prystaiko was quoted as saying Ukraine was willing to be ""flexible"" over its goal to join the Atlantic military alliance.
""We might - especially being threatened like that, blackmailed by that, and pushed to it,"" Prystaiko was quoted as saying when asked if Kyiv could change its position on NATO membership.
In Washington, President Joe Biden's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said an invasion could begin ""any day now"".
""We cannot perfectly predict the day, but we have now been saying for some time that we are in the window,"" Sullivan told CNN.
U.S. officials said they could not confirm reports that U.S. intelligence indicated Russia planned to invade on Wednesday.
Sullivan said Washington would continue sharing what it learned with the world in order to deny Moscow the chance to stage a surprise ""false flag"" operation that could be a pretext for an attack.
It would also ""defend every inch of NATO territory ... and Russia we think fully understands that message,"" Sullivan added in a separate CBS interview.
Biden spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday and they agreed on the importance of continuing to pursue diplomacy and deterrence in response to Russia’s military build-up, the White House said after the call.
Zelenskiy's office said he invited Biden to visit Ukraine soon. The White House declined to comment.
Agreeing with the U.S. assessment that an invasion could happen ""at any moment,"" a British government spokesperson said Britain was working on a package of military support and economic aid for Ukraine to be announced in coming days. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will make a trip to Europe later this week to build support to end the standoff with Russia.
Biden told Putin in a phone call https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-putin-speak-ukraine-warnings-mount-2022-02-12 on Saturday that the West would respond decisively to any invasion and such an attack would harm and isolate Moscow. 
Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that Kyiv had so far received almost 1,500 tonnes of ammunition from allies delivered on 17 flights, including about 180 tonnes from the United States.
Canada's defense ministry said it has temporarily withdrawn its Ukraine-based military personnel to an undisclosed location in Europe. Canada, which is home to the world's third-largest Ukrainian population after Ukraine and Russia, has kept a 200-strong training mission in western Ukraine since 2015.
RUSSIAN SECURITY DEMANDS
The Kremlin said Putin told Biden during their call on Saturday that Washington had failed to take Russia's main concerns into account, and that it had received no ""substantial answer"" on key elements of its security demands.
Putin wants guarantees from the United States and NATO that include blocking Ukraine's entry into NATO, refraining from missile deployments near Russia's borders and scaling back NATO's military infrastructure in Europe to 1997 levels.
Washington regards many of the proposals as non-starters but has pushed the Kremlin to discuss them jointly with Washington and its European allies.
""The diplomatic path remains open. The way for Moscow to show that it wants to pursue that path is simple,"" U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken https://www.reuters.com/world/blinken-says-risk-russian-invasion-high-enough-justify-us-embassy-drawdown-2022-02-13 said after he held talks on Saturday with Asian allies.
Washington and its European allies and others have been scaling back or evacuating embassy staff and urging citizens to depart immediately or avoid travel to Ukraine.
U.S. staff at the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) began leaving https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-staff-osce-begins-pullout-donetsk-eastern-ukraine-2022-02-13 by car from the rebel-held city of Donetsk in east Ukraine on Sunday, a Reuters witness said.
The OSCE conducts operations in Ukraine including a civilian monitoring mission in Russian-backed, self-proclaimed separatist republics in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where a war that began in 2014 has killed more than 14,000 people.
Ukraine said on Sunday it wanted talks with Russia and members of the OSCE within 48 hours to discuss Russia's military build-up. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Moscow had not responded after Kyiv on Friday invoked a part of the Vienna Document, a set of security agreements, to demand Moscow explain its military activities.
Dutch carrier KLM said https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-sees-no-point-closing-its-airspace-presidential-adviser-says-2022-02-13 it would stop flying to Ukraine and Germany's Lufthansa said it was considering suspending flights.
An adviser to Zelenskiy, Mykhailo Podolyak, said that regardless of what airlines chose to do Kyiv would not close its airspace as that would resemble ""a kind of partial blockade"".

A French presidency official said on Saturday, after President Emmanuel Macron spoke with Putin, that there were no indications from what the Russian leader said that Moscow was preparing an offensive, though Paris remained ""extremely vigilant"".
British defence minister Ben Wallace cautioned against putting too much hope in talks, telling The Sunday Times of London that there was ""a whiff of Munich in the air from some in the West"", referring to a 1938 pact that failed to halt German expansionism under Adolf Hitler.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) -New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday she felt demonstrations against a COVID-19 vaccine mandate now entering their second week were an ""imported"" phenomenon, and nothing like anything she had seen before in the country.
Hundreds of protesters continue to occupy lawns in front of the distinctive 'Beehive' parliament for a seventh day, ignoring repeated calls by the police to leave and undaunted by drenching rain over the weekend.
Claiming inspiration from truckers' anti-vaccine mandate demonstrations in Canada, the protesters have also blocked several streets around parliament with their trucks, vans and motorcycles.
""It feels like an imported protest to me,"" Ardern told state broadcaster TVNZ in an interview.
""I've seen Trump flags on the forecourt, I've seen Canadian flags on the forecourt,"" she said, referring to images of former U.S. President Donald Trump carried by some demonstrators as well as the situation in Canada. 
Ardern said in a news conference later in the day that the protesters have demanded the government remove all public health COVID-19 measures. 
""That means at the very point where we are seeing an increase in cases and an increase in risk to the public health and well-being of New Zealand, they want to see removed the very measures that have kept us safe, well and alive. You'll forgive me if I take a very strong view on that suggestion,"" Ardern said.
The protests started as a stand against vaccine mandates but have been joined by groups calling for an end to COVID-19 restrictions, rejecting vaccinations, as well as calling attention to other social issues like censorship and rights of the ethnic Maori community. At the protests' peak, thousands of demonstrators were estimated to be involved.
A country of five million people, New Zealand has some of the lowest COVID-19 case numbers in the world, largely due to tough coronavirus border curbs and social restrictions.
Daily Omicron variant cases have been rising, however, nearly touching 1,000 on Monday, as some domestic restrictions were eased this month.

The country's borders, however, are still closed with tens of thousands of expatriate New Zealanders cut off from families. 
The High Court on Monday started hearing a case against the government filed by a group representing expatriate New Zealanders which has accused the state of unlawfully denying citizens the right to enter the country.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Amid fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, Italy's UniCredit has backed out of a potential acquisition in Russia and Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International has set aside risk provisions for possible sanctions on Russia.
What the region's banks now fear most is that Russia gets banned from a widely used payment system, bankers told Reuters, with one describing such a move as an ""atomic bomb"" for the industry because it would prevent the repayment of debts.
Here's what is at stake for Europe's banks as the crisis shows no signs of abating:
WHICH COUNTRIES' BANKS ARE MOST EXPOSED TO RUSSIA?
Banks in Italy, France and Austria are the world's most exposed international lenders to Russia. Italian and French banks each had outstanding claims of some $25 billion on Russia in the third quarter of 2021, according to figures from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Austrian banks had $17.5 billion. That compares with $14.7 billion for the United States.
WHICH BANKS ARE MOST EXPOSED?
European banks with subsidiaries in Russia are most at risk of sanctions, according to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) research. The investment bank's study pointed to a handful of banks, including UniCredit, RBI, France's Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), and ING of the Netherlands, as having notable exposure to Russia.
RBI said its exposure was manageable, while ING said it was well prepared. Societe Generale said it was closely monitoring developments and confident about its Russia business. UniCredit did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
WHAT SANCTIONS CURRENTLY EXIST?
In reaction to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, and in the following years, the United States and European Union imposed sanctions that include blacklisting specific individuals, sought to limit Russia's state-owned financial institutions' access to Western capital markets, imposed bans on weapons trade and other limits on the trade of technology, such as that for the oil sector. 
Over that period, foreign bank exposure to Russia has more than halved, BIS data show. 
WHAT NEW SANCTIONS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
European banks are closely watching U.S. legislation to sanction Russia. A Senate bill would target the most significant Russian banks and Russian sovereign debt.
Meanwhile, in Europe, negotiators say they are ready to impose ""massive"" economic sanctions on Russia if it invades Ukraine, but officials and diplomats say the threat depends on complex negotiations involving 27 member states that are far from complete. Negotiations are being held secretly.
In addition to widening the circle of Russian financial institutions that would be affected, measures are most likely to include efforts to keep Russia's energy sector from expanding, as well as blacklisting people and companies allied to President Vladimir Putin, according to Paul Feldberg, partner in the investigations, compliance and defence group at Jenner & Block.
""We are likely to see many more individuals and entities designated than we have seen before,"" Feldberg said.
WHAT'S THE BIGGEST CONCERN FOR EUROPEAN LEADERS?
A major worry is that Russia gets cut off from the SWIFT global payment system, which handles international financial transfers and is used by more than 11,000 financial institutions in over 200 countries. There is a precedence for such a move: Iran was banned a decade ago.
Jan Pieter Krahnen, a finance expert at Frankfurt's Goethe University and adviser to the German finance ministry, said the short-term consequences of a ban are opaque, and might backfire. Long-term, it could lead to the buildup of a parallel system that would be ""a loss for the global system, and also facilitate conflicts further down the road as opportunity costs vanish"".
Heinrich Steinhauer, who represents the German lender Helaba in Moscow, said such a move would be tantamount to a giant debt forgiveness program by prohibiting payments, describing it as a ""sort of atomic bomb"". ""For many this would be a catastrophe. For many in the European Union and Russia, and less so for the U.S. because economic ties are fewer,"" he said.
WHAT ELSE IS POSSIBLE?
Financial institutions involved in swaps, futures, forwards and other derivatives that trade with Russian counterparties could also become subject to sanctions rules, according to Jonathan Moss, partner at the law firm DWF. 
A prohibition of trading of Russian bonds in the secondary market would mean that holders of Russian bonds might be forced to sell, Moss said. 
European banks oppose including Russian bonds in a sanctions package, said one person with direct knowledge of their stance.
WHAT ACTIONS HAVE EUROPEAN BANKS TAKEN SO FAR?
Last week, RBI said it had earmarked 115 million euros in provisions for possible sanctions on Russia, underscoring risks for European lenders as tensions flare. 

In late January, UniCredit dropped a potential bid https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/unicredit-beats-2021-guidance-despite-q4-loss-2022-01-28 for Russian state-owned Otkritie Bank due to the Ukraine crisis.
ING of the Netherlands disclosed last week that it has 4.7 billion euros in exposure in Russia, but only around 25% of that is onshore. Its CEO said https://ing.nepgroup-webinars.com/watch_ondemand/gYrQ_0gr3Sg the bank plans to remain in Russia and would act accordingly if any new sanctions arose.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Los Angeles-area natives Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre united for ""California Love,"" surprise guest 50 Cent hung upside down and rapper Eminem took a knee as superstars of hip-hop performed a high-energy halftime show at Sunday's Super Bowl.
The star-packed lineup, also featuring R&B star Mary J. Blige and rapper Kendrick Lamar, made hip-hop the focus of the halftime extravaganza, a platform that draws the world's top musical acts.
At SoFi Stadium outside Los Angeles, the musicians sang a medley of hits and traversed the roofs and interiors of a row of white buildings assembled on the football field. 
Eminem ended his hit ""Lose Yourself"" by kneeling and placing his head in his hand, a gesture that former quarterback Colin Kaepernick made during the National Anthem at NFL games as a call for racial justice.
Kaepernick has not played since the 2016 season as no NFL team hired him after he began kneeling.
Media outlet Puck reported earlier on Sunday that the NFL had told Eminem not to kneel during the performance. NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said the report was untrue. NFL staff watched halftime rehearsals this week and the kneeling was included at that time, he said.
Dre and Snoop Dogg opened the show with ""The Next Episode"" and ""California Love."" Rapper 50 Cent, an unannounced guest, began rapping ""In Da Club"" while suspended from a ceiling upside down. 
Wearing a sequined white outfit with thigh-high boots, Blige performed ""Family Affair"" in front of a sparkling group of backup dancers.

Before the show, Dre and Snoop Dogg said that the NFL should have embraced rap years ago and they hoped to open doors for more hip-hop artists. Rap musicians have appeared previously but alongside pop and rock acts.
""THE GREATEST HALFTIME SHOW IVE EVER SEEN!!!"" Los Angeles Lakers basketball star LeBron James, who was seated in the crowd, wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is working on a package of military support and economic aid for Ukraine as the threat of a Russian invasion grows, a government spokesperson said on Sunday.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson will make a trip to Europe later this week to build support to end the standoff with Russia. Although there were no details of where Johnson would visit, his office said he wanted to engage more with Nordic and Baltic countries.
""The crisis on Ukraine's border has reached a critical juncture. All the information we have suggests Russia could be a planning an invasion of Ukraine at any moment,"" the spokesperson said.
The United States and Britain have said Russian President Vladimir Putin could order an invasion before the end of the Winter Olympics on Feb. 20 in what would be Europe's biggest security crisis for decades.
Russia, which has more than 100,000 troops at the Ukrainian border, has denied accusations that it may be planning to invade and has accused Western nations of spreading lies to distract from their own aggressive acts.
The spokesperson said Johnson was working with allies on the package of support for Ukraine to be announced in the coming days.
Britain has been supplying anti-tank weapons and training personnel to Ukraine although those troops were ordered to leave at the weekend.
""There is still a window of opportunity for de-escalation and diplomacy, and the prime minister will continue to work tirelessly alongside our allies to get Russia to step back from the brink,"" the spokesperson said.

Britain's support for Ukraine comes as Johnson is grappling with the worst domestic political crisis of his premiership, with police investigating lockdown parties at his Downing Street office and residence. He is being questioned by police.
The allegations of rule-breaking have undermined Johnson's authority and led some lawmakers from his ruling Conservative Party as well as opposition leaders to call for him to resign.

INGLEWOOD, Calif. (Reuters) - Sweltering in long, airport-type security lines did nothing to diminish the mood of fans arriving at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood near Los Angeles on Sunday for Super Bowl LVI.
Temperatures climbed into the mid-80s outside the stadium, which is home to a Los Angeles Rams team looking to secure a championship against the Cincinnati Benglas after falling short in the Super Bowl three years ago.
""(Rams head coach Sean) McVay is gonna learn from the last Super Bowl,"" said California resident Nick Gonzales. 
""He's gonna be more prepared against a good team and a good coach and the Rams are gonna win.""
Despite their underdog status, Bengals fans were equally confident.
""Bengals are gonna win of course,"" said Matthew Webb of Cincinnati. 

""Super pumped up, beyond hyped, ready for them to hoist the Lombardi trophy later today.""

Canada, which has the world's third-largest Ukrainian population after Ukraine and Russia, has kept a 200-strong training mission in western Ukraine since 2015.
The defence ministry said the armed forces have been relocated because of the ""complex operational environment linked to Russia's unwarranted aggression against Ukraine.""
Russia has more than 100,000 troops massed near Ukraine, which is not part of the Atlantic military alliance. Moscow denies it is planning an attack on Ukraine and has accused the West of ""hysteria."" 
Canada's defence forces have trained over 30,000 Ukrainian soldiers and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the mission would be extended by three years, at a cost of C$340 million ($268.5 million) and would result in 400 Canadian trainers being sent to Ukraine ultimately.
Canada also has temporarily moved its diplomatic staff to an office in Lviv, suspending embassy operations in Kyiv, the government said on Saturday. Washington and its European allies and others have been reducing or evacuating embassy staff and urging citizens to depart immediately or avoid travel to Ukraine.
President Joe Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Sunday an invasion of Ukraine by Russia could begin ""any day now"".

BEIJING (Reuters) - The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has concluded its hearing on Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva after she tested positive for a banned drug and a final decision on the teenager will be announced later on Monday after deliberations.
The 15-year-old prodigy, who became the first woman to land a quadruple jump at the Olympics en route to winning gold with the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) in the team competition, tested positive for a banned heart drug on Dec. 25 but it took more than six weeks for the result to be made public.
Her future at the Beijing Games and the team gold won by the ROC now hangs in the balance amid a global outcry over Moscow's doping history.
Valieva is due to compete again on Tuesday in the women's individual event, forcing CAS to rule on her continued participation before then, with the hearing lasting nearly six hours and concluding at 2:10 am local time on Monday.
""The hearing was concluded, it was a long hearing. Now the panel will deliberate until tomorrow morning, the end of the morning,"" CAS Secretary General Matthieu Reeb told reporters.
""We hope to be able to announce a final decision tomorrow at around one, two or three pm tomorrow afternoon and there should be an announcement which should be either by press release on the website or a public announcement also tomorrow.
""We need to organise that and we still have some work to do... I cannot comment on anything at the hearing but I hope to give you a decision ... in a few hours.""
When asked if Valieva gave evidence, Reeb said he could not answer the question.
CAS said the hearing, conducted by video conference, was attended by Valieva and representatives of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the International Skating Union (ISU), the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) and the ROC.
An automatic provisional suspension, imposed after any positive test, was lifted by RUSADA on Wednesday but the IOC and WADA filed appeals to CAS to reinstate it.

Initially it was thought the case would be heard by CAS's six-member doping unit, but the court later said its legal disputes unit would be handling it.
WADA also said on Sunday that it would ask its independent Intelligence and Investigations Department to investigate the coaches, doctors and other adults surrounding the athlete.

Tensions have been rising for weeks over Russia's troop build-up near Ukraine and Washington has said an invasion could happen anytime. Moscow denies planning one.
""I'm convinced that your arrival in Kyiv in the coming days, which are crucial for stabilising the situation, will be a powerful signal and contribute to de-escalation,"" the presidential office quoted Zelenskiy as telling Biden.

CNN cited an unnamed Ukrainian official saying there was no positive response from Biden to the idea. 
The Ukrainian readout of the call had Zelenskiy saying Ukraine understood the threats it faced and was ready to face any scenario, while thanking the United States for its support. 

""We expect it to among other things help prevent the spread of a mood of panic,"" he was quoted as saying. 
Zelenskiy has voiced frustrations with some of the dire assessments of a looming war. Such warnings have taken their toll on the economy, piling pressure on the national currency.

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - A mob lynched a man because he had allegedly burnt pages of Muslim holy book the Koran in central Pakistan and dozens of people have been arrested, police and officials said on Sunday.
Prime Minister Imran Khan ordered action against the mob and any police who acted an onlookers to the killing. 
""The lynching will be dealt with full severity of the law. ""We have zero tolerance for anyone taking the law into their own hands,"" he said in a statement.
A government spokesman said more than 60 people suspected of involvement in the lynching have been arrested, adding that more suspects were being identified through social media videos shot by the villagers in Tulamba, Khanewal district. 
The mob gathered at a mosque on Saturday night after the son of its prayer leader announced that he had spotted the man burning pages of the holy book, police official Munawar Hussain told Reuters.
Police arrived to find the man unconscious and tied to a tree, Hussain said, adding that the mob also attacked the police. 
""The villagers armed with batons, axes and iron rods killed him and hanged his body from a tree,"" Hussain said.
He said that evidence so far gathered by police suggested the dead man, identified as Muhammad Mushtaq, was in his 50s and appeared to have had mental disabilities.

Mob killings over accusations of blasphemy - a crime that can carry the death sentence - are fairly frequent in Muslim-majority Pakistan.
In December, factory workers in the eastern city of Sialkot lynched and burnt the body of a Sri Lankan in an attack that Khan said brought shame on the country.

White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan repeated that a Russian invasion https://graphics.reuters.com/RUSSIA-UKRAINE/dwpkrkwkgvm could begin any day and President Joe Biden has said he will support Ukraine after any invasion and defend NATO territory.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, canceled a planned visit to Liberia this week to focus instead on U.N. diplomacy on Russia's troop build-up near Ukraine as Washington warns Moscow could invade at any time.
Tensions over the Ukraine crisis spilled into the U.N. Security Council two weeks ago at a public meeting requested by Washington. Russia, which denies planning an invasion, made a failed bid to stop the council discussion. 
While all members were able to air their views openly, there was no action by the 15-member council and will not be - even if Russia invades Ukraine. A simple statement needs consensus support and Russia could veto any bid for a resolution.
Russia is one of five permanent, veto-wielding powers on the council along with the United States, France, Britain and China. The Security Council is charged with maintaining international peace and security. 
Russia also currently holds the council's rotating presidency for February. 
WHAT HAPPENED WITH CRIMEA?
If Russia's military escalates the crisis, diplomats and foreign policy analysts say diplomacy and action at the United Nations is likely to mirror what happened in 2014 after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region.
The Security Council has met dozens of times since then to discuss the Ukraine crisis. In March 2014, it voted on a U.S.-drafted resolution opposing a referendum on the status of Crimea and urging countries not to recognize it. It received 13 votes in favor, China abstained and Russia cast a veto. 
Seeking to demonstrate Russia's international isolation, Western countries then took a similar text to the 193-member General Assembly, which adopted a resolution declaring the referendum invalid. It received 100 votes in favor, 11 against and 58 abstentions, while two dozen countries didn't vote. 
General Assembly resolutions carry political weight but are not legally binding. Unlike the Security Council, no country has veto power in the General Assembly.
WHAT ARE WESTERN DIPLOMATS DOING?
So far, Western diplomacy at the United Nations during the latest military build-up has largely focused on trying to rally support - should they need it - among U.N. members by accusing Russia of undermining the U.N. Charter.
The Charter is the founding document of the United Nations, outlining its purposes and principles agreed in 1945.
""Russia's actions toward Ukraine are not only a regional issue,"" Thomas-Greenfield said last month.
""They impact every U.N. member state, and we must be prepared to stand together in unity and solidarity should Russia defy the shared values and principles that undergird our international system,"" she said. 
WHAT CAN RUSSIA DO AS SECURITY COUNCIL PRESIDENT?
Russia holds the council's rotating presidency for February. This is largely an administrative role, but does involve scheduling meetings, so some diplomats warn Russia could delay any attempts by council members to request another discussion on actions by Russia.

As things stand, the council is already due to discuss Ukraine on Feb. 17, diplomats said. It is a regularly scheduled meeting on the Minsk agreements, which were endorsed by the council in 2015 and designed to end a separatist war by Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine. 
The General Assembly is also set to hold an annual discussion on ""the situation in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine"" on Feb. 23.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, canceled a planned visit to Liberia this week to focus instead on U.N. diplomacy over Russia's troop build-up near Ukraine, the U.S mission to the United Nations said. 
The White House decided to keep Thomas-Greenfield in New York after President Joe Biden spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday, a U.S. official told Reuters on Sunday. Biden told Putin the West would respond decisively to any invasion.
""Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield will remain in New York to engage in diplomacy related to Russia's escalating military build-up on Ukraine's borders,"" said a spokesperson for the U.S. mission to the United Nations. 
The U.N. Security Council is due to gather on Thursday for a regularly scheduled meeting on the Minsk agreements, endorsed by the council in 2015 and designed to end a separatist war by Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine.
But diplomats expect Western countries to raise concerns over Russia's current military escalation at that meeting. It is also likely to be a topic of discussion when Security Council envoys meet with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday for their monthly lunch, diplomats said. 
The United States said on Friday that the Russian military, which has more than 100,000 troops massed near Ukraine, could invade at any moment. Russia denies having any such plans and says its actions are a response to aggression by NATO countries.
Tensions between Russia and the United States spilled into the Security Council two weeks ago at a public meeting requested by Washington to discuss Moscow's troop build-up near Ukraine. Russia made a failed bid to stop the discussion.
""Russia's aggression toward Ukraine is a threat to global peace and security and to every U.N. member state,"" the U.S. mission to the United Nations spokesperson said. ""We hope that Russia chooses dialogue instead of conflict, but we're ready for any scenario.""
The 15-member U.N. Security Council is charged with maintaining international peace and security. But the council won't be able to take any action beyond talking about the Ukraine crisis as Russia is one of the body's five veto powers, along with the United States, China, France and Britain. 
The council has already met dozens of times over the crisis in Ukraine since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.
China supported Russia in trying to stop the Jan. 31 council meeting called by the United States. Thomas-Greenfield said last week she hopes China will urge Russia to ""do the right thing"" on Ukraine, prompting her Chinese counterpart to respond with a call for diplomacy and an end to ""hyping up the tension.""
Thomas-Greenfield - a member of Biden's cabinet - had been due to travel to Liberia on Sunday for bicentennial celebrations in Monrovia marking the arrival of free Black men, women, and children from the United States on Providence Island. 

She was set to return to New York by Thursday for the Security Council's meeting on the Minsk agreements.
Dana Banks, senior director for Africa at the White House National Security Council, will now lead the U.S. delegation to Liberia, U.S. officials said.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A high-level Israeli inquiry into alleged warrantless wiretaps by police is examining a database provided by NSO Group, the manufacturer of the powerful hacking tool Pegasus, the Justice Ministry said on Sunday.
NSO, which has denied wrongdoing amid months of spiralling reports in Israel and abroad of privacy violations by government clients using Pegasus, has said its ""audit log"" database provides accurate information on phones infected by the spyware. 
Israel's Calcalist newspaper, in an unsourced report last week, said police had used Pegasus without judges' warrants against public figures including a son and two confidants of former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Netanyahu is on trial in three corruption cases. He has pleaded innocent. The Calcalist report prompted the court to cancel a session so prosecutors could respond to defence queries on whether any evidence against him was from tainted wiretaps. 
The Justice Ministry statement said an internal police investigation had found ""that no action was taken against anyone in the absence of a court warrant against them"". Some 1,500 phone numbers were checked, the statement added. 
An inquiry being conducted by a deputy attorney-general ""is also checking information in the NSO company's internal database, which was made available,"" it said.
An NSO spokeswoman declined comment.
Netanyahu, now the opposition leader, has demanded an independent, external investigation of the Pegasus allegations. 

That call has been echoed by some members of the cabinet of Prime Minister Naftali Bennett - who has held off, saying he first awaited the deputy attorney-general's findings. 
Prosecutors in the Netanyahu trial requested that Jerusalem District Court give them until Wednesday to deliver a fuller response, citing a need to declassify materials first, the Justice Ministry statement said.

""It is more like telling us you chose between your religion or education, that's a wrong thing,"" she said after studying for five years at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial college in Udupi.
Several Muslim girls who protested the ban had received threatening calls and were forced to stay indoors, she added.
College officials say students are allowed to wear the hijab on campus and only asked them to take it off inside the classroom.
Udupi is one of three districts in Karnataka's religiously sensitive coastal region, which is a stronghold of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
The stand-off has increased fear and anger among minority Muslims, who say the country's constitution grants them the freedom to wear what they want. Protests over the ban have escalated, with hundreds demonstrating this month in Kolkata and Chennai.
Last week, a judge at the state's high court referred petitions challenging the ban to a larger panel.
The issue is being closely watched internationally as a test of religious freedom guaranteed by the Indian Constitution.
The U.S. Office of International Religious Freedom (IRF) on Friday said the hijab bans ""violate religious freedom and stigmatize and marginalize women and girls.""
In response, India's foreign ministry on Saturday said outside comments over internal issues were not welcome and the matter was under judicial review.

Imthiaz and six other Muslim girls protesting the ban say they are determined to fight for their religious freedom in the face of some hardline Hindu students and even some of their friends.
""It is really hurtful to see our own friends going against us and telling 'I have a problem with you wearing the hijab'...its affected our bonds and mental health,"" Imthiaz said.

The weekend snowfall, which had already begun in some areas on Saturday, is the capital's first since the Winter Olympics opened on Feb. 4, government notices showed.
The Women's Freeski slopestyle qualification in Zhangjiakou, featuring Team China gold medalist Eileen Gu, was rescheduled to later on Sunday due to the snow, a notice on the Beijing 2022 official Olympic website said.
The authorities issued a blue blizzard warning, the lowest of the country's four-tiered alerts, with some regions forecast to receive up to 4 cm (1.6 inches) of snow. They advised the public to cut back on unnecessary outdoor activities.

""It is expected that there will be heavy snow in parts of central and southern Inner Mongolia, northern Shanxi, central and northern Hebei, northern Beijing, southern Tianjin, eastern and southern Liaoning, and Xinjiang along the Tianshan Mountains today,"" the China Meterological Administration notice said.
Beijing temperatures dropped, with the Beijing Meteorological Observatory forecasting a minimum temperature of -6 degrees Celsius (21°F). (This story corrects headline to specify first Beijing snowfall)

541,"<span>Feb 13, 2022 05:12AM ET</span>","DAMASCUS/BEIRUT (Reuters) - After her son was killed fighting for the Syrian government in 2013, the state began paying Amouna al-Berri a monthly salary which easily covered all her household expenses. 
Today, the ""martyrs salary"" - given to families of people who have died for Damascus in the 11-year long war - barely pays for her diabetes medicine.
Like many Syrians, Berri says getting by is harder today than at any point during the conflict, even though it has been several years since the last major battles and President Bashar al-Assad is firmly in control of most of the country.
""It was easier in the war. Things weren't as expensive as now,"" said Berri, 50, sitting next to a picture of Assad as she spoke at her home on the outskirts of Damascus, where she has lived since fleeing fighting in Aleppo nearly a decade ago. 
She cannot afford to warm her home, a makeshift shelter in an unfinished building with blankets for walls.
With one son killed, a second wounded in fighting, and a third missing for a decade, Berri has paid a high price in the war that spiralled out of protests against Assad's rule in 2011. 
Across Syria, the human cost of the war has been huge, including more than 350,000 people killed and over half the population uprooted, many of them from former rebel enclaves that were bombed into submission by Damascus and its allies.
But while the frontlines have been largely frozen for years, an economic crisis is exacting an increasingly heavy toll across the fractured nation. The United Nations says the number of people in need of humanitarian support is greater than at any point since the war began.
At the time of her son's death, Berri's monthly allowance - 30,000 Syrian pounds - was worth around $150. Today, it amounts to $6, reflecting the economy's downward spiral. 
""Sometimes I cry, sometimes I get upset, sometimes I think about leaving (the country), but if I do, how will we live?"" 
Already hit by extensive damage to infrastructure and industries during the war, the once productive Syrian economy has nose-dived further since 2019, when contagion from neighbouring Lebanon's financial crisis led the Syrian pound to collapse.
The pound holds less than 2% of the value it had in 2011.
The number of people in need reached 14.6 million in 2021, a 1.2 million increase from 2020, the United Nations says. Extreme poverty is estimated at almost two thirds of the roughly 18 million people living in Syria today. 
Damascus blames the mounting misery mainly on sanctions, which were tightened by Washington in 2020, deepening Syria's isolation. Western states say they aim to put pressure on Assad to end repression and negotiate a political settlement.
APPEALING FOR HELP
Assad's enemies, including Turkey-backed insurgents, control the northwest, home to some 2.8 million people forced from their homes who have also been enduring an exceptionally tough winter https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/snow-storms-cold-fire-threaten-displaced-syrians-northern-camps-2022-01-25. Much of the east and northeast - including oil and farm land - is held by Kurdish-led forces backed by Washington.
The pandemic and a drought have added to the pressures.
With the war already having driven 6.6 million people out of Syria, some residents of the capital say hardship is encouraging more to leave: one Damascus resident said she knew of 50 people who left late last year.
Others use social media to seek help. 
In one Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post, a woman from Damascus who lost her husband in the war appealed for two blankets to help keep her children warm. In another, a woman asks if anyone has a heater to spare.
""I would like the situation to get better, so I don't have to leave,"" said Kawthar Al Saleh, 28, a journalist. 
""My salary is enough to cover transportation costs for one week only or 10 days. Other things like food, cannot be covered by my salary,"" said Saleh, who lives with her parents. 
MORE CHILD LABOUR, DEBT 
""What you have is a cascade of crises,"" Imran Riza, U.N. Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator in Syria, told Reuters. ""We are seeing levels of poverty that we haven't seen before, levels of need that we haven't seen before,"" he said.
""You see a lot of people moving towards very negative coping mechanisms - more child labour, more child marriage, very high levels of debt right now. People selling key household assets.""
Anna Cervi, country director of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said people across the country were being forced to make dramatic choices, such as whether a sick parent should pay for medical treatment, ""or save that money to put a meal on the table for their kids."" 
The government has sought to address the situation by increasing public sector wages and pensions, most recently in December. However, worsening conditions and subsidy cuts have led to protests https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/syrias-main-druze-city-sees-more-unrest-calls-friday-protests-2022-02-10 in the southwestern city of Sweida this month. 
A Syrian family needs 450,000 to 500,000 a pounds a month to cover essentials including food, power, medicine and rent, according to a Norwegian Refugee Council survey.
""Every house is in need of help, even state employees and middle-income people,"" said Issam Habbal, the head of Sa'ed, an NGO.

Fouad Chahine, a state employee, rarely buys clothes for his three children. His salary of 120,000 pounds is spent within three days. He tops up his income by selling nuts.
""In 2013, life was more comfortable than now. Now you sleep, wake up and see that prices have gone up,"" he said.

INGLEWOOD, Calif. (Reuters) - The new SoFi Stadium will get its day in the sun when the $5.5 billion venue hosts the NFL's championship game on what is forecast to be the hottest ever Super Bowl Sunday. 
Temperatures are expected to be in the mid-80s and the architects behind the massive ""indoor-outdoor"" stadium said the conditions would play to its strengths.
The stadium's curved form and aerodynamic canopy was inspired by the Southern California coastline to promote natural cooling, said Lance Evans, HKS director of sports and the architect who led the stadium's design.
""Because there are no walls — the roof is 'anchored' at four different spots — fans feel the Pacific breeze while 'inside' the 70,000-seat stadium,"" Evans told Reuters in an email.
Perforations on the canopy act as a valve to let hot air out and cool air in, said Bill Zahner, CEO of Zahner, which implemented HKS's vision for the semi-translucent roof. 
""Even the color of the canopy was deliberate - the custom white finish of the facade panels reflects the sun's infrared light,"" Zahner said.
At night a 14-acre LED screen on the roof, essentially a giant television, serves as a ""welcome card"" to visitors landing at nearby Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), displaying images of all kinds.
INFINITY SCREEN
""@RamsNFL bring another ring to LA!"" read a tweet by Lakers great Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson that appeared on the stadium, which is home to the LA Rams, who will take on the Bengals in Sunday's championship game, and the LA Chargers.
Once inside, fans are greeted by a 360-degree, double-sided infinity screen that draws them into the action no matter where they are in the stadium. 
At more than 125 yards long and 75 yards wide, the screen is larger than the field it hangs above and is the largest ever made for a sports venue.
In addition to the stadium, which can hold more than 100,000 fans, the complex also includes a 6,000 seat theater, a 2.5 acre plaza and a 25-acre community park. 
And there is still more to come. 
Commercial and residential properties are set to open in Hollywood Park, with SoFi, funded and developed by Rams owner Stan Kroenke, serving as the centerpiece.
SoFi's schedule is already filling up.
The stadium is set to host College Football Playoffs next year, will likely host World Cup soccer matches in 2026, may hold the Super Bowl again in 2027, and will be the stage of the Olympics opening ceremony in 2028.

""We wanted to create the living room for the city of Inglewood while also creating a global stage,"" said Mark Williams, a global director at HKS.
""It will be very visible to the world as it hosts mega events, like what we're going to see with the Super Bowl.""

WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden told Russia's Vladimir Putin on Saturday that the West would respond decisively to any invasion of Ukraine, adding such a step would produce widespread suffering and isolate Moscow.
In the latest effort to manage growing hostility, the two men spoke by phone for an hour a day after Washington and its allies warned that the Russian military, which has 100,000 troops massed near Ukraine, could invade at any moment. Moscow has dismissed those warnings as ""hysteria.""
Neither side said there had been any breakthroughs. A senior Biden administration official said the call was professional and substantive, but that there was no fundamental change.
The Kremlin said Putin told Biden Washington has failed to take Russia's main concerns into account, and it had received no ""substantial answer"" on key elements including NATO's expansion and the deployment of offensive forces to Ukraine. 
The senior Biden administration official said it was unclear whether Putin was committed to diplomacy even as he agreed to stay in touch with Biden.
The call took place as Israel, Portugal and Belgium joined the list of countries that have urged their citizens to leave Ukraine immediately. 
The U.S. State Department ordered most of its embassy staff to leave Ukraine. The Pentagon said it was withdrawing about 150 military trainers. 
Australia said on Sunday it was evacuating its embassy in Kyiv, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison calling on China to speak up for Ukraine and not remain ""chillingly silent"" as Russia massed military forces on its border. 
Morrison's comments to a news conference followed criticism by China of a meeting of the U.S., Australian, Japanese and Indian foreign ministers last week in Melbourne. 
""The coalition of autocracies that we are seeing, seeking to bully other countries, is not something that Australia ever takes a light position on,"" Morrison said. 
TELEPHONE DIPLOMACY
Biden was due to compare notes with French President Emmanuel Macron, who spoke with both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Saturday, according to the White House. Biden's top military and diplomatic officials held calls with their Russian counterparts.
Putin also spoke with Alexander Lukashenko, leader of Ukraine's northern neighbor Belarus, which is engaged in major joint military drills with Russia. 
After Macron's call with Putin, a French presidency official said there were no indications from what Putin told Macron that Russia is preparing an offensive against Ukraine. 
""We are nevertheless extremely vigilant and alert to the Russian (military) posture in order to avoid the worst,"" the French official said. 
Russia said on Saturday that it had decided to ""optimize"" its diplomatic staff numbers in Ukraine, fearing ""provocations"" by Kyiv or others. It said its embassy and consulates in Ukraine continued to perform their key functions. 
A U.S. official on Saturday said there was no telling what Putin has decided, but that the steps Russia is taking ""in plain sight"" make them fear the worst. 
ZELENSKIY CALLS FOR CALM 
Biden told Putin during their call that the United States is pushing for diplomacy but ready for ""other scenarios,"" the White House said.
In Kyiv, several thousand Ukrainians filed through the center of the city, chanting ""Glory to Ukraine"" and carrying banners that said ""Ukrainians will resist"" and ""invaders must die.""
Zelenskiy, who attended police drills in the southern Kherson region, echoed Washington's assessment that a Russian attack could happen at any time, but stressed that it was important for Ukrainians to remain calm. 
""The best friend of our enemies is panic in our country,"" he said. 
Putin, jostling for influence in post-Cold War Europe, is seeking security guarantees from Biden to block Kyiv's entry into NATO and missile deployments near Russia's borders.
Washington regards many of the proposals as non-starters but has pushed the Kremlin to discuss them jointly with Washington and its European allies.
Moscow has repeatedly disputed Washington's version of events, saying it has massed the troops near the Ukrainian border to maintain its own security against aggression by NATO allies. 
Also on Saturday, the Russian military said it had used ""appropriate means"" to make a U.S. submarine depart from Russian waters in the far east after the vessel ignored a Russian order to surface, Interfax news agency reported.

The submarine was detected in Russian waters as elements of Russia's Pacific Fleet conducted naval exercises near the Kuril islands, the defence ministry was quoted as saying. 
In a statement, a U.S. military spokesman denied it had carried out operations in Russian territorial waters.

PARIS (Reuters) - A convoy protesting COVID-19 restrictions breached police defences and drove into central Paris on Saturday, snarling traffic around the Arc de Triomphe and on the Champs Elysees, as police fired tear gas at demonstrators.
Protesters in cars, campervans, tractors and other vehicles had converged on Paris from Lille, Perpignan, Nice and other cities late on Friday, despite warnings from Paris authorities that they would be barred from entering the capital.
Inspired by horn-blaring ""Freedom Convoy"" demonstrations in Canada, dozens of vehicles slipped through the police cordon, impeding traffic around the 19th century arch and the top of the boutique-lined Champs Elysees, a magnet for tourists.
Inside the city's limits, motorists in the ""Freedom Convoy"" waved tricolour flags and honked in defiance of the police ban. 
On the Champs Elysees, clouds of tear gas swirled through the terraces of bars and restaurants.
Riot police also threw tear gas grenades to keep order at an authorised street protest where demonstrators, including some ""Yellow Vests"" railed against President Emmanuel Macron's coronavirus vaccine pass rules and the cost of living.
On the Champs Elysees, police used tear gas into the evening as sporadic scuffles continued and one person who collapsed on the sidewalk was brought to hospital for checks, police said. 
France requires people to show proof of vaccination to enter public places such as cafes, restaurants and museums, with a negative test no longer being sufficient for unvaccinated people. 
""We can't take the vaccine pass any more,"" said Nathalie Galdeano, who had come from southwest France by bus to participate in the protests.
Police said that they had arrested 54 people, handed out 337 fines by and stopped 500 vehicles trying to get into Paris in the morning. The Interior Ministry said about 32,000 people participated in protests nationwide, including 7,600 in Paris.
Less than two months from a presidential election, Macron's government is eager to keep protests from spiralling into large-scale demonstrations like the anti-government Yellow Vest revolt of 2018.
That movement began as a protest against fuel taxes and grew into a broader revolt that saw some of the worst street violence in decades and tested Macron's authority.
Grievances expressed by protesters in the ""Freedom Convoy"" extend beyond COVID restrictions, with anger simmering over a perceived fall in standards of living amid surging inflation.
Police had mobilised more than 7,000 officers, set up checkpoints and deployed armoured personnel carriers and water cannon trucks in preparation for the protests.

Separately police also said they had arrested five protesters in southern Paris in possession of sling shots, hammers, knives and gas masks.
Canadian truckers protesting a vaccine mandate for trans-border traffic have paralysed parts of the capital Ottawa since late January and blocked U.S.-Canada crossing points. Canadian police began clearing protesters blocking a key bridge linking Canada and the United States on Saturday.

545,"<span>Feb 12, 2022 08:03PM ET</span>",,,,,,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Saturday expressed concern over continued violence against journalists in Mexico, two days after the latest killing of a reporter.
""We're dismayed by the situation journalists are facing in Mexico,"" the U.S. embassy in Mexico said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), calling the fatal shooting in southern Mexico of journalist Heber Lopez, which was announced Thursday, a ""loathsome"" act.
The killing was the latest in what has been one of the most violent periods in recent Mexican history for media workers.
The embassy said a thorough investigation to catch those responsible was ""essential.""
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Friday condemned Lopez's killing and said there would be ""no impunity"" for the perpetrators. His government said two suspects had been arrested, and vowed to get to the bottom of the case.
Still, at the same news conference Lopez Obrador named the salary of a journalist who has been critical of his government.
Lopez Obrador has in recent days verbally pilloried Carlos Loret de Mola since the prominent broadcaster and another news outlet published a report that detailed the apparently expensive lifestyle enjoyed by one of the president's sons in Texas.
On Friday, the president gave details of what he said Loret earned in 2021, referring to the journalist as ""corrupt"" and ""mercenary,"" among other negative descriptions.
Loret hit back, accusing the president of going after him for raising questions about the son's income, and saying the salary claims were wrong, and had put him in danger.

The Mexican institute in charge of data protection later said it would be alert to any complaint filed that argued the revelations constituted a breach of Loret's rights.
At least five journalists or media workers have been killed this year in Mexico, one of the world's most dangerous countries for the profession, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.

The two leaders spoke at a time of high tension over Russia's massing of troops near the Ukrainian border, with Washington saying on Friday that Moscow could invade at any moment. Russia has denied it plans to invade.
""We see no indication in what President Putin says that he is going to go on the offensive,"" the official told reporters after Macron and Putin spoke on the phone for nearly 90 minutes.
""We are nevertheless extremely vigilant and alert to the Russian (military) posture in order to avoid the worst.""
Separately, the Kremlin said that Putin had highlighted during the call with Macron a ""lack of a substantive response from the United States and NATO to well-known Russian initiatives"". This referred to a series of Russian security demands, including that it bar Ukraine from ever joining NATO.
Putin and Macron also discussed the situation related to ""provocative speculations"" around an allegedly planned Russian invasion, the Kremlin said.
The Elysee official said France recommended that French nationals avoid trips to Ukraine and preparations would be made for embassy staff and their families to leave the country if they wanted.
The French ambassador would review the situation for the some 1,000 French nationals in the country, many of whom hold both French and Ukrainian citizenship, the official said. The United States and many other countries have urged citizens to leave Ukraine amid fears of an invasion.
Macron visited Moscow earlier this week and then and in their call on Saturday the two discussed ways to move forward on the implementation of the Minsk Agreements on achieving peace in eastern Ukraine, as well conditions for security and stability in Europe, the Elysee said separately in a statement.
Macron also spoke on Saturday with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz as well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and was due to speak with U.S. President Joe Biden.

In the call with Zelenskiy, Macron restated his support for the Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, the Elysee said.
Scholz is due to visit Kyiv on Monday followed by Moscow on Tuesday, and the Elysee said the French and German positions were ""perfectly aligned"".

KYIV (Reuters) - Several thousand Ukrainians rallied in Kyiv on Saturday to show unity amid fears of a Russian invasion, as Ukraine's leader told people not to panic and pushed back against what he said was a glut of bleak war predictions being reported in the media. 
Tension has mounted as Russia has built up more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine and carried out large-scale exercises. The United States said on Friday an invasion could start at any moment. Russia denies planning to invade. 
Ukrainians filed through the centre of Kyiv in a column, chanting ""Glory to Ukraine"" and carrying Ukrainian flags and banners that said ""Ukrainians will resist"" and ""Invaders must die"". 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who attended police drills in southern Kherson region, said a Russian attack could happen at any time, but pushed back against what he called excessive amounts of information about a major looming war. 
""The best friend of our enemies is panic in our country. And all this information is just provoking panic and can't help us,"" he said. ""I can't agree or disagree with what hasn't happened yet. So far, there is no full-scale war in Ukraine."" 
The United States and numerous Western governments have urged their citizens to leave Ukraine, and Washington on Saturday said it was ordering most of its Kyiv embassy staff to leave. 
""We have to be ready each day. It did not begin yesterday. It began in 2014, so, we are ready and this is why we are here,"" Zelenskiy said in a reference to Russia's annexation of Crimea and backing for an anti-Kyiv separatist insurgency in the east.
In a separate statement, the head of Ukrainian armed forces Valery Zaluzhny and Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said the aggressor won't take Kyiv, Odessa, Kharkiv, or any other Ukraine's city.
""We have strengthened the defense of Kyiv. We have gone through the war and due preparation. Therefore, we are ready to meet enemies and not with flowers, but with Stingers, Javelins and NLAW. Welcome to hell!"", Zaluzhny said, referring to an array of anti-rocket and anti-aircraft weapons received from the West.
The military says Ukrainian intelligence and the army have control of the situation on the borders and Kyiv is coordinating its actions with allies.
""Such a union of leading democracies has not existed for decades,"" Zaluzhny and Reznikov said.

Zelenskiy voiced frustrations just last month with dire assessments of a war. Such warnings have taken their toll on the economic, piling pressure on the national currency.
U.S. President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin will speak later on Saturday.

AHMEDABAD, India (Reuters) - Hundreds of Hindu nationalist protesters marched in the Indian state of Gujarat on Saturday, prompting the closure of stores owned by several multinational companies caught up in a furore over social media posts supporting disputed Kashmir.
The messages were posted last week by the Pakistani branches of firms including Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors, fast food chain Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) and Yum Brand Inc's Pizza Hut and KFC, which also operate in India.
They were issued by the companies on Feb. 5 to coincide with Pakistan's Kashmir Solidarity Day, held annually to commemorate the sacrifices of Kashmiris struggling for self-determination, and caused anger among social media users in India.
""These companies cannot be doing business in India and at the same time supporting Pakistan's stand on Kashmir,"" Dinesh Navadiya, national treasurer of Hindu nationalist organisation Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), told Reuters during a protest in the city of Surat.
Shouting slogans such as ""Kashmir is Ours"" and wearing saffron scarves, more than 100 members of Bajrang Dal, another Hindu nationalist group, also joined the protest - one of several held in Gujarat, the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Both the VHP and Bajrang Dal are linked to Modi's ruling Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP). 
The furore has highlighted the risks faced by companies operating in India and arch rival Pakistan, which control parts of Kashmir but both claim the Himalayan territory in full.
India says Pakistan supports an armed insurrection against New Delhi's rule in India-controlled Kashmir that broke out in 1990. Pakistan denies the charge and says it only provides diplomatic and moral support for the Kashmiri people.
""We protested peacefully against these companies for the tweets by their Pakistani affiliates in support of Kashmir,"" said Hitendrasinh Rajput, spokesperson for the VHP's state unit in Gujarat's largest city of Ahmedabad.

""We want to make it clear to these companies and others that Kashmir is an inseparable part of India,"" Rajput said.
Companies including Hyundai, Kia, Domino's Pizza, Yum Brand's Pizza Hut and KFC, Japan's Suzuki Motor, Honda Motor and Isuzu Motor issued apologies as criticism grew over the posts.

BEIJING (Reuters) - The Russian coach of the 15-year-old figure skater embroiled in an Olympic doping scandal broke her silence to defend Kamila Valieva on Saturday, while the sport's highest court said it would hold a hearing on Valieva's Winter Games future on Sunday.
Coach Eteri Tutberidze said she was certain Valieva was ""clean and innocent"" in an interview with Russian state television after hugging her figure-skating prodigy, who trained again at the rink next to the Capital Indoor Stadium on Saturday afternoon. 
Valieva's future at the Winter Games will be decided by Monday afternoon Beijing time, after a hearing by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Sunday, CAS said in a statement on Saturday.
The figure skater's Olympics hangs in the balance after the stunning revelation that she had tested positive for a banned heart drug before winning the team event on Monday, but it took more than six weeks before that positive result was reported.
Valieva is due to compete again on Tuesday in the women's individual event.
YOUNG ATHLETES
Valieva is one of the youngest athletes ever to have a positive test revealed at the Olympics, in a case that has prompted outrage from fans, athletes and anti-doping advocates around the world.
Earlier, Olympic officials said they would welcome an anti-doping investigation into the Russian doctors, coaches and family members in Valieva's entourage.
Many have questioned the role of the adults around the teenage skater and the continuing scourge of Russian doping in international sports.
Senior International Olympic Committee (IOC) member Dick Pound told Reuters that Russia may need an Olympic ""timeout"" after the latest doping scandal.
The Kremlin - separately preoccupied with Western diplomatic wrath over a troop buildup near Ukraine - calls Valieva's case a ""misunderstanding"".
Rachael Denhollander, the first woman to publicly accuse former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar of sexual abuse, told Reuters the failed drug test was a reminder of how vulnerable young athletes remain.
""A child does not make a choice to take those kinds of medications unless they're given to her by somebody who's in authority,"" Denhollander told Reuters. 
""What we're really seeing is the incredible damage that has come yet again to a child who has been under the control of adults who value her, not for who she is but for what she can produce for them.""
COACH ADDS HER VOICE
Tutberidze is known for raising a generation of Russian skaters with stellar but ephemeral careers. Her skaters are among the only women in the world who can successfully land quadruple jumps. 
On Saturday, she added her voice to the growing cries from Russian officials over the delay in the figure skater receiving her positive drug test result.
More than six weeks went by between Valieva's sample being taken on Dec. 25 and Feb. 8 when she was notified by a lab in Stockholm, Sweden that she had tested positive for the banned heart medication trimetazidine. 
""It's unclear why an athlete with a suspected doping on Dec. 25 was cleared to compete at the Olympics,"" Tutberidze told Russian state television. 
""Either it is an ill-fated confluence of circumstances, or it's a very well-planned plan. I hope our officials will not abandon us and defend our rights and prove our innocence.""
The Russian Olympic Committee (ROC), the Russian figure skating federation and Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA have questioned the timeline.
The Doping Control Laboratory (NYSE:LH) Karolinska University Hospital, in Stockholm, is accredited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). 
RUSADA released a statement saying the laboratory had cited a spike in COVID-19, which impacted staff and quarantine rules, as the reason for the delay.
The lab's director Anton Pohanka declined to comment. 
On Saturday, the International Olympic Committee said the delay was a question for WADA, which could not be immediately contacted by Reuters.
Test results during the Games take between 24-72 hours for a result, depending on the kind of test, but the process during the Olympics is expedited given the urgent need for quick results with many athletes competing in several events.

While a six-week delay is unusual, there could be mitigating factors, said Jean-Pierre Verdy, the former director of testing at the French Anti-Doping Agency (AFLD), who helped bust several top names on the Tour de France.
""Between a sample's delivery time, added to the analysis time and re-analysis time to confirm the presence of a specific substance, and the fact that you have to send the screenings to several labs to get external confirmation - and some labs don't have that kind of experience - the delays can be long,"" Verdy told Reuters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -About 150 U.S. troops from the Florida National Guard who have been in Ukraine to help train Ukrainian forces are leaving the country as the threat of a Russian invasion increases, the Pentagon said on Saturday. 
Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said the decision, first reported by Reuters, was made out of an abundance of caution and was informed by the State Department's decision to withdraw some staff from the U.S. embassy in Kyiv. 
""This repositioning does not signify a change in our determination to support Ukraine's Armed Forces, but will provide flexibility in assuring allies and deterring aggression,"" Kirby said in a written statement.
The trainers will be repositioned within Europe, he said, but it was not clear exactly where. 
It was also not immediately clear what will happen with the small number of U.S. special operations forces in the country, according to a U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity.
Reuters reported on Friday that the Pentagon will send 3,000 additional troops to Poland as Russia held military exercises in Belarus and the Black Sea following the buildup of its forces near Ukraine.

Australia, New Zealand, Germany and the Netherlands on Saturday joined countries urging their citizens to leave Ukraine. Washington said on Friday that a Russian invasion, likely beginning with an air assault, could occur at any time.
Moscow has repeatedly disputed Washington's version of events, saying it has massed more than 100,000 troops near the Ukrainian border to maintain its own security against aggression by NATO allies.

KYIV/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States said on Saturday it was ordering most staff at its embassy in Kyiv to leave Ukraine immediately due to the threat of an invasion by Russia.
An updated travel advisory said the State Department had ordered the departure of most employees at the embassy in Kyiv, adding to its call earlier this week for private U.S. citizens to leave Ukraine immediately.
A senior State Department official said the Biden administration would continue diplomatic efforts to ""ensure that Ukraine does not become a war zone."" 
Washington's warnings https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-says-russia-masses-more-troops-near-ukraine-invasion-could-come-any-time-2022-02-11 that the Russian buildup of more than 100,000 troops on Ukraine's borders could herald an invasion have become increasingly urgent in recent days. Moscow has denied it plans to invade, saying it has its own security concerns over what it terms aggression by NATO allies.
""It appears increasingly likely that this is where this situation is headed – towards some kind of active conflict, and that is why we are reducing our staff to a bare minimum while we still have the ability to get our official people out safely and in a predictable fashion,"" said the official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.
Tensions have been mounting for weeks during the Russian military buildup near its ex-Soviet neighbour. Washington said on Friday an invasion could happen anytime and urged U.S. citizens in Ukraine to leave the country right away, saying that it will not send troops to evacuate them if conflict erupts. 
A string of other countries including Britain, Japan and Australia have also said their citizens should leave.
A U.S. official said the order for U.S. citizens to leave Ukraine includes those working for a monitoring mission by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The OSCE did not respond to a request for comment.
The OSCE conducts operations in Ukraine including a civilian monitoring mission in the Russian-backed self-proclaimed separatist republics in the country's east where a war that erupted in 2014 has killed more than 14,000 people. 
Routine consular services at the Kyiv embassy would be suspended from Sunday, the State Department official said, but some emergency services would be provided in Lviv, a city in western Ukraine that is further from the eastern and northern borders where Russian troops are massed.
Embassy personnel will return to the United States and continue to work on Ukraine, the official said.

Russia, which has accused Western nations of spreading lies, meanwhile said on Saturday it had decided to ""optimise"" its diplomatic staff numbers in Ukraine, fearing ""provocations"" by Kyiv or another party. 
Moscow did not say whether that meant a reduction in staff numbers but said the embassy and consulates in Ukraine continued to perform their key functions.

NADI, Fiji (Reuters) -The United States will open an embassy in the Solomon Islands, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Saturday as he committed more diplomatic and security resources into the Pacific as a counter to China's drive for greater influence.
Blinken, in Fiji for virtual summit of the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) of regional leaders, heard their concerns about the need for genuine action on climate change and complaints that they had long been overlooked by bigger nations.
""Fiji and all the Pacific Island nations are a vital part of the Indo-Pacific region,"" Blinken told a news conference with Fiji's Acting Prime Minister Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyu.
Sayed-Khaiyu noted that Fiji and the other Pacific nations were the guardians of the largest ocean continent in the world, which was crucial to the wellbeing of everyone in the world.
""Despite that, Fiji and our small-state neighbours have felt at times, to borrow an American term, like a flyover country, "" he said.
""Small dots spotted from planes of leaders en route to meetings where they spoke about us rather than with us, if they spoke about us at all,"" he said, adding he hoped the visit marked the start of a more direct relationship between the United States and the Pacific.
Blinken flew to Fiji after a meeting in Melbourne of the United States, Japan, India and Australia, at which the so-called Quad pledged to deepen cooperation to ensure an Indo-Pacific region free from ""coercion,"" a thinly veiled swipe at China's economic and military expansion.
""This is not at all a case of us being here, coming here, being focussed here for security reasons. It's much more fundamental than that,"" Blinken said. ""When we're looking at this region that we share, we see it as the region for the future."" 
CHINA'S MILITARY PUSH 
In a briefing on the flight to Fiji, a senior U.S. administration official told travelling reporters that ""there are very clear indications that (China) want to create military relationships in the Pacific"".
""The most pressing case right now is what's going on in the Solomon Islands. With Chinese security personnel bucking up an increasingly besieged president in a way that has caused a lot of anxieties across the region,"" the official said.
The Solomon Islands switched its diplomatic allegiance to China from Taiwan in 2019.
Violent protests erupted in the Solomon Islands capital of Honiara in November after Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare refused to speak with protesters who had travelled from Malaita province, which had opposed the diplomatic switch to Beijing.
Around 200 police and soldiers from Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Papua New Guinea arrived in Honiara within days of the riots, at Sogavare's request.
Sogavare accused the provincial government in Malaita, the most populous province in the country, of being ""Taiwan's agent"", and in December survived a no-confidence motion in parliament.
China later sent police advisers to help train Solomons police, and equipment including shields, helmets and batons
INDO-PAC STRATEGY
Blinken's visit to Fiji, the first by a U.S. secretary of state in four decades, came after the Biden administration issued a strategy overview for the Indo-Pacific in which it vowed to commit more diplomatic and security resources to the region to push back against China.

Under an action plan for the next 12 to 24 months, the document said Washington would ""meaningfully expand"" its diplomatic presence in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands and prioritise key negotiations with Pacific island states that cover access for the U.S. military and which have appeared to stall in the past year.
Richard Clark, a spokesman for the president of one of the island nations, the Federated States of Micronesia, told Reuters a ""tremendous amount of progress"" was still needed in talks with Washington.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States will send 3,000 additional troops to Poland, Poland's Defence Minister said late on Friday, confirming an earlier Reuters report, as Russia held military exercises in Belarus and the Black Sea following the buildup of its forces near Ukraine.
The additional troops will be sent to Poland in the coming days, four U.S. officials told Reuters on Friday.
The deployment comes as Washington steps up warnings that Russia could be poised to invade Ukraine. Russia denies it plans to invade, saying it is defending its own security against aggression by NATO allies.
Polish Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) late on Friday that Poland is ready to welcome the U.S. troops anytime. 
""The U.S. administration will send additional 3,000 troops to Poland due to the tense situation in Ukraine. I spoke today about this issue with (U.S. Defence Secretary Lloyd) Austin,"" he said. ""We are ready at any time to welcome U.S. soldiers to Poland.""
The officials, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said the U.S. troop deployment will come from the 82nd Airborne Division based at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and not from within U.S. forces in Europe. 
They are expected to be in Poland by next week, they said. 
One of the officials described it as a significant deployment. 
Another official said the deployment order was signed by Austin at the direction of President Joe Biden. 
The soldiers are in addition to the 8,500 troops already on alert to be ready to deploy to Europe if needed and the nearly 3,000 American troops the administration said earlier this month it would deploy to Poland and Romania. 
A spokesperson for Poland's Defence Ministry did not confirm any additional details about timing or where the troops would be coming from.
Russia has already massed more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine, and this week it launched joint military exercises in neighboring Belarus and naval drills in the Black Sea.
While it denies plans to invade Ukraine, Moscow has said it could take unspecified ""military-technical"" action unless a series of demands are met, including promises from NATO never to admit Ukraine and to withdraw forces from Eastern Europe.
The United States and Britain have both warned an invasion could come within days.

The Biden administration has urged American citizens to leave Ukraine now, stressing it will not send U.S. troops into Ukraine to help them flee the country if there is a Russian invasion.
While the United States does not have any ships in the Black Sea currently, the U.S. Navy has sent four additional destroyers to Europe in recent weeks.

WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - The United States and its allies urged their citizens to leave Ukraine right away to avoid a Russian invasion, including a possible air assault, that Washington said on Friday could occur anytime.
Moscow accused Western nations of spreading lies to distract from their own aggressive acts. 
The United States and Europe stepped up their warnings of an imminent attack while the Kremlin, jostling for more influence in post-Cold War Europe, rejected a joint EU-NATO diplomatic response to its demands to reduce tensions as disrespectful.
Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops on the Ukraine border but denies it plans to invade. 
U.S. officials, while pressing for diplomacy, said Russia could invade before the conclusion of the Winter Olympics on Feb. 20 and may seek to seize the capital Kyiv and other cities.
U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Americans could not expect military evacuation if they remained in Ukraine and should leave within 48 hours. 
""We continue to see signs of Russian escalation, including new forces arriving at the Ukrainian border,"" Sullivan told reporters. ""We are in the window when an invasion could begin at any time."" 
""If a Russian attack on Ukraine proceeds, it is likely to begin with aerial bombing and missile attacks that could obviously kill civilians without regard to their nationality,"" he said. 
Australia and New Zealand became the latest countries to urge their citizens to leave as soon as possible, joining Britain, Japan, Latvia, Norway and the Netherlands. Israel said it was evacuating relatives of embassy staff. 
Russia wants guarantees from the West, including a promise of no missile deployments near its borders, no NATO membership for Ukraine, and a scaling back of the alliance's military infrastructure.
The West describes Russia's main demands as ""non-starters"" but is willing to talk about arms control and confidence-building steps.
After Sullivan's briefing at the White House, Russia's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy appeared to mock his comments:
""Some reasonable people were hoping U.S.-fanned hysteria was waning,"" he posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""Maybe they put a jinx on it, because scaremongers have clearly got second wind. Our troops are still on our territory and I wonder if the U.S. will invade Ukraine itself - someone has to, after such a panic campaign."" 
The EU and NATO alliance delivered a joint reply to Russia this week on behalf of their member states as diplomatic efforts continue to try to diffuse the crisis. 
Russia on Friday said it expected individual answers from each country, and called the collective response ""a sign of diplomatic impoliteness and disrespect"". 
It later said that Western countries, with help from the media, were spreading false information about its intentions to try to distract attention from their own aggressive actions.
'MASSIVE CONSEQUENCES' 
Washington will send 3,000 extra troops to Poland in coming days to try and help reassure NATO allies, four U.S. officials told Reuters. They are in addition to 8,500 already on alert for deployment to Europe if needed.
Earlier, commercial satellite images https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/satellite-images-show-new-russian-military-deployments-near-ukraine-2022-02-11 from a U.S. firm showed new Russian military deployments at several sites near the border.
Biden told NBC News on Thursday that things in Ukraine ""could go crazy quickly,"" and on Friday held a call about the crisis with the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Poland and Romania, as well as the heads of NATO and the EU. 
The leaders agreed to make coordinated efforts to deter Russian aggression, including by being ready to impose ""massive consequences and severe economic costs"" if it chose military escalation, the White House said after the call.
Washington also expressed concern that Russia and China were cooperating at the highest level, with a senior administration official saying on Saturday the two were ""working to undermine us.""
A partnership agreement between Moscow and Beijing shows they are in ""fundamental alignment"" that is growing closer, and a meeting between Putin and China's President Xi Jinping shows Beijing sees Moscow's moves regarding Ukraine as ""legitimate,"" the official told reporters accompanying Blinken on a flight from Australia to Fiji.
U.S. officials believe the crisis could be reaching a critical point, with rhetoric from Moscow hardening, six Russian warships reaching the Black Sea, and more Russian military equipment arriving in Belarus. 
""We continue to see very troubling signs of Russian escalation, including new forces arriving at the Ukrainian border,"" said Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
Stocks extended declines, with the S&P 500 index down around 1.9%. Gold and oil prices rose. The rouble fell to its lowest level against the dollar since March 2020.
Moscow has said it could take unspecified ""military-technical"" action if its demands are not met. This week it launched joint military exercises in neighbouring Belarus and naval drills in the Black Sea. 
Diplomatic efforts have so far failed to yield results.
Four-way talks in Berlin between Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France on Thursday made no progress.

Russia openly mocked British foreign minister Liz Truss when she visited on Thursday and there was no breakthrough after talks between Putin and Macron earlier in the week. 
""I'm not going to speculate as to (Putin's) motivations, his intentions, or, at this point, his decisions,"" said Sullivan. ""All I will say is that we are ready either way.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - More than six weeks went by from the time teenage Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva's sample was collected and the day she heard at the Beijing Olympics that she tested positive for a banned substance at her national championships.
The Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) immediately questioned the timeline, wondering what might have happened in that time frame after the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) lifted the 15-year-old's provisional suspension, allowing her to further train and compete.
While a six-week delay is unusual, there could be mitigating factors.
Test results during the Games take between 24-72 hours for a result, depending on the kind of test, but the process during the Olympics is expedited given the urgent need for quick results with many athletes competing in several events.
However, delays can vary outside of the Olympics, said Jean-Pierre Verdy, the former director of testing at the French Anti-Doping Agency (AFLD), who helped bust several top names on the Tour de France.
""Between a sample's delivery time, added to the analysis time and re-analysis time to confirm the presence of a specific substance, and the fact that you have to send the screenings to several labs to get external confirmation - and some labs don't have that kind of experience - the delays can be long,"" he told Reuters.
""So unless it's a substance that's commonly targeted, a lab never gets a result out without the opinion of some of their peers.""
ROC head Stanislav Pozdnyakov said the long gap between the Dec. 25 doping test and the Feb. 8 announcement looked suspicious and he had ""serious questions about the process"".
Valieva's result was reported from a WADA-accredited laboratory in Stockholm only on Tuesday, according to the International Testing Agency (ITA), the day after Valieva and her fellow Russian skaters won the Olympic team event.
""According to the information sent by the laboratory to RUSADA, the delay in analysis and reporting by the laboratory was caused by another wave of COVID-19 (cases), an increase in illness among laboratory staff and quarantine rules,"" RUSADA said.
""Unfortunately I will not be making any comment on this case,"" Anton Pohanka, Director of Stockholm's Doping Control Laboratory (NYSE:LH) at Karolinska University Hospital, the only WADA-accredited lab in Sweden, told Reuters.
FOLLOW-UP CALL
WADA recommends that if a national anti-doping agency is not notified of a test result within 10 working days, it makes a ""follow-up call"" to the lab to enquire about the ""pending results"".
It was not known whether RUSADA made such a call. RUSADA was not available for comment when contacted outside working hours in Russia by Reuters.
Valieva is set to learn her fate before her next event, the women's single on Tuesday.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) have all appealed RUSADA's lifting of her provisional suspension.
There are grounds for hope for the 15-year-old.
If Valieva and her team concede wrongdoing, the penalty for a protected minor like her could be reduced to a warning, instead of a ban, which could allow her to continue to compete in the Olympics, an expert said.

""She could get down to a warning as a sanction because she's a minor, even on a substance that carries normally a mandatory four-year ban, because she's protected,"" Paul Greene, a U.S.-based sports lawyer who has represented athletes in anti-doping proceedings and founder of Global Sports Advocates, told Reuters. 
""So it's entirely permitted that she could get a lesser sanction because she's a minor. If she was given a warning as a sanction, she would be rendered immediately eligible to compete. To agree to a warning you would have to concede that she committed a violation, which they might not be willing to concede.""

PHOENIX (Reuters) -A man fatally shot a woman inside a Phoenix home on Friday, then opened fire on police who were called to the scene, wounding nine officers in a gunfight that ended with the suspect shot dead, city police said.
Another man who carried an infant girl out of the dwelling unharmed was taken into custody during the incident, which apparently stemmed from a domestic dispute before escalating into bloodshed and a standoff with a police, authorities said.
A Phoenix police department spokesperson, Sergeant Andy Williams, said the suspect, identified as Morris Jones, 36, was found dead inside the home from an apparent gunshot wound. But it was not immediately clear whether he took his own life or was killed in the shootout with police.
Authorities did not publicly identify any of the others involved in the shooting and offered no possible motive for the violence. 
The slain woman and the suspect were believed to have been the child's biological parents from a past relationship, while the second man was apparently related to both the gunman and his victim.
""This is senseless, it doesn’t need to happen, and it continues to happen over and over again,"" Police Chief Jeri Williams said at a separate briefing outside a Phoenix hospital where five police officers struck by gunfire were admitted.
Four of those officers were recovering and one was ""on the road to recovery,"" the chief said. Police said four other officers suffered less serious shrapnel wounds during the gunfight.
Police first arrived at the scene in mid-afternoon after an emergency call about a woman being shot. The suspect invited police inside the residence, but one officer was gunned down as he approached, Sergeant Williams said.
The man who later emerged from the house with the baby girl placed the child on the ground before surrendering to officers. He was later ruled out as a suspect, police said. 
Four more officers were shot and wounded while trying to move the baby out of the line of fire from the gunman, who by then had barricaded himself inside the property, police said. The child was ultimately rescued unharmed, according to police.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - An unidentified woman has filed a civil lawsuit that accuses American rapper Snoop Dogg of sexual assault and battery after she attended one of his concerts in 2013, allegations the musician's spokesperson called a meritless ""shakedown.""
The lawsuit was filed on Wednesday, days before Snoop Dogg is set to perform at the Super Bowl halftime show with other hip-hop artists near Los Angeles.
The woman was identified as Jane Doe and described as a dancer, model, host and actress who had worked with Snoop Dogg, though his spokesperson said she never worked for the artist.
In the lawsuit filed in the Central District of California against Calvin Broadus aka Snoop Dogg, the woman said Snoop Dogg entered a bathroom she was using, forced her to perform oral sex and masturbated in front of her. 
""Plaintiff found herself thinking about her job security if she displeased Defendant Snoop Dogg,"" the complaint said. ""Plaintiff felt pressured by defendant Snoop Dogg due to his dominance, and his position of power over her, including his ability to hire and fire her and ensure that she would never be hired in his industry again.""
A spokesperson for Snoop Dogg said the musician ""has never had any sexual encounter"" with the woman and the allegations were ""simply meritless.""
""They appear to be part of a self-enrichment shakedown scheme to extort Snoop Dogg right before he performs during this Sunday's Super Bowl halftime show,"" the spokesperson said.
Similar allegations were made by a woman in December 2021, using her full name, through the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the spokesperson said.
""What is clear is that this shakedown scheme is disgraceful. This attempt to use the courts to advance this scheme is shameful too, and does a disservice to real victims who deserve to be believed,"" the spokesperson added.
The woman said in the lawsuit she was also sexually assaulted earlier in the evening by a Snoop Dogg employee who is also named as a defendant. The parties tried to resolve the matter through mediation, the complaint said.

On Instagram on Wednesday, Snoop Dogg wrote that ""Gold digger season is here be careful... keep ya guards up. And. Keep ya circle small."" 
The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, said the post appeared shortly after mediation talks broke down.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - As far as Eddie Gibbs knows, he is the first person elected to the New York State Legislature who previously served time in prison, but shortly before his inauguration on Thursday he recalled wondering if he could ever shake the stigma of his manslaughter conviction more than 30 years ago.
Gibbs, 53, won handily as the Democratic candidate in the Jan. 18 special election in the state Assembly's 68th District to represent East Harlem, the New York City neighborhood where he was raised by a single mother in public housing. 
Gibbs said his past shapes his legislative priorities, including improving the lot of his district's disproportionately high number of public-housing tenants and making it easier for people released from prison to reenter society.
As a teenager in Upper Manhattan in the 1980s, selling illegal crack cocaine seemed like the most obvious way to leap out of poverty, something he now calls a ""terrible mistake.""
""You didn't think about repercussions back then, you just made money and you were happy,"" he said in an interview at the community center in the James Weldon Johnson Houses, the city-run apartment towers where his mother still lives. ""But I was also a target for a lot of people.""
When Gibbs was 17, he said a man attacked him in an elevator there in an attempted robbery in which he was stabbed in the leg. The man forced him to open the safe in his family's apartment, which contained little besides the gun with which Gibbs shot and killed the man.
Gibbs expresses remorse, but also emphasizes that he killed in self-defense and turned himself in to the local police station. He spent about a year and a half in the city's notoriously violent Rikers Island jail complex before pleading guilty to manslaughter following what he said was bad legal advice by a public defender. He was moved between several prisons outside the city over about three years before being released on parole.
Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader of the U.S. Senate, was among the prominent New York politicians to speak at Thursday's inauguration.
""But did Eddie get angry?"" Schumer said at. ""No. He has such a good heart, he said: 'I am going to do better for everyone else.'""
The New York Legislature does not have records to confirm that Gibbs is the first elected representative there to have been previously incarcerated, a spokeswoman said, but his new Democratic colleagues welcomed him.
""We are proud of the diversity that exists in our conference,"" Speaker Carl Heastie said in a statement, ""and we are certain that his unique perspective combined with his longtime commitment to his community will be an asset to the People's House."" 
Soon after his release, Gibbs took comedy classes and performed stand-up under the name Good Buddy, hoping to offset the notion that people should be afraid of someone convicted of a violent felony. He ended up working as a driver for about a decade for the celebrity criminal defense attorney Murray Richman, who encouraged him to enter politics.
After an earlier unsuccessful challenge to the 68th District seat, Gibbs ended up instead becoming the Democratic Party's district leader, a volunteer role.

Now one of his first priorities is passing legislation to remove some of the obstacles young people leaving prison can face securing state identification.
""When you come out of prison you have this rap that you're a bad guy, and I wanted the community to see me in a different light,"" he said.

(Reuters) - A Myanmar army officer who defected and fled the country has detailed battlefield losses to rebels in the southern part of Chin state, with at least 50 soldiers killed and 200 badly wounded in 2021 by opposition fighters with homemade weapons.
Kaung Thu Win, a captain who defected in December, offered a rare first-hand account of intensified fighting in Chin, in Myanmar's northwest, where the military junta has faced some of the fiercest armed resistance since it seized power a year ago.
He said he switched sides after hearing reports by colleagues of military abuses during clashes last year.
Speaking in northeastern India where he and his family have fled, the 32-year-old showed Reuters his national and military identity cards and detailed 12 incidents between May and December in which soldiers were killed or wounded by rebels.
He also showed Reuters some 30 classified army documents he said backed up his version of recent events in southern Chin state, where civilians opposed to the coup have taken up arms and are working with an established ethnic insurgent group.
He based his estimate of military casualties on that information.
The documents, stored on his mobile device, add new details of a major clash near the town of Mindat that have not previously been reported. They provide further evidence of a growing popular rebellion against Myanmar's military rulers that has spread across the country.
Four other Myanmar defectors who reviewed some of the documents said they mirrored others they had seen in terms of language, format and descriptions of combat.
Myanmar's military, known as the Tatmadaw, has acknowledged battlefield losses, but it has not provided details.
The Tatmadaw did not respond to requests for comment on events in Chin, the account given by Kaung Thu Win or the documents he produced. The military has previously described armed groups opposed to the junta as ""terrorists"".
The Indian home ministry did not reply to a request for comment on Myanmar defectors seeking refuge across the border with Chin.
Groups of fighters began forming in Chin state in the weeks after the Feb. 1 coup, but the Tatmadaw felt the full force of the rebellion after a convoy of seven vehicles was ambushed near the town of Mindat on May 14, according to Kaung Thu Win.
In the Mindat attack, one of the biggest clashes reported so far, hundreds of rebel fighters attacked the convoy around dawn, firing at troops from hillside positions, leaving five soldiers dead and 37 personnel unaccounted for, according to one of the documents.
""We were attacked by an estimated 1,000 insurgents,"" read an internal field report on the fighting. ""Six army trucks were burned down, and many weapons were lost.""
CASUALTIES MOUNT
In addition to details about the Mindat attack, the documents shown by the former captain include maps of military facilities in southern Chin state, information about army supplies and battlefield reports of skirmishes with rebels.
    The fighting in the southern areas of Chin, involving hastily formed Chinland Defence Force (CDF) guerrilla groups, has been fierce.
Kaung Thu Win said at least 20 Myanmar soldiers were killed in the May 14 ambush.
""It was only after the May 14 incident that the Tatmadaw started taking the CDF seriously,"" he told Reuters in an interview. ""It was a meeting of ... hunting guns (used by the CDF) and modern weapons.""
The military did not respond when asked whether this ambush represented a turning point.
The captain said his position as liaison officer meant that military documents, including those detailing supplies and convoys, were provided to him by staff at the regional headquarters that oversaw his frontline outpost in Chin.
He said he also had access to accounts of the Mindat ambush because he was part of the military investigation into the incident.
The ex-officer did not know the outcome of the probe, but said Major Yan Naung Htoo, who was involved in the battle, was put under house arrest in Monywa around September.
Reuters has been unable to reach the officer. The military did not comment when asked about his situation or a broader probe.
A Jan. 10 statement from a CDF group in Kalay said Kaung Thu Win had handed them guns and ammunition. The group said they had led the captain and his wife to a safe area and paid him for the arms. His wife had just given birth to their first child.
A spokesman for the Kalay defence force, CDF KKG, said they paid the captain around 6 million kyat ($3,300). That was below the estimated value of 9 million for the weapons and ammunition, but the group could not afford the full amount, the spokesman added.
He said defectors were under no obligation to the defence group, but they ask them about Tatmadaw operations before moving them to safety.
The captain confirmed he had been paid by the CDF KKG in return for the weapons, but declined to say how much.
'ARMED INSURRECTION'
The Myanmar military continued to suffer steady casualties throughout 2021, as guerrilla outfits across the state gained strength, according to Kaung Thu Win.
His account of the May clash underlines the scale of resistance to Myanmar's military. Some analysts now call the conflict a civil war.
The military calls the rebellion an ""armed insurrection"", and military ruler Min Aung Hlaing said there were more than 9,000 ""terrorist attacks"" last year. The junta said in January it had ""largely restored national stability"" by the second half of 2021.
Soldiers whose bodies are not immediately found following a battle are often classified as unaccounted for, Kaung Thu Win said, explaining the difference in fatalities listed in the report of the Mindat ambush - five - and his estimate of 20.
    A CDF statement on Jan. 26 put the death toll among troops at 1,029 across the whole of Chin between April and December 2021. During that period, CDF groups sustained 58 fatalities, alongside 27 civilian deaths, the statement added.
Opposition groups say more than 1,000 soldiers have swapped sides in recent months.
The Tatmadaw declined to comment when asked about the figures from the captain and resistance groups.
'LOVED MY JOB'
The youngest of three children born to civil servants in Myanmar's Yangon region, Kaung Thu Win said he entered the prestigious Defence Services Academy in 2006. Reuters could not reach the academy for comment.
Three years later, he graduated from the military university and joined Light Infantry Battalion 216, which was deployed to Myanmar's Karen and Shan states to fight ethnic armed groups battling for greater autonomy.
During some operations in Shan, he said he saw civilian properties destroyed, but deemed such incidents the inevitable consequence of armed conflict.
""I was proud of my work and I still loved my job,"" he said.
In 2016, Kaung Thu Win said he was sent to a command post in Chin state's Matupi town. He said he was posted as its liaison officer at a regional command centre in Monywa when the military staged the coup last February.
He recalled seeing Tatmadaw helicopters flying in wounded troops from the front for treatment at Monywa base, he added.
In October, the military began sending reinforcements into southern Chin state, taking the total number of troops in the area to some 1,200, up from 800 previously, Kaung Thu Win said. CDF fighters have also said troop numbers have increased.
Around the same time, the captain also began hearing of Tatmadaw troops torching villages along the routes their convoys would take, sending civilian populations fleeing into forested areas for safety. 
""I received first-hand information (from colleagues),"" he said, ""I decided to defect because, after the coup, I've seen so many stories and events where the lives and possessions of citizens were targeted intentionally by the Tatmadaw.""
Late last year, the United Nations, human rights groups and foreign governments raised concerns over the Myanmar military's heavy-handed response to uprisings in Chin state.
Some rights groups warned it mirrored the Tatmadaw's brutal clamp down on Rohingya Muslims in neighbouring Rakhine state in 2017, which led to the exodus of some 730,000 people.
The military has said it was waging a legitimate campaign in Rakhine against insurgents who attacked police posts.
With Kaung Thu Win's wife still pregnant with their first child, he said the couple decided to wait before trying to leave the country.

On Dec. 22, a day after he abruptly cut communications with his colleagues, Kaung Thu Win, his wife and their infant left Monywa on a bus and travelled to the border of Chin state where they contacted rebels, who guided them to a safe house.
""I am satisfied because I'm not one of those soldiers that people hate,"" the ex-officer said, cradling his infant. ""I am now a normal citizen and I'm proud of it.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - Russian skating prodigy Kamila Valieva's failed drug test prior to her dazzling Winter Games team gold threw the 15-year-old's Olympic future into doubt and reawakened global anger over Moscow's doping history on Friday.
But the Kremlin - already facing Western diplomatic wrath over a troop buildup near Ukraine - was also defiant in the sporting terrain, calling Valieva's case a ""misunderstanding"".
""Hold your head up, you're a Russian,"" government spokesman Dmitry Peskov urged her. ""Go proudly and beat everyone.""
The teenager became the first woman to land a quadruple jump at the Olympics on Monday, winning a team figure skating gold with the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC).
However, the International Testing Agency (ITA) said she had tested positive for banned heart drug Trimetazidine in a urine sample collected by Russian authorities back on Dec. 25 - though confirmation of that only came this week.
Valieva is due to compete again on Tuesday in the women's individual event. By then, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) should have ruled on her case from a closed boardroom on the second floor of a Beijing hotel.
She is one of the youngest Olympians ever to test positive.
Many fans and fellow athletes were furious at how Valieva came to have a prohibited drug in her system, blaming coaches, medics and authorities rather than her.
""It is a shame, and the responsible adults should be banned from the sport forever!!!"" said German figure-skating great Katarina Witt. ""What they knowingly did to her, if true, cannot be surpassed in inhumanity and makes my athlete's heart cry infinitely.""
Former U.S. figure skater Adam Rippon, who is in Beijing as a coach, summed up Valieva's plight by saying: ""This entire situation is heartbreaking... she is a minor. The adults around her have completely failed her. They've put her in this awful situation and should be punished.""
One Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) user under the name ""Fran"" said despite widespread sympathy towards Valieva, she had to be banned.
""Kamila Valieva is absolutely a victim in this scenario. However now that we know she really did test positive to TMZ, they absolutely can NOT let her compete,"" the post said.
'HONEST' MEDAL?
Russian athletes are already competing in Beijing as the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) - without their national flag and anthem - due to past sanctions for state-sponsored doping.
The latest controversy blew up after a testing lab in Sweden reported on Tuesday that Valieva's sample had been positive - the day after she wowed the world at the Capital Indoor Stadium.
Questions hang over why there was such a delay between her test and the result, which allowed her to travel to Beijing.
Russian Olympic Committee president Stanislav Pozdnyakov said Valieva's test may have been deliberately held back to coincide with the end of the team competition.
The ROC said it was taking comprehensive measures to protect its athletes and to keep an ""honestly"" won gold. It said Valieva's tests were negative before and after Dec. 25. 
In an Instagram post featuring Valieva as an angel, the ROC urged fans to show their support to ""a very young, fragile, charming girl"" as she ""faced the hardest test"" of her life. 
Russia's own anti-doping agency RUSADA imposed a provisional suspension on Valieva after Tuesday's result then lifted it a day after on appeal. On Friday, RUSADA said it was investigating her support team and attributed the delay in results to COVID-19 cases at the Swedish laboratory, TASS news agency reported.
With their reputations for fairness on the line, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) asked CAS to reinstate the suspension.
""We have a 100% policy against doping,"" IOC spokesman Mark Adams said.
Late on Friday CAS confirmed it had received applications from the IOC and WADA appealing RUSADA's decision to lift the suspension and said a decision will be made in due course.
STILL SKATING
Valieva, wearing a navy hoodie and black tights under padded shorts, skated again in practice on Friday afternoon.
The controversy over her has delayed the medal ceremony for the team event, with the United States and Japan waiting in the wings after taking silver and bronze positions. Canada finished fourth. 
CAS's ruling will not only determine if the ROC will be disqualified from the team event, thus losing their gold medal, but also if Valieva will be allowed to compete in the women's individual competition.
Travis Tygart, head of the U.S. Anti Doping Agency (USADA), expressed sympathy for Valieva, but said the U.S. could use new laws to prosecute those around her.
""Clean athletes deserve better, and this poor young woman deserves better,"" he told Reuters. ""She's getting chewed up (for doping) on top of being abused by the Russian state system.""
The United States could prosecute the Russians involved in Valieva's case under the American Rodchenkov Act (RADA). 
It was signed into law in 2020 and empowers American prosecutors to seek fines of up to $1 million and jail terms of up to 10 years, even for non-Americans, if actions have affected American athletes’ results.

Former WADA deputy head Rob Koehler said the global bodies in charge of eradicating doping were to blame for being too lenient on Russia in the past.
""By not banning Russia for four years, there was no need or desire for cultural change by Russian authorities,"" he said. ""WADA, IOC and CAS favoured the power and influence of Russian sport over clean sport.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - The United States could prosecute the Russians involved in figure skater Kamila Valieva’s doping case under the American Rodchenkov Act, the head of the U.S. Anti Doping Agency (USADA), Travis Tygart, told Reuters on Friday.
The Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act (RADA) was signed into U.S. law in 2020 and empowers American prosecutors to seek fines of up to $1 million and jail terms of up to 10 years, even for non-Americans, if their actions have affected results of U.S. athletes.
Russian Valieva won gold in the team event on Monday but the International Testing Agency (ITA) said on Friday the 15-year-old had earlier failed a drug test. The United States won silver in the event and Japan bronze.
Olympic officials are now contesting Russia's decision to let her compete at the Beijing Winter Games.
""The act has been used to protect one Olympic Games,"" Tygart said, referring to last year's Tokyo Summer Games. ""It is going to be used to protect other Olympic Games when people continue to dope.
""We are living in the twilight zone. Clean athletes deserve better, and this poor young woman deserves better. She's getting chewed up (for doping) on top of being abused by the Russian state system,"" Tygart added.
The RADA gives U.S. authorities the power to prosecute individuals for doping schemes at international events involving American athletes, sponsors or broadcasters. 
It was named after Grigory Rodchenkov, a former Russia anti-doping laboratory head who turned whistleblower and helped expose Russia's state-sponsored doping following the 2014 Sochi Winter Games.
Doctors, coaches and government officials responsible for doping are accountable under the statute, but athletes themselves cannot be charged under RADA because often they are forced or coerced into taking the drugs, said Jim Walden, an attorney for Rodchenkov who helped author the law.
""The minute a doctor, a coach, a government official is behind American bars for doping at a sporting event like the Olympics, you will see a rapid decrease in (doping) because people will realize there's now a new sheriff in town and there's real penalties,"" Walden told Reuters.
Individuals with pending U.S. arrest warrants could be arrested if they travel to countries with extradition treaties with the United States for competitions, Walden said.
Russia has acknowledged some shortcomings in its implementation of anti-doping rules but denies running a state-sponsored doping programme.
GAMES HIGHLIGHT
Valieva delivered one of the highlights of the Beijing Games so far when she landed the first quadruple jumps by a woman in Olympic competition on Monday.
Her Olympic dream, however, turned into a nightmare on Friday, when the ITA revealed publicly that she had tested positive for banned angina drug trimetazidine in a urine sample collected by Russian authorities at the national championships in St Petersburg on Dec 25.
The testing lab in Stockholm reported on Tuesday that her sample was positive, the day after she wowed the world and helped win gold for her team, who are competing as the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) due to doping sanctions.
It was not immediately clear why there was such a delay between her test and the result, which allowed her to travel to Beijing and take part in the first of her two events.
""Whoever was dealing with it, simply, absolutely should have expedited it,"" Tygart said. ""It is not that difficult to do. A five-week delay for a substance like this should not have happened.
""It is a catastrophic failure of the system to allow the star of the Games to have her sample not reported back close to five weeks, and then it gets reported the day after they won the team event,"" he continued.
""You shouldn’t be in a government or sport and (be) able to dope athletes and there be no consequence. It was exactly what happened in state-sponsored doping, and this is why the Rodchenkov Act was passed. It's the only way to address this behaviour,"" Tygart said.
""Many of us were disappointed in the initial state-sponsored doping (in Russia) that was exposed back in 2015, that those who orchestrated and conspired to abuse young athletes ... were not held accountable by their sport or their own governments.""

Russian athletes at the Games are not competing under their flag, and their anthem is not played at any ceremonies following sanctions imposed for the widespread doping across many sports exposed after the Sochi Games.
The sanctions are due to be lifted at the end of the year, but the head of the World Anti-Doping Agency cautioned earlier this month that Russia should not assume this would happen automatically.

(Reuters) - A man accused of driving his vehicle into a traditional Christmas parade near Milwaukee late last year, killing six people and injuring dozens others, pleaded not guilty on Friday to multiple criminal charges.
Darrell Brooks, 39, entered the pleas to 77 charges, including six counts of homicide and several counts of reckless endangerment, in a court appearance.
""Not guilty plea entered. Bail remains as fixed"", court records showed after Friday's proceedings.
Brooks will remain jailed on a $5 million bail and a hearing is scheduled for March 11, according to the website of a Wisconsin Circuit Court.
Brooks, a Milwaukee resident, was arrested near the scene of the carnage in November. Authorities said Brooks deliberately drove an SUV through police barricades and into the annual parade in the city of Waukesha, about 20 miles (32 km) west of Milwaukee.
The victims killed ranged in age from 8 to 81, and included some members of the ""Milwaukee Dancing Grannies"" parade group. In addition to those killed, more than 60 people were injured.
Video of the incident showed a red SUV racing alongside the parade route and then into the procession, appearing to run over many people before bystanders raced from sidewalks to help.

At the time of the incident, Brooks was out on bail from a domestic abuse case and was suspected in another violent altercation.
The incident drew the attention of both President Joe Biden, who called the attack ""horrific,"" and Pope Francis.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Russia now has enough forces to conduct a major military operation against Ukraine and an assault aimed at seizing large parts of that country could begin ""any day now,"" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Friday.
Sullivan, speaking at a White House briefing without listing specific evidence, said any American still in Ukraine should leave in the next 24-48 hours. He said a Russian invasion could start with an air assault that would make departures difficult.
Sullivan said U.S. intelligence believes Russian President Vladimir Putin could order an invasion before the end of the Winter Olympics in Beijing on Feb. 20 and that a rapid assault on the Ukraine capital Kyiv is a possibility.
Sullivan spoke after President Joe Biden held a secure video call with transatlantic leaders from the White House Situation Room and sought allied unity in the face of a worsening situation.
It remains unclear, Sullivan said, whether Putin has definitively given an order to start an invasion. He said he expects Biden to seek out a phone call with Putin soon on the crisis.
""We have not seen anything come to us that says a final decision has been taken, the go-order has been given,"" he said.
But with 100,000 troops massed on Ukraine's border, Sullivan said a Russian invasion could involve seizure of large sections of Ukraine as well as major cities including Kyiv.
Sullivan said there is a ""fundamental distinction"" between the intelligence situation now and that which the United States used in justifying the 2003 Iraq war, which was based on claims of weapons of mass destruction that turned out to be wrong.

Then, U.S. ""intelligence was used and deployed from this very podium to start a war. We are trying to stop a war, to prevent a war,"" he said.
Further, he said, in 2003 ""it was information about intentions, about hidden things, stuff that couldn't be seen. Today we are talking about more than 100,000 Russian troops amassed along the Ukrainian border... it's all over social media, it's all over your news sites. So, you can believe your own eyes.""

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Russia has sent more forces to its border with Ukraine and could launch an invasion at any time, including during the Beijing Winter Olympics, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday. 
He said Washington was continuing to ""draw down"" its embassy in Ukraine and repeated a State Department call to American citizens in Ukraine to leave the country immediately.
""Simply put, we continue to see very troubling signs of Russian escalation, including new forces arriving at the Ukrainian border,"" Blinken told a news conference in the Australian city of Melbourne.
""As we've said before, we're in a window when an invasion could begin at any time, and to be clear, that includes during the Olympics."" 
Russia, which has more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders, denies Western accusations it may be planning to invade its former Soviet neighbour. The Winter Olympics are being hosted by Beijing until Feb. 20.
At the opening day of the Winter Olympics last week, China and Russia declared a ""no limits"" partnership, backing each other over standoffs on Ukraine and Taiwan with a promise to collaborate more against the West.
Beijing supported Russia's demand that Ukraine should not be admitted into NATO, as the Kremlin amasses 100,000 troops near its neighbour, while Moscow opposed any form of independence for Taiwan, as global powers jostle over their spheres of influence.
Russia's potential invasion of Ukraine threatened the international rules based order, Blinken said, adding that if such an action went unpunished, it could have consequences in the Indo-Pacific -- an apparent hint at the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.
""If we allow those principles to be challenged with impunity, even if it's half a world away, that will have an impact here as well. Others are watching. Others are looking at all of us to see how we respond,"" Blinken said.
Britain said on Thursday the ""most dangerous moment"" in the West's standoff with Moscow appeared imminent, as Russia held military exercises in Belarus and the Black Sea following the buildup of its forces near Ukraine.
The U.S. State Department urged Americans in Ukraine to leave immediately because of what it called increased threats of Russian military action and Blinken said Washington would continue to draw down its embassy after it had ordered the departure of family members of staff at its mission in January.

""We will continue that process and we've also been very clear that any American citizens who remain in Ukraine should leave now,"" Blinken said.
The United States and its allies have warned Russia of harsh sanctions if it goes ahead with an invasion of Ukraine. Moscow says the crisis is being driven by NATO and U.S. actions, and is demanding security guarantees from the West, including a promise by NATO never to admit Ukraine.

PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron refused a Kremlin request that he take a Russian COVID-19 test when he arrived to see President Vladimir Putin this week, to prevent Russia getting hold of Macron's DNA, two sources in Macron's entourage told Reuters.
As a result, the visiting French head of state was kept at a distance from the Russian leader during lengthy talks on the Ukraine crisis in Moscow.
They were photographed at opposite ends of a table so long that it provoked satirical comment on social media and speculation, including by diplomats, that Putin might be using it to send a message.
But two sources who have knowledge of the French president's health protocol told Reuters Macron had been given a choice: either accept a PCR test done by the Russian authorities and be allowed to get close to Putin, or refuse and have to abide by more stringent social distancing.
""We knew very well that meant no handshake and that long table. But we could not accept that they get their hands on the president's DNA,"" one of the sources told Reuters, referring to security concerns if the French leader was tested by Russian doctors.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed that Macron had declined the test and said Russia had no problem with this, but it meant that a 6-metre (20 feet) distance from Putin was required in order to protect the Kremlin leader's health.
""There is no politics in this, it does not interfere with negotiations in any way,"" he said.
A second source in Macron's entourage said he instead took a French PCR test before departure and an antigen test done by his own doctor once in Russia.
""The Russians told us Putin needed to be kept in a strict health bubble,"" the second source said. 
Macron's office said the Russian health protocol ""did not seem to us to be either acceptable or compatible with our diary constraints"", referring to the length of time that would have been required to wait for the results.

When asked specifically about DNA theft, Macron’s office said: ""The president has doctors who define with him the rules that are acceptable or not in terms of his own health protocol.""
On Thursday, three days after Macron and Putin had their socially-distanced meeting, the Russian leader received Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. The two men shook hands, and sat close to each other, divided only by a small coffee table.

ROME (Reuters) - At a trial under way in Sicily, a 28-year-old Italian is seeking justice against a man he accuses of forcing him to perform sex acts before going on to become a priest. 
The victim says the alleged abuse, committed more than a decade ago when he was a minor and the accused was a seminarian leading youth groups, included forced masturbation and oral sex in sacristies and schoolrooms. The accused denies the charges.
The victim went to the police only after the Church failed to act on his accusations, which he spelled out to two priests and at a meeting with a bishop involving his parents. 
Victims' groups say there are thousands of similar cases hidden in Church archives, and they are increasing pressure for an independent investigation in Italy to mirror recent moves in France and Germany. 
Nine Italian groups have formed a consortium and on Tuesday will announce a campaign called ""Beyond the Great Silence"" and unveil a hashtag #ItalyChurchToo.
It aims to put public pressure on the Italian government to investigate past and present abuse in the Church or for the Church to commission an impartial investigation by outsiders.
The campaign is the latest move worldwide to force the Catholic Church to establish the full extent of sexual abuse by clergy that has cost it millions of dollars in compensation to victims.
""The state and the government have to take the initiative on this,"" Francesco Zanardi, the head of one of the groups, Rete l'Abuso (The Abuse Network), which tracks clerical abuse in Italy, told Reuters.
""If the Church investigates itself, its first objective will be to protect itself,"" said Zanardi, who is a victim of clergy sexual abuse.
'POWDER KEG'
The campaigners did not say how many sexual abuse crimes they suspect have been committed in Italy, but Rete l'Abuso has documented hundreds of such cases, most of them current or recent.
The German study, released in 2018, showed 1,670 clergymen abused 3,677 minors from 1946 to 2014. The French investigation released last year and covering seven decades, said more than 200,000 children were abused in Catholic institutions.
Pope Francis has expressed shame at the Church's inability to deal with sexual abuse cases and said the Church must make itself a ""safe home for everyone"". Former Pope Benedict has acknowledged that errors occurred in handling sexual abuse cases when he was Archbishop of Munich and asked for forgiveness.
The results of an independent investigation going back decades could be devastating in Italy, where about 74% of the population are Catholic.
""The Church does not want this because it would be a powder keg,"" Zanardi said.
Bishops in Italy are divided over what type of investigation should be done. 
Some say the Church has the resources, such as diocesan anti-abuse committees, to do the work itself. 
Cardinal Gualtiero Bassetti, who favours an internal investigation, explained his position in a newspaper interview. Paola Lazzarini, head of Women in the Church, which is part of the consortium, told Reuters that Bassetti's position ""does not satisfy us one bit"".
Other bishops, including Erio Castellucci of Modena and Paolo Lojudice of Siena, have signalled support for commissioning an outside investigation.
Victims groups and some abuse experts within the Church have warned that an inside investigation will not be convincing.

""We can have the best intentions but as long as we do it in-house nobody is going to believe us,"" Father Hans Zollner, who heads the department of safeguarding and prevention of sexual abuse at Rome's Gregorian University, told Reuters.
A decision is due to be taken in May at a plenary to elect the new president of the Italian Bishops Conference because any investigation will be done during his five-year mandate.

BISSAU (Reuters) - In October, President Umaro Sissoco Embalo told French radio that drug trafficking and corruption were over in Guinea-Bissau, a country that has struggled to shake off its reputation as a ""narco state"" of West Africa.
Those words rang hollow a few months later. Fierce gunfire interrupted a cabinet meeting Embalo was presiding over, and within hours of the deadly Feb. 1 attack he described it as a failed coup attempt possibly linked to the drugs trade.
At a news conference on Thursday, Embalo said three soldiers who were arrested by U.S. drug authorities in a 2013 sting operation and pleaded guilty to cocaine trafficking had been detained in connection with the attack.
Embalo said he personally saw two - Captain Tchamy Yala and Lieutenant Papis Djeme - during the assault and that ex-navy commander Bubo Na Tchuto was coordinating the coup attempt from navy headquarters.
""When the shots were being fired in the Government Palace, Bubo was at the navy headquarters ... and I heard the assailants say we are going to call him to send us reinforcements.
""Bubo was arrested in uniform - someone who is not on active duty ... That shows the intention,"" Embalo said.
Reuters has not been able to reach the three men for comment.
Embalo suggested the attack, in which the government said seven security personnel defending the president, three government workers and one assailant were killed, was retaliation for his efforts to crack down on drug trafficking.
""When I committed to this fight against corruption and narco-trafficking, I think that I signed my death warrant,"" he said.
But some politicians and regional analysts have questioned this, saying drug smuggling has persisted under Embalo's watch and the attack was more likely related to trafficking groups and their political backers competing for the spoils.
""I think it's a conflict between all the factions that participate in the government or some of the factions,"" said Manuel dos Santos, a senior member of the main opposition African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde.
""And it is probably related to drug trafficking.""
The president's uncle Mussa Embalo, until recently an adviser, said Embalo had shaken up the leadership of the navy and judicial police to better combat drug trafficking.
""There are successes and setbacks. We need (the) assistance of our international partners,"" he told Reuters.
COCAINE HUB
Most people in the capital believe the intense, five-hour gun battle was, in one way or another, tied to narcotics.
It is an indication that, despite false dawns in recent years, Guinea-Bissau remains vulnerable to instability that some top officials blame on the illicit trade.
Embalo said at the news conference that many military officers and politicians continue to be involved in the drugs trade.
Asked how he reconciled that position with his remarks in October that trafficking was no longer a problem, he did not directly answer.
Defence Minister Sandji Fati declined to be interviewed for this article. An armed forces spokesman did not respond to questions on whether officers were involved in the cocaine trade.
The country of two million people emerged as a major cocaine trafficking hub in the 2000s, according to experts.
Guinea-Bissau's location on West Africa's Atlantic coast and lax law enforcement made it attractive to cartels, they said.
By sending their product first to Guinea-Bissau or neighbouring countries and then on a separate ship or plane to Europe or the United States, they could avoid scrutiny typically reserved for cargoes originating in South America.
There were no major cocaine busts in West Africa from 2014 to 2018, leading some to question whether the region had fallen out of favour with traffickers or managed to clean up its act.
But a spate of record seizures in 2019 from Guinea-Bissau to Senegal and Cape Verde put paid to those hopes, and some experts believe the region's current role is substantial at a time of record global cocaine production.
""Guinea-Bissau is one of the rapidly rising West African countries used as a point of transit for drug trafficking on the route to Europe,"" the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime's regional representative for West and Central Africa, Amado Philip de Andrés, told Reuters.
While he noted some positive developments in recent years, most of which pre-dated Embalo, he said more needed to be done.
""There are still grounds for improvement in Guinea-Bissau, particularly in terms of bringing perpetrators to justice.""
For Guinea-Bissau, the repercussions from the trade are serious.
Residents of Bissau, which has experienced around a dozen coups or attempted coups since independence from Portugal in 1974, said in the wake of the Feb. 1 bloodshed that they could not recall an incident of such intense violence.
When Reuters reporters visited the Government Palace three days after the attack, hundreds of shell casings lay strewn on the ground near dried pools of blood, and bullet holes pockmarked all four sides of the main building.
An unexploded rocket-propelled grenade was wedged between the branches of a palm tree. Another was lodged in a wall.
Witnesses in the neighbourhood said ministers had fled the compound on foot into the dirt roads behind the compound, seeking refuge in surrounding buildings.
Embalo said he hid in a side office for five hours with his justice minister and two guards. 
""I said: 'we stay here but you leave the door open ... because when the door is open, people think that there is no one inside.'""
TACKLING THE PROBLEM
Two law enforcement sources said that they detected an uptick in activity related to cocaine smuggling in Guinea-Bissau throughout 2020, the year that Embalo took office.
A Western diplomat said he thought Embalo was sincere about wanting to crack down on trafficking but that he was constrained by the military's influence.
Embalo, a former army general, has refused to hand over former armed forces chief Antonio Indjai to U.S. authorities, who last year offered up to $5 million for information leading to his arrest. Indjai was indicted in U.S. court in 2013 on narcotics trafficking charges.
    Indjai denies the allegations, and Embalo said he is prevented by national law from extraditing a Guinea-Bissau citizen.
The two men appeared in a photograph at the presidency that was published in local news reports and shared on social media shortly after Embalo's inauguration in February 2020.
Musso Embalo, the uncle, said the photo with Indjai and other senior officers was taken to show the support of the Balanta, Guinea-Bissau's largest ethnic group, for Embalo, who is Fulani.
Indjai is Balanta and the group dominates Guinea-Bissau's military.
The government spokesman did not respond to requests for comment about the photo or the government's actions on drug trafficking.
The president's account of seeing Yala and Djeme during the attack is consistent with a leaked army report that said the two soldiers were at the scene.
The president said there had been a number of other arrests but declined to say how many, pending the outcome of an official investigation.
Na Tchuto, Yala and Djeme were detained in 2013 by U.S. authorities on a luxury yacht after offering to import narcotics into the United States on behalf of informants they thought were South American traffickers.
The three men pleaded guilty to conspiracy in a U.S. court and were later released after serving their sentences.

The case cemented Guinea-Bissau's reputation as a stopover of choice for Latin American drugs en route to Europe and the United States. Even before that, Guinea-Bissau had been described as a ""narco state"" by the United Nations.
President João Bernardo Vieira was assassinated by soldiers in 2009, a killing widely believed to have been connected to trafficking networks. In 2012, army officers eyeing control of the drug trade seized power in the so-called ""cocaine coup"".

(Reuters) -Elon Musk said on Thursday he was ""highly confident"" his new SpaceX Starship, designed for voyages to the moon and Mars, will reach Earth orbit for the first time this year, despite a host of technical and regulatory hurdles yet to be overcome.
The billionaire SpaceX founder and CEO addressed a throng of news media and supporters at his company's ""Starbase"" facility in Boca Chica, Texas, for a presentation that combined a high-tech pep rally with big-screen videos and a question-and-answer session.
It came nine months after the private California-based space venture achieved the first successful launch and touchdown of a Starship prototype rocket in a test-flight after four previous landing attempts ended in explosions.
Musk acknowledged difficulties SpaceX has faced in developing the ""Raptor 2"" engines for its Super Heavy rocket, a reusable next-generation launch booster designed to carry the Starship spacecraft to orbit. He cited problems with melting inside the thruster chambers of the engines from intense heat.
But he said, ""we're very close to solving that,"" and expected to scale up production to about seven or eight of the engines a week by next month and produce a new Starship and a booster every month by year's end.
""I feel at this point highly confident that we will get to orbit (with the Starship) this year,"" said Musk, who also heads electric car maker Tesla . 
Such a time frame would mark an ambitious feat, even for an uncrewed orbital test flight of the Super Heavy/Starship combo, the next step up from SpaceX's current workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, which Musk said has flown 144 successful launches and 106 return landings.
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW
But the very future of the Boca Chica test-flight and production facility near the southeastern Gulf Coast tip of Texas is now at stake in an environmental assessment of the site under way by the Federal Aviation Administration.
The FAA is expected to decide in the coming weeks whether a planned build-out there poses a significant environmental impact to the area - including an adjacent wildlife reserve - and must therefore undergo a far more extensive study before expanded operations at Boca Chica can be licensed.
Such an environmental impact statements, or EIS reviews, can take years to complete and are often subject to litigation.
Asked what he knew about the status of the FAA review, Musk said, ""We don't have a ton of insight into where things stand with the FAA,"" but added: ""We have gotten sort of a rough indication there may be an approval in March. But that's all we know.""
Even in a ""worst-case"" scenario, in which a full EIS were required or legal wrangling over the issue threatened to drag on, Musk said SpaceX has a fall-back plan. The company would shift its entire Starship program to the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, where SpaceX already has received the environmental approval it needs, Musk said.

Such a move would cause a setback of six to eight months, he added.
In any case, SpaceX is still shooting for a 2023 launch of what it calls the world's first private lunar mission, flying Japanese entrepreneur Yusaku Maezawa and a dozen artists aboard a Starship to loop around the moon and return to Earth.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Senate on Thursday approved a bill that would ban companies from forcing employees who allege sexual assault or harassment to settle their claims with an arbiter without the option of filing a lawsuit.
The bill, which the House of Representatives passed earlier this week, was sent to President Joe Biden to sign into law. The Senate approved it in a voice vote, indicating broad bipartisan support in the narrowly divided chamber.
The Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act was first sponsored by Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) in 2017. It would provide federal protection for employees' right to sue their employers over allegations of sexual harassment or assault, nullifying clauses in employment contracts that force employees to enter arbitration with their employer instead.
An estimated 60 million Americans are subject to forced arbitration clauses that are ""especially common in female-dominated industries,"" Gillibrand said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote.
The legislation, she said, would address ""a broken system that protects perpetrators and corporations and end the days of silencing survivors.""
The forced arbitration clauses are often are accompanied by a non-disclosure agreement, Gillibrand said.
""Instead of being allowed their day in court these survivors are pushed into a system designed by the same corporations they are challenging,"" she said.
Republican Senator Joni Ernst, in a speech on the Senate floor said the bill will ensure that ""survivors of sexual assault and sexual harassment ... voices will not be silenced.""

She noted that the bill is narrowly written. ""This bill should not be the catalyst for destroying pre-dispute arbitration agreements in all employment matters.""
The bill is one of the few pieces of legislation passed in a narrowly divided Senate this year, including Biden's $1 trillion infrastructure bill and a debt limit increase.

(Reuters) - A Minnesota judge approved the ""no-knock"" raid that killed Amir Locke in Minneapolis last week, believing it was needed to protect the investigating officers and the public, court documents released on Thursday showed. 
Officers who requested the warrant to enter a Minneapolis apartment were investigating a previous fatal shooting in St. Paul in which a firearm capable of penetrating police body armor was used. That justified the need for a no-knock entry to catch suspects off guard, the requesting officers said. 
""The court further finds that no-knock entry, without announcement of authority or purpose, is necessary to prevent the loss, destruction, or removal of the objects of said search or to protect the safety of the searchers or the public,"" a court document signed by Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill said.
Locke, a 22-year-old Black man, was not named in the warrant. Minneapolis police have acknowledged it was unclear how or whether he was connected to their investigation. 
Locke's killing has revived calls to ban no-knock warrants, which intensified in 2020 after the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman who police fatally shot during a raid on her Kentucky apartment. Taylor was not the subject of that search warrant. 
Cahill is the same judge who oversaw the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who was convicted of murdering George Floyd in 2020, an act that spurred massive protests against racial bias and brutality by the police.
In the days after Locke’s killing on Feb. 2, police released video footage of the raid, and peaceful protests in downtown Minneapolis have drawn hundreds of demonstrators to demand justice and a ban on no-knock warrants. 
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey announced a moratorium on such searches on Friday, and some state lawmakers are seeking to enact legislation to limit them.
Video footage from the raid showed Locke holding a gun as he twisted beneath a blanket on a sofa after being roused by officers. Police say he pointed the gun at officers before they opened fire, but Locke’s family refutes that narrative. 
Activists at the protests have said Locke had a right to possess a weapon in his own home and was never given the chance to disarm himself in the chaotic moments as police stormed into his apartment without warning. 
The no-knock warrant was issued in relation to a homicide probe led by detectives from the St. Paul Police Department. 

The document mentions four suspects and names two of them, redacting the identity of one. Mehkia Speed, a named 17-year-old suspect, was arrested this week in connection to the killing of Otis Elder, 38, in Saint Paul, according to authorities.
The apartment raided on Feb. 2 was registered to the girlfriend of Speed's brother, according to a charging document filed by Ramsey County Attorney John J. Choi. Speed's brother, his girlfriend and Locke were at the apartment at the time.

BRUSSELS/MOSCOW (Reuters) -Britain said on Thursday the ""most dangerous moment"" in the West's standoff with Moscow appeared imminent, as Russia held military exercises in Belarus and the Black Sea following the buildup of its forces near Ukraine.
Ukraine also staged war games and the United States urged Americans in the country to leave immediately due to increased threats of Russian military action. But leaders on all sides signalled they hoped diplomacy could still prevail in what British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called Europe's biggest security crisis for decades.
In a new round of talks, Britain's foreign minister sparred publicly with her Russian counterpart in Moscow, Johnson visited NATO headquarters in Brussels and Germany's leader met his Baltic states counterparts in Berlin, where officials from Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France were also holding discussions.
Russia, which has more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders, denies Western accusations it may be planning to invade its former Soviet neighbour, though it says it could take unspecified ""military-technical"" action unless demands are met.
""I honestly don't think a decision has yet been taken"" by Moscow on whether to attack, Johnson told a news conference with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. ""But that doesn't mean that it is impossible that something absolutely disastrous could happen very soon indeed."" 
""This is probably the most dangerous moment, I would say, in the course of the next few days, in what is the biggest security crisis that Europe has faced for decades.""
The way forward was diplomacy, Johnson later told reporters in Poland.
Stoltenberg also said it was a dangerous moment for European security, adding: ""The number of Russian forces is going up. The warning time for a possible attack is going down.""
In a new point of friction, Ukraine criticised Russian naval exercises that it said were part of a ""hybrid war"" and had made navigation in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov ""virtually impossible"".
Nearly nine hours of talks between Ukraine and Russia on Thursday failed to produce a breakthrough on signing a joint document, but both sides agreed to keep talking, the chief of staff to Ukraine's president said after the talks in Berlin. 
Russia said the talks with Ukraine, France and Germany on the conflict in eastern Ukraine fell short of any new agreement, and criticised what it called a lack of clarity in the Ukrainian position.
'THINGS COULD GO CRAZY QUICKLY'
The U.S. State Department urged Americans in Ukraine to leave immediately due to what it called increased threats of Russian military action. 
""American citizens should leave now,"" President Joe Biden told NBC News in an interview. ""We're dealing with one of the largest armies in the world. It's a very different situation and things could go crazy quickly."" 
Asked whether there was a scenario that could prompt him to send troops to rescue fleeing Americans, Biden replied: ""There's not. That's a world war when Americans and Russia start shooting at one another. We're in a very different world than we've ever been."" 
Visiting Moscow, British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss was upbraided by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who accused her of refusing to listen.
""I'm honestly disappointed that what we have is a conversation between a mute person and a deaf person,"" the 71-year-old veteran diplomat told a news conference. 
""Our most detailed explanations fell on unprepared soil .. numerous facts that we produced bounced off (the British delegation.""
Truss, who warned of tough Western sanctions if Ukraine was attacked, challenged Lavrov over his assertion that Russia's build-up of troops and weaponry was not threatening anyone.
""I can't see any other reason for having 100,000 troops stationed on the border, apart from to threaten Ukraine. And if Russia is serious about diplomacy, they need to remove those troops and desist from the threats,"" she said.
Lavrov said Moscow favoured diplomacy to resolve the crisis. 
DE-ESCALATION EFFORTS
Truss's talks in Moscow follow shuttle diplomacy from French President Emmanuel Macron, who visited Moscow and Kyiv this week. In contrast to U.S. and British leaders, Macron has played down the likelihood of a Russian invasion soon.
As part of U.S. efforts to ""reduce chances of miscalculation"", the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, spoke on Thursday with his Belarusian counterpart, a Pentagon spokesman said.
Urging de-escalation, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Germany and its allies were ready for dialogue with Moscow and wanted peace. 
However further military aggression against Ukraine ""would have very serious political, economic and strategic consequences for Russia,"" Scholz told reporters in Berlin. 
Moscow has used the tensions to seek security concessions from the West that would include a promise never to admit Ukraine to NATO and halt the military alliance's expansion.
The EU said on Thursday it had delivered a single letter in response to Russia's proposals on European security, NATO and the United States having earlier portrayed Russia's main demands as non-starters. 
Stoltenberg said last week that Russia was expected to have 30,000 troops in Belarus as well SU-35 fighter jets, S-400 air defence systems and nuclear-capable Iskander missiles.
Russia held a briefing for military attachés that lasted just eight minutes, and gave notice of an exercise that was already under way, a senior U.S. State Department official said.
""That's highly inconsistent with agreements for transparency for large military exercises in Europe. That's bad news,"" the official said. 

Ukraine launched its own war games on Thursday which, like Russia's joint drills with Minsk, will run until Feb. 20. 
The Ukrainian forces, whose numbers have not been disclosed, are set to use Bayraktar drones and anti-tank Javelin and NLAW missiles provided by foreign partners. Kyiv was due to receive a further shipment of U.S. military aid later on Thursday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former National Guard member who served in Iraq on Thursday received a six-month prison sentence for punching two police officers during the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.
U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in the District of Columbia imposed the punishment on Mark Leffingwell of Seattle, who pleaded guilty to a felony assault charge.
Prosecutors had asked Jackson to sentence Leffingwell, 52, to a much longer sentence of 27 months in prison. But the judge said she was imposing a lighter sentence, citing factors including Leffingwell's remorse and lack of criminal history.
Jackson is one of several federal judges in the District of Columbia who have sharply criticized the Jan. 6 riot, calling it ""the definition of tyranny"" during Thursday's court hearing.
""It is not legitimate political discourse to descend on the nation's Capitol on behalf of a disappointed former president and disrupt the electoral process,"" Jackson said, an apparent reference to a Republican Party resolution https://www.reuters.com/world/us/loyal-trump-republican-party-moves-censure-us-reps-cheney-kinzinger-2022-02-04 that used the term to criticize the congressional investigation into the Jan. 6 attack.
""I'm embarrassed and ashamed of myself,"" Leffingwell said during the hearing. ""I wish I could go back and make it not happen.""
The Justice Department said last month that more than 225 people have been charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers or government employees during the Jan. 6 attack.

Approximately 140 police officers were assaulted that day, the Justice Department said.
Four officers died by suicide in the aftermath of the attack.

(Reuters) - A 16-year-old boy was arrested on Thursday and charged with calling in bomb threats at seven predominantly Black schools in Washington a day earlier, the city police department said.
The four high schools and three charter schools, which were evacuated following Wednesday's bomb threats and later cleared, included Dunbar High School, which was threatened on Tuesday https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bomb-threats-force-evacuation-seven-washington-schools-2022-02-09 during a visit by U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris' husband. 
The teenager from Southeast Washington was charged with making ""terrorist threats,"" the Metropolitan Police Department posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Authorities did not release the suspect's name and said the investigation into the incident was continuing.
Authorities have not indicated a connection to race in the spate of bomb threats, and police said Tuesday's incident did not appear to be targeted at Harris' husband, Douglas Emhoff, who was visiting Dunbar for a Black History Month event.
But the incidents have further raised fears among Black communities already rattled by a series of bomb threats made last week against at least a dozen historically Black colleges and universities, or HBCUs, nationwide.
No explosives were found at any of the HBCUs, but the threats are being probed by the FBI.
The United States faces heightened threats from extremist groups, underscored by the bomb threats at many HBCUs, among other factors, the Department of Homeland Security said https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-warns-extremism-after-texas-synagogue-attack-bomb-threats-colleges-2022-02-07 on Monday.

PARIS (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin spent much of his marathon talks with France's Emmanuel Macron this week on the Ukraine crisis reciting grievances that date back to the end of the Cold War, two sources in the French leader's entourage said.
In the first detailed read-out on Monday's meeting in Moscow from the French delegation, the sources said Macron had been struck by how different Putin was to the man he had met in his summer residence on the French Riviera three years ago.
""(Putin) gave him five hours of historical revisionism,"" said one of the two sources, describing how the Kremlin leader laid out his belief that the West had broken commitments to Russia since 1997 with the enlargement of NATO to include former Soviet bloc states.
""So he goes on for hours rewriting history from 1997 on. He drowns you in these long monologues. And the president (Macron) kept on going back to the issues of the day,"" said the source.
The French comments came as Russia, which has massed more than 100,000 troops near its borders with Ukraine, held military exercises https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/wrapup-1-russia-starts-belarus-military-drills-amid-new-diplomacy-ukraine-2022-02-10 in neighbouring Belarus and the Black Sea and Western leaders renewed their warnings of a major conflict. 
""These more than five hours of talks make us realise how different the Putin of today was to the Putin of three years ago,"" said the source, who was briefed on the contents of the Macron-Putin talks and spoke on condition of anonymity.
A Kremlin spokesman did not respond to questions submitted by Reuters about the French assessment of Putin's state of mind. 
'TOTAL DISREGARD'
Putin himself has spoken of growing frustration at what he calls Western failures to heed Russia's security concerns. 
""You know, we have tried to talk to them about avoiding certain actions for 30 years now. What we get in response is total disregard for our concerns,"" the Russian leader said at a joint news conference with Macron on Monday. 
Putin's own actions make clear he has become more hawkish, including his crackdown on domestic opponents, the pressure on independent journalists, and now the massive military deployment near Ukraine.
But the Macron meeting marked a rare opportunity for a Western leader to spend an extended period of time in Putin's company and to gauge, eyeball-to-eyeball, his state of mind.
For the duration of their talks, the French leader, was alone with Putin, with no aides and only one interpreter.
Macron had travelled to Russia to try to calm tensions between Russia and Western states over Ukraine. Washington has said the Kremlin is preparing for an invasion of its smaller neighbour, though Moscow denies such plans.
According to the first French source, Putin returned repeatedly during the talks to the issue of the 1997 NATO agreement that paved the way for three ex-Soviet bloc states - Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic - to join the alliance.
Putin, the sources said, described the agreement as a betrayal of earlier promises from the alliance not to expand. NATO members deny any such promises were ever made.
Putin also dwelled on the 2014 Maidan Revolution - which saw the flight of a pro-Russian leader amid mass street protests - and on the 2019 election of Volodymyr Zelenskiy as Ukraine's president.
""He says it was a coup and that Zelenskiy is controlled by the United States,"" the first source said. 
The election of Zelenskiy, who replaced a similarly Western-leaning president, was described by monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) as fair and held with respect for fundamental freedoms.
After Monday's talks, Macron told his team that when he had hosted Putin in France in 2019, the Kremlin leader had seemed ""less tough and less focused on history"" than this time round, according to a second source. 

It was not immediately clear what this evolution in Putin's state of mind might spell for Ukraine.
Macron told reporters as he flew out of Moscow he believed there was a real prospect for stopping escalation, though he said it was too early to point to any concrete undertakings from Russia to step back, and there were still real risks that armed conflict could break out.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Russia's 15-year-old figure skating sensation Kamila Valieva giggled with her coaches but turned serious for her own routine as she practiced on Thursday at the Winter Olympics despite reports of testing positive for a banned substance.
The teenager was part of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) team that won the figure skating team event on Monday, ahead of the United States and Japan. But their medal ceremony was delayed for unexplained ""legal reasons"".
Russian athletes are already competing without their flag and anthem because of sanctions for past doping violations.
Wearing a navy blue hoodie, black tights with shorts, her hair in a bun, Valieva took to the ice late morning, laughing at rink side but showing total focus when rehearsing her free skate.
Despite the pressure, she performed quadruple jumps in practice, after becoming the first woman to complete one at an Olympics during her team's winning performance on Monday.
Russian media reported on Wednesday that Valieva had returned a positive test, with newspapers RBC and Kommersant naming the drug as Trimetazidine, which is typically used to treat angina. 
The ROC and Russian figure skating federation have not commented. 
'MAKING NOISE'
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters the only source of information would be the International Olympic Committee (IOC). ""We will not join those making noise. We wish our athletes, including Valieva, only gold medals,"" he said.
The IOC has declined to comment, citing legal reasons, though spokesman Mark Adams asked for patience from other skaters and said officials would work as quickly as possible to sort out the medal ceremony.
With the United States and Japan waiting in the wings for their medals and fans anxious to see their teen idol compete again on Tuesday, the case is complicated by her age.
According to WADA's world anti-doping code, athletes who commit doping violations should be publicly named, but this is not required if the person is a minor under 18.
In that case, according to rule 14.3.7, any optional public disclosure ""shall be proportionate to the facts and circumstances of the case"".
Former WADA director general David Howman told Reuters parental consent is required before minors are tested.
""It's the worst nightmare of any organisation for athletes to be competing and then return a positive test during the Games,"" he added. 
""It's very unusual for a positive test to be returned between competition and the medal ceremony. Usually an athlete in that position would immediately be disqualified, but that hasn't happened here.""
The only time Howman could remember a ceremony not taking place was when South African Caster Semenya won the 800m at the World Athletics Championships in Berlin. 
RUSSIAN FORM
Figure skating is a prestige sport for Russia, in which it has an outstanding record. Any move to penalise Valieva or strip the team of medals would likely cause a national outcry.
Moscow has acknowledged some shortcomings in its implementation of anti-doping rules but denies running a state-sponsored doping programme. 
""Russia invariably follows principles of zero tolerance towards any violations of sports rules and Olympic ethics,"" Sports Minister Oleg Matytsin said in a statement. 
""We urge everyone to refrain from making unsubstantiated comments until official information is published,"" he added, saying all Russian athletes continued to participate in China.
Prominent journalist Vasily Konov, deputy general producer at Russian sports channel Match-TV, said without citing sources that the sample in question had been taken two months ago.
""The drug trimetazidine does not help an athlete in any way. At all. It was found in one single sample in December. A minuscule amount. Nothing in her samples before or since,"" he wrote on social media.
""There is no doping in the conventional sense. No! This cardiac drug has no impact on ... performance. Now leave Kamila in peace.""
Former Russian pairs skater Tatiana Volosozhar, who won two gold medals at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, showed solidarity with Valieva on social media, calling for the use of the Russian hashtag #Iwillneverbelieve to send the teenager support.
The post was ""liked"" on Instagram by Valieva herself.
""I don't know what you are going through now, but I understand how stressful it is. Hang in there, girl! Everything with be alright,"" wrote Elizaveta Tuktamysheva, the alternate on the Russian figure skating team, via Instagram under a picture of her and Valieva. 
Trimetazidine, or TMZ, works by increasing blood flow to the heart and limiting rapid swings in blood pressure. It has been on WADA's list of prohibited substances since 2014.

""It is not a drug that you would take accidentally, not something you would ordinarily be prescribed, and not something that you would expect a 15-year-old to be prescribed,"" Howman said.
""It is very disappointing and a real shame that Russians continue to test positive at major events after all that country has gone through.""

LISBON (Reuters) - A commission investigating child sexual abuse in the Portuguese Catholic Church said on Thursday more than 200 alleged victims had already been in touch to share their stories since its launch a month ago.
The abuse allegations have come from people born between 1933 and 2006, from various backgrounds, from every region of the country and also from Portuguese nationals living abroad.
Many of the 214 people who have shared their testimonies mentioned other children who might have been abused by the same person, the commission said in a statement. 
""The allegations reveal suffering... which, in some cases, has been hidden for decades,"" the commission said. ""For many, this is the first time they are breaking their silence.""
It started its work in early January after a major report by a commission in France revealed last year around 3,000 priests and religious officials sexually abused more than 200,000 children over the past 70 years.
It also followed pressure from prominent Portuguese Catholics to lift the veil of silence that had surrounded the issue.
The six-person commission is primarily funded by the Roman Catholic Church itself, but its head, child psychiatrist Pedro Strecht, has said he would be the first to walk out if the |Church tried to intervene in the process.
The commission, which has its own website and phone line, relies on alleged victims to come forward, but also on access to historic files from dioceses. They hope to present the report by the end of this year.

Most of the allegations have been shared via an online form on the website.
The commission said there were fears the online forms might not be reaching victims who live in isolated areas and who might not have access to new technologies. To reach them, it said it was making contact with local charities and other entities.

The United States is sending nearly 3,000 extra troops to Poland and Romania to bolster Eastern European defences. In Romania, it is relocating a  Stryker  (NYSE:SYK) squadron of U.S. service members from Vilseck, Germany.
The ministry said a part of the squadron, which will be named Task Force (TF) Cougar, will enter Romania at around 2000 GMT and drive across the country to the Mihail Kogalniceanu military base in the eastern county of Constanta. 
U.S. forces have used the Mihail Kogalniceanu air base on the Black Sea since 1999. Romania, a NATO member since 2004, also hosts a ballistic missile defense system.
The Stryker squadron, designed to deploy on short order, will add to the 900 soldiers the U.S. currently has rotating in Romania, some as part of the NATO force and some under separate bilateral arrangements.
France has also offered to be the lead nation of a future NATO mission in Romania, which could see about 1,000 troops from various countries, and a decision could be made at the next NATO defence ministers meeting in mid-February.

""Our contribution … we'll look to augment anything that NATO does, and generally we support NATO efforts to build up the battle group here,"" U.S. State Department Counselor Derek Chollet told reporters in Bucharest on Wednesday.
""Bolstering the eastern flank from north to south is the top of the NATO agenda, no question about it. One thing we have made very clear to the Russian side is that if they continue this course of escalation and if they choose to take the military path regarding Ukraine, they're going to see more NATO capability on the eastern flank.""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A partial tattoo kit offered at auction in Israel as an Auschwitz artefact is highly unlikely to have been used on Jews at the Nazi concentration camp, a court-ordered investigation has found following outcry from Holocaust survivors.
The eight fingernail-sized steel dies, each lined with pins to form numerals, were offered last year by a Jerusalem auctioneer who described them as ""the most shocking of Holocaust items"" with a projected $30,000 to $40,000 price.
But the Tel Aviv District Court granted a request by survivors to suspend the sale in November. 
It asked the Yad Vashem World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Jerusalem to try to authenticate the kit before the court rules whether the auction can proceed. 
The resulting five-page report, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, says: ""It would appear highly unlikely that these dies were used to tattoo Jews, though this cannot be determined with absolute certainty."" 
The Yad Vashem report was due to be submitted to the court on Thursday. A court ruling is expected at a later date.
More than 1.1 million people, around 90% of them Jewish, were killed at Auschwitz, which was among a network of camps run by Nazi Germany on occupied Polish soil during World War Two. 
The Yad Vashem report said that while dies were used as of late 1941 to embed ink in prisoners' upper-left chests, marking them with serial numbers, the ""overwhelming majority"" of those victims were non-Jewish political detainees or captured troops.
That method soon proved cumbersome and was replaced with tattooing prisoners' arms using styluses, the report said, adding that hundreds of thousands of Jews received such marks whereas just ""dozens or hundreds"" were numbered using dies.
Inspection of the auctioned dies showed they ""had clearly not been used regularly"" and had been cleaned, the report said.
It suggested they dated from 1949 - long after the war - as an accompanying manufacturer's brochure was published that year. Such dies were designed to brand livestock, the report noted.

The auctioneer, Meir Tzolman, declined a Reuters Television interview request on Wednesday. Earlier he said he awaited the court's ruling. Interviewed in November, he said the dies had been certified as having come from Auschwitz but did not share any such documentation with Reuters.

Russia, which has more than 100,000 troops at the Ukrainian border, denies Western accusations that it may be planning to invade its former Soviet neighbour though it says it could take unspecified ""military-technical"" action unless demands are met.
""I honestly don't think a decision has yet been taken"" by Moscow on whether to invade, Johnson told reporters at the headquarters of the NATO military alliance in Brussels alongside Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.
""That doesn't mean that it is impossible that something absolutely disastrous could happen very soon indeed. And our intelligence, I'm afraid to say remains grim,"" Johnson said. 
""This is probably the most dangerous moment, I would say, in the course of the next few days, in what is the biggest security crisis that Europe has faced for decades, and we've got to get it right. And I think that the combination of sanctions and military resolve, plus diplomacy is what is in order."" 
Britain's diplomatic push comes as Johnson is grappling with the worst domestic political crisis of his premiership: a police probe into lockdown parties in Downing Street which has led some lawmakers from his Conservative Party to call for him to resign.
It follows shuttle diplomacy from French President Emmanuel Macron, who visited Moscow and Kyiv earlier this week. In contrast to U.S. and British leaders, Macron has played down the likelihood of a Russian invasion soon.
Johnson, the most prominent figure in the Brexit campaign that brought Britain out of the EU, said Britain ""remains unwavering in our commitment to European security"".
While Johnson visited NATO, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss held talks in Moscow, telling Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov ""a war in Ukraine would be disastrous for the Russian and Ukrainian people and for European security"".
Lavrov said he did not understand British anxiety about drills in Belarus, and that Truss had ignored facts presented to her. The West, Lavrov said, was using Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as an instrument. 
Putin, who says that Moscow's concerns over NATO enlargement have been ignored for three decades, has demanded guarantees that there will be no missile deployments near its borders and no further enlargement of NATO.

Britain has backed a strong line that Russia should not be able to veto countries choosing to join the Western alliance.
""What we're really all trying to do, whether you're in NATO or not in NATO, is protect the sovereign right of countries to choose their security alliances,"" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told Times Radio.

Belarusian cross-country skier Darya Dolidovich told Reuters on Tuesday that she and her family had left Belarus because of fears of reprisals by authorities after she was banned from competition, a move her family saw as retribution for their support of the political opposition.
Darya Dolidovich is the daughter of Sergei Dolidovich, a seven-time Olympic cross-country skier who took part in street protests against the 2020 re-election of leader Alexander Lukashenko that opponents said was fraudulent.
Lukashenko has denied rigging the vote.
""It was initially a disciplinary action between the national federation and the athlete for some breach,"" IOC spokesman Mark Adams said in a briefing at the Beijing Games. 
""If FIS want to look into it further then they obviously will do. We've reiterated our call to the NOC and all IFs (international federations) to make sure that Belarusian athletes can compete safely without any discrimination.""
In December, the Belarus Ski Union deactivated Dolidovich's FIS code, an individual identifying number required for athletes to take part in competitions run by the International Ski Federation (FIS).
In a letter seen by Reuters, the Belarus Ski Union told Dolidovich's coaching staff it had deactivated her FIS code in response to a decision by the Belarus Cross-Country Skiing Federation. It did not say on what basis that decision was made.

Several Belarusian athletes have been jailed or kicked off national teams for voicing opposition views and joining protests that erupted in the wake of the 2020 election.
The repression of Belarusian athletes, including the attempt to forcibly repatriate sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya during the Tokyo Olympics last year, has drawn international condemnation.

ZHANGJIAKOU, China (Reuters) -American Chloe Kim cemented her position as one of the greats of women's snowboarding with a commanding performance on Thursday to win halfpipe gold at the Winter Games and successfully defend her 2018 Olympic title. 
The 21-year-old set herself apart from rivals in the very first run, earning a top score of 94 by breezily landing 1080s. Spain's Queralt Castellet could never catch up with Kim and had to settle for silver, while Sena Tomita of Japan won the bronze medal. 
Kim, who at 17 became the youngest woman ever to win Olympic gold in snowboarding at the Pyeongchang Games in 2018, roared back in style after taking nearly two years off the slopes.
After landing her first run, Kim put her hands on her black helmet and dropped to her knees in the snow, overjoyed to have nailed what she called her ""safety run"". 
""I just was so proud of myself,"" Kim said about her first run, adding she had a terrible practice session where she fell twice going into Thursday's final that had initially put her in a ""weird headspace"".
""I was just like overflowed with emotions when I was able to land it on the first go."" 
Given her sizeable lead, Kim then attempted a cab 1260 in her second and third runs but fell both times.
After the last Games, she took time off to focus on her studies and her mental health. 
""I think the biggest lesson I've learnt from the last Olympics was being as open as possible. It's unfair to be expected to be perfect,"" Kim told reporters at a packed news conference.
Suffering from frustration and burnout, she briefly threw out her gold medal as junk after the 2018 Games but said on Thursday she had no intention of repeating that this time.
After Kim's high run, Castellet received the next highest score of 90.25 and Tomita earned 88.25.
""I am extremely happy, to be honest. The second place in behind Chloe is incredible. She is an incredible athlete,"" Castellet said after the final. 
Tomita said she was happy to become the first Japanese woman to win a halfpipe medal.
""Everybody was very aggressive, and in that kind of competitive environment I got a medal. That has given me a lot of confidence,"" she said.
Kim, or ""golden girl"" as TV commentators called her on Thursday, was joined at the snow park by her friend, Eileen Gu, the Chinese freestyle skier. Gu, wearing a Red Bull helmet and black puffer jacket, cheered Kim on from the finish line.

International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach also appeared on the sidelines and watched the event. 
The course, officially called the Secret Garden Olympic Halfpipe, is more than 200 metres long and 22 metres wide. The inner height of the halfpipe walls is 7 metres.

586,"<span>Feb 10, 2022 12:45AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- European Union and U.K. attempts to jump-start negotiations over the post-Brexit trading relationship in Northern Ireland have so far failed to make any progress, and diplomats see little chance for any substantial progress until they get past a key election scheduled for May.
The two sides haven’t moved at all on the substance of their differences over cross-border trade in Northern Ireland, even though the tone has been more constructive, according to people familiar with the discussions.
The negotiations have been at a standstill for months, even after the U.K. appointed a new Brexit chief, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, in December, who many hoped would give the process new momentum. The EU has said there was a window of opportunity for a deal through the end of the month before campaigning begins for Northern Ireland assembly elections in May.   
In the meantime, political turmoil in Belfast and London is another distraction, with the collapse of Northern Ireland’s executive and U.K. Prime Minister battling for his political future in the so-called Partygate scandal. 
Truss will meet with her EU counterpart, Maros Sefcovic, on Friday to continue discussions, even though talks haven’t moved forward, according to an EU official, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are private. 
At issue is the so-called Northern Ireland Protocol, part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement signed by Johnson that allowed the region to remain in the bloc’s single market by putting a customs border in the Irish Sea. Johnson has declined to implement all the requirements of the protocol, saying it has disrupted trade and needs to be renegotiated. He has threatened to invoke Article 16, which allows either side to unilaterally suspend parts of the protocol.
Last week, a minister in Northern Ireland provoked an uproar by ordering inspections on agri-food goods to stop, only to have a Belfast court overrule him. The EU had decried the original order as a breach of international law, even as the British government insisted it was a matter for the region’s power-sharing assembly. 
“The protocol does not require, contrary to the way it is being applied by our friends, it does not require that all foods and all medicines and all plants should be systematically checked in the way that they are,” Johnson said in the House of Commons on Wednesday. “We must fix it and with goodwill and with common sense I believe we can fix it, Mr. Speaker. If our friends don’t show the requisite common sense, then of course we will trigger Article 16.”
While Truss has brought a more constructive tone to the discussions, she hasn’t moved from the positions of her predessor, David Frost, according to the people. The U.K. wants to end checks on U.K. products destined for Northern Ireland and to end the role of the bloc’s top court. 
The clash over the protocol led to the resignation last week of Northern Ireland First Minister Paul Givan, which effectively paralyzed the region’s government. Under the Good Friday agreement, the first minister and deputy first minister  -- one unionist and one nationalist -- have equal powers and one cannot be in place without the other.

(Reuters) - The attorneys general of Missouri and Texas said on Wednesday they will probe GoFundMe over the decision by the crowd funding service to take down a page for a fundraising campaign that supports protesting truck drivers in Canada who oppose mandated COVID-19 vaccines.
""The crowd-funding platform's integrity has come into question after it removed a multimillion-dollar fundraising campaign for the Canadian truckers 'Freedom Convoy' which is protesting vaccine mandates"", Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said on Wednesday.
Paxton said GoFundMe's response to restrict the fundraising campaign of the protests ""should ring alarm bells to anyone using the donation platform.""
GoFundMe could not immediately be reached for comment on the new probes. The site took down the Freedom Convoy's donation page on Friday, saying it violated its terms of service. It said ""the previously peaceful demonstration has become an occupation, with police reports of violence and other unlawful activity."" On Saturday, GoFundMe said it would refund all donations.
Over the weekend, some U.S. Republicans vowed to investigate GoFundMe's decision to take down the page.
Truckers blocking U.S-Canada border crossings risk hurting the auto industry and agriculture, the White House said on Wednesday as Ottawa urged an end to the 13-day demonstration against coronavirus mandates.
The Freedom Convoy 2022 began as a movement against a Canadian vaccine requirement for cross-border truckers, but has turned into a rallying point against public health measures in Canada. It has gained increasing support among U.S. Republicans, including former President Donald Trump.

Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt said later that he also launched a probe into GoFundMe's move.
Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of the former U.S. president, has called for all Republican attorneys general to look into GoFundMe's actions. Florida had announced its intention to probe on Saturday.

WINDSOR/OTTAWA/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Ford and Toyota on Wednesday both said they were halting some production as anti-coronavirus mandate protesters blocked U.S-Canada border crossings that have prompted warnings from Washington and Ottawa of economic damage.
Many pandemic-weary Western countries will soon mark two years of restrictions as copycat protests spread to Australia, New Zealand and France now the highly infectious Omicron variant begins to ease in some places.
Horn-blaring protests have being causing gridlock in the capital Ottawa since late January and from Monday night, truckers shut inbound Canada traffic at the Ambassador Bridge, a supply route for Detroit's carmakers and agricultural products.
A number of carmakers have now been affected by the disruption near Detroit, the historic heart of the U.S. automotive sector, but there were other factors too such as severe weather and a shortage of semi-conductor chips.
Toyota, the top U.S. seller, said it is not expected to produce vehicles at its Ontario sites for the rest of the week, output has been halted at a Ford engine plant and Chrysler-maker Stellantis has also been disrupted.
Another border crossing, in Alberta province, has been closed in both directions since late on Tuesday.
More than two-thirds of the C$650 billion ($511 billion) in goods traded annually between Canada and the United States is transported by road.
Starting as a ""Freedom Convoy"" occupying downtown Ottawa opposing a vaccinate-or-quarantine mandate for cross-border truckers mirrored by the U.S. government, protesters have also aired grievances about a carbon tax and other legislation.
""I think it's important for everyone in Canada and the United States to understand what the impact of this blockage is - potential impact - on workers, on the supply chain, and that is where we're most focused,"" White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said on Wednesday. 
""We're also looking to track potential disruptions to U.S. agricultural exports from Michigan into Canada.""
Washington is working with authorities across the border to reroute traffic to the Blue Water Bridge, which links Port Huron in Michigan with Sarnia in Ontario, amid worries protests could turn violent, she told reporters. 
Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem called for a swift resolution. 
""If there were to be prolonged blockages at key entry points into Canada that could start to have a measurable impact on economic activity,"" he said.
""We've already got a strained global supply chain. We don't need this.""
PROTESTS SPREAD
The protests were disrupting jobs too and ""must end before further damage occurs,"" Canada's Emergency Preparedness Minister, Bill Blair, told reporters.
Ford suspended engine output in Windsor while its Oakville factory near Toronto is operating with a reduced schedule, as it warned the Ambassador Bridge closure ""could have widespread impact on all automakers in the U.S. and Canada.""
Chrysler-maker Stellantis has also faced a shortage of parts at its assembly plant in Windsor, Ontario, where it had to end shifts early on Tuesday, but was able to resume production on Wednesday. 
Protesters say they are peaceful, but some Ottawa residents have said they were attacked and harassed. In Toronto, streets were being blocked. 
""We continue to know that science and public health rules and guidance is the best way to this pandemic is the way we're going to get to the other side,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
The issue has caused a sharp split between the ruling Liberals and the opposition Conservatives, many of whom have expressed open support for the protesters in Ottawa and accuse Trudeau of using the mandates issue for political purposes.
In the United States, prosecutors in Missouri and Texas will probe crowd funding service GoFundMe over the decision to take down a page for a campaign in support of the drivers after some Republicans vowed to investigate.
Downtown Ottawa residents criticized police for their initially permissive attitude toward the blockade, but authorities began trying to take back control Sunday night with the seizure of thousands of liters of fuel and the removal of an oil tanker truck.
Police have asked for reinforcements - both officers and people with legal expertise in insurance and licensing - suggesting intentions to pursue enforcement through commercial vehicle licenses.

But as the authorities attempt to quell demonstrations in one area, they pop up elsewhere.
""Even as we have made some headway in Ottawa, we've seen an illegal blockade emerge in Windsor,"" said Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -University of California officials have agreed to pay $243 million to settle the legal claims of about 200 women who have accused a former UCLA gynecologist of sexual abuse.
The settlement by the University of California regents, the system's governing board, marks the second in lawsuits stemming from the accusations against Dr. James Heaps, 65. 
Heaps, who retired in 2018 after more than 30 years at UCLA, is not a party to the settlement. He is awaiting trial later this year on 21 criminal counts of sexual abuse.
He has pleaded not guilty in the case and has repeatedly maintained his innocence.
""The conduct alleged to have been committed by Heaps is reprehensible and contrary to the university's values,"" UCLA said in a written statement issued on Tuesday. 
""We express our gratitude to the brave individuals who came forward, and hope this settlement is one step toward providing healing and closure for the plaintiffs involved,"" the university said.

McCune, 42, joins 13 co-defendants already sentenced for their roles in a nationwide scheme involving some $3 million in false medical claims under the plan, established for retired players and their families under the NFL's 2006 collective bargaining agreement.
McCune, who was arrested and charged in the case in December 2019, pleaded guilty to 12 counts of healthcare fraud, 10 counts of wire fraud, three counts of identity theft and conspiracy to commit healthcare and wife fraud, according to the DOJ.
Court documents show McCune submitted false claims to the Gene Upshaw NFL Player Health Reimbursement Account plan on his own behalf and for dozens of other former NFL players in 2017 and 2018.
Those claims typically sought reimbursement of $40,000 or more for costly medical equipment such as hyperbaric oxygen chambers, ultrasound machines and electromagnetic therapy devices, but none of the equipment was ever actually purchased, the DOJ said.
McCune, of Riverdale, Georgia, played college football at Louisville before he was picked up by the Washington Redskins in the 2005 NFL draft.

592,"<span>Feb 09, 2022 06:09PM ET</span>","(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden spoke on Wednesday with King Salman of Saudi Arabia about ensuring stable energy prices as well as Mideast security, in light of recent attacks by Yemeni rebels, and the status of talks over Tehran’s nuclear program.
Amid a broad surge in global energy prices in recent weeks, the two leaders “reiterated the United States’ and Saudi Arabia’s commitment to ensuring the stability of global energy supplies,” according to a White House statement. 
A Saudi press release echoed that theme, saying the king “stressed the importance of maintaining balance and stability in the oil markets” and citing a recent OPEC+ agreement as evidence of that concern. 
Beyond energy, much of the call appeared to focus on bolstering the U.S.-Saudi defense partnership following a spate of attacks coming from Houthi rebels in Yemen. 
“The president underscored the U.S. commitment to support Saudi Arabia in the defense of its people and territory from these attacks and full support for UN-led efforts to end the war in Yemen,” according to the White House statement.
Jets to UAE
A Saudi-led coalition has been battling the Houthi rebels since 2015. The conflict, which has pushed the Yemeni population to the brink of famine, threatens to widen beyond Yemen’s borders, most recently when the Houthis attacked the United Arab Emirates with drones and missiles. 
The U.S. plans to deploy a squadron of  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT).’s F-22 jets in addition to moving a guided-missile destroyer to assist the UAE, a member of the coalition, in fending off new assaults.
The Houthis are supported by Iran, and the official Saudi press agency said that Salman also “cited the kingdom’s support to efforts by the United States to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, and stressed the need to work together to counter the destabilizing activities of Iran’s proxies in the region.” 
Biden, the White House added, also “noted his commitment to ensuring that Iran can never obtain a nuclear weapon and briefed the king on ongoing multilateral talks to re-establish constraints on Iran’s nuclear program.”
While the Saudis enjoyed close ties with the Trump administration, Biden’s White House, although affirming the U.S. alliance with the kingdom, has largely steered clear of the king’s son, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. The CIA concluded in a report made public in February that Prince Mohammed -- seen as the country’s de facto ruler -- likely approved the 2018 killing of Washington Post columnist and Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul. 
Saudi officials have repeatedly rejected that accusation.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -A geomagnetic storm triggered by a large burst of radiation from the sun has disabled least 40 of the 49 satellites newly launched by SpaceX as part of its Starlink internet communications network, the company said.
The incident was believed to mark the largest collective loss of satellites stemming from a single geomagnetic event, and was unique in the way it unfolded, Harvard-Smithsonian astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell said on Wednesday.
The company's announcement, posted on its website on Tuesday, said the satellites were stricken last Friday, Feb. 4, a day after they were launched to a preliminary ""low-deployment"" orbit about 130 miles (210 km) above Earth.
SpaceX said it routinely deploys its satellites to such low orbits at first so they can quickly and safely be allowed to fall back toward Earth and incinerate on re-entry if a malfunction is detected during initial system checkouts.
But SpaceX left unclear whether the company had anticipated the severity of the extreme space weather conditions it faced, fueled by a solar storm days earlier, when it sent its latest batch of 49 satellites aloft.
SPACE-WEATHER ALERT BEFORE LAUNCH
The Thursday launch by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket flown from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida roughly coincided with a ""geomagnetic storm watch"" posted for last Wednesday and Thursday, Feb. 2-3, by the U.S. Space Weather Prediction Center.
The alert warned that solar flare activity from a ""full halo coronal mass ejection"" - a large blast of solar plasma and electromagnetic radiation from the sun's surface - was detected on Jan. 29, and was likely to reach Earth as early as Feb. 1.
The alert also said resulting geomagnetic storm conditions on Earth were ""likely to persist"" into Feb. 3 ""at weakening levels.""
According to SpaceX, the speed and severity of the solar storm drastically increased atmospheric density at the satellites' low-orbit altitude, creating intense friction or drag that knocked out at least 40 of them.
Starlink operators tried commanding the satellites into a ""safe-mode"" orbital configuration allowing them to fly edge-on to minimize drag, but those efforts failed for most of the satellites, forcing them into lower levels of the atmosphere where they burned up on re-entry, SpaceX said.
""This is unprecedented as far as I know,"" McDowell told Reuters. He said he believed it marked the single greatest loss of satellites from a solar storm, and first mass satellite failure caused by an increase in atmospheric density, as opposed to bombardment of charged particles and electromagnetic radiation itself.
McDowell said the incident raised questions of whether the elevated orbital drag caused by the storm exceeded design limits or whether SpaceX believed incorrectly that the satellites could handle so much density.
It appeared from SpaceX's account, McDowell said, that ""they weren't expecting to have to handle that much density, in which case it sounds like they weren't paying attention to the space weather reports.""
SpaceX did not immediately return queries from Reuters seeking further comment.
McDowell added that geomagnetic storm activity will escalate over the next few years as the sun nears ""solar maximum"" in its 11-year cycle of sunspot activity.

SpaceX, the Los Angeles area-based rocket company founded by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, has launched hundreds of small satellites into orbit since 2019 as part of his Starlink service for broadband internet. In a Jan. 15 tweet, Musk said the network consisted of 1,469 active satellites, with 272 moving to operational orbits.
The company has said it ultimately envisions a constellation of roughly 30,000 satellites, up from 12,000 previously planned.

ROBBINS, Calif. (Reuters) - In an experiment a decade in the making, biologists are releasing hatchery salmon onto flooded Northern California rice fields, seeking to replenish endangered fish species while simultaneously benefiting the farmers' business model.
At a time when environmentalists are often pitted against agribusiness in California's water wars, conservation scientists and rice farmers are working together, trying to reclaim the great flood plains of the Sacramento River for salmon habitat.
Their task is daunting. California's wetlands have all but disappeared, converted into farms and cities in one of the great engineering feats, or environmental crimes, of the 20th century.
Now, for the cost and inconvenience of flooding their fields, rice farmers are earning goodwill and betting that a healthy salmon population will avoid new regulations to protect wildlife and keep adequate water flowing.
In recent years, biologists discovered that as rice straw decomposes in flooded fields it creates a broth rich in fish food. They call it ""zoop soup."" 
""The zooplankton are so big and they're so juicy, it's like filet mignon,"" said Andrew Rypel, a professor of fish ecology at the University of California Davis and lead investigator on the project.
After fattening up on their zooplankton, the salmon return to the river, swim downstream and beneath the Golden Gate Bridge on their way to sea, returning years later to spawn the next generation.
The university's researchers have joined the California Rice Commission, the conservation group California Trout and the U.S. Department of Agriculture on the project, seeking to reverse the trend toward dwindling fish populations as a result of human re-engineering of the state's waterways and, in recent years, extreme drought exacerbated by climate change https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/severe-drought-marks-california-landscap-idUSRTXEEWPI.
""We don't want to just sit silently while extinctions happen,"" Rypel said. 
Before industrialization, the northern end of California's Central Valley was a miles-wide flood plain straddling the Sacramento River - a natural feeding ground for fish.
After one too many floods in the city of Sacramento, and realizing that Mississippi River-style levees were insufficient to contain the diluvial bounty, California built two bypasses in the Sacramento River for flood control and irrigation.
That land is ideal for farming rice, and about 500,000 acres (200,000 hectares) are under cultivation today.
Though the natural state will never be restored, the flood plain can reconnect to the river. Enhancing salmon habitat in the flood plains helps the fish grow big early in life, improving their chances of survival.
So far the results show juveniles feeding in the rice fields grow two to five times faster than those in the river channel, said Carson Jeffres, another researcher with the UC Davis Center for Watershed Sciences.
Though the experiment has placed salmon on small parcels before, this winter marks the first time it has been tried on a large scale on a working rice farm. Conservation scientists hope to replicate the model on more farms in years to come. 
The salmon project is using 389 acres (157 hectares) on a pair of rice farms at the Sutter Bypass near Robbins, about 30 miles (50 km) northwest of Sacramento. One farm is intentionally flooded with water and planted with hatchery fish, enabling the biologists to study their progress and tag some with microchips to track their movements.
A second farm is being prepared just in case the Sacramento overflows this year, delivering naturally spawned salmon.
Engineering of the 20th century rerouted the natural migration of water in California, speeding it from north to south. That turned the state into an economic powerhouse at the cost of decimating its fish https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentID=104268&inline. Some 83% of California's freshwater fishes are in decline or extinct, according to UC Davis researchers, including the endangered winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon.
Salmon that grow big early in life have the best chance to thrive, but California's aquatic expressways lack the nutrients of the flood plain.
""We're trying to ... reactivate this floodplain and give the salmon a little bit of this floodplain back that they historically relied on,"" said Paul Buttner of the California Rice Commission.
The project was inspired by changes that turned flooded rice farms into habitat for migrating ducks, geese and other waterfowl within the Pacific Flyway, a north-south corridor linking North and South America.
California rice farmers traditionally burned leftover rice straw after the autumn harvest until a 1991 state law banned the practice, largely in response to human complaints about smoke. When farmers started using water to break down rice straw, the smoke cleared and the birds started coming back.

Though no longer pristine wetlands, 90% of which have been lost in California, the rice fields enticed enough migratory birds to once again darken the sky, their honks and quacks bombinating across the valley.
Rypel, the UC Davis researcher, calls it ""one of the great conservation stories in U.S. history.""

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Sleeping in trucks and staying warm at fire pits and portable saunas, protesters camped out in the frigid Canadian capital of Ottawa are digging in for a long stay, convinced they have momentum and right on their side.
The number of protesters in the ""Freedom Convoy"" – initially an opposition to vaccine mandates for cross-border drivers that has morphed into a wider protest against COVID restrictions and the Canadian government – has thinned since it arrived in Ottawa 13 days ago. 
""We want freedom for our kids,"" said Jean-Pierre Lapointe, who came from Quebec with his small children, their strollers strung with small Canadian flags. His daughter had a cardboard sign around her neck: ""My future is in your hands.”
He said they would stay ""until we get out freedom back. ... I want all the mandates to end.""
Several protesters told Reuters they had lost jobs or had trouble finding work because they were not vaccinated. Others cited objections to government policy beyond the vaccine mandates such as a federal carbon tax and housing unaffordability. Virtually all of them spoke about losing their right to autonomy. 
Trucks and other vehicles in the area were emblazoned with variations on ""FREEDOM"" and exhortations against vaccine mandates, lockdowns and other measures. Some protesters wore Canadian flags as capes or baseball caps reading ""Make Canada Great Again,"" a play on former U.S. President Donald Trump’s slogan.
The protest, congregated around the Canadian Parliament and central bank, has shut down the city’s downtown core and frayed residents’ nerves due to blaring trunk horns. A court granted an injunction against using horns on Monda https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canada-police-seen-getting-tough-trucker-protests-continue-2022-02-07y, but police have been unable to shift the protesters, some of whom are demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
Clustered around metal drum fire pits, protesters traded debunked talking points on how Trudeau profited from buying vaccine patents or from contracts that went to a private company charged with administering COVID-19 tests. 
Multiple protesters said they were convinced vaccines could kill people. Data show post-vaccination adverse events https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/VACCINE-EFFECTS/xegvbglkrpq are extremely rare https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-preprint-myocarditiswithdrawn-idUSL1N2QX1WS. 
A well-organized supply chain has kept the protesters stocked with fuel, food and everything from diapers to bouncy castles for children. Open-sided tents piled high with food and water fed the protesters, who were largely peaceful. The group has raised millions in funding, some of which came from U.S. supporters, Canadian police said.
About a quarter of the 418 protest trucks have children in them, Ottawa Deputy Police Chief Steve Bell said. Citing concern for their welfare in relation to cold, noise, carbon monoxide risks and access to sanitation, police are in touch with child welfare authorities, Bell said.
""We’re not at the stage where we're looking to do any sort of enforcement activity around that,"" he said.
Police have made 23 arrests, issued about 1,300 tickets issued and have 79 criminal investigations open as of Tuesday.
Canada's right-wing Rebel News has said it would cover protesters' legal fees.

""I'm a very wealthy man,” said Kenny McKean, a domestic trucker from Huntsville, Ontario, who said his fuel costs are running at C$200 a day. ""I can stay to the end.""

KYIV (Reuters) - In his mayoral office, former heavyweight boxing champion Vitaly Klitschko waves a stylus pen at a screen on the wall - allowing him to monitor Kyiv's electricity grid and water supplies in case of a Russian cyber attack.
Klitschko, who has been mayor of Ukraine's capital city since 2014, is now readying its defences, inspecting Soviet era bomb shelters and encouraging citizens, including his brother and fellow heavyweight champion Wladimir, to become reservists. 
Ukraine is bracing itself for a possible military offensive from Russia, which has massed tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine's borders in recent weeks.
The 50-year-old Klitschko, who was known as ""Dr Ironfist"" in his fighting days, says there is no panic in the city, but citizens still have to be ready for the worst case. 
""That's why 5,000 bunkers are already prepared in our hometown. Over 2,000,000 people can be saved there,"" he told Reuters in his office in city hall. 
""Concerning the current situation, I believe there is not a single citizen in our city and our country that doesn't speak about the current situation. Of course, the whole society is quite worried,"" he said. 
""We don't want war. But, if it's about our territorial integrity, when the question about our independence arrives, then we don't have another choice. We have to defend our country, our homes, our families, our values.""
Russia denies planning any sort of military attack.
Klitschko said that the bombardment of civilian populations would in any case be unlikely, though U.S. officials this weekend said mass civilian casualties could not be ruled out in the worst case. 
Ukraine has also warned about the prospects of cyber attacks on key infrastructure, either as part of a military offensive or as a way of causing instability and hitting the country's financial system. 
Russia has denied any role in previous cyber attacks on Ukraine and other targets. 
""We are protecting all of the infrastructure objects. Now, we have a detailed plan of how we can protect everything from a possible attack on Ukraine,"" Klitschko said. ""We have a concrete plan, we have an action plan of what should we done. We hope that nothing will happen, but we have to be ready anyways.""
His brother Wladimir enlisted in Ukraine's reserve army last week. Both brothers have longstanding ties to Germany and speak German - but Vitaly has not been shy to criticise Berlin's reluctance to supply defensive weapons to Ukraine. 

He called a recent shipment of 5,000 Germany military helmets a ""joke"".
""Political support, financial support, and defensive weapons are very important to us because we have to defend our country with modern arms,"" he told Reuters, speaking in German.

DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran unveiled a new domestically-made missile with a range of 1,450 kilometers on Wednesday, state TV reported, a day after Tehran and Washington resumed indirect talks to salvage a 2015 nuclear deal. 
Iran, which has one of the biggest missile programmes in the Middle East, says its ballistic missiles have a range of up to 2,000 km (1,200 miles) and are capable of reaching its arch-foe Israel and U.S. bases in the region.
State TV displayed the new surface-to-surface ""Kheibar Shekan"" (Kheibar buster) missile, which refers to an ancient Jewish oasis called Kheibar in the Arabian Peninsula's Hijaz region that was overrun by Muslim warriors in the 7th century. 
""This long-range missile is domestically manufactured by the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) ... It has high accuracy and is propelled by solid fuel and is capable of penetrating missile shields,"" Iranian state media reported. 
Tehran regards its missile programme as an important deterrent against the United States, Israel and other adversaries. It has rejected Western demands to halt its ballistic missile work.
""Iran will continue advancing its ballistic missile programme,"" Iran's armed forces chief of staff Major General Mohammad Bagheri told a ceremony at an IRGC base where the new missile was displayed, Iranian media reported.
NUCLEAR DEAL
Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, a regional rival of Shi'ite-led Iran, has repeatedly called on major powers to address Gulf Arab concerns about Tehran's missiles. 
Israel, which the Islamic Republic does not recognise, has long threatened military action against Iran if the talks in Vienna fail to curb Tehran's nuclear work. Iran says its nuclear ambitions are peaceful.
In 2018, then-U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal - designed to stop Iran developing a nuclear weapon - and reimposed sanctions in a bid to force Tehran into talks on a broader agreement that would have also addressed its ballistic missile programme and support for proxies in the Middle East. 
Iran responded a year later by gradually breaching the pact's nuclear limits, rebuilding stockpiles of enriched uranium, refining it to higher fissile purity and installing advanced centrifuges to speed up output.
Indirect talks between Tehran and Washington to revive the deal started after Joe Biden replaced Trump in the White House, but despite eight rounds since April differences remain between Iran and world powers.

Tehran and Washington have blamed each other for the lack of progress.
""Voices from the U.S. government show there is no coherence in that country to make political decisions in the direction of advancing the Vienna talks,"" Iran's top security official Ali Shamkhani tweeted on Wednesday.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia launches the active phase of vast military exercises in Belarus on Thursday, a display of strength that shows how Moscow's tightening grip on Minsk has given it enhanced capabilities in its standoff with the West over Ukraine.
The joint Allied Resolve drills that NATO has described as Russia's biggest deployment to ex-Soviet Belarus since the Cold War run until Feb. 20 and are part of a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine that has stirred fears of a looming invasion. 
Russia, which denies any invasion plans, has not disclosed how many troops will be involved. Many of the troops have been deployed from thousands of miles away in Russia's Eastern Military District in the far east. 
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said last week that Russia was expected to have 30,000 troops as well as Spetsnaz special operations forces, SU-35 fighter jets, S-400 air defence systems and nuclear-capable Iskander missiles.
In military terms, the deployments create a new front for Ukraine to worry about and stretch Kyiv's forces thinner around its long defensive perimeter, said Neil Melvin, director of International Security Studies at the RUSI think-tank in London. 
The deployments to the north of Ukraine put Russian troops much closer to Ukraine's capital Kyiv, which lies just over 90 km (56 miles) from the border at its closest point.
With the deployment of fighters and air defence systems, Russia has much more effective defensive cover for its Kaliningrad exclave in Europe, and electronic jamming systems in Belarus make Western intelligence gathering harder, said Melvin. 
""(This) puts forces in play on NATO's eastern flank that will discourage or prevent NATO having any kind of role,"" he said. 
NO MORE AMBIGUITY
For years, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, a wily political operator in power since 1994, played off East against West for political gain and resisted the idea of hosting a permanent Russian military base. 
But since Russian President Vladimir Putin shored him up with political and economic support to help him weather huge opposition protests in 2020 he has shed much of that veneer of autonomy, analysts said. 
""I think he finally decided that in order to stay in power he should rely on his strategic alliance with Moscow and of course these joint military exercises are yet another kind of manifestation of this new closeness,"" said Andrey Kortunov, head of the Russian International Affairs Council which is close to the Foreign Ministry in Moscow.
""Now he has full backing from Putin in exchange for his loyalty. Apparently both sides are happy with this deal, at least for the time being,"" he said. 
In recent months, Lukashenko has publicly offered to host Russian nuclear missiles in Belarus. Moscow and Minsk have agreed a joint military doctrine for their ""union state"" integration project. Russian warplanes now regularly patrol the Belarusian border.
Last year the two countries opened a joint training centre in Grodno in western Belarus. 
""This is basic code for a permanent presence,"" said Mathieu Boulegue, a research fellow at London's Chatham House think-tank. ""You can call it what you want: whatever the rhetoric around it, it's going to turn into an informal permanent presence that Russia has always wanted.""
On Feb. 27, Belarus is expected to hold a referendum to change its constitution. Changes would include removing its formal status as a ""neutral"" country and a ""nuclear-free"" zone. 
'PANDORA'S BOX' 
The Kremlin has said the Russian troops will return to their permanent garrisons once the drills are over. 

But the beleaguered Belarusian opposition-in-exile, which has fretted for years that Lukashenko is trading off chunks of sovereignty in return for backing from Moscow, fears Russia's troops may not leave entirely. 
""Lukashenko has opened Pandora (OTC:PANDY)'s Box. He thinks he's still in control, but we're not sure. Is he able to make sure these troops are going home, or not?"" said Franak Viacorka, an adviser to Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Kamala Harris will hold a series of in-person meetings with U.S. allies and partners at the Munich Security Conference next week seeking to deter Russian aggression in Ukraine, a trip that serves as a major diplomatic test of her vice presidency.
A senior administration official said Harris will deliver a speech, articulate U.S. policy at a number of public engagements and assert America's commitment to its NATO allies. Leaders of Germany, the EU and NATO will attend and Harris is not expected to meet leaders from Russia and China. 
The conference, launched by Western nations at the height of the Cold War to address military conflicts, is expected to take place on Feb 18-20 in Munich, amid a high-stakes conflict over Ukraine between Western nations and Russia. 
""This trip is about engaging our allies and partners and building upon the intensive engagement that is already under way,"" the official said. 
Harris will ""reaffirm America's commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity"" as it faces the threat of a large-scale invasion by Russia, the official said. 
Russia has amassed some 100,000 troops near the Ukraine border. It denies planning an invasion but U.S. officials say an attack could occur within days or weeks.
In the early hours of Tuesday, President Vladimir Putin warned for the second time in a week that European countries would automatically be drawn into a war with Russia in which ""there will be no winners"" if Ukraine joined NATO and then tried to recapture the Crimean peninsula that Russia seized in 2014.
U.S. President Joe Biden has threatened to impose the most severe sanctions ever levied against Russia if it sends troops across the border, but emphasized the United States prefers diplomacy. He met German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Monday and said the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline would be halted if Russia invades Ukraine. 
HARRIS'S OVERSEAS PUSH While Harris's public appearance and effectiveness on a range of weighty issues at home has been heavily criticized, especially by the opposition Republican Party, on the global stage she is more often greeted as a trailblazer, the rare woman leader from the United States.
Biden has regularly urged his vice president to engage with foreign leaders directly and develop her own rapport with key U.S. partners, White House sources say, and the Munich trip is likely to be a major diplomatic test of her vice presidency and her highest-profile foreign trip yet. 
Harris took part in Biden's White House meeting with Scholz.
""The vice president is starting to, more clearly and publicly, demonstrate how she is a key player in executing our foreign policy across the board,"" the official said.
The vice president has sought to burnish her foreign policy credentials in solo calls with foreign leaders and in travel to Central America, Asia and Europe to advance administration priorities that include reducing migration from Central America into the United States and bolstering international support to counter China's growing global influence.

The conference will gather around 35 heads of state and government at its traditional venue in the Bavarian capital. The meeting was held virtually in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Biden has attended the conference as a U.S. senator, as vice president and even while not in public office. Last year, he addressed the conference virtually and declared the era of Trump-style ""America-first"" diplomacy over.

DONETSK, Ukraine (Reuters) - Politicians and military sources in Russian-backed breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine say they do not see an imminent risk of full-scale war while attempts are still under way to find a diplomatic solution.
A long-simmering conflict between the Russian-backed separatists and the Ukrainian army is part of a deeper crisis between the two countries in which Russia has massed more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders, prompting U.S. warnings of a possible attack within days or weeks.
Andrei Purgin, a local politician and former separatist leader, told Reuters he expected no significant changes for now in low-level hostilities along the line of contact between the two sides, where international monitors keep a tally of explosions and other ceasefire violations that sometimes runs to hundreds of incidents a day.
But he said he expected the next six months to be ""very difficult"", predicting a big shift one way or another in a conflict that the Ukrainian government says has killed about 15,000 people since 2014 in the eastern Donbass region.
""This will either be a final peace, or there is a very high probability of very serious escalations,"" he said.
Two separatist sources told Reuters they did not expect a major military escalation until at least spring. ""The time for diplomacy has not yet passed,"" said one of the sources, who is close to the separatist command.
Their comments could represent an attempt at disinformation and do not preclude the possibility that Russian President Vladimir Putin could order an attack on Ukraine either via the separatist regions or on a completely different front. Moscow has strongly denied it plans to invade Ukraine.
On Monday another separatist leader said full-scale war could break out at any time and his forces might need to turn to Moscow for support.
All sides see the breakaway Donbass region as key to the evolution of the wider Ukraine crisis, as a sudden escalation there could explode into wider war. France, Germany and the United States are among western governments pushing for a return to a 2015 peace agreement for Donbass that has never been implemented.
A Reuters reporting team that has spent the past week in Donbass saw only occasional signs of military activity, including destroyed and damaged buildings near the front line and an armoured personnel carrier and groups of fighters with AK-47 assault rifles on the streets of the main city, Donetsk.
Alexander Khodakovsky, a former political leader in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic who now oversees a military unit, said negotiations had so far pushed back - but not eliminated - the danger of a devastating all-out war.

""I perfectly understand how many human casualties will be suffered, how much infrastructure destroyed, how it will affect the minds and souls of people afterwards. And I well understand that it will be almost irreversible. Maybe only after three generations will this all calm down,"" he said.
""If there was an opportunity to avoid war, then we would take advantage of this opportunity.""

The United States and the European Union have threatened Russia with new sanctions if it attacks Ukraine after massing troops near its borders. Moscow denies planning an attack. [L1N2UI2JG]
""These sanctions are designed in a way that they will be imposed in the event of a further - or a new wave of - armed escalation, Russia's armed aggression against Ukraine,"" Kuleba said beside visiting Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Kyiv needs action to be taken against Russia before any attack. 
Kuleba said Russia had already violated international law and this provided a basis for imposing sanctions. 
He was referring to Russian passports being issued to some Ukrainian citizens in separatist-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine. 
""Some sanctions could have been imposed earlier as well as right now in order to demonstrate the seriousness of intentions and readiness for decisive action,"" Kuleba said.

Over 700,000 Russian passports have been issued to residents of eastern Ukraine since separatists seized territory there in 2014, and Russia's parliament is set to discuss making an appeal Putin to recognise the breakaway areas as independent states.
Russia has denied violating any international laws in its troop buildup near Ukraine. Western powers imposed sanctions on Russia after it seized the Crimea region from Ukraine and backed the separatists in eastern Ukraine.

Former political staffer Brittany Higgins, who says she was raped in a parliament office by a fellow staffer, said she was concerned workplace sexual abuse was in danger of becoming a ""political perception problem neutralised and turned into a net positive"". 
""Actions are what matter,"" Higgins said in a speech at the National Press Club in Canberra. ""Task forces are great. Codes of conduct are important. But only if it's paired with institutional change.""
The apology by Morrison, who must hold an election by mid-May, came after he struggled last year to placate public anger amid several allegations of sexual abuse, discrimination against women and misconduct in parliament.
A review sparked by Higgins going public with details of her alleged sexual assault in a ministerial office found half of parliamentary staff had experienced harassment, bullying or sexual assault.
As parliament sat for the first time in 2022 on Tuesday, the speaker read a statement apologising for ""an unacceptable history of workplace bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assault in parliamentary workplaces"".
In his address to the parliament, Morrison apologised to all who had suffered, and directly to Higgins for what happened to her.
Higgins said on Wednesday she recognised the significance of the moment but was concerned the government had only learnt how to be better at talking about the issue.
Last year, police charged a 26-year-old man after an investigation into Higgins' case. He is due to face court later this year.
The parliamentary apology marked a rocky start to an election year for Morrison as anti-vaccination protesters gathered outside parliament and his conservative party faced ructions over a religious freedom bill.
His personal integrity has also come under attack from damaging leaks, including by Higgins, of historical text messages from state and Coalition partner leaders, including some labelling him a ""liar"".
Higgins spoke at the press club alongside another prominent campaigner for the rights of abuse victims, former Australian of the Year Grace Tame.

Tame was asked how opposition Labor leader Anthony Albanese could do better on the issue of workplace abuse if elected.
""All that Anthony would have to do is none of the things Scott's done,"" Tame said.

Former doubles world number one Peng's well-being became a matter of global concern when she appeared to allege on social media in November that a former Chinese vice premier, Zhang Gaoli, had sexually assaulted her in the past. 
After that post, which was quickly removed, she disappeared from public view for nearly three weeks and the Women's Tennis Association suspended all tournaments in China over concerns regarding her safety and security.
The IOC has previously come under criticism for its stance during the saga. Human Rights Watch said the IOC's interest seemed to be to keep the Games on track, not the welfare of athletes, a suggestion rejected by the committee.
A three-time Olympian, Peng's presence during the Games had been a matter of speculation since the IOC said it planned to meet with her in Beijing.
In an interview on Sunday Peng denied she had accused anyone of sexual assault. Bach had met her on Saturday for dinner.
""We were trying to answer the question everybody was asking: 'Where is Peng Shuai?' This is why we took this human-centred approach from the very beginning,"" Bach told reporters.
""This is why we invited her for a meeting here, to show everybody it is not just a one-off effort. We will keep this contact up. We answered the question 'where is Peng Shuai?' We are continuing by having invited her to come to Lausanne.""
The IOC's headquarters are in the Swiss city and Bach said the meeting would most likely take place during the summer months. The IOC has said it would support her in any decision she made regarding her allegation, whether she wanted an investigation or not.
Peng has attended several sports event at the Games including the Big Air competition and curling as well as figure skating. She has smiled and waved at spectators.
""You could see it in her appearances that she is enjoying the Games, enjoying being among athletes and the public and this is why we are continuing to have this contact,"" Bach said.

""It is about caring for her. It is a human thing. It is about a person and the feelings, the emotions of one person.
""I hope I will meet her again in the summer in Lausanne to show that this caring is not finished with the Games. It is an ongoing effort.""

SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korea boasted on Tuesday that it is one of only a handful of countries in the world to field nuclear weapons and advanced missiles and the only one standing up to the United States by ""shaking the world"" with missile tests. https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/with-seven-tests-month-nkorea-calls-world-accept-its-missiles-2022-01-31
International tension has been rising over a recent series of North Korean ballistic missile tests, actions long banned by the U.N. Security Council. January was a record month of such tests, with at least seven launches, including a new type of ""hypersonic missile"" able to manoeuvre at high speed.
Also among the tests was the first firing since 2017 of a Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile, capable of striking U.S. territories in the Pacific Ocean.
A statement from North Korea's Foreign Ministry said a series of tests since New Year represented ""remarkable achievements"" that strengthened North Korea's ""war deterrence.""
It also cited the Hwasong-15, the longest-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) ever launched by North Korea, which hasn't been fired since its first test in 2017, and is believed to have the range to deliver a nuclear warhead anywhere in the United States. 
""In today's world where many countries waste time dealing with the United States with submission and blind obedience, there’s only our country on this planet that can shake the world by firing a missile with the U.S. mainland in its range,"" it said.
""There are more than 200 countries in the world, but only a few have hydrogen bombs, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and hypersonic missiles,"" it said.
Asked to comment, the U.S. State Department repeated past statements that it harboured no hostile intent towards North Korea and urging a return to dialogue, calls Pyongyang has persistently ignored.
A State Department spokesperson also called North Korea a threat to international peace and security and global nonproliferation efforts. 
""The United States has a vital interest in deterring (North Korea), defending against its provocations or uses of force, limiting the reach of its most dangerous weapons programs, and above all keeping the American people, our deployed forces, and our allies safe,"" the spokesperson said.
Jenny Town, director of 38 North, a Washington-based North Korea program, said the fact that North Korea's statement came from its foreign ministry probably made the statement less threatening than if might appear. ""The formulation is very passive. Not that they will do it, but that they can,"" she said. 
North Korea celebrated the anniversary of the founding of its army on Tuesday, a holiday that has occasionally featured major military parades with missiles and other weapons in previous years.
There were no reports of a parade this year, however, and state media said the day was marked by senior military leaders visiting the mausoleum of the country's former rulers, among other events. 
U.S. and South Korean officials have said they fear the launch of the Hwasong-12 on Jan. 30 could be a step toward fully resuming https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkorea-warns-it-may-rethink-moratorium-nuclear-missile-tests-2022-01-19 tests of North Korea's ICBMs or nuclear weapons. North Korea has not conducted a nuclear test or fired an ICBM since 2017.
The United States called on North Korea on Monday to defund https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-urges-nkorea-focus-needs-its-people-not-missiles-2022-02-07 its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and prioritize the needs of its own people. 

A Washington think tank said on Monday it has identified a military base close to North Korea's border with China that is likely intended for stationing ICBMs.
Talks to persuade Pyongyang to give up or limit its arsenal in return for sanctions relief have been stalled since 2019.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - The next leader of Islamic State is likely to be from a close circle of battle-hardened Iraqi jihadists who emerged in the aftermath of the 2003 U.S. invasion, two Iraqi security officials and three independent analysts said.
The group of potential successors to Abu Ibrahim al-Quraishi, who blew himself up during a U.S. operation to capture him in Syria last week, includes one commander whom Washington and Baghdad declared killed last year, the Iraqi officials said.
The death of Quraishi, 45, was another crushing blow to IS two years after the violent Sunni Muslim group lost longtime leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a similar raid in 2019. 
Quraishi, an Iraqi, never publicly addressed his fighters or followers, avoided electronic communications and oversaw a move to fighting in small devolved units in response to intense pressure from Iraqi and U.S.-led forces.
But those following Islamic State closely expect it to name a successor in coming weeks, as the group which imposed brutal rule over vast swathes of Iraq and Syria from 2014 to 2017 continues a stubborn and deadly insurgency INSIGHT-Islamic State hits back, aided by power vacuum in Iraq and Syria in the Middle East.
Fadhil Abu Rgheef, an Iraqi expert who advises its security services, said there were at least four possible successors.
""These include ... Abu Khadija, whose last known role was Iraq leader for Islamic State, Abu Muslim, its leader for Anbar province, and another called Abu Salih, of whom there's very little information but who was close to Baghdadi and Quraishi,"" he said.
""There's also Abu Yassir al-Issawi, who is suspected to be still alive. He's valuable to the group as he has long military experience.""
Issawi's death in an air strike in January 2021 was reported at the time by both Iraqi forces as well as the U.S.-led military coalition fighting Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
But an Iraqi security official confirmed there were strong suspicions Issawi is still alive. ""If he's not dead he'd be a candidate, he's tried and tested in planning military attacks and has thousands of supporters,"" the official said.
SECURITY SWEEP
The official added that Islamic State was likely carrying out a security sweep for potential leaks that led to the death of Quraishi before convening to choose or announce a successor.
Hassan Hassan, editor of New Lines magazine which has published research on Quraishi, said the new leader would be a veteran Iraqi jihadist.
""If they choose one in the coming weeks they'll have to choose someone from among the same circle ... the group that was part of the Anbari group which operated under (the name) ISIS since the early days,"" he said.
Islamic State emerged from the militants that waged an increasingly Sunni Islamist, sectarian-driven insurgency against U.S. troops and Iraqi forces after 2003. 
The Islamic State of Iraq, also known as al Qaeda in Iraq, was an offshoot of the global al Qaeda organisation of Osama Bin Laden and the precursor to ISIS, which took shape in the chaos of Syria's civil war across the border.
Baghdadi and Quraishi, both members of al Qaeda in Iraq from the start, did time in U.S. detention in the mid-2000s. In contrast, none of the four potential successors to Quraishi had been captured by U.S. forces, one security official and one army colonel told Reuters.
Officials and analysts in various countries agree Islamic State is under more pressure than it's ever been and will never restore its self-styled caliphate. But they are divided on how significant a setback Quraishi's death is for the group.
Some say the fight against ISIS will suck in the United States and its allies for years to come as it develops into a permanent insurgency with new leaders ready to take the reins.
""In Syria, Islamic State units work as a devolved network of individual groups in order to avoid them being targeted. We don't therefore believe that Quraishi's death will have an enormous impact,"" one of the Iraqi security officials said.
""It's also become more difficult to follow them because they've long stopped using mobile phones for communication.""
Since their territorial defeat in Iraq in 2017 and Syria in 2019, Islamic State leaders have found it increasingly easy to move between the two countries, helped by a gap in areas of control between different armed forces, some officials say.
Security and military officials said the 600 km (372 mile)long border with Syria made it a very hard for Iraqi forces to prevent militants infiltrating via underground tunnels. 
NEW LEADERSHIP STYLE
Lahur Talabany, former counter-terrorism chief for Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, said some IS leaders can travel on a route across the full expanse of Iraq.
""When you see attacks increasing in a particular area I wouldn't be surprised if somebody important has been through that region,"" he told Reuters. ""The caliphate was defeated but ISIS was never eradicated. I don't believe we managed to finish the job.""
Islamic State’s possession of land in Iraq and Syria set it apart from other like-minded groups such as al Qaeda and became central to its mission when it declared a caliphate in 2014, claiming sovereignty over all Muslim lands and peoples. 
Fiercely anti-Western, the group also draws on Sunni-Shi’ite tensions, saying Shi’ites were infidels who deserve to be killed.
Abu Rgheef said the new leader could have stronger military credentials than Quraishi, who Iraqi officials say was seen by followers as more of an Islamic legal mind than a military man.
""Attacks and operations will change in character depending on the style of the new leader. The new one might believe in big and intensive attacks, bombs or suicide bombers,"" he said.
Despite Quraishi's low profile and operational secrecy, his killing is likely to affect the group's fighters, analysts say.
Hassan said Quraishi's removal would reduce morale. ""ISIS is also locked into personalities and who's most trusted,"" he said.

Aaron Zelin, senior fellow at the Washington Institute, said a figurehead is very important to ISIS.
""Whenever a leader of the group is killed, your oath is to the (next) leader, the individual themselves, and not to the group.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - A Belarusian cross-country skier has fled the country with her family because of fears of reprisals by authorities after she was barred from competition over the family's political views, she and her father said. 
Darya Dolidovich and her family are now in Poland, where she hopes to continue training, Sergei Dolidovich, a seven-time Olympian cross-country skier who also coaches Darya, told Reuters in an interview by video call with his daughter on Tuesday.
Reuters reported last month that 17-year-old Darya was barred from competing for what Sergei and his daughter believe were his participation in street protests against the 2020 re-election of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko that opponents said was fraudulent. Lukashenko has denied rigging the vote.
""Darya has been stripped of her right to take part in competitions,"" he said. ""I don't see the possibility of her continuing her career in Belarus.""
""We could be accused of staging a demonstration and shouting (opposition) slogans, then just be sent to prison,"" he said. 
""Three months ago, I couldn't have imagined, even in a nightmare, that I would end up leaving my country.""
The Dolidovich family's departure comes a few days into the Beijing Winter Olympics, where the Belarusian national team is under scrutiny following the defection of sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya at the Tokyo Games last year.
Darya, one of the country's most promising junior cross-country skiers, said last month that the Belarus Ski Union deactivated her FIS code, an individual identifying number required for athletes to take part in competitions run by the International Ski Federation (FIS). 
The Belarus Ski Union told Dolidovich's coaching staff that it deactivated her FIS code in December in response to a decision by the Belarus Cross-Country Skiing Federation, according to a Jan. 31 letter reviewed by Reuters. The letter did not say why that decision was made.
In response to questions from Reuters, the FIS said it had not heard back from Belarusian ski officials since requesting further information last month on the deactivation of Darya Dolidovich's FIS code. 
The Belarus Cross-Country Skiing Federation and the Belarus Ski Union did not respond to requests for comment. 
UNCERTAINTY AHEAD
Darya Dolidovich was supposed to graduate from secondary school this year, but it is unclear how she will pursue her studies in Poland. 
""I had planned to finish school in Belarus, but my parents said that we were moving,"" she said. ""I'm upset, of course. It would have been simpler to stay a few months and finish school."" 
Dolidovich said she was keen to continue skiing in the hopes of keeping her Olympic dream alive.
Several elite Belarusian athletes have been jailed or kicked off national teams for voicing opposition views and joining protests that erupted in 2020 over Lukashenko's re-election.
The repression of Belarusian athletes, including the attempt to forcibly repatriate Tsimanouskaya during the Tokyo Olympics, has drawn international condemnation. 
Last week, the United States announced it was imposing visa restrictions on several Belarusian nationals, citing Tsimanouskaya's case and other instances of what it called extraterritorial counter-dissident activity.

Another Belarusian cross-country skier, Sviatlana Andryiuk, was also stripped of her FIS code, a decision that prevented her from taking part in a qualifying event that could have earned her a berth at the Beijing Olympics. 
Andryiuk, who told Reuters last month that she had been accused of being an opposition supporter, described her political views as neutral.

KYIV (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron, the first leader of a major Western power to meet Vladimir Putin since Russia massed troops near Ukraine, said on Tuesday he believed steps can be taken to de-escalate the crisis and called on all sides to stay calm.
Macron, who in contrast to the U.S. and British leaders, has played down the likelihood that Russia may soon invade its neighbour, shuttled from Moscow to Kyiv on Tuesday in a bid to mediate a settlement and avoid war.
The French president had no breakthroughs to announce but Macron said he thought his talks had helped prevent the crisis from escalating further. He said had never expected ""for one second"" that Putin would make concessions.
Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had told him they were committed to the principles of a 2014 peace agreement, he said, adding that this deal, known as the Minsk accords, offered a path to resolving their ongoing disputes.
""This shared determination is the only way allowing us to create peace, the only way to create a viable political solution,"" Macron told a joint news conference with Zelenskiy.
""Calm ... is essential from all parties in words and in deeds,"" Macron said, praising Zelenskiy for the ""sangfroid"" he and the Ukrainian people were showing as Russia amasses more than 100,000 troops, tanks and heavy weapons on Ukraine's borders.
Zelenskiy made clear he was sceptical of any assurances Macron may have received from Putin. ""I do not really trust words, I believe that every politician can be transparent by taking concrete steps,"" he said.
Moscow denies any plans to invade but is seeking sweeping concessions from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the military alliance which has underpinned security in western Europe since 1949.
The demands include a promise of no missile deployments near Russia's borders, a scaling back of NATO infrastructure and a ban on Ukraine ever joining the alliance.
Russia's military build-up gained momentum on Tuesday with the arrival of three warships in the Black Sea, according to a Reuters witness. Turkish sources said another three were expected to pass through the Bosporus on Wednesday, in what Russia's Interfax news agency reported as a pre-planned exercise.
Macron flew later to Berlin for meetings with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. In a statement alongside Macron before the talks began, Scholz told reporters: ""Our common goal is to prevent a war in Europe.""
""Our appraisal of the situation is united, as is our position on this: any further attack on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine is unacceptable and will draw wide-reaching consequences for Russia - politically, economically and geo-strategically,"" he added.
Macron and Scholz also met in Berlin with Polish President Andrzej Duda. The French presidency said after the talks the three leaders expressed their joint support for Ukrainian sovereignty.
The meeting further illustrated the European convergence on a ""committed and demanding approach"" toward Russia, the French presidency added.
NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg, asked in an interview with CNN about the likelihood of a Russian invasion, said: ""There's no certainty but what we see is a continued military buildup with more and more forces... The warning time is going down and the risk of an attack is going up.""
WESTERN FEARS OF AN INVASION
The United States and European Union have threatened Russia with sanctions if it attacks Ukraine. Moscow, still Europe's biggest energy supplier despite already being under sanctions since seizing Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014, has largely dismissed new sanctions as an empty threat.
U.S. President Joe Biden warned on Monday that if Russia invaded Ukraine, ""there will be no longer Nord Stream 2"" https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/if-russia-invades-ukraine-there-will-be-no-nord-stream-2-biden-says-2022-02-07, referring to a newly built, as yet unopened gas pipeline to Germany. He did not specify how he would halt it.
While Western countries have stood together to back Ukraine, they disagree about the likelihood of war. 
French officials have suggested they think Washington has overstated the threat, and Kyiv has also played down the likelihood of a large-scale invasion.
Macron, who is expected to stand for re-election in April, said before he left on his trip to Moscow that he believed Russia did not have designs on Ukraine but wanted to renegotiate European security arrangements.
But whatever Moscow's true aims, Western countries say they cannot safely assume the crisis will end without war unless Russia pulls back its troops.

The European Central Bank is preparing banks for a possible Russian-sponsored cyber attack as tensions with Ukraine mount, two people with knowledge of the matter said, as the region braces for the financial fallout of any conflict.
Japan would divert some LNG to Europe if the Ukraine crisis disrupted supplies, national broadcaster NHK reported.

(Reuters) - With COVID-19 cases still high nationwide, ""now is not the moment"" to drop mask mandates in schools and other public places, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told Reuters on Tuesday.
Her comments follow announcements by officials in New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, California and Oregon that they plan to lift indoor mask mandates for K-12 public schools and other indoor spaces in coming weeks, seeking a return to normalcy as infections spurred by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus ebb. 
""I know people are interested in taking masks off. I too am interested. That would be one marker that we have much of the pandemic behind us,"" Walenksy said in an interview. 
“Right now our CDC guidance has not changed ... We continue to endorse universal masking in schools.” 
Walensky said the CDC has always acknowledged that state and local jurisdictions are responsible for masking policies, but the agency's guidance remains unchanged. 
""We have and continue to recommend masking in areas of high and substantial transmission - that is essentially everywhere in the country in public indoor settings,"" she said.
She sees the health crisis becoming endemic when infections are at a steady state and the virus is no longer disruptive to society. 
And while Walensky said she is “cautiously optimistic” COVID-19 cases in the United States will fall below crisis levels, ""I don't think we're there right now.""
Even with declines in infections from recent record highs, Walensky noted that the United States is still seeing around 290,000 COVID-19 cases each day and higher rates of hospitalization than it did during the peak of cases caused by the Delta variant in 2021.
Hospital capacity is “one of the most important barometers” for whether COVID-19 should be considered a pandemic-level public health crisis, Walensky said. Right now, U.S. hospitals remain “overwhelmed” by COVID-19 cases, she added.
A sign the virus has become endemic, she said, is when ""anybody walking in the door who'd come in for a heart attack or a stroke or a motor vehicle accident could quickly get care because hospitals weren't overburdened or overwhelmed."" 
As the pandemic recedes, monitoring cases will remain important, as will testing for levels of virus in municipal wastewater, a program the CDC has recently expanded.
""We can see rises in cases in wastewater signals four to six days before we ever see rising cases,"" she said. 

Case counts and wastewater data will be used as early warning signals that a surge is coming and that people should resume COVID precautions, such as getting boosted or covering faces indoors, she said.
Preparing for some semblance of normal life with COVID represents ""a lot of the work that we have ahead as we work to come out of this crisis time.""

A military spokesperson declined to comment on the Syrian report of an initial Israeli attack near the Syrian capital which reportedly killed one soldier and injured five. 
But the military said it carried out a counter-strike in Syria in response to the launching of the anti-aircraft missile. It said the missile triggered sirens in parts of Israel and the occupied West Bank, and exploded in mid-air.
""Following the anti-aircraft missile launch earlier tonight, the Israel Defense Forces attacked surface-to-air missile batteries and radar that fired at Israeli air force planes,"" the military said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Syrian state TV said earlier that Syrian air defences had downed a number of Israeli missiles over Damascus.
Israel launched surface-to-surface missiles from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and Syrian air defences shot down some of them, Syrian state TV said.
""Israeli aggression"" also carried out an air strike earlier on Wednesday with missiles from southeast of Lebanon's capital Beirut, state TV added.
One Syrian soldier was killed and five were wounded in the attacks, state TV reported, citing a military source.
Israel has mounted frequent attacks against what it says are Iranian targets in Syria, where Tehran-backed forces led by Lebanon's Hezbollah have supported President Bashar al-Assad over the past decade in Syria's civil war.

James and Jennifer Crumbley, are accused of buying the weapon as a Christmas present for their 15-year-old son Ethan, and ignoring warning signs as late as the day of the Nov. 30 shooting in Oxford, Michigan. The shooter, Ethan Crumbley, has already been charged with first-degree murder in the deadliest U.S. school shooting of 2021.
All three have pleaded not guilty.
Prosecutors had called some witnesses during the preliminary hearing in front of Rochester District Court Judge Julie Nicholson, who will continue the hearing on Feb. 24 before deciding whether there is enough evidence for a trial. 
""Due to the voluminous nature of the exhibits ...., we are going to go ahead and continue the exam on Feb. 24"", said Nicholson.
The couple wore prison clothing as they sat in handcuffs at the defendant's desk in the courtroom. Andrew Smith, Jennifer Crumbley's supervisor at the real estate company where she worked, took the stand. He described his interactions with her the day of the shooting. 
""I need my job. Please don’t judge me for what my son did,"" Jennifer wrote in a text to Smith after the shooting that he read on the stand. ""I was surprised she was worried about her job at that point. I thought she would be more concerned about what was going on."" 
Four students were killed and six other students and a teacher were wounded at Oxford High School, 40 miles (65 km) north of Detroit. 
The case appears to be the first time that parents of a teenage school shooter have been charged for involvement in their offspring's alleged crimes. 
While other parents have been charged for deaths resulting from unsecured guns, those cases have involved much younger children, experts said. 
It was the latest in a decades-long string of deadly American school shootings.
Four days before the shooting, Ethan accompanied his father to a gun shop, where James Crumbley bought a 9mm handgun, prosecutors said.
The next day his mother posted that the two of them were at a gun range ""testing out his new Christmas present"", Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald said.
Prosecutors have detailed a number of other warning signs that they said the parents failed to address, including Ethan Crumbley searching for ammunition on his phone. 

Prosecutors said that on the morning of the shooting, a teacher discovered drawings by Ethan Crumbley that depicted a handgun, a bullet, and a bleeding figure. 
School officials then summoned the Crumbleys. The parents resisted the idea of taking their son home and did not search his backpack nor ask him about the gun, according to McDonald.

(Reuters) -The cousin of Amir Locke, a young Black man who was shot dead by Minneapolis police executing a ""no-knock"" search warrant last week, has been arrested in a homicide probe that led officers to conduct the fatal raid, police and prosecutors said on Tuesday.
Police in neighboring Saint Paul said a 17-year-old, who county prosecutors identified as Locke's cousin, Mekhi Speed, had been arrested Monday in connection with a Jan. 10 homicide.
""This arrest is related to the search warrants that were served last week in Minneapolis,"" the Saint Paul Police Department said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
The fatal shooting of Locke, 22, in an apartment in Minneapolis, the state's largest city, has drawn protests against no-knock search warrants authorizing police to enter private property without first alerting occupants. 
Locke had not been named in the warrant issued in relation to the Saint Paul homicide investigation, and police have acknowledged it was unclear if he was connected. 
The apartment raided on Feb. 2 was registered to the girlfriend of Speed's brother, according to a charging document filed by Ramsey County Attorney John J. Choi. Speed's brother, his girlfriend and Locke were at the apartment at the time. 
The document identified Locke as ""A.L."", adding he was ""Speed's cousin"" and was ""shot during execution of the warrant and now deceased"". 
Speed was charged Tuesday with two counts of second-degree murder in the killing of Minneapolis resident Otis Elder, 38, the document said, adding Speed is being held at the Ramsey County Juvenile Detention Center. 
'NO-KNOCK'
Locke's parents have joined others in Minneapolis in calling for an end to no-knock warrants in the city. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey announced a moratorium https://www.reuters.com/world/us/minneapolis-police-releases-video-swat-team-shooting-dead-armed-black-man-2022-02-04 on such searches on Friday, and some state lawmakers are seeking to enact legislation limiting them.
""The no-knock warrant is what caused Amir's death,"" his father, Andre Locke, told CNN in an interview on Tuesday. ""He didn't even see what was coming. He couldn't see who took his life."" 
Holding back tears, Locke's mother, Karen Wells, said during the interview: ""As professional people that carry guns and are supposed to protect and serve a community, they didn't protect my son that day.""
The day after Locke's killing, police released video footage https://www.reuters.com/world/us/minneapolis-police-releases-video-swat-team-shooting-dead-armed-black-man-2022-02-04 from the raid that showed Locke holding a gun as he twisted beneath a blanket on a sofa after being roused by officers.
Building on protests held over the weekend, students at several Minneapolis schools staged a walkout on Tuesday, waving banners that read ""Justice for Amir Locke"" and ""Protect Young Black Lives,"" photos and video on social media showed.
The incident is the latest to put the Minneapolis police department under scrutiny. Almost two years ago, George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, was killed by a white officer who knelt on his neck for over nine minutes during an arrest. 

Outrage over Floyd's death sparked a nationwide movement challenging police brutality and bias in the U.S. criminal justice system. 
The officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, Derek Chauvin, was convicted by a jury of unintentional second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin has filed notice that he will appeal the conviction.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Three female graduate students at Harvard University filed a lawsuit on Tuesday accusing the Ivy League school of ignoring for years the sexual harassment of students by a professor who they said threatened their academic careers if they reported him.
The students filed the lawsuit in federal court in Boston days after Harvard placed John Comaroff, an anthropology professor and expert on South Africa, on administrative leave following a university investigation into his conduct.
Margaret Czerwienski, Lilia Kilburn and Amulya Mandava alleged that Comaroff for years ""kissed and groped students without their consent, made unwelcome sexual advances, and threatened to sabotage students’ careers if they complained.""
They said they were among the students who reported Comaroff to Harvard officials. Yet despite those warnings, Harvard watched as he retaliated by ensuring the students would have ""trouble getting jobs,"" the lawsuit said. 
Comaroff, who joined Harvard in 2012, was not named as a defendant. His lawyers -- Norman Zalkind, Janet Halley, and Ruth O’Meara-Costello -- in a joint statement said he ""categorically denies ever harassing or retaliating against any student.""
Harvard had no comment. In January, it placed Comaroff on leave for the spring semester and barred him from teaching required courses after finding he engaged in verbal conduct that violated its sexual harassment and professional conduct policies.
Those sanctions have divided the Harvard community, where nearly 40 faculty members signed onto an open letter questioning the investigation and calling him an ""excellent colleague.""

In Tuesday's lawsuit, the women said Harvard's inaction allowed Comaroff to repeatedly and forcibly kiss Kilburn, grope her in public and even graphically described ways she would be supposedly raped or killed in South Africa for being in a same-sex relationship.
All three said their academic trajectories and career prospects had been ""profoundly altered"" and that Harvard violated Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, which protects students from discrimination based on sex, and various Massachusetts laws.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - Abortion providers in liberal states are expanding clinics, training more staff and boosting travel assistance to prepare for an influx of patients from conservative states if the U.S. Supreme Court ends the constitutional right to the procedure.
Planned Parenthood is enlarging several clinics in California and has purchased land to build a bigger clinic in Reno, Nevada. In Illinois, abortion providers have set up a logistics center to help make medical care arrangements for women from states where abortion is expected to be restricted. 
Clinic operators said they were also increasing services in Minnesota, New York and Virginia ahead of a Supreme Court decision expected by early summer. Many court watchers believe the six-justice conservative majority will weaken or overturn Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion legal nationwide. 
The court's ruling could dramatically curtail abortion access in the United States, where the issue remains politically divisive despite public polling showing a majority of Americans believe the procedure should be legal in all or most cases. 
A decision to overturn Roe would trigger laws ending the right to an abortion in 26 states, mostly in the Midwest, South and parts of the West. It would also embolden abortion opponents to seek restrictions in states where it remains legal.
""We are getting ready for this post-Roe world and getting ready to continue to be the safety net for patients from all over the country,"" said Dr. Jessica Hamilton, associate medical director for abortion services for a Planned Parenthood chapter that covers much of California and Nevada.
Hamilton treats patients seeking abortion care at the organization's Sacramento clinic while protesters march outside. Two days a week, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and medical students work and train alongside doctors, deepening the ranks of providers.
California Governor Gavin Newsom has pledged the state will be a ""sanctuary"" for U.S. women seeking abortions. Yet divisive politics have complicated efforts to protect and expand access, even in this and other heavily Democratic states. 
Stacy Cross, president of the Planned Parenthood chapter that includes California's more conservative Central Valley, is concerned abortion opponents could hinder plans to expand a clinic in Visalia.
Since the city's planning commission approved a larger site for the clinic in December, abortion opponents have called for protesters to speak out against the project when the city council considers it at a meeting next month.
The address of the planned site for a new clinic in Reno has not been released for security and safety reasons, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman said.
Should Roe get overturned or weakened, anti-abortion advocates said they expect to see increased activism around the issue in all 50 states.
""You're going to see both sides doing whatever they can,"" said Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life, an anti-abortion organization. 
'REAL STIGMA' AROUND ABORTION
Last year, states passed 10 times more restrictions on abortions than protections, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research and policy organization.
""There’s real stigma around abortion across the country, even in progressive spaces,"" said Elizabeth Nash, a state policy expert at Guttmacher. With Roe as settled law, many politicians on the left have not grappled with abortion as part of their routine work for nearly 50 years, she said.
Abortion providers got a preview of a post-Roe landscape last year when Texas enacted the country's strictest anti-abortion law, banning the procedure after about six weeks. 
Clinics in states including California, Illinois, New Mexico and Oklahoma experienced a surge in patients from Texas, abortion providers said.
""We saw and continue to see this massive ripple effect,"" said Dr. Colleen McNicholas, chief medical officer for Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri.
Last month, in cooperation with a private clinic, McNicholas' group opened a logistics center in Illinois aimed at helping women from Texas and other states travel to obtain abortions. 
Whole Woman's Health, which operates four abortion clinics in Texas, recently set up a telehealth office in neighboring New Mexico to serve women seeking medication abortions past six weeks, said Amy Hagstrom Miller, the organization's president and CEO.
To obtain the pills, however, women must provide a New Mexico address where the medication can be mailed and undergo a video exam from a New Mexico location.

""Texas is having a dress rehearsal for what we can expect across the country as Roe is either overturned or further chipped away at,"" Hagstrom Miller said.
Whole Woman's Health also plans to expand operations in Minnesota. The Upper Midwest state borders several largely rural, conservative states likely to ban or severely restrict abortion if Roe is weakened, Hagstrom Miller said. There are also non-stop flights to Minneapolis/St. Paul from every Texas city where the group operates.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When three federal judges last month blocked Alabama's new Republican-backed map of U.S. congressional districts as likely discriminatory against Black voters, they said they were applying ""settled law"" and that the outcome was not even close.
An increasingly assertive conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court disagreed. The justices froze the lower court's ruling and allowed Alabama to use the contested map of the state's seven U.S. House of Representatives districts for the Nov. 8 midterm elections in which Republicans are seeking to regain control of Congress from President Joe Biden's fellow Democrats. 
Monday's 5-4 decision signals a potential further weakening of the Voting Rights Act. The landmark 1965 federal law for decades has been used to counter racially biased actions in voting and drawing electoral districts including those intended to dilute the clout of Black and Hispanic voters and maximize the power of white voters. 
The Supreme Court's action on Monday put in doubt decades of precedent requiring states to create Black-majority districts ""where it's geographically possible to do, and conditions of racially polarized voting prevail,"" said election law expert Ned Foley of Ohio State University's Moritz College of Law.
The court will hear Alabama's arguments in the case this autumn. The eventual ruling, due by the end of June 2023, could make it harder for courts to consider race when determining whether an electoral district map violates a provision called Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act that bars voting practices that result in racial discrimination, legal experts said. 
""If the court accepted Alabama's argument, that would be the end of Section 2 as we know it,"" said Harvard Law School Professor Nicholas Stephanopoulos, an expert in redistricting. 
""It would become far harder for plaintiffs to win Section 2 cases, and states could eliminate many existing minority opportunity districts without violating the statute,"" Stephanopoulos said, referring to districts in which minorities have a better chance of electing lawmakers of their choice.
The Supreme Court has chipped away at the Voting Rights Act, beginning with a 2013 ruling striking down a key part that determined which states with a history of racial discrimination needed federal approval to change voting laws. In a 2021 ruling endorsing Republican-backed Arizona voting restrictions, the justices made it harder to prove violations under Section 2.
Districts in the 435-seat House are reconfigured every decade to reflect national population shifts. The latest redistricting https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-redistricting-legal-battles-that-could-affect-control-congress-2022-02-08 follows the 2020 census. 
Republicans have said the consideration of race in drawing electoral maps must be limited. Democrats have accused Republicans of exploiting majorities in state legislatures to devise electoral maps that lessen the power of Black and other minority voters, who tend to support Democratic candidates. 
The Alabama case is one of two major race-related disputes the Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, already is due to hear in its coming term. The other one gives the conservative justices a chance to end affirmative action policies used by colleges and universities to increase their numbers of Black and Hispanic students. All this comes as Biden is preparing to nominate the first Black woman https://www.reuters.com/world/us/retiring-us-justice-breyer-appear-with-biden-white-house-2022-01-27 to serve on the Supreme Court, to replace retiring liberal Justice Stephen Breyer. 
'RACE-NEUTRAL'
The challengers in Alabama - including two groups of Black voters and the Alabama NAACP civil rights organization - contend that the Republican legislature designed the map to confine Black voters' power to a single district even though the statewide population is 27% Black.
The lower court judges agreed, finding that under Supreme Court precedent an additional district where Black voters constitute the majority or close to it would be justified based on their population and geographic proximity, among other factors. 
Alabama said its legislature adopted a map that used ""race-neutral"" criteria and that the lower court's remedial order would itself be racially discriminatory. Alabama has said Section 2 is not meant give minorities a ""race-prioritized"" electoral advantage. 
State Attorney General Steve Marshall, a Republican, said the lower court's order ""would have unconstitutionally divided Alabamians based on race"" while dividing ""long-recognized communities centered on the Gulf Coast's unique economy and culture.""
Jason Torchinsky, a Republican elections expert, said the Supreme Court now has the chance to bring sorely needed clarity to the redistricting process. Torchinsky noted that ""in many places around the country we're not seeing the kinds of racially polarized voting that we saw 50 years ago.""

Chief Justice Roberts, breaking from the court's five other conservatives, joined the three liberal justices in dissenting on Monday.
In her dissent, liberal Justice Elena Kagan rejected Alabama's assertion that the lower court impermissibly prioritized race in favoring the challengers. Kagan wrote that the Supreme Court's own test formulated in 1986 for gauging racial bias in electoral maps requires lower courts to consider race in deciding whether a minority group could constitute the majority in a newly drawn district.

President Kais Saied announced his declaration to abolish the Supreme Judicial Council on Sunday, a move the body rejected as illegal and an attempt to undermine judges' independence. 
The head of the council, Youssef Bouzakher, told Reuters on Tuesday that its members were defying Saied's push to close it down and were discussing via email their next steps to oppose the move. 
Ambassadors to Tunisia from the G7 group of rich democracies said ""a transparent, independent and efficient judiciary and the separation of powers are essential for a functioning democracy that serves its people"". 
Foreign Minister Othman Jarandi received on Tuesday ambassadors of the G7 group and the representative of the Commission on Human Rights and informed them the president's decision to dissolve the Supreme Judicial Council aims to reform the judiciary.
""The president's decision does not aim in any way to put a hand on the judiciary"", the minister said.
Tunisia faces a crisis in public finances, with Tunisians already complaining of shortages of some goods and with the central bank governor warning of an economic collapse like in Venezuela or Lebanon. 
While Tunisia has started talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a rescue package seen as necessary to unlock other financial help, donors have urged Saied to adopt an inclusive approach to reforms. 
The president has promised to uphold rights and freedoms Tunisians won in the 2011 revolution that triggered the Arab Spring and brought democracy, but his latest move has increased concern for the continued rule of law. 
In July he suspended the parliament and dismissed the prime minister, later saying he could rule by decree while he prepares a new constitution that he says will be put to a referendum this summer. 
However, rights groups fear he is growing increasingly authoritarian and his latest move to bring the judiciary under his control would mean he had absolute power over all branches of state. 
The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, also urged Saied to restore the council, warning its dissolution ""would seriously undermine the rule of law"".

Rights group Amnesty International also said on Tuesday the move posed ""a grave threat to fair trial rights in Tunisia"". 
The judges association said in a statement that it would suspend all work in courts on Wednesday and Thursday and that judges would hold a protest against Saied's decision on Thursday.

MOSCOW/ISTANBUL (Reuters) -Six Russian warships are heading to the Black Sea from the Mediterranean for naval drills, the Interfax news agency cited Russia's Defence Ministry as saying on Tuesday, in what it said was a pre-planned movement of military resources. 
Russia announced last month its navy would stage a sweeping set of exercises involving all its fleets in January and February, from the Pacific to the Atlantic, in the latest show of strength in a surge of military activity during a standoff with the West over Ukraine.
Three of the ships passed through Turkey's straits to the Black Sea on Tuesday, according to a Reuters witness. Turkish sources said the other three are expected to pass on Wednesday.
The vessels include the Korolev, the Minsk and the Kaliningrad, which navigated the Bosphorus on Tuesday, while the Pyotr Morgunov, the Georgy Pobedonosets and the Olenegorsky Gornyak are scheduled to pass on Wednesday. 
Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops near the Ukraine border. It denies any plans to invade but is seeking sweeping security guarantees, including a promise of no missile deployments near its borders, a scaling back of NATO military infrastructure and a ban on Ukraine ever joining the alliance.
Legally, NATO member Turkey could shut the straits to transit if Russia were to take military action against Ukraine.
""Turkey is authorised to close the straits to all foreign warships in wartime or when it is threatened by aggression. Also, it is authorised to refuse transit to merchant ships belonging to countries at war with Turkey,"" said Yoruk Isik, an Istanbul-based geopolitical analyst and head of the Bosphorus Observer consultancy.
Turkey, which shares a maritime border with both Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea, has said any military conflict would be unacceptable and has told Moscow any invasion would be unwise.

However President Tayyip Erdogan has also offered to mediate in the row between Moscow and Kyiv. Ankara has cordial relations with both countries, though Erdogan says it will do what is necessary as a NATO member in the event of a Russian invasion.
French President Emmanuel Macron, said on Tuesday after talks in the Kremlin with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin that he believed steps can be taken to de-escalate the crisis and called on all sides to stay calm.

This is the contact line of Ukraine's eight-year war against Russian-backed forces that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy says has claimed 15,000 lives. 
Russia has massed more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders in recent weeks, ringing alarm bells in NATO member states who fear a new military offensive. Moscow denies any such plan. 
The soldiers in the Luhansk region, which shares much of its border with Russia, say they are fed up with uncertainty and want some kind of breakthrough in the conflict that has kept them in the trenches since 2014. 
    ""We are sick of this never-ending war. Make it or break it, let them attack us or we should attack them to end this uncertainty. We are all tired of this,"" said Bohdan, a Ukrainian soldier who refused to give his surname for security reasons. 
     Bohdan, 27,  a former miner and a student of aviation engineering in Pavlohrad, near Dnipro, has been stationed on the frontline for the past year. 
    Although the bigger guns have been silent for some time, mortar and rocket-propelled grenade explosions still break the silence over the snow-covered fields. 
    Soldiers are doing what they can to cope with tension and fight boredom.
    Bohdan spends time exercising with barbells and a skipping rope in a makeshift gym he has built in the trench that he has been posted at for the past several months.

    Another soldier, Konstyantin, 44, a former policeman from Lviv in active service since 2014, says training will be crucial if full-scale conflict breaks out.  
    ""If something starts it is impossible to predict what's going to happen and to plan accordingly. One will have to rely on one's skills, habits and experience,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration will place hundreds of migrants caught at the U.S.-Mexico border on house arrest in the coming weeks as it seeks cheaper alternatives to immigration detention, according to a notice to lawmakers and a U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official.
A 120-day pilot program will be launched in Houston and Baltimore, with 100-200 single adults enrolled in each location, according to the notice, which was sent by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) and reviewed by Reuters.
The so-called ""home curfew"" pilot will cost $6-8 per day for each enrollee, far less than the $142 daily cost of immigration detention.
The enrollees will generally be required to remain at home from 8 p.m. until 8 a.m., with exceptions for job schedules for those with work authorization or extraordinary circumstances.
Current alternatives to detention, such as ankle bracelets and phone monitoring, require enrollees to notify case managers if they are leaving the state or traveling, but do not mandate home confinement, the DHS official said.
U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, has pledged a more humane approach to immigration policy than his predecessor Republican Donald Trump. During Biden's presidential campaign he pledged to end for-profit immigration detention but has yet to deliver on that promise. 
The home curfew program could face criticism from both immigration hardliners for being too lax and pro-immigrant advocates for being stricter than existing alternatives to detention. One immigrant advocate on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) called the plan ""mass e-carceration"" after Axios first reported details of the pilot. 
The plan comes as arrests at the U.S.-Mexico border are expected to reach record highs again this year https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-preps-another-record-breaking-rise-migrant-arrests-mexico-border-2022-01-27 and detention space has been limited by the coronavirus pandemic. Though most migrants caught at the border are being rapidly expelled from the United States under a COVID-related health order, thousands have been allowed into the country to pursue their immigration cases.
""We just don't have the capacity,"" the DHS official said. ""We're not going to detain our way out of the border crisis."" 

The Biden administration plans to ask Congress for funding to place as many as 400,000 migrants this year in alternatives to detention, which could include the home curfew initiative as well as existing programs, the DHS official said. The total number of migrants in such programs would be higher since only heads of households are enrolled. 
About 164,000 are currently in alternative-to-detention programs, according to ICE, roughly double the total on Sept. 30, 2020, before Biden took office.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. law enforcement agents on Tuesday arrested a North Carolina man accused of storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 while he was out on bail on an unrelated attempted murder charge, according to a newly unsealed court document.
Prosecutors allege that during deadly Capitol siege Matthew Beddingfield jumped over a barricade, charged toward a group of police officers, and jabbed them with a metal flagpole he brought with him.
At the time of the Jan 6. attack, Beddingfield was out on bail while awaiting trial on an attempted murder charge.
In that case, Beddingfield was charged with shooting a 17-year-old in the head after an altercation in a Walmart (NYSE:WMT) parking lot in Smithfield, North Carolina.
Beddingfield was 19 at the time of his Dec. 2019 arrest in that case. The victim survived the shooting.
Soon after that incident, Beddingfield's father told a local news outlet that his son had been robbed and was defending himself.
According to NBC News, Beddingfield eventually pleaded guilty to a lesser charge relating to the 2019 shooting and is currently on probation in that case.
A lawyer for Beddingfield was not immediately reachable for comment.

The U.S. Justice Department said last month that more than 225 defendants have been charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding police officers during the storming of the Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump.
Approximately 140 police officers were assaulted that day, according to the Justice Department.

(Reuters) - Behind his latest outbursts against NATO and doomsday warnings to the West, there are tentative signs that Russian President Vladimir Putin is keen to avoid an escalation of the Ukraine crisis and seek some form of accommodation with the West.
In the early hours of Tuesday, Putin warned for the second time in a week that European countries would automatically be drawn into a war with Russia in which ""there will be no winners"" if Ukraine joined NATO and then tried to recapture the Crimean peninsula that Russia seized from it in 2014.
But at the Kremlin news conference that ended after 1 a.m., he also said dialogue was not over, that some proposals from the United States and NATO were worth discussing, and that Russia would do ""everything to find compromises that suit everyone"".
After more than three months of high tension sparked by Putin's build-up of more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders, his intentions remain opaque. The White House said at the weekend he could order an attack within days or weeks.
Yet two Moscow-based analysts who specialise in deciphering the signals from the Kremlin said Putin's late-night comments after hours of talks with French President Emmanuel Macron suggested that he was serious about negotiating. 
""Of course he sticks to his positions but I've not got the impression that he's in the mood for escalation,"" said Andrey Kortunov, head of the Russian International Affairs Council. ""Probably you wouldn't speak to an opponent for seven hours if you wanted just to lecture him and close the file.""
Putin has gathered a force of more than 100,000 Russian troops near the border with Ukraine as he presses the core demands that he restated on Tuesday: no more enlargement of NATO, no missile deployments near Russia's borders and a scaling back of NATO's military infrastructure in Europe to 1997 levels.
He complained that the United States and NATO had ""bypassed"" these in the formal responses they delivered to Moscow on Jan. 26, which contained ""political clichés and proposals on some secondary issues"".
But the U.S. response - leaked last week to Spanish newspaper El Pais - included offers to address specific Russian concerns. It said Washington was ready to discuss a reciprocal deal on not deploying missiles and combat forces in Ukraine, and to negotiate a ""transparency mechanism"" to confirm that the United States has not placed Tomahawk cruise missiles at missile defence sites in Poland and Romania.
Kortunov said entering an arms control dialogue with Washington could therefore be in Putin's interest.
""In a way that can meet his demand because if there are serious negotiations on arms control in Europe, these negotiations can prevent NATO infrastructure from moving closer to Russian borders,"" said Kortunov.
""If this is the centre of his concerns, he can try to resolve the problem in this way. But of course he's not likely to drop his prime demand completely.""
MINSK DEAL
Fyodor Lukyanov, editor-in-chief of the Russia in Global Affairs journal, said that if Moscow could not get the West to promise not to admit Ukraine into NATO, it could seek to achieve the same outcome through a revived version of the 2014 and 2015 Minsk peace agreements.
Putin stressed after speaking with Macron that there was no alternative to the accords, which would grant special constitutional status to two east Ukrainian regions where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting the Ukrainian army since 2014.
Depending how that special status was defined, it could stymie Ukraine's NATO ambitions, especially if the two pro-Russian regions were left free to conclude their own security arrangements with Moscow - something Kyiv would strongly resist.
Lukyanov acknowledged it would take serious Western pressure for Ukraine to drop its refusal to talk to the separatists and sign up to autonomy for the eastern regions.

But he said it was possible that ""the contours of (a) new deal might emerge"" from some form of settlement of the conflict, combined with a statement on new security arrangements in Europe along the lines that Macron has proposed, and new arms control measures of the kind that Washington is ready to discuss.
""I'm optimistic but at the same time very cautious,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said on Tuesday it will name college professor and lawyer Robin Morris Collin to lead the agency’s efforts to advance environmental justice in communities disproportionately harmed by pollution.
Her selection as senior EPA advisor on environmental justice is part of the Biden administration's effort to deliver on a promise to ensure environmental decisions and rules are fair to low-income and minority communities that have historically borne the brunt of pollution from power plants, refineries and other industries. 
EPA Administrator Michael Regan described Collin in a statement sent to Reuters as ""one of the nation's foremost experts and lifelong advocate for overburdened communities."" 
Collin, a law professor at Willamette University in Oregon, served as founding chair of Oregon's Environmental Justice Task Force, which was created by the state legislature over a decade ago. The task force has increased engagement between low-income and minority communities and state policymakers on environmental policy. 
""I am honored to serve in this role to protect our land, air and water and, as part of that work, lift up underserved communities so that we may all thrive together,” Collin said in a statement.
The EPA has spent months trying to identify a candidate for the senior advisor position, hoping to find someone with credibility in pollution-affected communities as well as the ability to navigate a complex federal regulatory environment. 
The EPA’s proposed fiscal 2022 budget also calls for a new national environmental justice office under a newly created assistant EPA administrator, which would potentially elevate the senior advisor position and require senate confirmation. 
Congress has yet to approve the new position.

The EPA plays a key role in delivering on the environmental justice goals set by President Joe Biden's administration, which promised to deliver at least 40% of overall benefits from federal investments in climate change action to disadvantaged communities. Last month EPA announced surprise inspections https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-plans-surprise-inspections-protect-communities-burdened-by-pollution-2022-01-26 at facilities that are suspected of polluting.
Beverly Wright, executive director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, said she looks forward to working with Collin ""to address the urgent needs of underserved communities that have been left behind for way too long.”

ANTANANARIVO (Reuters) - A cyclone killed at least 10 people in southeastern Madagascar, the second to hit the Indian Ocean island in just two weeks, triggering floods, bringing down buildings and cutting power, officials said on Sunday.
One of the worst-hit towns was Nosy Varika on the east coast where almost 95% of buildings were destroyed ""as if we had just been bombed"" and floods cut access, an official said.
Cyclone Batsirai swept inland late on Saturday, slamming into the eastern coastline with heavy rain and wind speeds of 165 kph (100 mph). It was projected it could displace as many as 150,000 people.
The damage from the storm compounded the destruction wreaked by Cyclone Ana, which hit the island, with a population of nearly 30,000,000, two weeks ago, killing 55 people and displacing 130,000 
Madagascar's office of disaster and risk management said in a bulletin late on Sunday 10 people had been killed. State radio said some died when their house collapsed in the town of Ambalavao, about 460 km south of the capital Antananarivo. 
""We saw only desolation: uprooted trees, fallen electric poles, roofs torn off by the wind, the city completely under water,"" Nirina Rahaingosoa, a resident of Fianarantsoa, 420 km south of the capital, told Reuters by phone. 
Electricity was knocked out in the town as poles were toppled by gusts of winds that blew all night into Sunday morning, he said. 
Willy Raharijaona, technical adviser to the vice president of Madagascar's Senate, said some parts of the southeast had been cut off from the surrounding areas by flooding.
""It's as if we had just been bombed. The city of Nosy Varika is almost 95% destroyed,"" he said. ""The solid houses saw their roofs torn off by the wind. The wooden huts have for the most part been destroyed.""
Another resident who gave only one name, Raharijaona, told Reuters even schools and churches that had been preparing to shelter the displaced around Mananjary in the southeast had their roofs torn off.
In the central region of Haute Matsiatra, villagers shovelled mud from a road to clear damage from a landslide caused by Batsirai.

Cyclone Ana that struck the Indian Ocean Island nation on Jan. 22, leaving at least 55 dead from landslides and collapsed buildings and causing widespread flooding.
After ravaging Madagascar, Ana moved west, making landfall in Mozambique and continuing inland to Malawi. A total of 88 people were killed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Bureau of Investigation is probing a meeting in a downtown DC garage the day before the January 6 Capitol Hill riot between the then-leader of the Proud Boys extremist group, the now-indicted leader of the Oath Keepers militia and other far-right figures, according to two witnesses interviewed by FBI agents.
Among the half dozen people gathered at a garage near the Phoenix Park Hotel was Oath Keepers head Stewart Rhodes, who was indicted this year on charges of “seditious conspiracy” in the insurrection. Proud Boys Chairman Enrique Tarrio, who was not present at the riot, was also at the garage meeting but left Washington afterward.
The meeting put the heads of the nation’s two best-known violent far-right pro-Trump groups in immediate proximity to each other 24 hours before the breach of the Capitol. Three attendees or their representatives contacted by Reuters say they did not discuss matters related to January 6.
Bianca Gracia, who heads a pro-Trump coalition called Latinos for Trump and an affiliated Political Action Committee named Latinos For America First, was at the garage meeting as well, according to witnesses and video taken by a documentary film crew. Also present was Kellye SoRelle, a lawyer for the Oath Keepers and Latinos for Trump. SoRelle told Reuters she was invited by Gracia to meet Tarrio and share information about criminal defense attorneys. She said her role in the meeting was brief, and did not concern plans for the next day.
A U.S. House of Representatives committee is investigating the January 6 riot, in which supporters of then-President Donald Trump sought to block Congress’ certification of Joe Biden’s election as president. The committee has subpoenaed the phone records of a photographer who accompanied Tarrio to parts of the garage meeting.
Tarrio told Reuters last June that his meeting at the garage with Rhodes was unplanned and not significant. “By coincidence,” Tarrio said, “he was inside … that parking garage.” He said he shook hands with Rhodes solely to be polite. “He’s here, I’m not going to not shake somebody’s hand.” He has denied any Proud Boys planning ahead of January 6.
Reached again in January, Tarrio said he would not answer further questions. “I usually speak to all reporters,” he texted back after one question, “but when they become conspiracy theorists … that’s usually when I sever ties.” Tarrio has said he stepped down as Proud Boys chairman earlier this year.
An attorney for Rhodes, who is being held pending trial, emailed Reuters that “there was no coordination” between Rhodes and Tarrio.
The FBI’s investigation of the meeting has not previously been reported, nor have the circumstances of the gathering. A short clip of the gathering appeared in a British Channel 4 documentary last year about the Proud Boys, spurring some chatter on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Michael Simmons, who was present during part of January 6 with Rhodes, said Rhodes had not mentioned meeting Tarrio. When Reuters told him of the meeting, Simmons said he was shocked because, he said, Rhodes had been critical of Tarrio and the Proud Boys. “Why would you meet Enrique in a fucking parking garage?” said Simmons, who has not been charged. “It just blows my mind. That’s crazy!”
Federal prosecutors have charged multiple leaders of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers with playing leading roles in the mayhem of January 6. Tarrio has not been indicted in the case.
The Proud Boys is an all-male group that encourages street brawling against leftist protesters and calls itself “Western chauvinist.” Oath Keepers wear military-style uniforms, train in military tactics and often carry firearms in operations.
Last March, prosecutors cited the social media messages of one Oath Keeper leader indicted in the January 6 case. “This week I organized an alliance between Oath Keepers, Florida 3%ers, and Proud Boys,” he allegedly wrote in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) message before the riot, citing a different gathering, prosecutors said in a court filing. The Three Percenters is a loosely organized far right militia, some of whose members have been charged in the Capitol attack.
So far, however, the Justice Department has not disclosed clear evidence that the far-right groups plotted to come together on January 6.
An FBI spokesperson declined to comment.
'OUT OF SIGHT'
On the afternoon of January 5, 2021, Washington teemed with Trump supporters preparing for January 6, when Congress was scheduled to ratify Biden’s presidential victory at the Capitol. Tarrio had just been released after a night in a Washington jail, where he was held on charges of burning a Black Lives Matter flag in December 2020. A judge ordered him to leave town until his court appearances. Tarrio later served nearly six months for burning the banner and carrying illegal rifle magazines into the city that December.
After he was released on January 5, the documentary film crew working on the Proud Boys report drove Tarrio to the Phoenix Park Hotel, not far from the Capitol building, said a source familiar with the matter.
Oath Keepers leader Rhodes had left Texas on January 3, spending over $10,000 on firearms equipment on his journey to the DC area, prosecutors say in an indictment unsealed January 4. The indictment said he conspired “to oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power.” He stayed at a hotel in Vienna, Virginia.
Just as Tarrio arrived from jail January 5, Rhodes was outside the Phoenix Park Hotel in DC, said a source at the scene.
Gracia, the president of Latinos for Trump, was inside the hotel. SoRelle, the lawyer for Latinos for Trump, says Gracia invited her to meet Tarrio. While Tarrio is best known as the Proud Boys chairman, he was also previously involved in Latinos for Trump and had been its Florida state director.
Sorelle said her recollection was that Tarrio and a couple of others were in the garage when she walked in with Rhodes and Gracia. She said Rhodes shook Tarrio’s hand and the two exchanged pleasantries. Then she briefly discussed Tarrio’s need for a lawyer in the DC criminal case, for which he’d been arrested the previous day. She said about six people were there. Latinos for Trump has not been accused in the January 6 violence.
Contacted this January, Gracia declined to discuss the garage meeting. Previously, she told Reuters her group had a morning rally on January 6 near the U.S. Senate, and that she left by 12:15 PM, went to her hotel and slept through the insurrection. “We’re a very spiritual group and we’re grounded in God and we stayed where we were supposed to stay and we prayed,” she said. SoRelle says she too went to the morning January 6 rally by Latinos for Trump, where she spoke, as did Rhodes, SoRelle and Simmons said.
The photographer, Amy Harris, was also with Tarrio at the garage meeting January 5, two sources said. Harris, who originally specialized in photography of music concerts and festivals, had shifted to protests in 2020, and had begun focusing on Tarrio and the Proud Boys. The House committee has subpoenaed Harris’s phone records; she is suing the January 6 committee to block the subpoena. “Harris’s work documenting Tarrio throughout the remainder of 2020 earned her Tarrio’s trust as a journalist and, accordingly, the trust of the members of his group,” her suit said.
Harris and her lawyers declined to comment.
SoRelle said the garage meeting left her puzzled and she says she is unclear why it was held. She said the meeting was not necessary, as she had already shared information about possible lawyers with Tarrio and others. “There was no reason for him to show up and there was no reason for me to be there,” she said.

The documentary film crew was from a company called “Saboteur Media.” It gathered a snippet showing Tarrio, Rhodes and Gracia standing in the garage but does not have audio, according to a source familiar with it. Reuters has seen a photo of the participants standing together at the garage.
The FBI has obtained a copy of the footage, a source told Reuters.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Indirect talks between Iran and the United States on salvaging Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers resumed on Tuesday after a 10-day break, but envoys gave little away as to whether they were closer to resolving various thorny issues.
Delegates say the talks have made limited progress since they resumed in November after a five-month hiatus prompted by the election of hardline Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi. 
Negotiations accelerated last month but a number of vital issues remain unresolved and Western powers say little time remains before Iran's nuclear advances make the 2015 deal restricting them redundant. Envoys went home 10 days ago seeking decisions from their political bosses to hurry things along.
As officials from Iran, the United States, Russia, China, France, Germany, Britain and the European Union began meeting in various formats on Tuesday, it was not immediately clear how much progress had been enabled by any political decisions.
The talks' coordinator, Enrique Mora, declined to comment to reporters as he crossed the road between two luxury hotels hosting negotiations on a blustery day in Vienna, where the negotiations began 10 months ago. Hours later Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Ali Bagheri Kani, arrived for talks.
""After a short break, 8th round of #ViennaTalks is resumed,"" Iran's mission to the United Nations in Vienna said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), with a picture of Bagheri Kani meeting Mora.
The 2015 deal imposed restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities that extended the time Tehran would need to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb, if it chose to, to at least a year from around two to three months. Most experts say that time is now shorter than when the deal was struck.
Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons.
Then-President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the deal in 2018, re-imposing punishing U.S. sanctions on Iran's economy that slashed its vital oil exports. 

Iran responded by breaching many of the deal's restrictions and pushing well beyond them, enriching uranium to close to weapons-grade and using advanced centrifuges to do it, which has helped it hone its skills in operating those machines.
Iran has insisted that since the United States pulled out of the deal, it is up to Washington to make the first move by agreeing to lift sanctions and guarantee it will not withdraw again. Western officials say they are seeking a solution where both sides act in a coordinated manner.

625,"<span>Feb 08, 2022 07:46AM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) -After protesters hounded Britain's opposition leader Keir Starmer, Prime Minister Boris Johnson came under heavy pressure on Tuesday to withdraw a claim that Starmer had failed to prosecute one of the country's most notorious child abusers. 
Johnson is facing the gravest crisis of his 30-month premiership after a series of scandals including revelations that he and his staff attended Downing Street parties during COVID lockdowns.
As Johnson apologised to parliament for the parties on Jan. 31, he falsely claimed Starmer had failed to prosecute Jimmy Savile, a late TV star who abused hundreds of children, during his time as Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).
Starmer was confronted by angry protesters on Monday who surrounded him after an anti-COVID vaccination demonstration.
As the Labour Party leader was escorted into a police car, some of the protesters shouted ""Traitor!"" and ""Were you protecting Jimmy Savile?"" at him.
""It is really important for our democracy and for his security that the false Savile slurs made against him are withdrawn in full,"" said Julian Smith, a lawmaker in Johnson's ruling Conservative Party. 
Another Conservative lawmaker, Roger Gale, said: ""This, I fear, is the direct result of the deliberately careless use of language in the Chamber."" 
The row risks further undermining Johnson's authority as he battles to reshape his Downing Street team and face off claims from opposition parties that he is unfit to govern.
Opposition lawmakers called on Johnson to apologise for the Savile remarks. 
Savile, a BBC TV and radio host who was never prosecuted despite a number of police investigations, died in 2011, aged 84. After his death it was revealed he had abused hundreds of victims, mainly children. The youngest victim was an 8-year-old boy. 
'POISON' IN POLITICS
Johnson's supporters said that while the behaviour of the protesters was unacceptable, it was a step too far to pin the blame for their actions on the prime minister.
Johnson said on Feb. 3 that he had not meant to imply Starmer had personally failed to prosecute Savile, but he has refused to apologise for his remarks.
Johnson's attempt to clarify his remarks failed to satisfy Munira Mirza, his head of policy who had worked with him for 14 years, and prompted her to quit her job last week. Finance minister Rishi Sunak has said he would not have made such remarks. 
House of Commons Speaker Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) Hoyle, who previously ruled that Johnson's comments on the matter were inappropriate but not against parliamentary rules, told lawmakers he had requested a report on the incident from police. 
""These sorts of comments only inflame opinions and generate disregard for the House...,"" he said. ""Our words have consequences and we should always be mindful of that fact.""
The husband of Jo Cox, a British lawmaker stabbed to death days before the 2016 Brexit referendum, made a similar plea for politicians not to ""inject poison"" into public discourse.
""When you throw around accusations of people protecting paedophiles or not moving against paedophiles, it creates a viscerality of debate and a violence of emotional reaction,"" Brendan Cox told BBC radio.

Coming to Johnson's defence on Tuesday, Chris Philp, minister for technology and the digital economy, said the prime minister could not be blamed for the protesters' actions.
""I don't think it (Johnson's comment) in any way justified or provoked or incited the terrible and totally unacceptable harassment and intimidation of the leader of the opposition,"" Philp told Sky.

LONDON (Reuters) - Advances in satellite technology have revealed that the world's glaciers contain significantly less ice than previously thought, according to a study published in Nature Geoscience on Monday. 
The revised estimate reduces global sea level rise by 3 inches if all glaciers were to melt. But it raises concern for some communities that rely on seasonal melt from glaciers to feed rivers and irrigate crops. If glaciers contain less ice, water will run out sooner than expected. 
While some ice naturally melts throughout the year, rising temperatures due to climate change are speeding up glacier retreat. Between 2000 and 2019, these rivers of ice lost roughly 5.4 trillion tonnes. 
Countries are already struggling with disappearing glaciers. Peru is investing in desalination to make up for declining freshwater. And Chile hopes to create artificial glaciers in its mountains.
But, ""we've had quite a poor understanding of how much ice is actually stored in glaciers,"" said lead study author Romain Millan, a glaciologist at Université Grenoble Alpes. Past analyses, for example, double-counted glaciers along the peripheries of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, overestimating ice volume. 
The Nature Geoscience study assessed how quickly glaciers were moving across the landscape, or their velocity. Such measurements allow scientists to more accurately measure volume, as the way glaciers flow indicates where ice is thick or thin. But collecting this information has been limited by technology.
High-resolution satellites deployed in recent years, however, allowed for the first analysis of how 98% of the world's glaciers are moving, ""from small glaciers in the Andes up to massive glaciers in Svalbard and Patagonia,"" said Millan.
The work analyzed more than 800,000 pairs of images of glaciers taken between 2017 and 2018, and found that many were shallower than previously assessed. Scientists now estimate there is 20 percent less glacial ice present with the potential to melt into the ocean and raise sea levels. Currently, glaciers are responsible for 1 mm of annual sea level rise, or 30% of the yearly increase. 
""This is one of the first really impressive results coming out"" from satellite advances, said Daniel Farinotti, a glaciologist at ETH Zurich not involved in the research.

Millan and his colleagues also found that Asia's Himalayas contain 37% more ice than previously estimated, while South America’s Andean glaciers contain roughly 27% less ice. Already, Peru's glaciers have lost 40 percent of their surface area since the 1970s.
""This will put more pressure on freshwater in the Andes,"" he said. ""On the contrary, water will be more secure in the Himalayas.""

In the city of Kharkiv, Viktoria Makarova, a building firm manager, is learning to fire a rifle in case of an invasion.
Far from the rarefied rounds of diplomacy aimed at easing soaring East-West tensions over a Russian military build-up, people in Ukraine are trying to get on with their daily lives. But they are also preparing for the worst.
In the suburbs of Donetsk, the regional centre of one of two regions in east Ukraine where rebels are fighting an armed conflict with the Ukrainian army, Viktor describes a grim post-retirement existence. 
He lives a few kilometres from the frontline on a pension from the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic. He also gets a Ukrainian pension, but in practice it's hard to pick up.
He spends his time painting oil portraits of his relatives in Russia from photographs in his flat and last year sold three landscapes and two portraits for a pittance. 
""One of your ears is on the pillow, the other is listening out for any shelling starting, in case you have to run to the basement. In short, we all need peace,"" said Viktor, who declined to give his surname. 
Some 15,000 people have been killed since 2014 in fighting between the Russian-backed separatists and the Ukrainian army, according to the government in Kyiv. Ties have been fraught since Moscow annexed the peninsula of Crimea that year. 
Now a Russian build-up of more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine has sparked fears in the West and in Ukraine that Moscow may be planning an invasion, something Russia denies. 
In Kharkiv, a major Ukrainian city around 40 kilometres (25 miles) from the Russian border, 44-year-old Makarova is one of numerous women who are signing up for self-defence courses to prepare. 
""We're not going to run away and abandon our beloved city of Kharkov, this means we have to learn how to defend it,"" the Russian-speaker told Reuters. 
On the weekend, she's out doing target practice with a rifle in a snowy field. Demand for such courses among civilians has soared.
""Every time Russian aggression grows, people's motivation increases, they obviously want to refresh their skills and learn news ones,"" said Igor Pushkarev, who fought in east Ukraine and runs courses for Kharkiv's residents.

Back in the rebel-held Donetsk People's Republic, Svetlana, who lives in a village by the frontline, said she was resigned to what lay in store. 
""Whatever happens, will happen. We'll stay at home or at work when it starts. Maybe we'll survive, maybe not... Of course we're scared, sure. But where can we go? Who needs us?""

China, which claims self-governed Taiwan as its own, routinely objects to U.S. arms sales, adding to existing Sino-U.S. tensions.
A statement from the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency said it had delivered the required certification notifying Congress following State Department approval for the sale, which was requested by Taiwan's de facto embassy in Washington.
Upgrades to the Patriot Air Defense System would ""help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, economic and progress in the region,"" the DSCA said in a statement. 
""This proposed sale serves U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability,"" the agency said. 
The main contractors would be Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) and  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), it said. 
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said it ""highly welcomed"" the decision.
""In the face of China's continued military expansion and provocative actions, our country will maintain its national security with a solid defense, and continue to deepen the close security partnership between Taiwan and the United States,"" it said in a statement.
In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian offered strong condemnation.
""China will take appropriate and forceful measures to firmly safeguard its sovereignty and security interests,"" he told reporters.
Asked what measures China would take, Zhao said: ""I wish to ask everyone to wait and see"".
China has imposed https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-china-taiwan-idUSKBN27B0P0 sanctions on Lockheed Martin and other U.S. companies in the past for selling weapons to Taiwan, though it is unclear what form the penalties have taken.
Taiwan's Defense Ministry has said the decision to obtain newer Patriot missiles was made during a 2019 meeting with U.S. officials in the administration of President Donald Trump.
The ministry said the deal was expected to ""come into effect"" within one month. 
The democratically governed island has complained of repeated missions by China's air force in its air defense zone, part of what Washington sees as Beijing's effort to pressure Taipei into accepting its sovereignty.
The United States, like most countries, does not have official relations with Taiwan, but Washington is its biggest backer and is bound by law to provide it with means to defend itself.

U.S. officials have been pushing Taiwan to modernize its military so it can become a ""porcupine,"" hard for China to attack.
China's ambassador to the United States said last month that the two super powers could end up in a military conflict if Washington encourages Taiwan's independence.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Police in Canada's capital said on Monday they had seized thousands of liters of fuel and removed an oil tanker as part of a crackdown to end an 11-day protest against COVID-19 measures, adding truck and protester numbers had fallen significantly.
The protest, which has gridlocked Ottawa, has been largely peaceful but ear-splitting horn blaring by protesters saw a court on Monday grant an interim injunction preventing people from sounding horns in the city's downtown.
The so-called ""Freedom Convoy"" consisting of truckers and other motorists started as a movement opposing a Canadian vaccine mandate for cross-border drivers - a requirement mirrored by a U.S. rule - has morphed into a rallying point against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau' public health measures.
Trudeau, who appeared on Monday for the first time in nearly a week after being infected by COVID, said the protest has to stop. Responding to an emergency debate in the parliament, Trudeau denounced the tactics used by demonstrators.
""This is a story of a country that got through this pandemic by being united and a few people shouting and waving swastikas does not define who Canadians are,"" he said.
Trudeau and his family left Ottawa to an undisclosed location as the convoy started rolling into the city due to security concerns. The protests last week included some Confederate and Nazi flags.
Canadians have largely followed government's health measures and nearly 79% of the eligible population has taken two doses of the vaccine. But recent polls have shown frustrations against restrictions are growing.
While Ottawa awoke to its second week of what its political and policing leaders now describe as a siege, Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly said on Monday activity has decreased at the blockades. This weekend, police counted 1,000 trucks and 5,000 protesters, down from 3,000 trucks and 10,000 to 15,000 protesters last weekend, Sloly added.
""We are turning up the heat in every way we possibly can,"" Sloly told reporters, days after he said there may not be a ""policing solution"" to the occupation. ""We are asking for a major push of resources to come in the next 72 hours.""
On Monday, a Canadian judge granted a 10-day injunction preventing people from sounding horns in downtown Ottawa. The injunction was part of a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of downtown Ottawa residents, some of whom have said they feel unsafe in their own neighbourhood.
The Ambassador Bridge, a major road bridge connecting Canada and the United States was temporarily closed in both directions, the Canadian government website said https:// late Feb. 7. The Windsor-Detroit border is the busiest international crossing in North America.
'PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE'
Deputy Police Chief Steve Bell told city councillors on Monday police had received ""active threats to public figures throughout this occupation,"" which they continue to investigate.
Ottawa police have received help from hundreds of officers in other police agencies, but they say it is not enough. Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson asked for reinforcements in a letter on Monday to Trudeau and Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino.
""The occupation has turned into an aggressive and hateful occupation of our neighbourhoods,"" he wrote. ""People are living in fear and are terrified."" He called the honking ""tantamount to psychological warfare.""
A short stretch of Metcalfe Street in downtown Ottawa, home to Canada's parliament, central bank, and buildings including Trudeau's office, smelled of campfire on Monday. A clustering of trucks, cars and tractors without trailers bore signs deriding everything from vaccines and mandates to Canada's carbon tax.
One sign showed a poster of Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which guarantees rights including that of life, liberty and security of the person - subject to ""reasonable limits.""
'PRIME MINISTER STOP HIDING'
Packets of water bottles, briquettes and diapers were piled high beside open-sided white tents with tables of food.
There was also evidence of pushback from residents. Small signs in the ground-floor windows of an apartment building a few blocks away said: ""GO HOME MORONS"" and ""VACCINES SAVE LIVES.""
""We cannot allow an angry crowd to reverse the course that continues to save lives in this last stretch. This should never be a precedent for how to make policy in Canada,"" Mendicino told reporters on Monday.
Trudeau did not attend the press conference and missed question period in the parliament.
""When will the prime minister stop hiding, show up for Canadians, show some leadership and fix the mess that he's created?"" interim Conservative Party leader Candice Bergen, who has supported the protests, told the House of Commons.
On Sunday night, police began removing gas and fuel supplies at a logistics encampment set up by protesters after the city's mayor declared a state of emergency https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/protest-against-vaccine-mandates-paralyzing-canada-capital-mayor-says-2022-02-06 on Sunday.
A well-organized supply chain -- including portable saunas, a community kitchen and bouncy castles for children -- has sustained the protesters. It has relied partly on funding from sympathizers in the United States, police said.

Former U.S. President Donald Trump and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk have praised the truckers. 
Over the weekend, protests spilled over into other large Canadian cities, including the financial capital Toronto, and were met with counter demonstrations.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai was on hand on Tuesday to watch China's Eileen Gu as she won gold https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/freestyle-skiing-chinas-gu-wins-gold-medal-womens-big-air-2022-02-08 in the Big Air competition in Beijing to put the host nation at the top of the medals table. 
Peng, who could be seen in the stands wearing a black knit hat with the Olympic rings on them and a black coat with the Chinese flag, acknowledged a greeting from a journalist but declined to answer questions as she left the venue.
Peng's well-being became a matter of global concern when she appeared to allege https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-tennis-star-peng-says-ex-vice-premier-forced-her-into-sex-2021-11-03 on social media in November that a former Chinese vice premier, Zhang Gaoli, had sexually assaulted her in the past. After that post, which was quickly removed, she disappeared from public view for nearly three weeks.
During Tuesday morning's competition she was seated among Olympic athletes and delegation members from several countries next to the finish area at Big Air Shougang, the distinctive venue built on the site of a former steel mill.
International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach visited with members of the group including Peng during the competition.
""I just met her, she was here sitting in the stadium,"" Bach told Reuters.
""She was among the athletes, and I had the opportunity to meet with a number of athletes from Switzerland and from Germany and the U.S."", he said.
A three-time Olympian, Peng's presence during the Games had been a matter of speculation since the IOC said it planned to meet with her in Beijing. The IOC, which had said last week that Peng would meet with Bach inside the Olympic bubble, said previously that Peng had attended a curling competition.
Bach said Peng would soon be leaving the ""closed loop"", which separates Olympic competitors and related personnel from the Chinese public to prevent the spread of COVID-19. 
""She was sitting there and we had the opportunity to talk and now she has to go to the quarantine, she told me, she will leave now the closed loop,"" Bach said.
Peng has said little since her initial social media post and discussion of the scandal has been heavily censored in China's tightly controlled cyberspace, with searches for Peng's name on Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) continuing to show no recent search results.
However, in an interview conducted on Sunday with French newspaper L'Equipe at a hotel inside the Olympic bubble in Beijing, Peng denied https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-tennis-player-peng-denies-making-accusation-sexual-assault-2022-02-07 she had accused anyone of sexual assault. 
The World Tennis Association, which suspended its tournaments in China following Peng's post, said on Monday that her denial of making the accusation had done little https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/wta-says-latest-peng-interview-does-not-ease-concerns-about-her-safety-2022-02-07 to address concerns about her safety.
The San Francisco-born Gu, China's biggest star at the Games, said she was glad to hear of Peng's presence on Tuesday.

""It's a big honour when athletes from different sports, you know, especially if more widely known sports like tennis come paying attention to smaller sports like free skiing, I think it gives us an amazing platform to hopefully spread our small sport to the rest of the world,"" Gu said.
""I'm really grateful that she's happy and healthy and out there doing her things again.""

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's Eileen Gu got her maiden Olympics off to a dream start as the U.S. born teenager landed a tricky jump to become the first freeski Big Air champion at the Beijing Games, taking the host country to the top of the medals table on Tuesday.
With the Shougang steel mill in the backdrop, Gu landed in the final run a 1620, a trick only Tess Ledeux had achieved in competition before. The Frenchwoman settled for silver.
Ledeux was leading after two runs but pressure got to the Big Air World Cup leader and she struggled on her final jump, ending up in tears while the crowds erupted in cheers for Gu.
Swiss Mathilde Gremaud took the bronze, unable to turn things around in the final run as she crashed.
""I've never done the 16 before, I haven't really prepared for it that much either,"" the 18-year-old Gu said. 
""I think I did two days on the airbag but I've spent a lot of hours visualizing it if that counts. Generally I've visualized for about an hour and a half before bed every day.
""Tess inspired me a lot with this jump. So even if she may be sad, this gold medal also belongs to her.""
Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai, wearing a black knit hat with the Olympic rings on them, watched and waved from the stands as Gu won the Big Air gold.
It first appeared that Gu, a fashion model and incoming Stanford University student, still had a lot to learn when 'Air France' Ledeux landed her double cork 1620 in the first run.
The 20-year-old Frenchwoman, a three-time Winter X Games winner in Big Air, had a combined best of 187.50 after the first two runs. Gremaud was second on 182.50 and Gu was third on 182.25.
Already assured of a podium finish, Gu went for Ledeux's double cork 1620 and achieved it, holding her head in disbelief in the finish area under the eyes of her mother.
""So my mum called me before my last jump and she told me not to do the 16. She told me to do the right 14 again and to see if I could do it better. But I kind of was adamant that I wanted to do the left 16,"" said Gu, whose phone screen saver has been a gold medal for months.
Despite an imperfect landing, she scored 94.50 - Ledeux's score in the first run, which took Gu's tally up to 188.25 and earned her a 0.75 final advantage over the Frenchwoman.
""She has been skiing for a long time but she is new on the big stage. What she's been doing is incredible,"" said Gremaud.
Ledeux said Gu ""killed the game today"". ""It's competitive sport. I'm stoked with my silver medal.""
Gu, who has nearly two million followers on China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), will have more opportunities to increase her popularity as she participates in the slopestyle and halfpipe events in Beijing. 

Minutes after Gu won Big Air gold, eight of the top 10 searches on Weibo were related to her.
China have so far won three gold and two silver medals at the Winter Games, leading the medals tally, while Sweden is at second place with three golds.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said on Monday that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline would be halted if Russia invades Ukraine and stressed unity with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz as the West rallies to avert a war in Europe. 
At a White House press conference with the new German leader, Biden, a longtime opponent of the decade-old pipeline project https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-nordstream-idUKKBN2JY1SF to Germany from Russia, said Russian forces crossing into Ukraine would trigger a shutdown. 
""If Russia invades, that means tanks or troops crossing the ... border of Ukraine again, then there will be ... no longer a Nord Stream 2. We, we will bring an end to it,"" Biden said. Asked how, given the project is in German control, Biden said: ""I promise you, we'll be able to do it.""
Scholz said the United States and Germany had the same approach to Ukraine, to Russia and to sanctions, but did not directly confirm the Nord Stream 2 plans or mention the pipeline publicly by name over the course of his day-long visit.
Whether the United States and Germany are on the same page over the $11 billion project has become a crucial question as the two major democracies lead NATO allies in pushback against Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Russia has amassed some 100,000 troops near the Ukraine border. It denies it is planning an invasion. U.S. officials say an attack could occur within days or weeks.
Scholz, under fire at home and abroad for what has been seen as insufficient leadership in the crisis, told reporters Russia would pay a very high price if it invaded Ukraine and said Germany and the United States had the same approach.
""We will be united. We will act together. And we will take all the necessary steps,"" Scholz said in English.
Even before the pipeline starts flowing, Germany uses Russian gas to cover half its needs. It delayed approval of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline until at least the second half of 2022, but has refused to cancel the nearly completed project. 'OFF RAMP' FOR PUTIN? 
Biden and Scholz emphasized that they preferred diplomacy as a solution to the Ukraine conflict. 
Asked if Russia still had an ""off ramp"" from any crisis, Biden said yes.
Scholz, whose popularity has plunged 17 percentage points in recent weeks as tensions ratcheted up with Moscow, is due to visit both Ukraine and Russia next week, after meetings this week with Biden, European Union officials and the heads of Baltic states.
The Biden-Scholz relationship could be pivotal at a time when French President Emmanuel Macron has yet to declare if he will run in an election in three months, and while British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is engulfed in a domestic crisis.
On Monday, Macron met with Putin and told the Russian leader https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-plays-down-hope-breakthrough-ahead-macron-putin-talks-2022-02-07 he seeks to avoid war and build trust.
Scholz also met with key lawmakers on both sides of the aisle on Monday evening, including top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell.
Biden said he had no doubts about Germany's reliability as a partner and said Scholz had the United States' complete trust. ""There is no doubt about Germany's partnership with the United States. None,"" Biden said.
Biden and U.S. officials emphasized that Germany was the second largest donor of non-military assistance to Kyiv after the United States, and that they were planning sanctions against Russia together. 
Details of the sanctions package are still being finalized, but banning Russia from the SWIFT financial transaction system remains an option, a U.S. official said.

Steven Sokol, president of the American Council on Germany, said Scholz needed to clarify Germany's position on Nord Stream 2 and show more ""creativity"" in providing assistance to Ukraine, short of sending in weapons.
""Germany has to understand that if it wants to be more of a player on the world stage and carry more responsibility, then with that comes taking more action,"" Sokol said. ""In order to be a leader, Germany has to do more.""

The French leader travelled to Moscow for talks amid an East-West standoff over a Russian military buildup near Ukraine and a Kremlin campaign for security ""guarantees"" from Washington that would include a halt to NATO expansion. 
In a joint news conference after the talks, Putin said that a number of Macron's ideas concerning security were realistic and that the two would talk again once Macron had travelled to Kyiv to meet Ukraine's leadership. 
""A number of his ideas, proposals, which are probably still too early to talk about, I think it is quite possible to make the basis of our further joint steps,"" he said.

(Reuters) - A federal judge ordered the U.S. government to pay slightly more than $230 million to survivors and family members of victims of a 2017 mass shooting at a Texas church that killed 26 people.
U.S. District Judge Xavier Rodriguez ruled seven months after finding the government 60% responsible https://www.reuters.com/world/us/judge-finds-us-government-60-responsible-2017-texas-church-mass-shooting-2021-07-07 for the Nov. 5, 2017, massacre by former Air Force airman Devin Patrick Kelley at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas.
""The losses and pain these families have experienced is immeasurable,"" wrote Rodriguez, who works in San Antonio, Texas.
Kelley, whom the judge found 40% responsible, used firearms he should not have been allowed to buy after admitting in a 2012 court martial to domestic assault. The Air Force had failed to enter that plea in a database used for background checks.
In addition to those killed, 22 people were injured when Kelley, 26, dressed in black and wearing a skull mask, opened fire at a Sunday service at the church, 31 miles (50 km) east of San Antonio.
He later died of a self-inflicted gunshot to the head following a police chase.
In his 185-page decision, Rodriguez rejected what he called the government's effort to ""obfuscate its responsibility"" by adopting a ""no-fault"" approach to damages similar to that used to compensate victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
Monday's decision covered about 80 claimants, most of whom were awarded money.

A spokeswoman for the Air Force said it was aware of the awards and reviewing the decision.
In December 2018, a government report said the Air Force had missed six chances to alert law enforcement about Kelley's history of domestic abuse.

Atlanta (Reuters) -The first round of jury selection ended late Monday with 52 potential jurists interviewed in the U.S. federal hate-crimes trial of the three white men who murdered Ahmaud Arbery, a Black jogger who was chased and shot while running through a mostly white Georgia neighborhood.
The final panel seated will be asked to decide whether racial animus drove the defendants to fatally pursue Arbery in the Satilla Shores neighborhood in coastal Georgia in February 2020. Gregory McMichael, 66, his son Travis McMichael, 36, and neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52, were convicted of murder in an earlier state trial.
A state judge sentenced the men to life in prison, ruling that the two McMichaels would not be eligible for parole, after a jury of one Black man and 11 white men and women rejected the men's self-defense claims in November.
It took three weeks to seat the state court jury.
Jury selection in the federal trial, which the U.S. District Court in Brunswick (NYSE:BC), comes shortly after Gregory and Travis McMichael offered to plead guilty to the hate-crime charges in agreements with prosecutors that were later scrapped..
Selecting a jury to hear the case will be complicated by the publicity that surrounded both the murder and the earlier trial, said Julie Campanini, a jury consultant with Magna Legal Services based in Philadelphia.
""Potential jurors might have firm opinions,"" she said. ""That doesn't disqualify them though. The test is whether they can set that aside and decide the case only on the evidence presented.""
The McMichaels nearly avoided the federal trial by entering into a plea deal with prosecutors.
At a hearing last week, Travis McMichael said he was willing to admit to trying to apprehend Arbery because of his ""race and color"" as part of the plea agreement.
But he changed his mind after U.S. District Judge Lisa Wood rejected that agreement. She said she would not accept it because it bound her to a fixed sentence: 30 years in federal prison before he would be handed back to the state of Georgia to serve out the rest of his life sentence for murder.
Gregory McMichael had reached a similar plea agreement with prosecutors, but also withdrew from it.
The family of Arbery decried the potential plea deal, saying that they will only get full justice with this second trial.
""We want the world to see a trial, see why these men did what they did,"" Arbery's father said in an interview with Reuters.
The men are charged in federal court with using threatening force to interfere with Arbery's rights on the basis of race, a hate crime. The charge carries a maximum of life in prison.
The three are additionally charged with attempted kidnapping, and the McMichaels face gun charges.
Judge Wood said in court that she plans to call 50 potential jurors a day, drawn from 43 south Georgia counties, until a panel of 12 jurors and four alternates are found.
There were 52 potential jurists interviewed Monday and of that, 30 were told to come back to court next week for the next round of selection, with the court's goal to ultimately seat 12 jurors and four alternates.

Campanini said that the court could struggle to call 50 people every day, given there are three sets of defense attorneys, as well as the prosecution, all of whom could possibly interview each potential juror.
""They'll seat a jury, but don't count on it being quick,"" she said. ""It will take a significant about of time.""

Russia put sanctions under the spotlight at the U.N. Security Council as part of its presidency of the 15-member body during February. However, Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia could not chair the meeting because he tested positive for COVID-19, diplomats said.
""We call on DPRK to demonstrate a commitment to the wellbeing of its own people by respecting human rights, defunding its unlawful WMD (weapons of mass destruction) and ballistic missiles program, and prioritizing the needs of its own people – the vulnerable North Koreans,"" said the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield.
North Korea's formal name is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
In November, Russia and China revived a 2019 push to ease U.N. sanctions on North Korea in what they described as a bid to improve the humanitarian situation. The move found little support or engagement among council members, so China and Russia have not put it to a vote.
""If the council were to think of ordinary Koreans and not merely geopolitics then this proposal warrants support,"" Deputy Russian U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy told the council. ""We believe firmly that the Security Council sanctions apparatus requires a strong dose of humanization.""
North Korea's humanitarian situation ""continues to worsen,"" according to an excerpt https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/exclusive-nkorea-grows-nuclear-missiles-programs-profits-cyberattacks-un-report-2022-02-05 of a confidential U.N. report seen on Saturday by Reuters. The report said that was probably mainly due to Pyongyang's COVID-19 blockade.

Russia and China also both used the council meeting on Monday to blast unilateral sanctions, without naming names. China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun said of such countries: ""They have been flinging them about left, right, and center in a frenzy, so much so that they seem to be addicted.""
Thomas-Greenfield said she was concerned by attempts ""to criticize and delegitimize"" unilateral sanctions as unlawful and that the United States categorically rejects that position.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will aim with a trip to the Pacific this week to remind the world that Washington's strategic long-term focus remains with the Asia-Pacific region despite an escalating crisis with Russia over Ukraine.
Blinken departs on Monday for Australia, Fiji and Hawaii for a week-long trip and meetings with key allies, aiming to reaffirm a commitment to push back against what the United States calls China's growing economic and military ""coercion.""
The trip's highlights include a meeting of the informal grouping of Australia, India, Japan and the United States known as the Quad, diplomatic efforts regarding North Korea and discussions on the concerns of Pacific Islands states where U.S. officials believe China wants to establish bases.
U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price was asked at a briefing on Monday whether Blinken had considered cancelling the trip given the Ukraine crisis. Price replied that the United States is capable of ""walking and chewing gum at the same time.""
Price nevertheless said Blinken would be ""focused to a large degree"" on the Ukraine crisis.
""We are a big country. We are a big department. We have a lot of challenges on our plate,"" Price said, adding that Blinken would remain in contact with his U.S. government counterparts on the Ukraine issue during the trip.
Blinken's trip comes days after China and Russia declared a ""no limits"" strategic partnership https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-china-tell-nato-stop-expansion-moscow-backs-beijing-taiwan-2022-02-04 - their most detailed and assertive statement to work together - and against the United States - to build a new international order based on their own interpretations of human rights and democracy. 
Daniel Kritenbrink, the State Department's top diplomat for East Asia, chided Chinese President Xi Jinping when briefing journalists on Blinken's trip, saying Xi's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday should have been an opportunity to encourage de-escalation of Ukraine tensions.
China and Russia pledged mutual protection of core interests - an apparent reference to Russia and Ukraine as well as Taiwan, a self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its own. Their joint statement also denounced U.S. moves to counter China through AUKUS, a pact under which the United States and Britain will provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines.
'MAINTAIN FOCUS'
U.S.-Chinese ties are at their lowest point in decades as the world's top two economies disagree on issues ranging from Hong Kong to the South China Sea and China's treatment of ethnic Muslims. Russia's potential invasion of Ukraine, the most serious threat of a major conflict in Europe since the Cold War's end, only complicates matters. 
Charles Edel, an expert on Asia and Australia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said Blinken's trip ""underscores just how important - and how challenging - it is for Washington to maintain focus on the Indo-Pacific.""
Meeting in Melbourne, the Quad countries are expected to discuss how to further goals including climate policy and providing COVID-19 vaccines to Southeast Asia ahead of an expected May summit in Japan that President Joe Biden plans to attend.
In meetings with Fiji's prime minister and Pacific Island leaders, climate policy and the security challenge posed by China are expected to be front and center. 
""The speed and extent of China's outreach to the Pacific Islands has served as a wakeup call,"" said Daniel Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia under former President Barack Obama.
Lawmakers from the Pacific Island republic of Kiribati said last year China had drawn up plans to upgrade an airstrip on one its remote islands about 1,860 miles (3,000 km) from Hawaii. This would offer China a foothold deep in territory firmly aligned with the United States and its allies since World War Two.
The United States has said the AUKUS pact and expanding Quad cooperation show its Indo-Pacific commitment. Analysts have said former President Donald Trump's withdrawal from a trade framework now known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) undercuts U.S. engagement with a region where many countries count China as their main trading partner.

Biden told Asian leaders in October that the United States would launch talks on a new Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, but few details have emerged and his administration has been reluctant to offer the increased market access Asian countries desire, seeing this as threatening American jobs.
In Hawaii, Blinken will host Japanese and South Korean counterparts for discussions expected to center on North Korea, which has conducted a slew of missile launches this year, raising fears it may return to testing intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear bombs for the first time since 2017.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -French President Emmanuel Macron, the top Western leader to visit Moscow since Russia began massing troops on the border with Ukraine, told Vladimir Putin at the start of talks in the Kremlin on Monday that he aimed to avoid war and build trust.
Macron, who is expected to seek re-election in April, has positioned himself as a potential mediator on Ukraine, with Paris voicing scepticism about predictions by Washington and other Western capitals that a Russian assault is imminent.
Macron told the Russian president he was seeking a ""useful"" response ""that of course allows us to avoid war and to build bricks of trust, stability, visibility"". Putin, for his part, said Russia and France shared ""a common concern about what is happening in the security sphere in Europe"".
""I see how much efforts the current leadership of France and the president personally is applying in order to solve the crisis related to providing equal security in Europe for a serious historical perspective,"" Putin said.
On the eve of his trip, Macron, who is also due in Kyiv on Tuesday, told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper: ""The geopolitical objective of Russia today is clearly not Ukraine, but to clarify the rules of cohabitation with NATO and the EU.""
On his arrival, Macron told reporters: ""I'm reasonably optimistic but I don't believe in spontaneous miracles.""
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said ahead of the talks: ""The situation is too complex to expect decisive breakthroughs in the course of one meeting.""
In Washington, U.S. President Joe Biden said as he hosted German Chancellor Olaf Scholz that they were ""working in lockstep"" to address the crisis. 
Russia has deployed more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders. It denies planning an invasion, but says it is ready to take unspecified ""military-technical measures"" if its demands are not met, including a promise by NATO never to admit Ukraine and to withdraw some troops from Eastern Europe.
Washington has rejected those demands but says it is willing to talk about arms control and confidence-building steps, which Moscow says are beside the point.
""In recent days there has been nothing new on the topic of security guarantees for Russia. Our Western interlocutors prefer not to mention this topic,"" Peskov said.
The United States and its allies have ruled out defending Ukraine with military force but say they would respond to any invasion with sanctions, arms shipments and reinforcement of NATO countries nearby.
Last week Biden ordered nearly 3,000 U.S. troops to deploy in Poland and Romania to better protect NATO's eastern flank. A U.S. general arrived in Poland on Saturday and the bulk of the new forces due there were expected on Monday.
Germany announced on Monday it would deploy 350 troops to Lithuania to reinforce a NATO battle group there.
Russian-backed separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine warned that a full-scale war https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/separatist-leader-says-full-scale-war-east-ukraine-could-break-out-any-time-2022-02-07 could break out there and urged Moscow https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/exclusive-senior-separatist-urges-russia-send-30000-troops-east-ukraine-2022-02-07 to send 30,000 soldiers to reinforce rebel forces. Kyiv says 15,000 people have been killed in fighting between government forces and separatists in the breakaway Donetsk region since 2014. 
'DEFENSIVE ALLIANCE'
In London, a spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Russian concerns about potential NATO aggression were ""fundamentally unfounded as NATO is a defensive alliance at its heart"". He said Britain wanted to work with Moscow to provide it with reassurance on that point.
Russia sees NATO's addition of 14 new east European members since the Cold War ended three decades ago as an encroachment on its sphere of influence and a threat to its security.
On her second visit to Kyiv in three weeks, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock promised unequivocal support, stressing that Germany was willing to pay a high economic price to contain Moscow.
Ukrainian officials have publicly criticised Berlin for refusing to sell defensive weapons to Kyiv and over its perceived reluctance to stop gas flowing through the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia if Moscow launches an attack. 
European countries are heavily reliant on Russian energy, high prices for which are already fuelling inflation. European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde warned last week of ""geopolitical clouds"" https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/ukraine-clouds-horizon-europes-economy-2022-02-07 over the European economy. 
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said ""a frank conversation"" with Baerbock about weapons had found ""both common ground and a draft solution"" but did not give details. 
Germany has ruled out sending lethal weapons for historical reasons arising from its role in the 20th Century world wars. Kyiv's mayor last month derided https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-germany-idCAKBN2K01DZ an offer of 5,000 military helmets as ""a joke"".
Biden, a long-time opponent of Nord Stream 2, will make clear in his meeting with Scholz that the pipeline will not move forward if ""Russia invades Ukraine in one way or another"", a U.S. official said. 
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said meanwhile the United States and European Union were working to protect European energy supplies against shocks stemming from the crisis. 

Scholz, who took office after 16 years of Angela Merkel's leadership, has been criticised for showing insufficient leadership in the crisis. 
He told reporters the West would act swiftly, decisively and in unity if Russia invades Ukraine, adding: ""There will be a very high price to pay if Ukraine is attacked militarily.""

639,"<span>Feb 07, 2022 01:50PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -The Black former president of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBTQ advocacy group in the United States, sued the organization on Thursday, accusing it of racial discrimination in his firing last year.
Alphonso David was fired https://www.reuters.com/world/us/alphonso-david-fired-human-rights-campaign-president-cuomo-advice-nyt-2021-09-07 on Sept. 6 after New York state Attorney General Letitia James issued a report saying he had advised former Governor Andrew Cuomo about dealing with sexual harassment allegations, the organization's board said then.
The civil rights attorney filed his lawsuit in federal court in Brooklyn.
David, who said in his lawsuit that he was the 40-year-old group's first Black president, had held the post for two years. The Washington-based nonprofit group advocates for equal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people (LGBTQ).
“Today, I am filing a lawsuit for the millions of Black and Brown people who face discrimination every day but fear retaliation or lack the resources to challenge it,” David said in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post. 
The Human Rights Campaign's interim president, Joni Madison, said in a statement that David's actions in assisting Cuomo’s team in responding to allegations of sexual harassment were, among other things, in violation of the organization's conflict of interest policy and its mission. 
""Mr. David’s complaint is riddled with untruths. We are confident through the legal process that it will be apparent that Mr. David’s termination was based on clear violations of his contract and HRC’s mission, and as president of HRC, he was treated fairly and equally,"" Madison said. 
In a copy of the complaint he posted on Twitter, David said the organization had a ""deserved reputation for unequal treatment"" of its nonwhite employees. He said the Human Rights Campaign's own employees had described it as a ""White Men’s Club"" where nonwhite staffers were marginalized, tokenized, and denied advancement to high-level positions.
According to the complaint, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) renewed David's contract for five more years in August and gave him a 30% raise. During contract renewal negotiations, the lawsuit said, board members told David he was underpaid compared with his white predecessor because of his race. 
The complaint also described an instance in which a white board member told the HRC president to stop mentioning race in public comments and said David regularly received pushback from senior colleagues on issues involving race.
The organization said that some of the individuals David accuses of discriminatory behavior are people of color and champions of racial equity and inclusion. Also, the organization's executive committees, constituted of independent directors, were comprised of seven individuals, five of whom are Black, it said.
Before serving as the group's president, David worked as counsel to then-Governor Cuomo.
In the lawsuit, David said that after he was interviewed over his involvement in Cuomo's handling of sexual harassment allegations, board members asked him to resign. He said that after he refused, he was terminated. 
At the time, the co-chairs of HRC's board, Morgan Cox and Jodie Patterson, said his assistance of Cuomo's staff had violated the group's mission and accused him of making false statements. 
The report by New York Attorney General James described allegations of sexual harassment by Cuomo, and efforts by his aides to retaliate against the then-governor's accusers. 

David was identified in the report as having been involved in efforts to undermine Cuomo's first accuser, Lindsey Boylan.
Cuomo stepped down as governor in August after a state investigation concluded that he sexually harassed women who worked for him, including a state trooper. He at times expressed regret for making young women uncomfortable, but denied criminal wrongdoing and said it was ""unfair"" he had to resign.

(Reuters) - A second person charged in a plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer in 2020 has agreed to plead guilty and testify at a trial in March, according to a federal court filing on Monday.
Kaleb Franks, 27, will plead guilty to kidnapping conspiracy, in a plea deal approved by prosecutors and his lawyers. The charge carries a sentence of up to life in prison.
Franks is scheduled to stand trial in March in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan alongside four others charged in the case and will admit to conspiring from June 2020 to October 2020 to kidnap Whitmer, a Democrat. 
In August last year, another man who pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the plot received a sentence of just over six years in prison, after he also agreed to testify against fellow extremists in the ""Wolverine Watchmen"" militia who were accused in the conspiracy.
Ty Garbin was the first to be convicted of scheming to abduct Whitmer from her vacation home. Since the FBI said it uncovered the conspiracy by members of the militia group, more than a dozen men have been charged in state or federal court.
Prosecutors said the suspected participants in the plot sought Whitmer's capture in retribution for wide-ranging public health orders imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Violent threats have become an increasing factor in American politics, ranging from the hundreds of people who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, trying to overturn then-president Donald Trump's November 2020 election defeat, to phone threats made to election workers.

Whitmer, who served as a co-chair of Joe Biden's presidential campaign, has previously accused Republican Trump of hyping up far-right groups as he denounced COVID mitigation efforts that were carried out in states run by Democrats.

DONETSK, Ukraine (Reuters) - An influential separatist commander in eastern Ukraine has urged Russia to send 30,000 soldiers to reinforce rebel forces fighting in the breakaway Donetsk region and to operate new weapons systems he hopes Russia will supply.
The Kremlin did not immediately respond when asked to comment on the request by Alexander Khodakovsky, a former political leader in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic who now oversees a military unit.
The deployment of 30,000 Russian soldiers would further increase tensions between the West and Moscow over a Russian troop build-up near Ukraine.
Khodakovsky said he thought separatist forces would be defeated if they faced a major offensive by Ukrainian government forces in a conflict that began in 2014, and urged Russia to send Grad and Uragan multiple rocket launcher systems.
Russia's ruling United Russia party, which backs President Vladimir Putin, has said the forces of Donetsk and Luhansk, an adjacent breakaway republic, need more weapons. 
But the Kremlin has not yet committed one way or the other on the idea of military aid and has played down the call to recognise the breakaway regions as it tries to negotiate security guarantees with the West in the standoff over Ukraine.
Khodakovsky said the Donetsk separatists had 30,000 fighters of their own, but only 10,000 were fit for frontline duties. 
""We need to have at least 40,000, but 40,000 with automatic rifles on the frontline,"" Khodakovsky told Reuters in an interview, making clear his request was for 30,000 soldiers in addition to the 10,000 already deemed capable of frontline duties. 
He welcomed an appeal by Andrey Turchak, a senior United Russia member, to send armaments to the separatist regions but said specialists would also be needed to operate such ""complex systems"". 
""I would like to see Russian military units that can use this weaponry,"" he said. 
Over 700,000 Russian passports have been issued to residents of eastern Ukraine since separatists seized territory there in 2014. Russia's parliament is set to discuss making an appeal Putin to recognise the breakaway areas as independent states. 
Kyiv has denied allegations by Moscow that Ukraine could launch an attack to take back control of the two regions and has accused Russia of supporting the separatists with covert forces, something Moscow denies.
Khodakovsky said the majority of rebel troops did not want more fighting and did not want the conflict, in which more than 14,000 people have been killed, to be settled militarily. 

""There remains in their minds the understanding that they are, after all, fighting their own people,"" he said. 
He said Russia would raise morale among separatist forces and deter Ukraine by openly sending clearly marked Russian units to the breakaway regions, and that it was now only a matter of time before Russia formally recognised their independence.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Israel announced it was setting up a national inquiry on Monday after a newspaper reported illicit use by police of powerful spyware against confidants of former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other public figures. 
Pegasus, a cellphone hacking tool made by Israel's NSO Group, was used to ""phish for intelligence even before any investigation had been opened against the targets, and without judicial warrants"", Calcalist said in an unsourced report.
The furore has added a domestic angle to allegations that surfaced last year of misuse of Pegasus by foreign clients against journalists, rights activists and other figures, which prompted the Israeli government to order export reviews.
NSO says all its sales are government-authorised and that it does not itself run Pegasus. 
Calcalist said targets in Israel included a son of and two aides to Netanyahu - who is on trial on corruption charges he denies - as well as a co-defendant and several witnesses, and, separately, two former officials suspected in leaks to journalists.
The court hearing the case against Netanyahu said it was cancelling the next session, scheduled for Tuesday, and would await answers from the prosecution about the hacking allegations before deciding whether proceedings would resume on Wednesday.
Omer Barlev, the minister for police, said he was setting up a cabinet-level commission of inquiry, drawing calls from some colleagues in the government for a more independent probe.
Prime Minister Naftali Bennett called the allegations against the police ""very serious, if true"".

Pegasus, he said in a statement, was ""not intended to be used in phishing campaigns targeting the Israeli public or officials, which is why we need to understand exactly what happened"".
Calling for some police to face criminal investigation, Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz said: ""Those who turned a blind eye to this activity abroad, must now deal with it here.""

LONDON (Reuters) -Prince Charles on Sunday thanked his mother Queen Elizabeth for publicly stating her desire that his wife Camilla becomes Queen Consort when he becomes king, acknowledging the honour on the 70th anniversary of her accession to the British throne.
The request - a blessing that will likely remove the need for any discussion about future titles - follows an earlier era when Camilla was vilified by the tabloid press for the breakdown of Charles' marriage to his first wife, the late Princess Diana. 
The 95-year-old queen said it was her ""sincere wish"" that when the day comes, Camilla would be known as Queen Consort. 
Charles made his response on Sunday when he led tributes from world and religious leaders to the monarch as she passed a milestone never reached by any of her predecessors in nearly 1,000 years of a line that traces its origin back to Norman King William I and his 1066 conquest of England. 
""We are deeply conscious of the honour represented by my mother's wish,"" Charles said in a statement. ""As we have sought together to serve and support Her Majesty and the people of our communities, my darling wife has been my own steadfast support throughout.""
The long-time lovers were married in 2005, enabling Camilla to gradually take on a more prominent role. With a current title of Duchess of Cornwall, Camilla is now a popular member of the royal family and regularly appears at official duties alongside the queen, Charles and his son, William, and wife Kate.
Diana, the mother of Princes William and Harry, died in a Paris car crash in 1997. 
The statement on the future of the monarchy comes as the country celebrates the queen's role over the last 70 years. Britain will hold four days of national events in June to mark her platinum jubilee.
Charles was joined by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the White House, the Archbishop of Canterbury and other politicians in praising the queen for her dedication to public service. 
""Throughout the past 70 years, she has strengthened the ties of friendship, shared ideals, and faith in democracy that forever unite our countries,"" the White House of President Joe Biden said.
HUGE CHANGE
During her seven decades on the throne, the queen has been a symbol of stability for the country during huge social, economic and political change https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/queen-elizabeths-reign-second-golden-age-britain-2022-02-03, including the end of the British Empire.
But her anniversary comes after a very difficult time https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/royal-crown-slips-elizabeth-prepares-mark-70-years-queen-2022-01-25 for the monarchy, following the sex abuse accusations her son Prince Andrew is facing in the United States, which he denies, and allegations of racism in the royal household from grandson Prince Harry and his wife Meghan. 
Elizabeth became the queen of Britain and more than a dozen other realms including Canada, Australia and New Zealand on the death of her father King George VI on Feb. 6, 1952, while she was in Kenya on an international tour aged 25.
The news was broken to her by her husband Prince Philip, who died last year aged 99 after more than 70 years by her side.
When she ascended the throne, Josef Stalin, Mao Zedong and Harry Truman were running the Soviet Union, China and the United States, respectively, while Winston Churchill was British prime minister. 
The queen has continued to carry out official duties well into her 90s, but has been seen much less regularly of late after she spent a night in hospital last October for an unspecified ailment and was then instructed by doctors to rest.

On Sunday, the palace released a new video of the queen, smiling broadly near a red despatch box that contains official government paperwork and discussing a message from Biden. On Saturday she was filmed meeting local community groups and joking with officials. 
""I think I might just put a knife in it,"" she said when presented with a large cake. ""Somebody else can do the rest.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron flies to Moscow on Monday in bid to persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to dial down tensions with Ukraine, where Western powers fear the Kremlin plans an invasion.
Moscow gave the visit a guarded welcome, saying it would listen to Macron's ideas, but played down expectations of a breakthrough. 
Russia has deployed more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders. It denies planning an invasion, but says it could take unspecified military measures if its demands are not met, including a promise by NATO never to admit Kyiv.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was aware of Macron's plans to ease tensions. But he added: ""The situation is too complex to expect decisive breakthroughs in the course of one meeting.""
""In recent days there has been nothing new on the topic of security guarantees for Russia, our Western interlocutors prefer not to mention this topic,"" Peskov added.
Macron phoned Western allies, Putin and Ukraine's leader ahead of the visit, and will follow up on Tuesday with a trip to Kyiv, staking a lot of political capital on a mission that could prove embarrassing if he returns empty-handed.
""We have to be very realistic,"" Macron told the Journal du Dimanche in an interview in the build-up to the mission. 
""We will not obtain unilateral gestures, but it is essential to prevent a deterioration of the situation before building mechanisms and reciprocal gestures of trust.""
Two sources close to Macron said one aim of his visit was to buy time and freeze the situation for several months, at least until a ""Super April"" of elections in Europe - in Hungary, Slovenia and, crucially for Macron, in France.
RED CARPETS, CONFRONTATIONS
The French leader, who has earned a reputation for highly publicised diplomatic forays since he took power in 2017, has tried to both cajole and confront Putin over the past five years.
Soon after his election, Macron rolled out the red carpet for Putin at the Palace of Versailles, but also used the visit to publicly decry Russian meddling during the election. Two years later, the pair met at the French president's summer residence. 
Eastern European countries who suffered decades under Soviet rule have criticized Macron's approach to Russia, leery of his talk of negotiating a ""new European security order"". 
To counter critics ahead of the trip and take on the mantle of European leadership in this crisis, Macron has been at pains to consult with other Western leaders, including Britain's Boris Johnson and U.S. President Joe Biden.
However, unlike in the previous Ukraine crisis in 2015 when then German chancellor Angela Merkel and former French President Francois Hollande travelled to the Kremlin together, Macron has not taken his German counterpart with him.
Olaf Scholz will be travelling to Kyiv and then Moscow next week. His foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, is in Kyiv on Monday to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and will visit the conflict area in eastern Ukraine on Tuesday.

The French president's visit to Moscow and Ukraine comes less than three months before a presidential election at home. His political advisers see a potential electoral dividend, although Macron has yet to announce whether he will run. 
""For the president, it's an opportunity to show his leadership in Europe. That he is above the fray,"" one French government source said.

(Reuters) - Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, was jogging through a mostly white neighborhood on Feb. 23, 2020, when he was chased by three white men in two trucks, and shot and killed about two miles (3.2 km) from his mother's house near Brunswick (NYSE:BC), Georgia. 
His killing sparked national outrage when cellphone video of the shooting emerged months later and the public learned that local authorities had declined to arrest his pursuers. 
The men who chased Arbery told police they thought he committed a crime and were trying to make a citizen's arrest. The men were all convicted in state court last year for murder and now face a federal hate-crimes trial.
WHO WAS AHMAUD ARBERY?
Ahmaud Marquez Arbery was a lifelong resident of the coastal, south Georgia city of Brunswick. He was known as ""Maud"" or ""Quez"" to his friends, and was the son of Marcus Arbery Sr. and Wanda Cooper-Jones. He had a big, easy smile and ran every day unless there was a drenching rain, his family said.
Arbery worked long hours at a truck washing company and at his father's landscaping business. He'd frequently be seen by neighbors lifting weights in his mother's driveway or playing basketball. He often sang freestyle rap.
FOOTBALL DREAMS
Arbery was a former linebacker for his high school football team, the Brunswick Pirates. Despite lacking the typical heft of a linebacker, his speed and agility on the field made him a local star. He once dreamed of playing for the National Football League, but at 5-foot-10 (1.8 meters) he wasn't big enough, his family said.
His coach at Brunswick High School, where Arbery graduated in 2012, retired his football jersey, No. 21, in honor of the star player at a ceremony in 2020.
LEGAL TROUBLES
Arbery had a few brushes with the law, incidents that his family says he was putting behind him.
In 2013, a year after graduating from high school, he went back on campus to attend a basketball game and was found with a pistol in his waistband. He was given five years of probation.
In 2017, he was arrested for attempted shoplifting of a television from a local Walmart (NYSE:WMT). A judge extended the term of his original probation, which he was still serving when he died, court records show.
Defense attorneys wanted to tell the jury about those incidents, but the judge said no, ruling that the defendants could not have known anything about Arbery's legal troubles or probation status.
FUTURE

Apart from his football dreams, Arbery wanted to become an electrician, following in the footsteps of three of his uncles, his family said. 
Right after high school, he attended South Georgia Technical College for about a year and half but dropped out when money got tight. His aunt, Theawanza Brooks, said that Arbery had been saving up to continue his studies.

Ambassador Zhang Jun said in a statement on the embassy's website that China ""sternly refutes"" the ""unwarranted accusations"" made by U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield in an interview with CNN.
Zhang said that Dinigeer Yilamujiang, a cross country skier born in Xinjiang, is ""among the best"" of the 20 athletes from nine ethnic minorities competing for Team China at the Winter Games.
""She is the pride and excellent representative of the Chinese people. Where does the U.S.' inexplicable anger over this come from, and what intentions does it harbour?"" Zhang said.
Dinigeer was selected as one of the last two torchbearers at the opening ceremony. Many Western nations have imposed a diplomatic boycott of the Games over China's treatment of Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang.
U.N. experts and rights groups estimate more than a million people, mainly from the Uyghur and other Muslim minorities, have been detained in camps in Xinjiang since 2016.
China rejects accusations of abuse, describing the camps as vocational centres designed to combat extremism, and in late 2019 it said all people in the camps had ""graduated"".

International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams said on Saturday that Dinigeer was not chosen because of where she comes from.
Chinese organisers of the Games said the torchbearers who entered the stadium with the flame had been picked based on their birth dates, with each having been born in a different decade, starting from the 1950s through to the 2000s.

Biden has ordered nearly 3,000 troops to move to eastern Europe to protect the eastern flank of NATO from the possibility of a Russian attack on Ukraine. Russia, which has deployed more than 100,000 troops near the Ukrainian frontier, denies Western accusations that it is planning an invasion.
Around 1,700 service members, mainly from the 82nd Airborne Division based in Fort Bragg, are due to deploy to Poland, while 1,000 troops based in Germany will head east to Romania.

The commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, U.S. Army Major-General Christopher Donahue, arrived on Saturday, and a military source said most of the troops would arrive on Monday.
After two military transport planes could be seen landing at Rzeszow-Jasionka airport in southeastern Poland on Monday morning, an airport employee told Reuters three more were expected. A Polish military spokesperson said more planes were expected on Monday, but did not say how many.

DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran said on Monday that Washington had to make a ""political decision"" regarding lifting sanctions on the Islamic Republic as Tehran's demand for their full removal to revive a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers was non-negotiable. 
After eight rounds of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington since April, differences remain about the speed and scope of lifting sanctions on Tehran, including Iran’s demand for a U.S. guarantee of no further punitive steps, and how and when to restore curbs on Iran’s atomic work.
The talks paused on Jan. 28 as top negotiators returned to their respective capitals for consultations. U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley on Sunday said he would soon return to Vienna, insisting the pact could still be revived. 
""The issue of removal of sanctions and Iran benefiting from it is Iran's red line in the talks,"" Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Saeed Khatibzadeh told a weekly a news conference. 
""If the U.S. returns to Vienna with a political decision and a specific agenda ... to remove the sanctions, then surely it will be possible to reach a deal quickly."" 
Iran's lead nuclear negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani would return to Vienna on Tuesday, Khatibzadeh said. 
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration on Friday re-introduced sanctions waivers for Iran to allow international nuclear cooperation projects, as indirect American-Iranian talks on a 2015 international nuclear agreement with Tehran enter the final stretch.
""Washington has decided to take a step which has no impact on Iran's economic situation,"" Khatibzadeh said, echoing Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, who on Sunday described the U.S. move as a ""good but insufficient"" step. 
Iran has gradually violated nuclear limits of the nuclear pact in reaction to then-U.S. President Donald Trump's 2018 withdrawal from the agreement between Tehran and six powers and reimposing of crippling sanctions on Iran.
Iran insists on the immediate removal of all Trump-era sanctions in a verifiable process. Washington has said it would remove curbs inconsistent with the 2015 pact if Iran resumed compliance with the deal, implying it would leave in place others such as those imposed under terrorism or human rights measures. 

Khatibzadeh rejected warnings by Western officials that time is running out to resurrect the pact, given Tehran's nuclear advances.
""We do not consider any fake deadlines ... This round can be the last round if other parties fulfill their obligations and provide guarantees to Iran,"" he said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai has denied she ever accused anyone of sexual assault, adding that she herself had deleted her social media post in November that had appeared to make such a claim.
The well-being of Peng, a three-time Olympian, became a matter of global concern when she appeared to allege https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-tennis-star-peng-says-ex-vice-premier-forced-her-into-sex-2021-11-03 on social media that a former Chinese vice premier, Zhang Gaoli, had sexually assaulted her in the past.
In an interview with French newspaper L'Equipe at a hotel in Beijing, Peng denied she had made such allegations.
""In the text we could see in Europe, you accused someone of sexual assault. What did you really write? We don't understand,"" asked the paper.
""Sexual assault? I never said anyone had sexually assaulted me in any way,"" said Peng, without elaborating.
In her now-deleted post on China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), Peng had written ""why did you take me to your house and force me into having relations with you?"", though she also described the relationship with Zhang as an on-off one that was also consensual.
The post led the Women's Tennis Association to suspend tournaments https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/wta-suspends-tournaments-china-over-peng-shuai-situation-2021-12-01/#:~:text=BEIJING%2C%20Dec%202%20(Reuters),then%20disappeared%20from%20public%20view in China and caused an international outcry about her safety.
Discussion of the scandal has been heavily censored in China's tightly controlled cyberspace and searches for Peng's name on Weibo continue to show no recent search results.
Peng has not updated her Weibo account since the post was removed.
'HUGE MISUNDERSTANDING' 
Asked about the interview by Reuters on Monday, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said it was up to Peng to communicate her situation.
""We said what we had to say, the communication is up to her, it is her life, it is her story and this is why the communication is up to her,"" said Bach, who had dinner with Peng in Beijing on Saturday.
Peng told the French paper her social media post had caused a ""huge misunderstanding"", repeating comments https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/china-tennis-star-peng-denies-that-she-made-accusation-sexual-assault-2021-12-19 reported by a Singapore media outlet in December, and that she did not want ""any further media hype"" about it. 
""I'd like to say that feelings, sports and politics are three very distinct things. My lovelife problems, my personal life must not be mingled with sports and politics,"" she was quoted as saying. 
""And sports must not be politicised because when that happens, most of the time it means turning one's back on the Olympic spirit and it goes against the will of the sporting world and the athletes.""
The interview was conducted in Chinese and translated into English by a Chinese Olympic official during the interview, as well as an interpreter based in Paris, said the paper.
Questions were submitted in advance, and the paper agreed to publish Peng's responses without commentary, it said.
Peng, pictured wearing a red tracksuit top with the characters for China on it, also sought to allay fears over her safety, saying her life since November had been ""nothing special"". She denied she had ""disappeared"" after the furore when she was not seen in public for weeks. 
She also said she had not been aware of the worries expressed by the international community, such as the use of social media hashtag #WhereIsPengShuai by some of the world's top tennis players, including Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka, as she did not watch much foreign media news and could not read in English. 
The WTA, which said in December that Peng's appearances did not address its concerns about her wellbeing, did not immediately respond to a request for comments on her latest remarks.

In a statement on Monday, the IOC said Peng would attend several Olympics events. She also plans to travel to Europe after the pandemic and visit the IOC headquarters in Switzerland, it added.
Peng also said a previous knee injury that had required several rounds of surgery and her age made it unlikely she would compete professionally again. (This story refiles to fix typo in byline)

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - North Korea continued to develop its nuclear and ballistic missile programs during the past year and cyberattacks on cryptocurrency exchanges were an important revenue source for Pyongyang, according to an excerpt of a confidential United Nations report seen on Saturday by Reuters. 
The annual report by independent sanctions monitors was submitted on Friday evening to the U.N. Security Council North Korea sanctions committee. 
""Although no nuclear tests or launches of ICBMs (intercontinental ballistic missiles) were reported, DPRK continued to develop its capability for production of nuclear fissile materials,"" the experts wrote.
North Korea is formally known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). It has long-been banned from conducting nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches by the U.N. Security Council. 
""Maintenance and development of DPRK's nuclear and ballistic missile infrastructure continued, and DPRK continued to seek material, technology and know-how for these programs overseas, including through cyber means and joint scientific research,"" the report said.
Since 2006, North Korea has been subject to U.N. sanctions, which the Security Council has strengthened over the years in an effort to target funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
The sanctions monitors noted that there had been a ""marked acceleration"" of missile testing by Pyongyang. 
The United States and others said https://www.reuters.com/world/china/want-north-korea-breakthrough-china-tells-us-show-flexibility-2022-02-04 on Friday that North Korea had carried out nine ballistic missile launches in January, adding it was the largest number in a single month in the history of the country's weapons of mass destruction and missile programs.
""DPRK demonstrated increased capabilities for rapid deployment, wide mobility (including at sea), and improved resilience of its missile forces,"" the sanctions monitors said.
North Korea's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
CYBERATTACKS, ILLICIT TRADE
The monitors said ""cyberattacks, particularly on cryptocurrency assets, remain an important revenue source"" for North Korea and that they had received information that North Korean hackers continued to target financial institutions, cryptocurrency firms and exchanges.
""According to a member state, DPRK cyberactors stole more than $50 million between 2020 and mid-2021 from at least three cryptocurrency exchanges in North America, Europe and Asia,"" the report said. 
The monitors also cited a report last month by cybersecurity firm Chainalysis that said North Korea launched at least seven attacks on cryptocurrency platforms that extracted nearly $400 million worth of digital assets last year. 
In 2019, the U.N. sanctions monitors reported that North Korea had generated an estimated $2 billion for its weapons of mass destruction programs using widespread and increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.
The latest report said North Korea's strict blockade in response to the COVID-19 pandemic meant ""illicit trade, including in luxury goods, has largely ceased.""
Over the years the U.N. Security Council has banned North Korean exports including coal, iron, lead, textiles and seafood, and capped imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products.
""Although maritime exports from DPRK of coal increased in the second half of 2021, they were still at relatively low levels,"" the monitors said. 

""The quantity of illicit imports of refined petroleum increased sharply in the same period, but at a much lower level than in previous years,"" the report said. ""Direct delivery by non-DPRK tankers to DPRK has ceased, probably in response to COVID-19 measures: instead, only DPRK tankers delivered oil.""
North Korea's humanitarian situation ""continues to worsen,"" the report said. The monitors said that was probably due to the COVID-19 blockade, but that a lack of information from North Korea meant it was difficult to determine how much U.N. sanctions were unintentionally harming civilians.

MANILA (Reuters) -As frontrunner in the Philippines' presidential race, the son of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos appears poised to complete a remarkable rebranding of the family name 36 years after a ""people power"" uprising ended his father's autocratic rule.
    With official campaigning beginning on Tuesday, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., 64, holds a double-digit lead in the polls, three months ahead of the May 9 elections.
His push for the presidency has been aided by what political analysts say has been a decades-long public relations effort to alter public perception of his family and supporters. Critics accuse the Marcoses of attempting to rewrite history.
""What we are witnessing right now is nothing short of a counter-revolution,"" said Richard Heydarian, an author and academic who specialises in politics.
""The Marcoses are here to erase the 1986 (people power) revolution, and to restore the glory and fully rehabilitate the image of the Marcos regime.""
Since the family's return from exile in the 1990s, Marcos has served as governor and congressman of the northern Ilocos Norte province, his father's bailiwick, before winning a seat in the Senate in 2010. 
His sister is a senator and a former governor and former congresswoman, and his mother, Imelda, who ran unsuccessfully for president in 1992, was elected to Congress for four terms.
The return of a Marcos to Malacanang, the presidential palace, is unthinkable for millions of Filipinos, but over half the country's more than 60 million voters are 40 or under, and did not live through the Marcos regime and its oppression and plunder.
Ferdinand Marcos Sr., with Imelda by his side, was president for nearly two decades, ruling as a dictator before he was ousted in the ""people power"" uprising in 1986 that has become renowned around the world. 
Marcos Sr. and Imelda, known for her vast collection of artwork, jewellery and shoes, were accused of amassing more than $10 billion while he was in office.
    During his rule, 70,000 people were imprisoned, 34,000 were tortured, and 3,240 were killed, according to Amnesty International. 
    More than 11,100 victims of human rights abuses during the Marcos regime were paid compensation using millions from Marcos Swiss bank accounts, part of the family's ill-gotten wealth recovered by the government.
Among them was Loretta Ann Rosales, a political activist who was tortured and sexually abused during the Marcos regime and is now one of several complainants seeking to bar Marcos Jr. from the presidential race.
    ""We thought we had gotten rid of the Marcoses,"" said Rosales, who is also a former chairperson of the human rights commission. ""I want him disqualified.""
'LACK LEADERSHIP'
Marcos Jr. has questioned the Amnesty data and rejected long-standing narratives of oppression and failed government in his father's rule. He and his family have shunned questions about past atrocities and instead touted what their supporters claim as a 'golden age'.
The younger Marcos, also known as Bongbong, did not comment for this story. He has in the past spoken highly of his father, calling him his ""idol"", while expressing admiration for his ""style of work"", his qualities as a strong leader, and his ""love for the Filipino"" people, traits he said he has inherited.
    ""He had a very clear understanding of what needed to be done and how to do it, and that I think was his best quality as a leader,"" Bongbong Marcos said in a YouTube interview last year. ""The problem we have now is we lack leadership.""
    The YouTube interview titled 'The Greatest Lesson Bongbong Marcos Learned From His Father' has been viewed 13 million times since it aired in September.
    ""He is doing very well because we have this pandemic of disinformation,"" said Victor Manhit, an analyst with the Stratbase think tank. ""He has been dominating political discourse in social media.""
Fact-checking organisation Vera Files said in a December report that Marcos was the ""top beneficiary"" of disinformation online to spruce up his image while discrediting rivals ahead of the start of the official campaign period.
    ""Because you are surrounded on social media by the same account saying the same things about Marcos (Sr.) being a good leader - benevolent, revolutionary, all those narratives - even if it sounds bananas and not grounded on facts, you are more likely to believe it is true,"" said Marie Fatima Gaw, communications research professor at the University of the Philippines.    
Marcos has said he does not engage in negative campaigning.
    He lost the 2016 vice presidential race to human rights lawyer Leni Robredo, who is also contesting the presidency, along with boxing superstar Manny Pacquiao, Manila Mayor Francisco Domagoso, and senator Panfilo Lacson, among others.  

    For Raphie Respicio, 48, a tricycle driver and tour guide in the Marcos family bastion in Ilocos Norte, no amount of criticism against Marcos will weaken his support for the former senator.   
    ""He has done plenty of things here ... and he helped tricycle drivers earn a living through tourism,"" Respicio said. ""We are 100% for Bongbong.""

(Reuters) - Every day for the last three months, an average of six or seven families in Myanmar have posted notices in the country's state-owned newspapers cutting ties with sons, daughters, nieces, nephews and grandchildren who have publicly opposed the ruling military junta.
The notices started to appear in such numbers in November after the army, which seized power from Myanmar's democratically elected government a year ago, announced it would take over properties of its opponents and arrest people giving shelter to protesters. Scores of raids on homes followed. 
Lin Lin Bo Bo, a former car salesman who joined an armed group resisting military rule, was one of those disowned by his parents in about 570 notices reviewed by Reuters.
""We declare we have disowned Lin Lin Bo Bo because he never listened to his parents' will,"" said the notice posted by his parents, San Win and Tin Tin Soe, in state-owned newspaper The Mirror in November.
Speaking to Reuters from a Thai border town where he is living after fleeing Myanmar, the 26-year-old said his mother had told him she was disowning him after soldiers came to their family home searching for him. A few days later, he said he cried as he read the notice in the paper.
""My comrades tried to reassure me that it was inevitable for families to do that under pressure,"" he told Reuters. ""But I was so heartbroken."" 
Contacted by Reuters, his parents declined to comment.
Targeting families of opposition activists was a tactic used by Myanmar's military during unrest in 2007 and the late 1980s but has been used far more frequently since the Feb.1, 2021 coup, according to Wai Hnin Pwint Thon, senior advocacy officer at rights group Burma Campaign UK, which uses the old name for the former British colony. 
Publicly disowning family members, which has a long history in Myanmar's culture, is one way to respond, said Wai Hnin Pwint Thon, who said she was seeing more such notices in the press than in the past. 
""Family members are scared to be implicated in crimes,"" she said. ""They don't want to be arrested, and they don't want to be in trouble.""
A military spokesperson did not respond to Reuters questions for this story. Commenting on the notices in a news conference in November, military spokesperson Zaw Min Tun said that people who made such declarations in newspapers could still be charged if found to be supporting opposition to the junta. 
VIOLENT CRACKDOWN 
Hundreds of thousands of people in Myanmar, many of them young, took to the streets to protest the coup a year ago. After a violent crackdown on demonstrations by the army, some protesters fled overseas or joined armed groups in remote parts of the country. Known as People's Defence Forces, these groups are broadly aligned with the deposed civilian government.
Over the past year, security forces have killed about 1,500 people, many of them demonstrators, and arrested nearly 12,000 people, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a monitoring group. The military has said those figures are exaggerated.
Journalist So Pyay Aung told Reuters he filmed riot police using batons and shields to break up protests and livestreamed the video on the Democratic Voice of Burma, a news website. After authorities came searching for him, he said he hid in different locations in Myanmar before fleeing to Thailand with his wife and infant daughter. He was disowned by his father in November.
""I declare I am disowning my son because he did unforgivable activities against his parents' wills. I will not have any responsibilities related to him,"" said a notice posted by his father, Tin Aung Ko, in the state-owned Myanma Alinn newspaper. 
""When I saw the newspaper that mentioned cutting ties with me, I felt a little sad,"" So Pyay Aung told Reuters. ""But I understand that my parents had fears of pressure. They might have worries of their house being seized or getting arrested.""
His father, Tin Aung Ko, declined to comment. 
Two parents who disowned their children in similar notices, who asked not to be named for fear of attracting the attention of the military, told Reuters the notices were primarily intended to send a message to authorities that they should not be held responsible for their children's actions.
""My daughter is doing what she believes, but I'm sure she will be worried if we got into trouble,"" one mother said. ""I know she can understand what I have done to her.""  
Lin Lin Bo Bo said he hopes to one day go home and support his family. ""I want this revolution to be over as soon as possible,"" he told Reuters.
Such a reunification may be possible for some families torn apart in this way, according to Wai Hnin Pwint Thon, the rights activist. 
""Unless they do it properly with lawyers and a will, then these things don't really count legally,"" she said of the disowning notices. ""After a couple of years, they can go back to being family.""

So Pyay Aung, the journalist, said he fears his split with his parents is permanent. 
""I don't even have a home to go back to after the revolution,"" he told Reuters. ""I am so worried all the time because my parents are left under the military regime.""

SAN JOSE (Reuters) -Former president Jose Maria Figueres comfortably led the preliminary vote count in Sunday's Costa Rican presidential election, with former finance minister Rodrigo Chaves poised to defy expectations to face him in a second-round run-off.
Figueres was seen winning 27.3% of the vote based on returns from nearly three-quarters of polling stations, with economist Chaves pulling past evangelical Christian Fabricio Alvarado to carve out an advantage in second with 16.6% of the tally.
Chaves, a former World Bank official who has forged an anti-establishment reputation since running the finance ministry for about half a year under outgoing Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado, had been running fourth in recent opinion polls.
""Chaves has a liberal economic position, is socially conservative, pro-law and order and against the political class,"" said Rotsay Rosales, a political scientist and head of the National Policy Observatory of the University of Costa Rica.
Fabricio Alvarado of the neo-Pentecostal New Republic Party and runner-up in the Central American country's 2018 election, was running third, garnering support of 15.2%.
To win the first round outright, a candidate had to secure more than 40% of votes. The two leading contenders will face each other in a run-off on April 3. A total of 25 candidates were competing in the first round.
Chaves, who in the campaign rejected accusations he had been censured for sexual harassment earlier in his career, urged Figueres to pursue a dignified discourse in the run-off.
""I have been attacked by few, but very viciously. If I made a mistake, I apologize,"" he told supporters.
Figueres, who governed from 1994 to 1998 under the centrist National Liberation Party, had been a slight favorite heading into the first round, according to opinion polls.
All 57 seats of the national legislative assembly are also up for grabs. A divided legislature is likely, with local media forecasting Figueres' National Liberation Party (PLN) would win the most seats with 19, but well short of a majority.
Costa Ricans have said they want their next leader to tackle corruption and high unemployment rates during a four-year term. 
The electoral tribunal said voting went smoothly across the country and reported a preliminary turnout of about 60%.
In the capital, San Jose, Enrique Romero, a 52-year-old construction worker, said he would vote for Figueres.
""I want things to improve, that the government functions better,"" Romero said. ""The situation is critical. It is not about going back to the past, but about moving forward and learning from experience.""
President Carlos Alvarado, a center-left politician, cannot seek a second consecutive term.
About a third of the voters in the Central American nation of about 5 million people had not made up their minds on whom to back ahead of the election, according to opinion polls.
Victor Morales, a 56-year-old who sells flags, was among those who were undecided. 
""My business has dropped due to the bad governments we have had,"" Morales said. ""Before, people used to rally to support political parties."" 

The ruling center-left Citizen Action (PAC) party, which has been in power for two terms, received less than 1% of support in the Center for Research and Political Studies poll. 
The national assembly, among other responsibilities, is due to negotiate important financial support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

The timing of SpaceX's work is not clear, although the Fijian Broadcasting Corporation, citing Sayed-Khaiyum, said engineers would operate a ground station in Fiji for six months. 
SpaceX did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Tonga's prime minister's office and state telecom Tonga Communications Corporation could not immediately be reached by phone or email.

YANQING, China (Reuters) -Defending Olympic champion Mikaela Shiffrin crashed out of the women's giant slalom on her first run at the Winter Games while Swede Sara Hector took top spot after taming the 'Ice River' course on a dramatic Monday at the Yanqing Alpine Centre.
American Shiffrin, who came out seventh, was not injured as her skis slid out from under her as she pushed into the turns coming down, causing her to miss a gate. She got back on her skis and made her way slowly down the rest of the course.
Hector, who leads the World Cup rankings in giant slalom this season, set the pace with a time of 57.56 seconds, 0.30 ahead of Austria's Katharina Truppe and 0.42 faster than Italian Federica Brignone in third. 
Slovenian Meta Hrovat was in fourth place, with Pyeongchang silver medallist Ragnhild Mowinckel of Norway in fifth.
The medals will be decided after the second run, which begins at 1430 local time (0630 GMT).
Shiffrin, 26, said her run was a ""huge disappointment"".
""I was pushing. I felt that I was really pushing in those turns,"" she added. ""It's hard to know how it would have gone the rest of the run ... the day was finished basically before it even started.""
Shiffrin plans to compete in all five women's events at the Games this year and will race in her favourite discipline, the slalom, on Wednesday.
""I'm not going to cry about this because that's just wasting energy,"" she added. ""My best chance for the next races is to move forward, to refocus and I feel like I'm in a good place to do that.
""As you can see anything can happen and it happens really, really quickly. The conditions are incredible but nothing is given and I'm not taking that for granted.""
Italian Brignone said she was enjoying the conditions. 
""I really like the slope, it's great for Olympics,"" she added.
Shiffrin was the second skier to crash out during the first run after Italy's Marta Bassino, the fifth racer down, wiped out.
Bassino also appeared unhurt from the fall after her skis slid out from under her at the second gate, sending her into a slow slide down the mountain.
""It's for sure sad that she (Shiffrin) goes out in an Olympic Games,"" said Norway's Maria Therese Tviberg. ""But that's our sport and that's also alpine skiing. I bet she also wanted to give it her all. Mistakes happen.""

In all, 19 racers failed to finish their first run, while Bosnia's Esma Alic was disqualified and Croatia's Andrea Komsic and Poland's Hanna Zieba did not start. There were no initial reports of any serious injuries.
""It's a really nice slope,"" Sweden's Hilma Loevblom said. ""I just think it's the Olympics and there's a lot of other factors. It can be a lot of pressure and everyone's probably a little bit stressed, coaches as well, and it's just different.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin could order an attack on Ukraine within days or weeks, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned on Sunday, as Washington and its European allies continued efforts to offer Putin a diplomatic way out of the crisis.""We are in the window. Any day now, Russia could take military action against Ukraine, or it could be a couple of weeks from now, or Russia could choose to take the diplomatic path instead,"" Sullivan told the ""Fox News Sunday"" program.
Sullivan made the comments in television interviews after two U.S. officials on Saturday said Russia, which seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, has in place about 70% of the combat power it believes it would need for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
As Russia masses more than 100,000 troops near the border, Moscow has said it is not planning an invasion but could take unspecified military action if its security demands are not met.
Those include a promise that NATO will never admit Ukraine, a demand the United States and the 30-nation Western security alliance have called unacceptable. 
U.S. President Joe Biden spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday, the White House said. That call came ahead of a visit by Macron to Moscow on Monday, the culmination of days of French contacts with Russia and Ukraine to try to de-escalate tensions.
The 40 minute-long call between Biden and Macron allowed the two leaders to coordinate ahead of the trip, a French Presidency source said.
If Putin is not deterred by the diplomatic push, possible Russian action could include annexing Ukraine's Donbass region, where Russian-backed separatists broke away from Ukrainian government control in 2014, cyberattacks or a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sullivan said.
""We believe that there is a very distinct possibility that Vladimir Putin will order an attack on Ukraine,"" Sullivan told ABC's ""This Week"" program.
""It could happen as soon as tomorrow, or it could take some weeks yet. He has put himself in a position with military deployments to be able to act aggressively against Ukraine at any time now,"" Sullivan added.
U.S. TROOPS LAND IN POLAND
Ukraine, while seeking more military aid, has also sought to calm fears of an invasion. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Sunday urged people to ignore ""apocalyptic predictions,"" saying his country was strong and had unprecedented international support.
Washington has made clear it would not send U.S. soldiers to defend Ukraine, which is not a member of NATO.
However, Washington has given Kyiv arms and last week said it would send nearly 3,000 extra troops nL1N2UD16S to Poland and Romania to shield Eastern Europe from potential spillover from the crisis.
A plane carrying U.S. troops landed in Poland nL8N2UH069 on Sunday, a Reuters witness said. On Wednesday, the Pentagon said around 1,700 service members, mainly from the 82nd Airborne Division, would deploy from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to Poland.
Biden sent a message to the troops as he arrived at the White House after a weekend at his Delaware home. ""We're thinking of you,"" he said, clenching his fist as he spoke to reporters.
Biden said he would not speculate on whether he might need to send more troops to Europe. Asked what Putin is weighing as he decides whether to pursue an invasion, Biden said the Russian president was looking for ""things he cannot get.""
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who will meet Biden at the White House on Monday, signaled on Sunday he was open to deploying more troops to Lithuania to bolster NATO's eastern flank.
'DIRECT IMPACT' OF SANCTIONS
The United States, with its allies, has threatened extensive economic sanctions against Russia should it invade. These could include financial sanctions as well as export-control measures.
U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo on Sunday said any sanctions would hit Putin and Russian elites hard given their reliance on Europe, which is Russia's largest trading partner, and the U.S. dollar. 
""By the United States and Europe acting together, we put ourselves in a position where we not only would have an impact on the overall Russian economy but we'd have a direct impact on President Putin, who is tied to the Russian economy,"" he told CBS News' ""Face the Nation.""On a daily basis, Russian financial institutions do about $46 billion worth of financial transactions globally with 80% of those in dollars, Adeyemo said. Russia's biggest trading partner is Europe, accounting for about 40% of Russian commerce.
Asked if Russia could instead just turn to China, Adeyemo said the severity of planned U.S. sanctions and Russia's ties with the West would make that difficult.

China ""does not have access"" to critical technologies Russia relies on from the United States and its allies, he told CBS.
""Russian elites, who would be cut off from the global financial system, are not putting their money in China. They're putting their money in Europe and in the United States,"" Adeyemo said.

MUMBAI (Reuters) -Lata Mangeshkar, one of India's best known cultural icons and a singer who defined music for generations of her countrymen, died on Sunday and was given a state funeral as politicians and personalities united in mourning. 
Mangeshkar, 92, made her name in the world of Bollywood and her voice has rung out on television sets, on crackly airwaves and from movie theatres for most of independent India's three quarters of a century, earning her the name ""the Nightingale"".
""I am anguished beyond words,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""She leaves a void in our nation that cannot be filled."" 
Modi joined mourners at a packed open air state funeral late on Sunday after her body, wrapped in the Indian flag, had been paraded through the streets of her home city Mumbai on a truck decorated with flowers.
Thousands of people gathered round Shivaji Park, where she was cremated, climbing walls and trees to get a glimpse of the proceedings and pay their own respects however they could, despite police erecting barricades and restricting public entry. 
The government will observe state mourning with the flag at half-mast through Monday, the Home Ministry said. 
Mangeshkar died of ""multi-organ failure after more than 28 days of hospitalisation post COVID-19"", said Pratit Samdani, who was treating her at Mumbai's Breach Candy Hospital, according to Reuters TV partner ANI.
""The coming generations will remember her as a stalwart of Indian culture, whose melodious voice had an unparalleled ability to mesmerise people,"" Modi wrote.
Other Bollywood personalities and politicians also paid their tributes https://www.reuters.com/world/india/reaction-indian-singer-lata-mangeshkars-death-2022-02-06. ""The voice of a million centuries has left us,"" veteran actor Amitabh Bachchan said.
Maharashtra, Mangeshkar's home state, declared a public holiday on Monday. India's central bank rescheduled its monetary policy committee meeting by a day to Feb. 8-10 due to the holiday. The policy decision is now expected on Thursday.
The state of West Bengal declared a half-day holiday and urged the administration to play Mangeshkar's songs at important crossings all over the state for 15 days.
The Indian Cricket Team wore black armbands as they kicked off the first of three one-dayers against the West Indies. Former Indian captain Virat Kohli said her songs had touched people around the world. Another former captain, Sachin Tendulkar, was among those at the funeral.
'A GIFT FROM GOD'
Born in 1929 in pre-independence India, Mangeshkar began singing in her teens, and in a career spanning 73 years sang more than an estimated 15,000 songs in 36 languages.
She enthralled music-mad Indians with her lilting voice and sheer range, singing everything from patriotic songs to romantic numbers, both in films and albums.
The world of Bollywood - where movies were unthinkable without at least six songs and where everything from romance to grief was narrated with the help of a ballad - was where Mangeshkar cut her teeth.
Classically trained, Mangeshkar moulded her voice to the demands of singing for Bollywood movies, even voicing songs in her 60s for an actress who was in her 20s.
Her songs motivated millions of Indians during wars with China and Pakistan to pay homage to the defence forces. Some of her songs are used as prayers in temples, shrines and schools.
""My voice is a gift from God,"" she once told an interviewer. ""I learned to emote through my voice. When I sang a lullaby, I became a mother, when it was a romantic song, I was a lover.""
The only songs she refused to sing were cabaret numbers and songs that had bawdy or racy lyrics, saying those did not fit with her personal values. Mangeshkar, nevertheless, dominated the Hindi film industry for almost five decades until the 2000s, along with her younger sister Asha Bhosle.
Detractors accused her of using her Bollywood clout to limit the entry of newcomers. Her influence was such that Mumbai authorities in 2006 scrapped a planned highway flyover after she objected that it would disturb her privacy.

Known for soft-spoken nature and wearing a saree, her hair in two schoolgirl-like braids, Mangeshkar received India’s highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, in 2001. She was awarded France's highest civilian honour, the Legion of Honour, in 2009.
""Music is incomplete without your voice,"" actor Amitabh Bachchan said of Mangeshkar in 2019, commemorating her 90th birthday. ""It has done the work of saints.""

ANTANANARIVO (Reuters) - A cyclone killed at least 10 people in southeastern Madagascar, the second to hit the Indian Ocean island in just two weeks, triggering floods, bringing down buildings and cutting power, officials said on Sunday.
One of the worst-hit towns was Nosy Varika on the east coast where almost 95% of buildings were destroyed ""as if we had just been bombed"" and floods cut access, an official said.
Cyclone Batsirai swept inland late on Saturday, slamming into the eastern coastline with heavy rain and wind speeds of 165 kph (100 mph). It was projected it could displace as many as 150,000 people.
The damage from the storm compounded the destruction wreaked by Cyclone Ana, which hit the island, with a population of nearly 30,000,000, two weeks ago, killing 55 people and displacing 130,000 
Madagascar's office of disaster and risk management said in a bulletin late on Sunday 10 people had been killed. State radio said some died when their house collapsed in the town of Ambalavao, about 460 km south of the capital Antananarivo. 
""We saw only desolation: uprooted trees, fallen electric poles, roofs torn off by the wind, the city completely under water,"" Nirina Rahaingosoa, a resident of Fianarantsoa, 420 km south of the capital, told Reuters by phone. 
Electricity was knocked out in the town as poles were toppled by gusts of winds that blew all night into Sunday morning, he said. 
Willy Raharijaona, technical adviser to the vice president of Madagascar's Senate, said some parts of the southeast had been cut off from the surrounding areas by flooding.
""It's as if we had just been bombed. The city of Nosy Varika is almost 95% destroyed,"" he said. ""The solid houses saw their roofs torn off by the wind. The wooden huts have for the most part been destroyed.""
Another resident who gave only one name, Raharijaona, told Reuters even schools and churches that had been preparing to shelter the displaced around Mananjary in the southeast had their roofs torn off.
In the central region of Haute Matsiatra, villagers shovelled mud from a road to clear damage from a landslide caused by Batsirai.

Cyclone Ana that struck the Indian Ocean Island nation on Jan. 22, leaving at least 55 dead from landslides and collapsed buildings and causing widespread flooding.
After ravaging Madagascar, Ana moved west, making landfall in Mozambique and continuing inland to Malawi. A total of 88 people were killed.

Nearly 400 migrants have been transferred by bus to three different shelters near the border city of Tijuana, where they can remain ""indefinitely,"" said the city's Mayor Montserrat Caballero.
Caballero promised help for those migrants regardless of whether they want to stay in Tijuana or return to their countries of origin.
""We're going to pay for the transfers and, if they want to wait for their 'American dream,' we're also going to support them while they wait,"" said Caballero.
Dozens of security personnel, including soldiers from the national guard, were seen dissolving the makeshift camp, fenced by metal mesh, in videos shared on social media. 
Families, including parents with small children, were seen packing up their belongings. There were no reports of violence.
Caballero said the troops were not armed and that migrants collected their belongings and boarded buses voluntarily because they had previously been notified they would be transferred.
But one Guatemalan mother, who had arrived in Tijuana a year ago, and requested anonymity, said she felt migrants had little choice but to follow orders.

On Saturday, Mexico's National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) urged immigration authorities to speed up the processes that would help nearly 2,000 migrants at the southern border get documents to regularize their stay in Mexico or let them travel through the country without being detained.
Tens of thousands of migrants flee their home countries each year in an attempt to reach the United States, but many of them also seek refuge and protection in Mexico.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told Chinese leaders on Saturday that he expected authorities to allow U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet to make a ""credible visit"" to the country, including Xinjiang, the United Nations said.
Guterres met with China's President Xi Jinping and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the Winter Olympics, according to a U.N. readout of the meetings. 
Bachelet has long sought access to Xinjiang to investigate accusations of abuse against ethnic Uyghurs. The issue has soured relations between Beijing and the West, sparking accusations of genocide from Washington and a U.S.-led diplomatic boycott by some countries of the Winter Olympics. 
""The Secretary-General ... expressed his expectation that the contacts between the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Chinese authorities will allow for a credible visit of the High Commissioner to China, including Xinjiang,"" said the U.N. readout of Guterres' meetings.
Bachelet's office in Geneva said last month that conversations were underway for a possible trip to the area in northwest China in the first half of the year. 
Rights groups accuse China of widescale abuses against Uyghurs and other minority groups, including torture, forced labor and detention of 1 million people in internment camps.
China calls them re-education and training facilities, denies abuses, and says it is combating religious extremism.
Guterres also discussed Afghanistan and climate change - among other issues - during his meetings with Xi and Wang.

""The Secretary-General recognized the important efforts China is making to address climate change but reiterated the appeal for additional efforts to accelerate the transition to the green economy to bridge the emissions gap,"" said the U.N. statement. 
Guterres traveled to Beijing to attend the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics on Friday. The ceremony concluded with the Olympic flame cauldron lit by two young Chinese Olympians, one of them a member of China's Uyghur minority.

The saga of the ultimately failed rescue attempt gripped the country and many people abroad for days.
Rayan fell into the well in Ighran village near the town of Chefchaouen on Tuesday and his body was finally pulled out late on Saturday, following an operation that involved cutting much of the adjacent hillside and then tunneling toward the bottom of the well to reach the child.
Many of the weary rescue workers and the hundreds of people who had gathered around the well hoping for good news burst into tears when they heard Rayan was dead. 
“I heard people shout in jubilation after the boy was found thinking he was alive but then we learnt he was not. I never felt this sad,” an onlooker called Noureddine told Reuters. 
The boy's parents spoke to state Al Oula TV after their son's body was recovered.
""This is God's will. I thank all for their efforts to help,"" Rayan's mother Ouassima Kharchich said, her voice strained with grief and barely audible.
""We thank so much the people and authorities... who helped us,"" the father, Khalid Awram, said. 
King Mohammed expressed condolences to the parents in a phone call on Saturday night, a palace statement said.
It was not yet clear when the funeral would take place, but well-wishers travelled to the village on Sunday to offer condolences to the family.
""We feel that people are sorry, we are all sorry. We have no other choice. The father, the mother, the grandmothers and uncles,"" an uncle of the child, Mohammed Kharshish, told Reuters TV on Sunday. ""May God give us patience.""
Pope Francis praised the people of Morocco for coming together to try to rescue the boy.
""The people clung together, as a whole, to save Rayan, they worked together to save a child,"" the pope said during his weekly blessing in St. Peter's Square. ""(The rescuers) tried their best, unfortunately they did not make it,"" he said.

French President Emmanuel Macron said he felt the pain of Rayan’s family and of Moroccans.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China will increase the supply of merchandise featuring ""Bing Dwen Dwen"", the panda mascot of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, the organising committee said on Sunday.
The announcement came as Chinese media and internet users reported difficulty in purchasing souvenirs in the likeness of the chubby panda in a hard, transparent body suit. Many had queued for hours in cold weather outside a flagship store in Beijing but failed to get the soft toys and other decorations.
""We are paying close attention to this problem ... we are coordinating (with factories) to increase supply of 'Bing Dwen Dwen',"" Zhao Weidong, a spokesman of the Beijing Olympics organising committee, told a news conference.
Zhao said the tight supply of ""Bing Dwen Dwen"" was partly because the manufacturing plants were shut down for the week-long Lunar New Year, which overlaps with the Olympics. 
""This issue reflects the popularity of the Beijing Winter Olympics, and also demonstrates the achievement of engaging 300 million Chinese in winter sports.""
Rarely have mascots sold out after the first few days of any Olympics let alone become household names so quickly. Some mascots remain almost in obscurity even during the Games, as was the case at the 2018 Rio de Janeiro Olympics with ""Vinicius"" or the 2002 Salt Lake City trio of Powder the hare, Copper the coyote and Coal the black bear. 
Analysts from Shanxi Securities estimate the total revenue from selling Beijing Olympic licensed products could reach 2.5 billion yuan ($394.80 million) during the Games.
""One Dwen at each family"" has become the No.4 most trending topic on Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), China's equivalent of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), with 10.38 million viewers in the past 24 hours. Chinese internet users are calling for the organisers to meet the surging demand.
Many said on social media that possessing an Olympics souvenir would make them feel more a part of the Games, which has been devoid of most spectators as tickets to events were not sold to the public to curtail the spread of COVID-19.

""To show that I am actively participating in the Winter Olympics, I am making all efforts is get a 'Bing Dwen Dwen' home,"" wrote a Weibo user named ""famous European"".

RABAT (Reuters) -A small boy trapped in a well in northern Moroccan for five days died before rescuers were able to reach him late on Saturday and retrieve his body, two government officials said. 
Footage posted on social media showed the scene after his body was recovered, with hundreds of distraught rescue workers and onlookers gathered at the site chanting to god and shining the flashlights of their phones into the air. 
Rayan Awram, aged five, fell into the well at his village of Ighran in the hills near Chefchaouen on Tuesday, triggering a huge rescue effort that engrossed the country. 
Rescuers finally reached him late on Saturday after removing much of the adjacent hillside and delicately tunnelling a horizontal passage into the well. 
King Mohammed sent condolences to his parents, a statement carried by state media reported. 
The well was only 45 cm (18 inches) wide at the top and tapered as it dropped 32 metres (100 feet) to the bottom, where Rayan was trapped, making it impossible for rescuers to descend directly. 
A male relative of the boy said on Friday that the family had first realised he was missing when they heard muffled crying and lowered a phone with its light and camera switched on to locate him. 
""He was crying 'lift me up',"" the relative said. 
The hilly region around Chefchaouen is bitterly cold in winter and rescuers attempted to keep the boy alive by lowering food, water and oxygen through a tube. 
Rescuers worked round the clock cutting a massive trench through the hillside, then tunnelling horizontally towards Rayan, with a constant risk of triggering landslides. 
In the final hours of the rescue effort, workers had to move with extreme caution as they attempted to dig through earth and rocks to where Rayan lay. 
They were eventually able to access the well late on Saturday, and carried his body to a waiting ambulance. 

Crowds had gathered in a vigil at the scene to watch the rescue effort as hundreds of workers toiled to save the child. Across the country, Moroccans followed the saga on television in homes and cafes.
""I am so sad to learn Rayan has died. Sincere condolences to the parents,"" said Abderrahim Sabihi, a Rabat resident who was following the rescue effort from a cafe.

Russia and Belarus have said they will hold joint exercises called Union Resolve 2022 on Feb. 10-20 aimed at training to repel an attack on southern borders of their alliance, and Russia has given some details of missiles and warplanes it is sending for the event.
The new deployment and planned exercises are taking place at a time when tensions are high between Russia and the West over Russia's massing of troops near its border with Ukraine. Western countries have accused Russia of preparing to invade Ukraine while Moscow denies it has such plans.
The images from U.S.-based Maxar Technologies (NYSE:MAXR) showed that military units armed with missiles, multiple rocket launchers and attack aircrafts had deployed to Belarus at three locations close to the border with Ukraine.
Reuters could not independently verify the imagery.
The Russian defence ministry did not immediately reply for a request for comments. Belarusian military officials did not pick up calls on Sunday.
Maxar Technologies said it had collected images of military hardware near Yelsk, Rechitsa and Luninets on Feb. 4. All locations are within around 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the Ukrainian border. 
Satellite images showed what Maxar Technologies identified as 15 Su-25 ground attack aircrafts and S-400 air defense system at Luninets airfield, as well as SS26 Iskander missiles and multiple rocket launchers near Yelsk.

The Russian defence ministry said on Saturday that it had sent S-400 missile systems and Su-25 warplanes to take part in the drills. Ahead of the exercises, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu visited a firing range in western Belarus on Thursday.
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg last week called the Russian maneuvres in Belarus the biggest Russian deployment in the area since the Cold War and added that nuclear-capable Iskander missiles were a part of it.

(Reuters) - A 19-year-old former student was shot and killed after a high school basketball game a week ago in Beloit, Wisconsin. On Monday, a shooting outside Chaparral High School in Las Vegas left three teens hospitalized. 
On Tuesday, five teenage girls were shot and injured outside Rufus King High School in Milwaukee. Also Tuesday, a student was killed and another shot outside the South Education Center in Minneapolis, the only of these cases in which suspects were arrested. Two students from the school have been charged. 
Signs are emerging that the stresses and challenges of the pandemic are worsening gun violence in American schools. Researchers who are studying the phenomenon worry it will only get worse.
Already, campuses have been the site of 141 shootings so far during the 2021-22 school year - more than at any point in the previous decade, according to Everytown for Gun Safety. 
Problems that predated the pandemic - such as inequality and inadequate resources - have grown worse even as COVID-19 has introduced new challenges, like creating such stress that half of teachers say they want to quit or retire early, according to recent surveys by the National Education Association. 
What that means is there are now and will continue to be fewer adults connected to students who can see warning signs that a child may be heading toward violent behavior. 
""Kids are walking into a system that has been massively weakened,"" said Ron Avi Astor, a school violence expert at UCLA. ""We're going to see a variety of different forms of gun violence and violence in general. We're in a situation where things are going to get worse."" 
Astor said there are myriad factors behind the violence, among them the pandemic, increases in overall community violence and breakdowns in family structures. All those issues have created a ""tsunami of mental health needs"" in schools, he said. And the problems are cresting as teachers and administrators are ill-equipped to deal with them because of burnout, lack of staff and illness.
The problem is not necessarily too little funding, Astor said, but the missing human capital -- teachers, specialists and staff who could help tackle the crisis of violence. 
BROKEN ROUTINES, MANY GUNS
Katherine Schweit, a retired FBI special agent who focused on active shooters and author of the book ""Stop the Killing"" published last year, said another key factor in the violence has been parents' erratic schedules in the pandemic. This means less oversight and less predictable routines for kids, making it even more difficult for parents, teachers and others to see warning signs. 
""One of the things that we focus on when we talk about preventing shootings … is what is different in someone's routine that might indicate to us that this person is on a trajectory towards violence,"" she said. ""But who has a routine these days? Nobody."" 
The availability of guns is another factor, according to Jillian Peterson, a criminology professor at Hamline University and co-creator of the Violence Project research center. The past year saw consistent monthly record gun sales, though purchases have begun to ebb. Peterson said far too many of those guns are not secured in homes, allowing teens access. 
One of the most important things schools can do right now, Peterson said, is create crisis response systems and teams so that students and teachers can report their concerns about specific students. This information can be funneled to people trained to evaluate the threats.
Peterson said that while it is impossible to know exactly what is driving increases in violence, researchers agree the decimation of school services is a big contributor. 

""We know that a lot of things that prevented violence, like after-school programs and sports, are still not up and functioning in many places,"" she said.
""The pandemic,"" Peterson added, ""has shown us that schools are so much more than schools. They really hold our society together and hold our kids together in many ways, from mental health to physical health to food security. And we lost that.""

ZHANGJIAKOU, China (Reuters) -Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand said she was a ""proud Kiwi"" after winning gold in the women's slopestyle event at the Beijing Olympics on Sunday, snagging the nation's first-ever Winter Games gold medal.
Rival snowboarders said the 20-year-old's final run pushed the women's field to the next level and called it a giant leap for the sport. 
Sadowski-Synnott scored 92.88 on her final run, landing back-to-back 1080s on a challenging course resembling the Great Wall of China. 
Asked how she felt about making history as the island nation's first Winter Games gold medallist, she said it made her a ""proud Kiwi"".
""I hope I made them happy and they will celebrate for me,"" she said. 
Her coach, Sean Thompson, said ""everyone was going to go crazy"" back home over the win.
""She's amazing and deserves every bit of it,"" he said. 
The New Zealander won over a tough field of competitors, including the reigning twice-gold medallist Jamie Anderson, who missed the podium after she said she ""blew it"" during Sunday's contest. 
Julia Marino of the United States, who took silver, said Sadowski-Synnott was elevating the women's slopestyle competition, putting down tricks successfully performed only by men previously.
""She stomped that to the last line,"" Marino said, adding that she was ""overcome with happiness"" for all the winners.
""I just think it's insanely huge for the progression of the sport,"" she said. 
After Sadowski-Synnott landed her final trick, her supporters erupted in cheers, waving her home country's flag as well as another flag displaying the black-and-white silver fern.
Australian Tess Coady, who won bronze, jumped on top of the New Zealander at the finish and Marino also piled in. 
The skies were sunny but hard snow and the extremely low temperatures made the event demanding for boarders as air temperatures fell to minus 19.6 degrees Celsius at Genting Snow Park in Zhangjiakou.
Snowboarders described the course, which even includes a replica of an ancient watch tower on the Great Wall, more challenging than others they had tried. 
Anderson, who lost her title and came in ninth in the finals, paused after an interview and turned towards the awards ceremony, watching in silence as the winners were crowned.
Afterwards, she posted an Instagram video https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/snowboarding-anderson-reassures-fans-she-is-okay-after-losing-title-2022-02-06 telling her supporters that she was ""okay"" but admitted it was hard to lose the title.

""I'm a little sad, of course, I wasn't able to put down a run today,"" she said in a hoarse voice, adding praise for the other riders. 
""This whole next generation of snowboarding girls are so badass and I'm just so proud of all of you,"" she said.

671,"<span>Feb 06, 2022 03:56AM ET</span>",,,,,,"MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - Hundreds of protesters took to the streets of downtown Minneapolis on Saturday demanding justice in the fatal police shooting of a young Black man, Amir Locke, during a ""no-knock"" raid on his apartment earlier this week.
The boisterous but peaceful crowd, chanting Locke's name and the slogan ""no justice, no peace,"" rallied at Government Plaza in Minnesota's largest city three days after Locke, 22, was shot on his couch by police.
The day after the killing, police released video footage from the raid, which showed Locke was holding a gun as he twisted beneath a blanket on his sofa after being roused by officers moments before he was slain.
Police have said the officers were exercising a ""no-knock"" search warrant, which authorizes police to enter private property without first alerting occupants or announcing their presence. 
The warrant was issued in relation to a homicide probe led by detectives from the neighboring Saint Paul Police Department. Locke was not named in the warrant, and Minneapolis police have acknowledged it was unclear how or whether he was connected to that investigation.
On Thursday, interim Minneapolis Police Chief Amelia Huffman told a news conference the county attorney's office was reviewing the shooting, and that video from the incident appeared to show Locke's gun pointed toward officers when they opened fire.
Activists at the protest said Locke had a right to possess a weapon in his own home and was never given the chance to disarm himself in the chaotic moments as police stormed into his apartment without warning. 
At least 500 demonstrators assembled in below-freezing temperatures on Saturday, demanding an unconditional ban on no-knock warrants, the dismissal and arrest of officers involved in the shooting, and the resignation of the mayor and police chief.
A series of speakers led the crowd through chants demanding racial justice and denouncing police violence against Black people, who organizers said have been disproportionately targeted by heavy-handed, and discriminatory law enforcement tactics.
Live video footage of the protest from Reuters showed the crowd remained orderly, while police kept a low profile presence on the fringes of the rally.
On Friday, Mayor Jacob Frey responded to the Locke shooting, ordering a moratorium on ""no-knock"" search warrants, saying he was acting to ""ensure safety of both the public and officers until a new policy is crafted.""
The Locke shooting was the latest of a string of incidents to put Minneapolis-area police department under scrutiny.
Almost two years ago, George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, was killed by a white officer who knelt on Floyd's neck for over nine minutes during an arrest on suspicion of trying to pass a counterfeit $20 bill. Outrage over Floyd's death sparked a nationwide movement challenging police brutality and bias in the U.S. criminal justice system.
The video of Locke's arrest showed police unlocking his apartment with a key and officers shouting, ""Police, search warrant, get on the ground,"" as they entered.

An officer then kicks at the couch where Locke was lying and as Locke turns, his arm emerges from under the blanket with a gun seen in his hand. Almost immediately, police fired at least three shots.
Lawyers for Locke's family said he had no criminal history and legally possessed a firearm at the time of his death.

YANQING, China (Reuters) -The marquee event of the men's Alpine Olympic programme at the Beijing Winter Games was postponed to Monday at noon (0400 GMT) after high winds on Sunday forced two hours of delays before organisers threw in the towel.
""Due to the present weather situation with the wind gust and the updated forecast - the jury together with the organiser have decided in the best interest of safety and fairness for the racers to delay today's men’s Olympic downhill to another day,"" organisers said in a statement.
The men's downhill will take place in between Monday's scheduled women's giant slalom, which will be held in two stages on the technical course adjacent to 'The Rock' speed course.
Similar wind in the upper and middle areas of the course had led to the cancellation of Saturday's third training session after just three skiers had completed their run.
While fans are not allowed to attend the race due to COVID-19 restrictions, International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach had arrived at the course, which is made from artificial snow, to watch the event.
Norway's Aleksander Aamodt Kilde, the favourite in the event, backed the decision but said skiers might have to cope with some degree of wind.
""We will see, we just have to be patient and make sure that we make the right decisions,"" the World Cup downhill leader said.
""If we talk about our safety then we can't do much about it. But if it is only just a little bit, so it is safe to ski, then we might just have to race with wind and take what we get. 
""It is an outside sport and we know about the wind and the things that can happen,"" added Kilde, who hopes there will be less waiting around if a similar situation emerges.
""It is just a lot of lack of energy when you have to prepare for such a long day and then suddenly at 2 p.m. they have to make a decision. Lets see if they can make a decision earlier in the future and hope for the best.""

French veteran Johan Clarey backed the decision.
""I think the conditions were not safe for everyone, so security first,"" said the 41-year-old.

TORONTO/OTTAWA (Reuters) - Thousands of people demonstrated in Canadian cities, including the financial hub Toronto, on Saturday as mostly peaceful but noisy protests against vaccine mandates spread from Ottawa, the capital.
The ""Freedom Convoy"" began as a movement against a Canadian vaccine requirement for cross-border truckers, but has turned into a rallying point against public health measures and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government. 
“We're all sick and tired of the mandates, of the intimidation, of living in one big prison,” said Robert, a Toronto protester who did not give his last name. ""We just want to go back to normal without having to take into our veins the poison which they call vaccines.”
Protesters have shut down downtown Ottawa for the past eight days, with some participants waving Confederate or Nazi flags and some saying they wanted to dissolve Canada's government.
""The protesters in Ottawa have made their point. The entire country heard their point,"" said Transport Minister Omar Alghabra, who urged protesters to ""go home and engage elected officials."" 
Ottawa police said hate crime charges were laid against four people and they were investigating threats against public figures jointly with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The well-organized blockade, which police say has relied partly on funding from sympathizers in the United States, saw protesters bring in portable saunas on Saturday to combat frigid temperatures.
One man rode through the area on horseback, carrying a Trump flag, social media videos showed. Former U.S. President Donald Trump has spoken out in support of the truckers against ""the harsh policies of far-left lunatic Justin Trudeau who has destroyed Canada with insane COVID mandates."" 
GoFundMe took down the Freedom Convoy's donation page on Friday, saying it violated the platform's terms of service due to unlawful activity. The group had raised about C$10.1 million.
The website originally said it would give refunds for any requests made by Feb. 19 and would remaining funds to verified charities, but on Saturday GoFundMe said it would refund all donations automatically.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who has previously criticized vaccine mandates, called GoFundMe ""professional thieves."" Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and other Republican state lawmakers vowed to investigate the California-based company over the move.
About 5,000 people demonstrated in Ottawa, police said, while hundreds more gathered in Toronto, Canada's biggest city, and Quebec City, coinciding with the city's annual winter carnival. Four people were injured in Manitoba after a pick-up truck drove into a crowd late Friday, police said. 
In Toronto, about 500 healthcare workers and supporters rallied downtown in opposition to the trucker convoy, according to a Reuters witness. 
Several Toronto healthcare workers said they received advice from their hospitals to not wear hospital scrubs in public in light of the protest. 
""The notion that we have to somehow skunk around or be afraid of who we are and what were doing, I think, is offensive and regrettable, and I think, a sad commentary on our society,"" emergency room doctor Raghu Venugopal told Reuters.
Some Ottawa residents, who have endured near-incessant honking, smashed windows and harassment for wearing masks themselves, criticized Ottawa Police earlier this week for not doing more to end the blockade. One resident filed a class-action lawsuit against convoy organizers, seeking up to $10 million in damages and an injunction to end the protests.

Ottawa police, which warned on Friday of a crackdown on the protest and dedicated more officers, do not have enough resources to end the protests, the city's police chief said on Saturday. Trudeau ruled out the use of troops against truckers in the capital earlier this week. 
""This is a city under siege, this is a threat to democracy, this is a nationwide insurrection, this is madness,"" Chief Peter Sloly said at a police services' board meeting. ""We have done our very best.""

674,"<span>Feb 05, 2022 10:25PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -Some U.S. Republicans on Saturday vowed to investigate GoFundMe's decision to take down a page accepting donations in support of protesting truckdrivers in Canada, although GoFundMe early Saturday already said it would simply refund all donations. 
The Freedom Convoy 2022 began as a movement against a Canadian vaccine requirement for cross-border truckers, but has turned into a rallying point against public health measures in Canada. It has also gained increasing support among U.S. Republicans, including former President Donald Trump.
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said on Saturday it was fraud for GoFundMe to ""commandeer"" $9 million in donations sent to the Freedom Convoy in support of the truckdrivers and said he would work with his state's attorney general, Ashley Moody, to investigate. ""(T)hese donors should be given a refund.""
But hours before DeSantis posted his statement on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), GoFundMe said in a tweet that it had revised its original plan on how to handle funds already donated to support the truckdriver protest, saying that all donations would be refunded.
""This refund will happen automatically — you do not need to submit a request. Donors can expect to see refunds within 7-10 business days,"" GoFundMe said in its tweet. 
GoFundMe took down the Freedom Convoy 2022 fundraiser page on Friday, saying it violated its terms of service. At the time it said donors would have two weeks to request a refund, with any remaining funds distributed to ""credible and established charities."" 
West Virginia and Louisiana attorneys general were among those who called on constituents to let them know if they had been a donor.
""My office will be looking into whether or not #GoFundMe violated our state law. If you are a Louisiana donor to the #FreedomConvoy, please contact my #ConsumerProtection Section!"" Jeff Landry, attorney general in Louisiana, said on Twitter on Saturday.
GoFundMe did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Protesters have shut down downtown Ottawa, the Canadian capital, for eight days now, with some participants waving Confederate or Nazi flags and some saying they wanted to dissolve Canada's government. To the increasing fury of residents, Ottawa police have largely stood by and watched as some protesters smashed windows, threatened reporters and health-care workers, and abused racial minorities.

Toronto, Canada's largest city, and other cities braced for disruptions on Saturday as protests spread from Ottawa, raising fears of clashes with counter-protesters.
Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of the former president, on Twitter late Friday called for all Republican attorneys general to look into GoFundMe's move.

DENVER (Reuters) - A housekeeper at the Colorado ranch of billionaire Michael Bloomberg was abducted at gunpoint this week by a man who forced her to drive them to Wyoming, where police later arrested the suspect and freed the woman unharmed, according to officials and court documents.
Joseph Beecher, 48, was taken into custody on Thursday and was jailed without bond in Cheyenne, Wyoming, facing multiple state charges including kidnapping and felony menacing, a Colorado sheriff's office said in an online statement
A federal kidnapping charge has also been lodged against the suspect, as documented in a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Wyoming.
The abduction took place on Wednesday near the town of Meeker, Colorado, in a rural corner of the state about 200 miles west of Denver, according to law enforcement officials, but was not widely reported by media outlets until Saturday.
Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and onetime U.S. presidential candidate, was not present at his ranch at the time, nor were any of his family, authorities said.
No mention of a possible motive for the kidnapping was made by the sheriff's office or federal officials. 
But The New York Times, citing court documents, said the suspect had initially asked the housekeeper about Bloomberg's two adult daughters by name, and later said he had traveled to a nearby airport over the summer in search of the former mayor.
According to an FBI affidavit filed in the case, the abduction began after Beecher rammed his pickup truck through the gate of the Bloomberg ranch, entered the property and accosted the supervising housekeeper as she was working in an upstairs bedroom of the residence.
The housekeeper told authorities the man pointed a rifle at her face, threatened to shoot her and forced her at gunpoint to drive them in her vehicle on a cross-state trek to the Denver area, making several stops along the way, the affidavit said.
The suspect ultimately demanded the victim drive them to Cheyenne, where they rented a motel room under assumed names, and he ordered her to share a bed with him for the night, forcing her to sleep with her head on his chest and one arm over his waist, according to the FBI.
Authorities back in Colorado, alerted on Wednesday to the abduction, managed to track the pair to the motel, and police stormed the room the following day, arresting Beecher and rescuing the housekeeper, the affidavit said.
The FBI said authorities also recovered two rifles and ammunition Beecher is accused of having stolen from a Colorado hotel where he lived and worked until a falling-out with his landlord-employer early on Wednesday, before the kidnapping about 70 miles away.
According to the Rio Blanco Sheriff's Office, Beecher had no known connection to the housekeeper or to Bloomberg, 79, who according to the Times purchased the 4,600-acre ranch in 2020 for nearly $45 million.
In a statement issued by his spokesperson, Ty Trippet, Bloomberg said he was ""deeply grateful"" to law enforcement for its ""swift and heroic action in this case in ensuring that no lives were lost and that the victim has been rescued and safely returned to her family.""

Migrants, including minors, currently survive ""in conditions contrary to respect for their dignity"" in the southern city of Tapachula, near the Guatemala border, the commission said in a statement. The National Migration Institute (INM) and the Commission for Refugee Assistance (COMAR) urgently need to provide humanitarian assistance to these migrants, it said.
""The INM and COMAR have been asked to immediately create working groups in order to speed up the migratory regularization procedures, or the recognition of refugee status,"" it said. 
The INM also should guarantee ""the free transit through national territory of people once the corresponding identification documents have been issued.""
On Thursday https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/protesting-migrants-southern-mexico-threaten-form-new-caravan-2022-02-04, hundreds of migrants in Tapachula protested against the slow pace of government visa approvals and threatened to form a fresh caravan that would head to the U.S. border. 
Neither the INM nor COMAR immediately responded to requests for comment. Last week, the INM said that ""there is no need for marches or demonstrations"" for migrants to complete their paperwork.

Amid pressure from Washington, Mexico has tried to stem large waves of migrants traveling in U.S.-bound caravans. 
Tens of thousands of migrants flee their home countries each year in an attempt to reach the United States, but many of them also seek refuge and protection in Mexico.

677,"<span>Feb 05, 2022 09:10PM ET</span>","SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea on Sunday surpassed one million cumulative COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began, as health officials reported a daily record of 38,691 new infections driven by an Omicron variant outbreak.
South Korea saw its first confirmed COVID-19 case on January 20, 2020, and soon became the first country outside China to battle a major outbreak.
An aggressive strategy of tracking, tracing, masking and quarantining helped South Korea to blunt that initial wave and keep overall cases and deaths low without widespread lockdowns, but the spread of the Omicron variant is driving case numbers to new highs.
Deaths have remained low in the highly vaccinated country, however, with 15 new deaths reported as of midnight Saturday, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency.
Daily cases are nearly five times higher than two weeks ago, when the Omicron variant began to dominate, but serious infections have remained at manageable levels so far, authorities have said.
Officials on Friday announced they would extend social distancing measures for at least another two weeks, including a 9 p.m. curfew on businesses and a six-person limit for private gatherings.

Overall, South Korea has reported 1,009,688 COVID-19 cases, with 6,873 deaths.
Nearly 86% of the country's 52 million population is fully vaccinated, with more than 54.5% having received booster shots.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russia has in place about 70% of the combat power it believes it would need for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and is sending more battalion tactical groups to the border with its neighbor, two U.S. officials said on Saturday. 
In the last two weeks, the number of battalion tactical groups (BTG) in the border region has risen to 83 from 60 as of Friday and 14 more are in transit, the officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the information. 
As to the timing of an invasion, the ground is expected to reach peak freeze around Feb. 15, the officials said, allowing for off-road mechanized transit by Russian military units. Such conditions would continue until the end of March. 
That timeline and the growing number and capability of Russian forces close to Ukraine could suggest the window for diplomacy is shutting. 
The U.S. officials did not provide evidence to back up their estimates of Russia's forces. 
As Russia masses more than 100,000 troops near the border, it has said it is not planning an invasion but could take unspecified military action if its security demands are not met. Those include a promise that NATO will never admit Ukraine, a demand Washington and NATO have said is unacceptable. 
Washington believes Russia may choose other options than a full-scale invasion, including a limited incursion, and does not believe President Vladimir Putin had made a final decision, the officials said. 
But they said Putin is putting in place a force that can execute all scenarios. 
If Russia were to invade the capital of Kyiv, it could fall within a couple of days, the U.S. officials said. 
A full-scale invasion would cause major casualties, one of the officials said. 

Ukraine could suffer 5,000 to 25,000 troop casualties, while Russia's troop casualties could be between 3,000 and 10,000, and civilian casualties could range from 25,000 to 50,000, according to U.S. estimates, the official said. 
A full invasion would also prompt the flight of millions of refugees and internally displaced persons in Europe, Washington believes.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's Queen Elizabeth said on Saturday that she wants Prince Charles' wife Camilla to be styled Queen Consort when he becomes king, cementing her place at the heart of the royal family after once being judged an outsider. 
In a letter written to mark the 70th anniversary of her accession to the throne, Elizabeth said the occasion had given her pause to reflect upon the loyalty and affection shown to her by the British public.
She said she hoped Charles and Camilla would receive the same support.
""(It) is my sincere wish that, when that time comes, Camilla will be known as Queen Consort as she continues her own loyal service,"" Elizabeth said.
Charles and Camilla, long-time lovers, were married in 2005 in a civil ceremony in Windsor. Their Clarence House residence said on Saturday that they were ""touched and honoured by Her Majesty's words"".
Elizabeth's move reflects a wider acceptance of Camilla's status as a royal.
Tabloid newspapers no longer target her as they did in the decade following the death in 1997 of Charles' first wife, Princess Diana.
Camilla - whose current title is Duchess of Cornwall - now regularly represents the royal family alongside Charles during official duties.
Throughout British history, the wife of a king typically is given the title Queen Consort. At the time of their marriage, it had been officially decided that Camilla would use the title Princess Consort if Charles were to become king.
While Elizabeth on Sunday celebrates 70 years on the British throne - an unprecedented stretch - the anniversary comes at a time of tumult for the royal family.
From the U.S. sex abuse court case facing her son Prince Andrew to allegations by her grandson Prince Harry and his wife of racism in the royal household, rarely has the 95-year-old Elizabeth's family faced such scrutiny and damaging headlines.
Last year she lost her husband of 73 years, Philip, whom she acknowledged in her letter on Saturday.
""I was blessed that in Prince Philip I had a partner willing to carry out the role of consort and unselfishly make the sacrifices that go with it. It is a role I saw my own mother perform during my father's reign,"" Elizabeth said.
POMP AND POIGNANCY
Earlier on Saturday, Elizabeth kicked off celebrations for the 70th anniversary of her accession to the throne by inviting local community groups to her Sandringham residence in the east of England.
The queen, pictured smiling and wearing a light blue dress, cut a celebratory cake baked by a local resident and heard a rendition of ""Congratulations"" played by a concert band.
""I remain eternally grateful for, and humbled by, the loyalty and affection that you continue to give me,"" she said in her letter to the public.
Ironically Elizabeth was not destined to be monarch at her birth, and became queen only because her uncle Edward VIII abdicated to be with American divorcee Wallis Simpson.
But in 2015, she overtook Victoria as Britain's longest-reigning sovereign in a line that traces its origin back to Norman King William I and his 1066 conquest of England.
This weekend's low-key events are a prelude to more pomp and ceremony to mark the platinum jubilee in early June, when the government will add an extra public holiday.
But Elizabeth said the anniversary was to her one of reflection and poignancy.

""It is a day that, even after 70 years, I still remember as much for the death of my father, King George VI, as for the start of my reign,"" she wrote.
""As we mark this anniversary, it gives me pleasure to renew to you the pledge I gave in 1947 that my life will always be devoted to your service.""

LANCASTER, PA. (Reuters) - Republicans in Pennsylvania chose on Saturday not to endorse a primary candidate in one of the most closely-watched U.S. Senate races in the country, amid concerns they could back a candidate in a crowded field who might put them at odds with Donald Trump. 
The endorsement of the state committee is widely considered the early prize of primary season, catapulting its recipient to the general election. This year, the party emerges from its winter meeting less unified ahead of a wide-open primary season. 
Trump has not said whether he will back any of the current candidates in the contest that could decide control of Congress in November's midterm elections.
Among the Republicans vying to replace Senator Pat Toomey, who is retiring, are several with ties to the former president: Carla Sands, his former ambassador to Denmark; his friend the celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz; and hedge fund CEO David McCormick (NYSE:MKC), whose wife served in the Trump administration.
The state committee, comprised of more than 300 local and state officials, voted against endorsing any candidate in the Senate race, or in the equally-crowded governor's race, according to two sources who attended the closed-door meeting. It was conducted by a voice vote and there was no need for a roll call, the sources said. 
In interviews, 25 state party committee members and Republican Party officials in Pennsylvania said they were reluctant to back one Senate candidate. They cited both the large field of 12 hopefuls and the possibility that Trump might eventually endorse a different contender.
""This was no surprise. Committee members want the candidates to stand on their own and let the voters decide,"" said one top Republican official who was present during the vote. ""Now, everyone will be working for the Trump endorsement and the best way to get that endorsement is to show you can win.""
In the weeks leading up to Saturday's vote, regional Republican caucuses held straw polls to gauge support, with real estate developer Jeff Bartos garnering the most party support despite trailing in public polls. 

Last month, the Democratic state committee could not agree on endorsing any single candidate, but U.S. Representative Conor Lamb received the overwhelming majority of the votes ahead of Democratic rivals Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman and state lawmaker Malcolm Kenyatta, according to results viewed by Reuters. 
Under Democratic rules, a candidate needs roughly two-thirds of votes to earn the state committee's endorsement. Republicans require only a simple majority.

In an interview with the Funke media group to be published online on Sunday and in newspapers on Monday, Lambrecht said Germany was ""already making an important contribution in Lithuania"" by leading a NATO battlegroup.
""As a matter of principle, additional troops are available as reinforcement, and we are in talks with Lithuania at the moment to find out what exactly would make sense in this regard,"" she said.
Russia has denied planning to invade Ukraine but has tens of thousands of troops near its neighbour's borders, prompting the United States to order about 3,000 extra troops to bolster NATO's eastern flank in Poland and Romania. 
The first of these U.S. troops arrived on Saturday at Rzeszow military base in southeastern Poland. 
NATO has already deployed four multinational combat units with some 5,000 troops in total in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. They were sent there in response to Moscow's annexation of the Crimea region from Ukraine in 2014.
These so-called NATO battlegroups, led by the United States, Germany, Canada and Britain, are meant to stall an attack in the region and buy time for additional NATO troops to reach the frontline.
Two U.S. officials said on Saturday that Russia has in place about 70% of the combat power it believes it would need for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Lambrecht again ruled out supplying Kyiv with arms, after Ukraine's embassy in Germany sent a list with specific requests to the foreign and defence ministries in Berlin.
The list included missile defence systems, tools for electronic warfare, night vision goggles, digital radios, radar stations and military ambulances - equipment which, in part, is already in short supply within the Germany forces.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - North Korea continued to develop its nuclear and ballistic missile programs during the past year and cyberattacks on cryptocurrency exchanges were an important revenue source for Pyongyang, according to an excerpt of a confidential United Nations report seen on Saturday by Reuters. 
The annual report by independent sanctions monitors was submitted on Friday evening to the U.N. Security Council North Korea sanctions committee. 
""Although no nuclear tests or launches of ICBMs (intercontinental ballistic missiles) were reported, DPRK continued to develop its capability for production of nuclear fissile materials,"" the experts wrote.
North Korea is formally known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). It has long-been banned from conducting nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches by the U.N. Security Council. 
""Maintenance and development of DPRK's nuclear and ballistic missile infrastructure continued, and DPRK continued to seek material, technology and know-how for these programs overseas, including through cyber means and joint scientific research,"" the report said.
Since 2006, North Korea has been subject to U.N. sanctions, which the Security Council has strengthened over the years in an effort to target funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
The sanctions monitors noted that there had been a ""marked acceleration"" of missile testing by Pyongyang. 
The United States and others said https://www.reuters.com/world/china/want-north-korea-breakthrough-china-tells-us-show-flexibility-2022-02-04 on Friday that North Korea had carried out nine ballistic missile launches in January, adding it was the largest number in a single month in the history of the country's weapons of mass destruction and missile programs.
""DPRK demonstrated increased capabilities for rapid deployment, wide mobility (including at sea), and improved resilience of its missile forces,"" the sanctions monitors said.
North Korea's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
CYBERATTACKS, ILLICIT TRADE
The monitors said ""cyberattacks, particularly on cryptocurrency assets, remain an important revenue source"" for North Korea and that they had received information that North Korean hackers continued to target financial institutions, cryptocurrency firms and exchanges.
""According to a member state, DPRK cyberactors stole more than $50 million between 2020 and mid-2021 from at least three cryptocurrency exchanges in North America, Europe and Asia,"" the report said. 
The monitors also cited a report last month by cybersecurity firm Chainalysis that said North Korea launched at least seven attacks on cryptocurrency platforms that extracted nearly $400 million worth of digital assets last year. 
In 2019, the U.N. sanctions monitors reported that North Korea had generated an estimated $2 billion for its weapons of mass destruction programs using widespread and increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.
The latest report said North Korea's strict blockade in response to the COVID-19 pandemic meant ""illicit trade, including in luxury goods, has largely ceased.""
Over the years the U.N. Security Council has banned North Korean exports including coal, iron, lead, textiles and seafood, and capped imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products.
""Although maritime exports from DPRK of coal increased in the second half of 2021, they were still at relatively low levels,"" the monitors said. 

""The quantity of illicit imports of refined petroleum increased sharply in the same period, but at a much lower level than in previous years,"" the report said. ""Direct delivery by non-DPRK tankers to DPRK has ceased, probably in response to COVID-19 measures: instead, only DPRK tankers delivered oil.""
North Korea's humanitarian situation ""continues to worsen,"" the report said. The monitors said that was probably due to the COVID-19 blockade, but that a lack of information from North Korea meant it was difficult to determine how much U.N. sanctions were unintentionally harming civilians.

President Pedro Castillo said on Friday he would reshuffle the Cabinet in light of the allegations, but did not address whether Valer would leave. 
Castillo must now name his fourth cabinet in just six months, which he said will incorporate representatives of a range of political groups. It is unclear when an announcement will take place. 
Castillo, a former schoolteacher and member of a Marxist-Leninist party, has moved increasingly to the right since taking office last July. 
His first prime minister was a far-left party leader, who was replaced in October by a moderate-left politician, before Castillo appointed Valer this week.

Valer is a lawmaker and conservative Catholic who ran with a right-wing party before defecting to join a Congressional bloc that is friendly with Castillo. 
Peru's prime minister is a powerful figure. The PM is the chief adviser to the president, and presides and helps appoint the rest of the Cabinet.

    The Duke of York, who denies accusations that he sexually abused Giuffre two decades ago when she was 17, will speak under oath in London, the Daily Telegraph newspaper reported.
""We agreed to voluntarily produce the Duke for a deposition on March 10. Despite repeated requests, Ms. Giuffre still hasn't committed to a date or location for her deposition,"" the source told Reuters.
Giuffre, 38, sued Andrew last August, alleging he battered her while the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was trafficking her.
In a filing with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Andrew, 61, admitted meeting Epstein in or around 1999, but denied Giuffre's allegation that he ""committed sexual assault and battery"" upon her.
Andrew's ties to Epstein, who killed himself in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges, have undermined his reputation with the public and standing in Britain's Royal Family.
Last month, the family removed Andrew's military links and military patronages, and said the second son of Queen Elizabeth would no longer be known as ""His Royal Highness"".
The prince's lawyers previously called Giuffre's lawsuit ""baseless"" and accused her of seeking another payday.
Giuffre received $500,000 in a 2009 civil settlement with Epstein. 
U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan has said a trial could begin between September and December 2022.

If Giuffre won at trial, Andrew could owe her damages. She has asked for an unspecified amount. 
Andrew has not been criminally charged, and no criminal charges can be brought in Giuffre's civil lawsuit.

Flores, who is Black, was fired by the Dolphins last month after back-to-back seasons with winning records, saying it was emblematic of the treatment of Black coaches, who comprise a fraction of team staff positions while 70% of NFL players are Black.
Goodell said he understood Flores' concerns and added they would not wait for the legal process to ""reassess and modify our strategies"" so they are consistent with the league's commitment to diversity.
""We have made significant efforts to promote diversity and adopted numerous policies and programs which have produced positive change in many areas,"" Goodell wrote in a memo seen by Reuters and sent to all league employees and clubs.
""However we must acknowledge that particularly with respect to head coaches the results have been unacceptable.
""We will reevaluate and examine all policies, guidelines and initiatives relating to diversity, equity and inclusion, including as they relate to gender.""
There is currently just one Black head coach among the NFL's 32 teams.
Goodell added they were retaining ""outside experts"" to assist in their review while also asking current and former players and coaches for their input.
""Our goal is simple: make our efforts and those of the clubs more effective so that real and tangible results will be achieved,"" he added.
""We recognize the need to understand the lived experiences of diverse members of the NFL family to ensure that everyone has access to opportunity and is treated with respect and dignity.""

Flores had also said his refusal to throw games as a way to improve the football club's chances of landing a top draft pick ultimately cost him his job.
""We also take seriously any issue relating to the integrity of NFL games. These matters will be reviewed thoroughly and independently,"" Goodell said.

Weeks of diplomacy between the West and Moscow have produced no breakthrough after Russia massed tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine's borders. 
Moscow denies it plans to attack Ukraine but has demanded security guarantees, including a block on Ukraine joining the NATO alliance. 
Kharkiv, an eastern industrial city that lies 42 km (26 miles) from the Russian border, was identified by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as a possible Russian target, though his spokesman later said he was speaking hypothetically.

Demonstrators in Kharkiv sang the national anthem and waved Ukrainian flags, or held up flags of allies that have supported Kyiv, including the United States, Britain and the European Union.
""The people came into the streets to demonstrate that Kharkiv is a Ukrainian city and we will not surrender it,"" said Kharkiv resident Nina Kvitko.

Sunday will mark the queen's platinum jubilee https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/queen-elizabeth-quietly-marks-70-years-british-throne-2022-02-04, a first for a British monarch. 
Elizabeth, 95, became the queen of Britain and more than a dozen other realms including Canada, Australia and New Zealand on the death of her father King George VI on Feb. 6, 1952, while she was in Kenya on an international tour.
The queen's guests at Sandringham included Angela Wood, who as a cookery student in 1953 helped to create Coronation Chicken, a curry and mayonnaise-based dish invented to celebrate Elizabeth's reign and that is still enjoyed today.
The queen, wearing a light blue dress, also cut a celebratory cake baked by a local resident and heard a rendition of ""Congratulations"" played by a concert band, Buckingham Palace said.
Elizabeth has continued to carry out official duties https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/queen-elizabeths-reign-second-golden-age-britain-2022-02-03 well into her 90s, but has been little seen in public since she spent a night in hospital last October for an unspecified ailment and was then instructed by doctors to rest.
However, Buckingham Palace on Friday released footage ahead of Sunday's landmark, showing her viewing items from previous royal jubilees, such as a fan given to her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria to mark her 50th year on the throne in 1887, signed by family, friends and politicians.
Ironically Elizabeth was not destined to be monarch at her birth, and became queen only because her uncle Edward VIII abdicated to be with American divorcee Wallis Simpson.

But in 2015, she overtook Victoria as Britain's longest-reigning sovereign in a line that traces its origin back to Norman King William I and his 1066 conquest of England.
This weekend's low-key events are a prelude to more pomp and ceremony to mark the platinum jubilee in early June. The government has added an extra public holiday to the usual spring day off to make for a four-day weekend.

Following a groundbreaking agreement https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-china-tell-nato-stop-expansion-moscow-backs-beijing-taiwan-2022-02-04 with Russia on Friday over Taiwan and against NATO expansion, Xi held meetings with the leaders of Serbia, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan and hosted a banquet at Beijing's Great Hall of the People.
Over 30 foreign leaders travelled to Beijing to attend Friday's opening ceremony. But the United States and other Western countries have subjected the Winter Games to a diplomatic boycott amid rising geopolitical tensions and allegations of human rights abuses in China's northwestern region of Xinjiang.
The Global Times, run by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily, hit back at foreign media reports that the event had attracted only ""authoritarian"" leaders, accusing them in an editorial of using ""outdated anti-China cliches"".
Saturday's Lunar New Year-themed banquet was the first time the Chinese president has joined a gathering of state leaders since before the outbreak of COVID-19 in late 2019. 
Toasting his fellow leaders, Xi expressed ""heartfelt thanks to all governments, peoples and international organisations who care about and support the Beijing Winter Olympics"".
""China has made every effort to overcome the impact of the coronavirus epidemic, earnestly fulfilled its solemn commitments to the international community and ensured the Beijing Winter Olympics is being held as scheduled,"" Xi said in a speech published by Xinhua news agency. 
The People's Daily described strengthened China-Russian relations - announced by Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin after they met on Friday - as ""an important guarantee for maintaining an international strategic balance, world peace and stability"". The Global Times called it the start of a new era ""not defined by the United States"". 
MEETINGS
Xi held individual meetings with Kazakhstan President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic and President Abdel Fatta Al-Sisi of Egypt on Saturday morning, Xinhua news agency reported, discussing Belt and Road-related infrastructure investments and cooperation in the fight against COVID-19.
He also told Turkmenistan President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov that the two sides should deepen cooperation on supplying natural gas to China.
Xi also met Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, while Chinese Premier Li Keqiang held meetings with Ecuador's President Guillermo Lasso, Singapore's President Halimah Yacob and the director general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. 
Kevin Rudd, former prime minister of Australia and president of the Asia Society, described the joint statement issued by Xi and Putin as ""highly significant"". 
It was ""the first time since the Sino-Soviet split that China's taken a definitive position on European security to support Russia on something as fundamental as NATO"", Rudd wrote on Saturday.
The ""no limits"" agreement https://www.reuters.com/world/china/moscow-beijing-partnership-has-no-limits-2022-02-04 for a strategic partnership included Russian support for China's opposition to any form of independence for Taiwan, and China's backing for Russian opposition to further expansion of NATO.

Russia has amassed 100,000 troops near its border with Ukraine as it tries to pressure the country into ruling out future NATO membership for the country. Moscow has denied it plans to invade.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry called the timing of the agreement ""contemptible"", and added that the Chinese government was bringing shame to the spirit of the Games.

691,"<span>Feb 05, 2022 06:40AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Iran’s foreign minister said on Saturday that a U.S. move to restore sanctions waivers to Tehran was not enough and Washington should provide guarantees for the revival of the 2015 nuclear deal with major powers.
Washington on Friday restored the waivers to allow international nuclear cooperation projects, as indirect U.S.-Iranian talks on reviving the nuclear deal enter the final stretch in Vienna.
""The lifting of some sanctions can in itself translate into good faith,” Hossein Amirabdollahian said in comments reported by Iranian media. 
""While what is on paper is good, but it’s not enough,” he added.
Amirabdollahian said one of the major issues in the Vienna talks was getting “guarantees, especially from the West, to fulfil their obligations.”
“We demand guarantees in the political, legal and economic spheres. Certain agreements have already been reached,” he added.
The waivers restored by Washington had allowed Russian, Chinese and European companies to carry out non-proliferation work to effectively make it harder for Iranian nuclear sites to be used for weapons development. The waivers were rescinded by the United States in 2019 and 2020 under former President Donald Trump, who pulled out of the nuclear agreement in 2018.
The United States and Iran have held eight rounds of indirect talks in Vienna since April aimed at reinstating the pact with major powers - the United States, China, Russia, France, Germany and Britain - which lifted sanctions against Tehran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear program.

After Trump pulled the United States out of the deal and reimposed harsh sanctions, Iran gradually started violating the pact's nuclear curbs. Tehran insists its nuclear programme is purely for peaceful purposes.
Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, said in a post on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Saturday: ""Iran's legal right to continue research and development and maintain its peaceful nuclear capabilities and achievements, side by side with its security ... cannot be curbed by any agreement.""

BEIJING (Reuters) -A cross country skier born in Xinjiang, who was one of the two final torchbearers at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics opening ceremony on Friday, was not picked because of where she comes from, the International Olympic Committee said on Saturday.
Dinigeer Yilamujiang, from Altay in China's western Xinjiang region, placed the lit torch onto a giant snowflake along with Zhao Jiawen, a 21-year-old biathlete, before it was lifted high above the spectators at Beijing's Bird's Nest stadium.
The selection of Yilamujiang as one of the final two torchbearers came as many western nations diplomatically boycotted the Winter Games over China's treatment of Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang.
""Obviously the opening ceremony is something that the organising committee put together and there's creative input,"" IOC spokesman Mark Adams said. ""We are involved to a certain extent.""
""This is an athlete who is competing here, she is competing this morning. She has every right, wherever she comes from, whatever her background, to compete... and to take part in any ceremony.""
Games organisers said the final handful of torchbearers who entered the stadium with the flame had been picked based on their birth dates with each having been born in a different decade, starting from the 1950s through to the 2000s.
Yilamujiang is the first Chinese cross-country skiing medallist at any international federation-level event and is a medal hopeful in a sport in which China has not traditionally excelled.
However, she finished tied for 43rd on Saturday in the skiathlon, placing third among the four Chinese skiers in the race. 
Ma Haiyun, an expert on Xinjiang and an associate professor at Frostburg State University in Maryland, said Yilamujiang's selection was intended to send a message.
""By selecting a Uyghur athlete to light the torch, China is trying to address criticism by the West about genocide or persecution of the Uyghurs, and about sinicisation of ethnic minorities,"" he said.
""But I don’t think this can have much effect on the West, which tends to think most of what China puts up is a show anyway,"" Ma added.

Rights groups and some western governments have called for China to end what the United States deems genocide against ethnic Uyghurs. United Nations researchers and rights activists estimate more than one million Muslims have been detained in camps in Xinjiang. 
China rejects accusations of abuse, describing the camps as vocational centres designed to combat extremism, and in late 2019 said all people in the camps had ""graduated"".

Fans watching the climactic moment of Friday's start of the Beijing 2022 Games were left wondering where the usually dramatic burst of flame was, when the final torchbearers placed the lit torch on a large snowflake-shaped metal structure without any further ignition and it was lifted into the air.
The faint flame reflected unity and the original aspiration of human beings, said Zhang Yimou.
""The cauldron and the lighting process have surprised many people. I think this is an innovation,"" the film director, who also directed the Beijing 2008 Summer Games ceremonies, told a press briefing.
Unlike in past Games, where the fire in the cauldron remains a conspicuous symbol of the Olympics throughout the competitions, this flame was so small that even some in the stadium struggled to spot it.
At the 2008 Games, a large cauldron rose above the rim of the stadium for people to see from far away.
""The micro-flame shows that even a little spark can start a prairie fire. This is the original aspiration of human beings and the Olympics spirit,"" Zhang said.
The giant snowflake comprises 91 small flakes representing the 91 competing nations and regions, Zhang said, ""as if the entire world is carefully protecting the flame"".
Zhang said the ""micro-flame"" also conveyed a low-carbon and environmental-friendly idea, with China having pledged to stage a green Games.
Beijing Olympic organisers have said all torches used at the Games were made from carbon fibre materials and fuelled by hydrogen.
Reactions were mixed among Chinese internet users.
""I cannot approve this arrangement. (The cauldron) is nothing rare. And because it's visually too small, it has lost its solemn status in people's heart,"" wrote user ""uncle without ambition"" on China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) social media platform.
Others appreciated the design and thought the cauldron was the show's highlight.

""I like this kind of low-keyed expression. It is a full expression of self-confidence. Today's China has the qualification and confidence to change the inherent rules,"" wrote ""Weifengluoluolan"" online.
The Olympic flame will be burning at the three competition zones - Beijing, Yanqing and Zhangjiakou - for the limited number of visitors to see.

China is home to around two million ethnic Koreans, half of whom live on the Chinese side of the North Korean border, and they are a recognised minority group whose language and culture are granted official protection.
South Koreans have expressed ire in the past over recent Chinese claims that some aspects of Korean culture such as kimchi, a Korean side dish made with fermented cabbage, or traditional Korean dress called hanbok, are of Chinese origin.
""We deeply regret that hanbok appeared among the costumes of Chinese minorities at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics,"" wrote ruling party lawmaker Lee So-young in her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page on Saturday, referring to a woman dressed in a white top and pink dress among people that passed the Chinese flag during the ceremony. 
""This is not the first time China has introduced Korean culture as if it were its own... If the anti-China sentiment of the Korean people becomes stronger by leaving this issue as is, it will be a big obstacle when conducting diplomacy with China in the future,"" Lee said. 
Lee Jae-myung, the ruling Democratic Party of Korea candidate for the country's presidential election in March, wrote in his Facebook page late on Friday, ""Do not covet (our) culture. Oppose cultural appropriation"". 
The main opposition People Power Party (PPP) called the costume's appearance a ""rude"" act of appropriating the culture of a sovereign state, which overshadows the Games' slogan of ""together for a shared future"". 

""We cannot remain angry, but make the world more aware of the truth that hanbok is a traditional Korean costume,"" Seo Kyoung-duk, a professor at Sungshin Women's University and activist promoting South Korean culture, wrote in his Instagram account. 
Although the South Korean government has not expressed an official statement, Culture Minister Hwang Hee told South Korean media on Saturday that referring to people as a minority means it hasn't become a sovereign country, which could cause ""misunderstanding"" in bilateral relations, according to Yonhap.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) -The key to solving the issue of North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear programs is in the United States' hands, China's U.N. envoy said on Friday, urging Washington to show ""more sincerity and flexibility"" if it wants a breakthrough.
""They should come up with more attractive and more practical, more flexible approaches, policies and actions in accommodating concerns"" of North Korea, Ambassador Zhang Jun told reporters. ""The key in solving this issue is already in the hands of the United States.
He spoke ahead of a closed U.N. Security Council meeting, which was requested by the United States to discuss North Korea's launch of an intermediate-range ballistic missile last Sunday.
After the meeting, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield told reporters: ""We have to keep up the pressure.""
She also read a joint statement by more than half the U.N. Security Council condemning North Korea's latest missile launch and warning that continued silence by the 15-member body would only embolden Pyongyang. 
The eight council members - the United States, Albania, Brazil, France, Ireland, Norway, the United Arab Emirates and Britain - and Japan described Sunday's launch as a ""significant escalation"" that ""seeks to further destabilize the region.""
They said North Korea had carried out nine ballistic missiles launches in January, describing it as the largest number in a single month in the history of its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs.
TESTS BANNED
Nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches by North Korea are banned by the U.N. Security Council. Diplomats said the United States has proposed the council issue a statement. 
""We call on all council members to speak with one voice in condemning these dangerous and unlawful acts,"" the eight council members and Japan said in the statement. ""The cost of the council's ongoing silence is too high. It will embolden the DPRK to further defy the international community.""
Zhang said the council should only issue a statement if it is ""helpful for the de-escalation of the tensions."" Such statements by the council have to be agreed by consensus.
North Korea confirmed on Monday https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkorea-says-tested-hwasong-12-missile-sunday-2022-01-30 it had launched a Hwasong-12 ballistic missile, the same weapon it had once threatened to target the U.S. territory of Guam with, sparking fears the nuclear-armed state could resume long-range testing. 
It was the first time North Korea had tested a nuclear-capable missile of that size since 2017. 
Pyongyang had put nuclear weapons tests and long-range ballistic missile launches on hold while leader Kim Jong Un met with then-U.S. President Donald Trump in Singapore in 2018 and Vietnam in 2019.
Zhang cited those meetings and the suspension of tests, asking: ""What has been done by the U.S.?""
Thomas-Greenfield said launches of other ballistic missiles had continued over the past few years and that U.S. President Joe Biden could not commit to a meeting with Kim until Washington had ""a better sense of what there is to achieve.""
Diplomacy with North Korea has stalled since the summits between Trump and Kim, which failed to produce a deal. Pyongyang wants U.S. and U.N. sanctions to be removed. There has been no easing of any U.S. or U.N. measures, but China and Russia have said the Security Council should consider such a move.

Thomas-Greenfield said there was no reason for the council to ""reward"" Pyongyang for its ballistic missile tests.
""We continue to urge (North Korea) to respond positively to the offers from the United States and others to meet without preconditions,"" the eight council members and Japan said.

(Reuters) -Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey announced on Friday a moratorium on no-knock warrants after police fatally shot a 22-year-old Black man during a raid on an apartment.
The Minneapolis Police Department released video and a still image showing the man, Amir Locke, holding a gun as he twisted around beneath a blanket after being roused by officers who entered the apartment on Wednesday to carry out a search warrant.
A no-knock warrant authorizes police officers to enter a property without first knocking and announcing their presence.
""To ensure safety of both the public and officers until a new policy is crafted, I'm issuing a moratorium on both the request and execution of such warrants in Minneapolis,"" Frey said in a statement.
The incident is the latest to put the Minneapolis police department under scrutiny.
Almost two years ago, George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, was killed by a white officer who knelt on his neck for over nine minutes during an arrest. Outrage over Floyd's death sparked a nationwide movement challenging police brutality and bias in the U.S. criminal justice system.
The video of Locke's arrest, which was released on Thursday, shows police unlocking his apartment with a key, and officers shouting, ""Police, search warrant, get on the ground, get on the fucking ground,"" as they entered.
An officer then kicks at the couch where Locke was lying and as Locke turns, an arm comes out from beneath the blanket, showing a gun held in the hand. Almost immediately, police fired at least three shots.
Locke was not named in the search warrant, which was issued in relation to a homicide investigation that is being run by the neighboring Saint Paul Police Department, Minneapolis Police Department interim chief Amelia Huffman said on Thursday.
Locke's parents described their son as a talented musician, beloved member of his community, and law-abiding citizen at a news conference on Friday with their lawyer, prominent civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who also represented Floyd's family.
""I'm going to fight every day, throughout the day, 365 days, to make sure that Amir Rahkare Locke gets justice for being executed by the MPD,"" said Locke's mother, Karen Locke. ""We are going to make sure that we speak loudly for Amir.""
In a statement released on Wednesday, the Minneapolis Police Department said that the man had a ""handgun pointed in the direction of the officers.""
During a news conference on Thursday, Huffman said the county's attorney will review the facts, in response to a question noting that the video appeared to show that Locke's gun was pointed toward the floor.
""As there's a gun emerging in your direction, you are forced to make a split-second decision on when it's a threat,"" Huffman added.
In commenting on the search warrant in the homicide probe, Huffman said, ""It is unclear at this time how he or if he was connected to the Saint Paul's investigation."" 
She added that officers from the Saint Paul's Police Department were at the scene later and had recovered possible evidence for the homicide investigation.
According to the family's lawyers, Locke had no criminal history and legally possessed a firearm at the time of his death.

""In the wake of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, the City of Minneapolis told the public that it was limiting the use of no-knock warrants to 'limit the likelihood of bad outcomes.' Less than two years later, Amir Locke and his family needlessly suffered the worst possible outcome,"" Jeff Storms, another lawyer representing Locke's family in the case, said in a statement.
Taylor, a Black woman, was shot and killed when armed police raided her Kentucky apartment in March 2020. Floyd was killed in May 2020.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. raid in Syria that led to the death of Islamic State's leader is a much-needed national security win for President Joe Biden after the messy withdrawal from Afghanistan while he tries to project an image of strength in a standoff with Russia over Ukraine, analysts said. 
Islamic State leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Quraishi, blew himself up as U.S. forces approached. The raid on the jihadist leader came after months of planning and was authorized by Biden earlier this week. 
As well as dealing a blow to ISIS, the raid came at a good time for Biden, who is locked in a tense strategic tussle with Russia over Ukraine. John Bolton, a former national security adviser to President Donald Trump, said the successful operation could show strength to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
""It can't hurt in the sense that it was a clear win,"" he acknowledged. ""A lot of people should take notice of that,"" said Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush.
U.S. prestige suffered from the chaotic pullout from Afghanistan last August after 20 years of war. Even though his predecessor Trump also favored a withdrawal and agreed a deal with the Taliban, Biden's poll numbers dived after the messy withdrawal.
David Gergen, a former aide to Democratic and Republican presidents, said the Afghanistan chaos still hangs over Biden's foreign policy record despite the success against Islamic State.
""I think the trouble he faces in the international scene is stickier than it looks. It's going to be hard to reverse public opinion,"" Gergen said. 
Bolton, one of the main foreign policy hawks in the former Bush administration, said going after Quraishi in northwestern Syria was ""the right thing to do."" But the legacy of Afghanistan still weighs heavily on Biden despite the raid, he said. 
""I don't think it can repair the damage that was done to his credibility and America's credibility by withdrawing from Afghanistan.""
Another stern test for Biden is the standoff with Russia over Ukraine. The United States and other Western nations say Russia's massing of some 100,000 troops along the Ukraine border could be a prelude for an invasion.
""I think the overall question is going to be how this gets resolved with the Russians,"" Gergen said. ""He's going to be tested on toughness. But he's also going to be tested on competence.""
POLITICAL GAINS? 
At home, Biden is stuck in a months-long slump in the polls, reflecting Americans' frustration over the COVID-19 pandemic and inflation-plagued economy. That worries Democrats ahead of November's midterm elections.
While the midterms are months away and foreign policy is not a main priority for voters, demonstrating command in the raid on Quraishi and standing up to Putin can be helpful to Biden's position with U.S. voters, said David Axelrod, a former adviser to President Barack Obama.
""One of his problems right now is that the world seems out of control - everyday events in people's lives. They're looking for Biden to show command, so any opportunity to do that is valuable,"" Axelrod said. ""These things are valuable from a political standpoint. Shows of strength are valuable."" 
Biden traveled to New York on Thursday to meet with the city's mayor, Eric Adams, a former police officer, and called for greater investments in local police departments and social services. Republicans have suggested Biden is weak on crime and tried to tie him to calls by some Democrats to ""defund"" the police. Biden has rejected the ""defund"" push.
Gergen said the Democratic president seems to be making an effort to project strength. ""I do think Biden is trying to toughen up in the public eye,"" he said.
Biden beat Trump in the 2020 election in part by arguing he would bring competence to the job, and he enjoyed approval ratings close to 60% during his first few months in office. They fell to the lowest level of his presidency this week according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll, which found 41% of U.S. adults approved of his performance in office and 56% disapproved. 

The combination of the Syria raid and the New York visit could offset some Republican criticism, said Mo Elleithee, executive director of Georgetown University’s Institute of Politics and Public Service.
""It's hard to argue someone is weak on fighting terror ... after they've taken out, you know, one of the world's top terrorists,"" Elleithee said. ""He was able to show results - important results - in national security, and I think you see him appearing like the grown-up in the room on crime.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Lawyer Michael Avenatti, who rose to fame for taking on then-U.S. President Donald Trump before a string of criminal charges ended his legal career, was convicted on Friday of defrauding a former client, porn star Stormy Daniels. 
Avenatti, who faces up to 22 years behind bars, had pleaded not guilty to embezzling nearly $300,000 in book proceeds intended for Daniels.
The verdict by a federal jury in Manhattan followed a two-week trial in which the brash, 50-year-old lawyer represented himself. 
Avenatti, who is based in Los Angeles, agreed to surrender to U.S. marshals in California on Monday. Sentencing was scheduled for May 24.
Following the verdict, Avenatti, who was wearing a black mask and a suit with a diamond-patterned tie, switched his gaze back and forth between the jury and down at the table he was sitting at. 
He vowed to appeal.
""I am very disappointed in the jury's verdict,"" Avenatti said. ""I am looking forward to a full adjudication of all the issues on appeal."" 
It was the second time in two years that Avenatti was convicted on federal charges in Manhattan. ""Rather than advise his clients in their best interests, Avenatti instead used his law degree as a license to steal,"" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement.
Daniels, the prosecution's star witness https://www.reuters.com/world/us/porn-star-stormy-daniels-testifies-against-fallen-lawyer-michael-avenatti-2022-01-27, testified that Avenatti had led her to believe her publisher had not disbursed advance payments totaling $297,500 for her memoir, ""Full Disclosure,"" when she asked in 2018 and early 2019 about the delays.
She said she later learned that Avenatti had diverted the money to an account he controlled, without telling her. 
""I felt very betrayed and stupid,"" Daniels said. ""Michael had been lying and stealing from me.""
In a statement following the verdict, Daniels' lawyer, Clark Brewster, said his client was ""relieved this nightmare is over.""
""Mr. Avenatti possessed the uncanny ability to steadfastly deny the crimes and persuade others he was entitled to the embezzled funds,"" Brewster said. ""Stormy is pleased that the justice system worked.""
Avenatti had downplayed the dispute as a disagreement over legal fees. He said his contract with Daniels, 42, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford, entitled him to a reasonable share of her book and media proceeds.
Avenatti called no witnesses https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/avenatti-does-not-plan-testify-his-defense-stormy-daniels-us-fraud-case-2022-01-31 and did not testify in his own defense. Asked after the verdict whether he regretted his decision to represent himself, he said, ""No. Not at all."" 
The highlight of the trial was Avenatti's five-hour cross-examination of Daniels, where he sought to undermine his former client's credibility by exposing her interest in paranormal activities https://www.reuters.com/world/us/michael-avenatti-cross-examines-ex-client-stormy-daniels-his-fraud-trial-2022-01-28.
Daniels, who is producing a documentary-style TV show on ghost hunting called ""Spooky Babes,"" testified that she believed she could speak with the dead.
The spectacle of Avenatti questioning Daniels capped a public falling-out for a pair who became cable TV mainstays in 2018 for cases they brought against Trump. 
Daniels is known for receiving $130,000 in hush money from Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in exchange for remaining quiet ahead of the 2016 election about sexual encounters she says she had with Trump, which he has denied.
Avenatti was successful in freeing Daniels from her nondisclosure agreement with Trump.
He gained widespread recognition through frequent television appearances that made him a hero to some Trump opponents, prompting him to flirt with running for the White House as a Democrat in 2020 against the Republican president.

But Avenatti was hit with dozens of criminal charges in March and April 2019 accusing him of cheating Daniels, defrauding several other clients, trying to extort up to $25 million from  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE), and other crimes. 
He is appealing his conviction and 2-1/2-year prison sentence in the Nike case in New York. A federal court trial in California over the other alleged client frauds, in which Avenatti also represented himself, ended in a mistrial. The remaining charges have yet to be tried.

699,"<span>Feb 04, 2022 10:40PM ET</span>",,,,,,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan on Saturday condemned as ""contemptible"" the timing of China and Russia's ""no limits"" partnership at the start of the Winter Olympics, saying the Chinese government was bringing shame to the spirit of the Games.
China and Russia, at a meeting of their leaders hours before the Winter Olympics officially opened, backed each other over standoffs on Ukraine and Taiwan with a promise to collaborate more against the West.
Russia voiced its support for China's stance that democratically-governed Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and opposition to any form of independence for the island.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said China's continued false claims the island is part of the People's Republic of China were exactly the same as the country's habit of spreading fake news.
""It not only increases the Taiwanese people's disgust at and loathing for the Chinese government's arrogance and bullying, it also clearly shows all the world's countries the sinister face of the Chinese Communist regime's aggression, expansionism and damaging of peace.""
At a time when the world's eyes are focused on the Winter Olympics and cheering on their athletes, the Chinese government has used the Russian summit to engage in the expansion of authoritarianism, the ministry added.
""This is an insult to the peaceful spirit embodied by the Olympic Rings, and will be spurned by Taiwan's people and held in contempt by democratic countries.""
The United States has also criticised the meeting, saying Chinese President Xi Jinping should have used the meeting to push for lowering of tensions in Ukraine.
The Olympics, to which Taiwan has sent a small team of four athletes to compete, is happening at a time of heightened tensions between Taipei and Beijing, with China regularly sending military ships and aircraft near the island.

While Russia is a close friend of China's, both Russia and Taiwan maintain small de facto embassies in each other's capitals.
Former Taiwan President Chiang Ching-kuo, who began tentative democratic reforms, spoke Russian and was married to a Russian lady he met while working there in the 1930s.

(Reuters) -In a sharp rebuke of his former boss, former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Friday that Donald Trump was wrong to believe Pence had the power to reverse the outcome of the 2020 presidential election that Trump has falsely claimed was stolen from him.
After losing his re-election campaign to Democrat Joe Biden in November 2020, the Republican Trump in a bid to stay in office pressured Pence to block congressional certification of the results while presiding over the proceedings on Jan. 6, 2021.
Pence, a loyal lieutenant during the four years of Trump's tumultuous presidency, opted not to block certification.
Trump has often disparaged Pence since then, and on Sunday issued a fresh statement saying the former vice president could have ""overturned"" the election. 
""President Trump is wrong,"" Pence said in a speech to the Federalist Society, a conservative legal organization, in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. ""I had no right to overturn the election.""
""The presidency belongs to the American people, and the American people alone. And frankly there is no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president,"" Pence added. 
Pence's comments represented his most forceful criticism of Trump to date. A Trump spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
""I understand the disappointment many feel about the last election. I was on the ballot,"" Pence said. ""Whatever the future holds, I know we did our duty that day. John Quincy Adams reminds us: Duty is ours; results are God's,"" Pence added, quoting a 19th century U.S. president.
""And the truth is there's more at stake than our party or political fortunes. Men and women: if we lose faith in the Constitution, we won't just lose elections, we'll lose our country,"" Pence added.
Trump issued a statement later on Friday disagreeing with Pence. 
""I was right and everyone knows it. If there is fraud or large scale irregularities, it would have been appropriate to send those votes back to the legislatures to figure it out,"" the former president said.
'DARK DAY' 
While Pence was presiding over the certification, a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a failed bid to stop the certification. Pence and U.S. lawmakers inside the Capitol fled from the rioters.
In his speech on Friday, Pence called Jan. 6 a ""dark day.""
His comments stand in contrast to the Republican Party, which on Friday censured https://www.reuters.com/world/us/loyal-trump-republican-party-moves-censure-us-reps-cheney-kinzinger-2022-02-04 Republican U.S. Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger for joining a House of Representatives select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack. The party said the Democrat-led inquiry was persecuting ""ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse.""
Some Republicans aligned with Trump have made the false election claims a key part of their campaigns https://www.reuters.com/world/us/georgia-governors-race-tests-trumps-stolen-election-claims-2021-12-20 heading into the November 2022 midterm elections in which the party is seeking to win back control of Congress from the Democrats. Around 55% of Republicans nationally think the 2020 election was stolen, according to Reuters/Ipsos polls.
Trump, who continues to have a strong grip over the party more than a year after he left office, has hinted he could run for president again in 2024.
At a rally in Texas on Saturday, he said that if he were to win in 2024, he would pardon people charged with criminal offenses https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-would-pardon-jan-6-rioters-if-he-runs-wins-2022-01-30 in connection with the Jan. 6 riot.
In a speech moments before the Jan. 6 attack, Trump repeated his false claims that the election was stolen through widespread voting fraud. Trump called upon Pence to ""do the right thing"" and block certification of the election results, while urging his supporters to go to the Capitol to ""stop the steal.""
Later, some of the rioters at the Capitol chanted ""Hang Mike Pence"" and some set up a makeshift gallows.

Olivia Troye, a former national security aide to Pence who has become a Trump critic, said it was the first time she had heard her former boss publicly say Trump was wrong. 
""It's a start,"" Troye wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Ottawa police vowed on Friday to crack down on an ""increasingly dangerous"" protest by hundreds of truckers who have shut down the center of the Canadian capital for eight days to demand an end to COVID-19 vaccine mandates.
The well-organized blockade, which police say has relied partly on funding from sympathizers in the United States, is unprecedented by Canadian standards. Hundreds more truckers planned to enter the city this weekend, Ottawa police chief Peter Sloly said.
""This remains ... an increasingly volatile and increasingly dangerous demonstration,"" he told reporters.
Protesters in the downtown core ""remain highly organized, well-funded, extremely committed to resisting all attempts to end the demonstration safely,"" he added.
Some want an end to a federal COVID-19 vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers while others insist Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau be deposed on the grounds he exceeded his authority by imposing restrictions to tackle the pandemic.
GoFundMe took down the Freedom Convoy's donation page on Friday, saying it was in violation of its terms of service.
""We now have evidence from law enforcement that the previously peaceful demonstration has become an occupation, with police reports of violence and other unlawful activity,"" the website said in a statement. 
It said donors had until Feb. 19 to request a full refund, then it will ""work with organizers to send all remaining funds to credible and established charities verified by GoFundMe.""
In the western province of Alberta, where truckers have been blocking a major border crossing with the United States in a similar protest, premier Jason Kenney said ministers would meet early next week to start lifting restrictions.
""We can, and must, get on with our lives, restore our freedoms, and live with joy, not fear,"" he wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Sloly, who said he and other top officials had received death threats, likened the protest to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot in Washington when thousands of supporters of former president Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol in a bid to overturn Joe Biden's election victory.
Trump said the truckers were ""peacefully protesting the harsh policies of far left lunatic Justin Trudeau who has destroyed Canada with insane Covid mandates"".
To the increasing fury of residents https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/ottawans-fed-up-with-trucker-blockade-blame-police-inaction-2022-02-03, Ottawa police have so far largely stood by and watched as some protesters smashed windows, threatened reporters and health care workers and abused racial minorities. 
Sloly said police would put in place a ""surge and contain"" strategy, including reinforcements of 150 officers deployed downtown, to restore order.
""The hatred, the violence, the illegal acts that Ottawa residences and businesses have endured over the last week are unacceptable,"" he said.
Blockades are also planned in Quebec City and Toronto, where authorities closed off access to the city centers.
""We all want to do everything we can to avoid the situation we are seeing in Ottawa,"" said Toronto mayor John Tory.
The protest is dividing the official opposition Conservative Party, which this week ousted its leader https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/main-rival-canadas-trudeau-ousted-after-losing-party-confidence-vote-2022-02-02 amid complaints he had not sufficiently backed the truckers.
Interim Conservative chief Candice Bergen, in an email leaked to the Globe and Mail, said on Monday ""we need to turn this into the PM's problem"" and saw no need to ask the truckers to leave.

Bergen issued a statement on Friday asking Trudeau to provide a clear plan to end the blockade and urging the truck drivers to remain peaceful.
The party's public safety spokesman, Pierre Paul-Hus, tweeted on Friday that the blockade needed to end. Fellow legislator Dean Allison then tweeted that Paul-Hus was wrong.

(Reuters) - Baltimore's top prosecutor, Marilyn Mosby, pleaded not guilty on Friday to federal charges of perjury and making false statements on loan applications stemming from her purchase of two Florida vacation homes.
Mosby, the Baltimore city state's attorney since 2015, has said she is innocent of wrongdoing and the victim of a politically motivated prosecution by adversaries in the Maryland U.S. Attorney's Office trying to smear her as she runs for a third term.
Online court records showed Mosby entered not guilty pleas to all four counts contained in an indictment returned by a federal grand jury on Jan. 13.
During a 15-minute arraignment before a federal magistrate in Baltimore, Mosby answered several perfunctory questions and told the judge, ""Your honor, I would plead not guilty to all four counts,"" according to The Washington Post.
Mosby is accused of twice falsely claiming to have suffered a work-related financial hardship from COVID-19 in order to request two early withdrawals totaling $90,000 from her city employee retirement account.
Prosecutors said Mosby, 42, used that money - $36,000 in May 2020 and $45,000 on Dec. 31 of that year - toward down payments on two vacation homes in Florida, in Kissimmee and Long Boat Key.
The two counts of perjury stem from Mosby's allegedly false statements of coronavirus-related financial duress at a time when she was earning a gross annual salary of nearly $248,000 in full, according to the indictment.
She is also charged with two counts of making false statements on mortgage applications seeking a total of more than $900,000 in loans to buy the Florida properties. The indictment says Mosby failed to disclose federal tax delinquencies resulting in a $45,000 lien imposed by the Internal Revenue Service in 2020.
Her lawyer has said Mosby was unaware of a ""tax lien issue"" at the time.

Mosby said political opponents ""have had a target on my back"" since she made national headlines in 2015 by filing criminal charges against six police officers in the death of Freddie Gray, a young Black man who suffered a fatal spinal injury while being transported in the back of a police van. None of the six officers charged in his death was convicted.
Mosby, whose husband, Nick Mosby, is president of the Baltimore City Council, ran for office as a part of a movement of ""progressive prosecutors"" promising to address systemic racism in the U.S. criminal justice system.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Republican Party on Friday censured U.S. Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger for joining Congress' investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack and Donald Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential election defeat, calling the probe an attack on ""legitimate political discourse.""
Cheney and Kinzinger are the only Republicans on the House of Representatives Jan. 6 select committee. The panel is investigating who -- including people in Trump's circle -- had any role in planning or enabling the worst assault on the U.S. Capitol since the War of 1812.
The resolution censuring Cheney and Kinzinger, approved at a Republican National Committee meeting in Salt Lake City, accused them of ""participating in a Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse.""
Thousands of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol that day, smashing windows, assaulting police officers and sending lawmakers and then-Vice President Mike Pence running for their lives after Trump made a fiery speech repeating his false claims that his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud.
Friday's vote was dramatically different in tone from a statement the Republican National Committee released the day of the attack, when it said ""these violent scenes we have witnessed do not represent acts of patriotism, but an attack on our country and its founding principles.""
RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said Friday's resolution targeted the Jan. 6 committee probe, which has subpoenaed a range of politicians and Trump White House aides as it tries to piece together their role in events leading to the assault. 
""Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger crossed a line. They chose to join Nancy Pelosi in a Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens who engaged in legitimate political discourse that had nothing to do with violence at the Capitol,"" she said. She said she ""condemned violence on both sides of the aisle.""
The resolution passed on a voice vote as 168 members of the RNC gathered for their winter meeting. The yes votes were overwhelming, with a handful of nays, according to reporters at the meeting.
Cheney and Kinzinger voted to impeach Trump on a charge of incitement of insurrection, and they joined the seven Democrats on the panel investigating the attack.
The resolution said Cheney and Kinzinger have damaged Republican efforts to win back majorities in Congress. 
The measure said the RNC will ""immediately cease any and all support of them"" as party members, but stops short of calling for their ouster from the party, as initially proposed. The committee uses some of its funds to help support Republican candidates in their campaigns.
Trump, who retains a strong grip over his party as the Nov. 8 midterm congressional elections draw closer, has been on the warpath against Republicans who have taken a stand against him. Republicans are trying to take control of both the House and the Senate from President Joe Biden's Democrats.
'PERSONS OF CONSCIENCE'
Both lawmakers issued statements in anticipation of Friday's vote. 
""The leaders of the Republican Party have made themselves willing hostages to a man who admits he tried to overturn a presidential election and suggests he would pardon Jan. 6 defendants, some of whom have been charged with seditious conspiracy,"" Cheney said, referring to the hundreds of Trump supporters accused of various crimes in the violent attack. 
Four people died on Jan. 6, and a Capitol Police officer died the next day. About 140 police officers were injured, and four later died by suicide.
Cheney said she does not recognize those in her party who ""abandoned the Constitution to embrace Donald Trump,"" who has endorsed her challenger in the Wyoming Republican primary.
Kinzinger, who is not seeking re-election, said he has been a conservative Republican since before Trump entered politics. He vowed to continue ""working to fight the political matrix that's led us to this point.""
House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, in an interview with Fox News, did not comment on the censure but criticized the House committee as purely political.
Not all Republicans are lining up against the two. 
Republican Senator Mitt Romney praised Cheney and Kinzinger as honorable in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post on Friday. ""Shame falls on a party that would censure persons of conscience, who seek truth in the face of vitriol,"" he wrote.

At least 71 Republican members of Congress transferred money https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/republican-us-lawmakers-funnel-money-colleagues-who-crossed-trump-2022-02-01 last year to the campaigns of congressional Republicans, including Cheney's, that supported booting Trump from office, a Reuters analysis found. 
Republican Senator Bill Cassidy came to their defense late Thursday, writing on Twitter, ""The RNC is censuring Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger because they are trying to find out what happened on January 6th - HUH?""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. forces rehearsed the helicopter raid over and over, hoping to capture Islamic State's leader on the third floor of a residential building in a Syrian town on the Turkish border, where he was holed up with his family.
But before they could reach him, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Quraishi detonated a suicide bomb, triggering a large explosion that blew mangled bodies -- including his own -- out of the building into the streets outside.
President Joe Biden, who monitored the raid from the White House's Situation Room, called Quraishi's suicide a ""final act of desperate cowardice."" It echoed of the self-detonation of a bomb by his predecessor, Islamic State founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, during a U.S. raid in 2019 in Syria.
For residents in the town of Atmeh, the events were terrifying, as U.S. forces swept in aboard helicopters before trying to evacuate civilians from the cinder-block building, using loudspeakers to tell them to leave.
""Men, women, and children raise your hands. You are in safety of the American coalition that is surrounding the area. You will die if you don't get out,"" said one woman recounting the U.S. warnings.
Marine General Frank McKenzie, who oversees U.S. forces in the region and was providing updates to Biden, said U.S. troops got six civilians, including four children, to leave the first floor of the building before the blast ripped apart the top floor. 
""The explosion, which was more massive than would be expected from a suicide vest, killed everyone on the third floor and in fact ejected multiple people from the building,"" McKenzie said, adding that Quraishi, his wife and two children died.
A second U.S. official later said two of Quraishi's wives and one child were killed.
As U.S. troops advanced to the second floor, one of Quraishi's lieutenants and his wife started firing on the Americans and were killed. One child was found dead there, McKenzie said, and three other children and an infant were brought to safety from the second floor. 
Syrian rescue workers said at least 13 people died, most of them women and children.
The Pentagon said at least two armed members of a local al Qaeda affiliate were killed by gunfire from a U.S. helicopter after they approached the scene of the raid while U.S. troops were still at the site. 
TARGET ON THIRD FLOOR
U.S. officials said Quraishi's death was another setback for a group that once ruled a self-proclaimed caliphate stretching across territory in Syria and Iraq. It is now waging insurgent attacks. 
Planning for the operation began in early December, when officials became convinced the Islamic State leader was living in the building, the officials said. Biden received a detailed briefing on options for capturing Quraishi alive on Dec. 20, a senior White House official said.
One official said the operation was complicated by the fact Quraishi rarely left his residence on the building's third floor and relied on couriers to interact with the outside world.
The number of children seen in the area and families believed to be living on the first floor led U.S. officials to try to craft a mission aiming to safeguard civilians, they said. 
That ultimately required putting U.S. forces at risk in a raid, instead of launching a remote strike, the officials said.
U.S. military procedures to guard against civilian casualties are under scrutiny following a high-profile mistaken drone strike in Kabul during the U.S. evacuation of civilians from Afghanistan that the Pentagon initially hailed a success. 
The Pentagon said it would review all the information from the Atmeh raid to ensure no civilians were harmed by U.S. forces, but stressed all indications so far were that civilian deaths were caused by Islamic State fighters themselves.
Biden gave final approvals for the mission on Tuesday during an Oval Office meeting with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and General Mark Milley, who as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the top American military officer, U.S. officials said.
Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and other administration officials received real-time updates from Austin, Milley and McKenzie as they watched the operation unfold on several screens from the Situation Room, the officials said.
Biden joined the group in the Situation Room around 5 p.m. ET on Wednesday after finishing a call with French President Emmanuel Macron on an unrelated topic, the White House official said.
At one point, a helicopter involved in the raid suffered a mechanical failure and had to be destroyed rather than left behind, the Pentagon said. 
Biden said ""God bless our troops"" once U.S. forces were wheels up after the operation, and kept tabs on them during the night as they flew to safety, officials said.
Once U.S. forces were in safety, Biden reflected on an airstrike carried out in 2015 - when he was serving as vice president - that killed another ISIS leader and injured Quraishi, costing him a leg, the White House official said.

Milley told Biden that U.S. forces hit ""a visual ID jackpot"" when they viewed Quraishi's body and confirmed his identity using biometric data taken from a fingerprint during the flight back, the official said. They waited to announce his death until after a DNA test was completed, the official added.
""He was on our target list from the earliest days of the campaign. He was Baghdadi's right-hand man, and ... was personally responsible for some of the most vicious ISIS atrocities,"" the official.

BEIJING/ MOSCOW/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China and Russia on the opening day of the Winter Olympics declared a ""no limits"" partnership, backing each other over standoffs on Ukraine and Taiwan with a promise to collaborate more against the West.
President Xi Jinping hosted President Vladimir Putin on Friday as the two nations said their relationship was superior to any Cold War era alliance and they would work together on space, climate change, artificial intelligence and control of the internet.
Beijing supported Russia's demand that Ukraine should not be admitted into NATO, as the Kremlin amasses 100,000 troops near its neighbour, while Moscow opposed any form of independence for Taiwan, as global powers jostle over their spheres of influence.
""Friendship between the two States has no limits, there are no 'forbidden' areas of cooperation,"" the two countries said in a joint statement. 
The timing of their announcement was highly symbolic, at a China-hosted Olympics that the United States has subjected to a diplomatic boycott.
The agreement marked the most detailed and assertive statement of Russian and Chinese resolve to work together to build a new international order based on their view of human rights and democracy.
Putin used the occasion to trumpet a new gas deal with China worth an estimated $117.5 billion, promising to ramp up Russia's Far East exports. 
The United States hit back, saying Xi should have used the meeting to push for lowering of tensions in Ukraine.
Such an approach is what the world expects from ""responsible powers,"" the U.S. State Department's top diplomat for East Asia Daniel Kritenbrink said. 
""If Russia further invades Ukraine and China looks the other way, it suggests that China is willing to tolerate or tacitly support Russia’s efforts to coerce Ukraine...""
Moscow denies it is planning an invasion of Ukraine.
Daniel Russel of the Asia Society think tank, who served as the U.S. State Department's top diplomat for East Asia in the Obama administration, said Xi and Putin were ""announcing their determination to stand together and to stand against the U.S. and the West — ready to withstand sanctions and contest American global leadership"".
While not formally allied, the two ""are making common cause as a tactical matter to better defend their respective interests and their authoritarian systems from Western pressure"", he said.
MUTUAL SUPPORT
The two countries have moved closer together as both have come under pressure from the West on human rights and other issues.
In the lengthy document - nearly 5,400 words in English translation - each went significantly further than before in backing the other on flashpoints of tension with the West.
- Russia voiced its support for China's stance that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and opposition to any form of independence for the island. 
- Moscow and Beijing also voiced their opposition to the AUKUS alliance between Australia, Britain and the United States, saying it increased the danger of an arms race in the region.
- China joined Russia in calling for an end to NATO enlargement and supported its demand for security guarantees from the West.
- They expressed concern about ""the advancement of U.S. plans to develop global missile defence and deploy its elements in various regions of the world, combined with capacity building of high-precision non-nuclear weapons for disarming strikes and other strategic objectives"".
Elsewhere, without naming Washington, they criticised attempts by ""certain states"" to establish global hegemony, fan confrontation and impose their own standards of democracy.
Scott Kennedy, a China expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that despite the rhetoric, there would be limits to the alliance.
""China is willing to stand with Russia through thin but not thick,"" he said. ""If a war breaks out over Ukraine or Taiwan, we can expect this partnership to fracture.""
TECH AND ENERGY
In the technology arena, Russia and China said they were ready to strengthen cooperation on artificial intelligence and information security.
They said they believed that ""any attempts to limit their sovereign right to regulate national segments of the Internet and ensure their security are unacceptable"".
Meanwhile Russian state energy giants Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) and Rosneft on Friday agreed new gas and oil supply deals with Beijing worth tens of billions of dollars.
The deals capitalise on Putin's drive to diversify Russian energy exports away from the West, which started shortly after he came to power in 1999. Since then Russia has become China's top energy supplier and cut its reliance on the West for revenues.
The Kremlin said the presidents also discussed the need to broaden trade in national currencies because of unpredictability surrounding the use of the dollar.

U.S. President Joe Biden has said Russian companies could be cut off from the ability to trade in dollars as part of sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine.
The first of 2,000 American troops sent to reinforce NATO allies in Eastern Europe and Germany arrived on Friday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives on Friday narrowly passed a multibillion-dollar bill https://www.reuters.com/business/us-house-leaders-set-unveil-chips-china-competition-bill-2022-01-25 aimed at increasing American competitiveness with China and boosting U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, despite Republican opposition.
The Democratic-majority House backed the ""America COMPETES Act of 2022"" by 222-210, almost entirely along party lines. One Republican joined Democrats in voting for the measure and one Democrat voted no. 
The vote took place hours after the opening ceremony https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/after-fraught-games-run-up-beijing-turns-opening-ceremony-2022-02-04 for the Beijing Winter Olympics, amid criticism in Congress of the International Olympic Committee for awarding the Games to China. Human rights groups have long criticized China's rights record, allegations China denies.
The bill's passage by the House set up negotiations with the Senate on a compromise version of the legislation, which must pass both chambers before it can be sent to the White House for President Joe Biden's signature. 
The talks could take weeks or months, although Biden urged quick action in a statement praising what he called ""vital"" legislation.
""Every day we delay we fall farther behind and that increases our domestic national security risk,"" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told a news conference.
The House bill authorizes almost $300 billion for research and development, including $52 billion to subsidize semiconductor manufacturing and research into the key components used in autos and computers. It also has $45 billion over six years to ease supply-chain problems that have exacerbated shortages.
It includes changes to U.S. trade rules intended to offset China's market-distorting trade practices, including by strengthening anti-dumping rules.
The bill would authorize $8 billion in U.S. contributions to the Green Climate Fund, established by the Paris Agreement to combat climate change, to help developing countries cope.
'MAKE AMERICA ... SELF-SUFFICIENT'
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters before the vote that she intended to begin negotiations with the Senate quickly.
""It is about making America ... self-sufficient when it comes to the supply chain, so that we're not depending on other countries,"" she said. 
Raimondo said companies had told the administration that without the chips funding they would build manufacturing plants outside the United States. 
The Semiconductor Industry Association praised the bill.
Steve Zylstra, president of the Arizona Technology Council, said the bill was ""profoundly important"" to the state's ambitions of becoming the center of excellence for semiconductors in the United States, after both  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd recently announced plans to build new plants there. 
House Republicans complained that Democrats did not include them in drafting the legislation. They harshly criticized the climate provisions and said they could be used to help Beijing, and accused Democrats of using the China measure to advance parts of Biden's economic agenda that could not pass the Senate. 

House Democrats said Republicans had refused to engage with them while they wrote the legislation. Democrats note that their bill includes all or part of more than 60 smaller measures that Republicans had co-sponsored.
The Senate passed its own bill - the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act - by 68-32 in June. Eighteen Republicans joined every Senate Democrat in voting yes. That legislation includes $52 billion to increase domestic semiconductor production and authorizes $190 billion for U.S. technology and research to compete with China.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -Hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses were without power on Friday after a winter storm dumped sleet and heavy snow on a wide swath of the central United States this week, and more treacherous weather threatened parts of the Plains and New England. 
More than 370,000 customers were without power from Texas, Arkansas, Tennessee up through Ohio and into New York, Poweroutage.us reported on Friday, after an ice storm downed power lines and trees across the area on Thursday.
Memphis Light, Gas and Water said more than 130,000 customers were without power and it could take days to restore electricity.
""We know you are anxious and want to know when your power will be restored,"" the utility company said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""Debris must be cleared before crews can restore power.""
Airlines canceled nearly 3,000 flights on Friday, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware, after scrapping more than 5,000 flights on Thursday. 
U.S. carriers have faced disruptions to their operations since before Christmas because of bad weather and a staffing crunch due to the Omicron coronavirus variant.
Wind chill warnings remained in effect for Texas and the Great Plains, where morning lows ranging between the single digits and below zero Fahrenheit were in the forecast, the National Weather Service (NWS) said. 
""Cold wind chills could result in hypothermia in a short amount of time if precautions are not taken,"" the NWS warned. 
Winter storm warnings and advisories also remained in effect for Tennessee and Kentucky up through New York and Pennsylvania and into New England where a mix of sleet and snow was expected to make travel difficult, the service said.

In the Boston area, home to 4.8 million people, forecasters predicted 1 to 2 inches (3-5 cm) of snow and ice accumulations of one tenth to one quarter of an inch, making road conditions hazardous. 
By Saturday morning, the winter storm finally leaves off the East Coast, but bitterly cold temperatures will stick around with some temperatures challenging record lows in the South Central United States, NWS forecasters said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Queen Elizabeth marks 70 years on the British throne on Sunday, a milestone never reached by any of her predecessors over the last 1,000 years, and one which only a few monarchs across the globe have ever achieved.
Elizabeth, 95, became the queen of Britain and more than a dozen other realms including Canada, Australia and New Zealand on the death of her father King George VI on Feb. 6, 1952, while she was in Kenya on an international tour. 
The news was broken to her by her husband Prince Philip, who died last year aged 99 after more than seven decades by her side. 
Elizabeth will mark 'Accession Day' in private as is customary, not viewing it as something to celebrate. But there will be four days of national events to mark her Platinum Jubilee in June.
""While it is a moment for national celebration, it will be a day of mixed emotions for Her Majesty as the day also marks 70 years since the death of her beloved father George VI,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson told parliament on Wednesday, thanking the monarch for ""her tireless service"". 
Elizabeth has continued to carry out official duties well into her 90s, but has been little seen in public since she spent a night in hospital last October for an unspecified ailment and was then instructed by doctors to rest.
However, Buckingham Palace on Friday released footage ahead of Sunday's landmark, showing her viewing items from previous royal jubilees, such as a fan given to her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria to mark her 50th year on the throne in 1887, signed by family, friends and politicians. 
Ironically Elizabeth was not destined to be monarch at her birth, and only became queen because her uncle Edward VIII abdicated to be with American divorcee Wallis Simpson.
But in 2015, she overtook Victoria as Britain's longest-reigning sovereign in a line that traces its origin back to Norman King William I and his 1066 conquest of England. 
MILESTONES
""Inevitably a long life can pass by many milestones - my own is no exception,"" Elizabeth said in 2015, adding that the record was not one ""to which I have ever aspired"". Her son and heir Prince Charles said it was a moment other people were more excited about than she was.
While small in stature - standing at 5ft 3ins according to reports - she has been a towering figure in Britain for seven decades. During that time she has overseen huge social, economic and political change, including the end of the British Empire. 
When she ascended the throne, Josef Stalin, Mao Zedong and Harry Truman were running the Soviet Union, China and the United States, respectively, while Winston Churchill was British prime minister.
Including Churchill, she has been served by 14 prime ministers - a quarter of all there have been in Britain since Robert Walpole 300 years ago. During her reign, there have been 14 U.S. presidents, all of whom she has met bar Lyndon Johnson. 
As the world's current oldest and longest-reigning monarch, her global presence has also been profound, and she retains an almost unrivalled mystique.
""What's telling is when heads of state meet, whether it be at the G7 or the COP conference, they want to meet the queen,"" said Anna Whitelock, Professor of the History of Monarchy at London's City University. 
""They may be presidents or heads of state in their own country, but there is something quite magical about this miniature woman.""
Only a handful of monarchs are ever thought to have reigned for longer than Elizabeth. King Louis XIV of France, who built the palace of Versailles, is considered to hold the record for a sovereign state, ruling for 72 years, while Sobhuza II was king of Swaziland for almost 83 years until his death in 1982.
While public affection for her remains strong, with about four in five Britons holding a favourable view, the monarchy itself has suffered a number of recent knocks, including a U.S. sex abuse court case against her second son Prince Andrew, raising questions about the long-term future of the institution.

""She's almost beyond criticism, I think,"" said Professor Vernon Bogdanor, an expert in British constitutional history.
""It's not that she's never put a foot wrong, it's more positive than that. She somehow instinctively understands what you might call the soul of the British people.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A government-funded research project released on Friday sheds new light on the upward trend of mass shootings in the United States, finding that the number of Americans dying from mass shooters is on the rise, and most people who commit such acts of violence have a history of trauma or were in a state of crisis. 
The Violence Project, funded by the Justice Department's National Institute of Justice, examined 172 mass shootings -defined as killing four or more people - dating back more than 50 years. 
It found that of all the mass shootings that took place between 1966 and 2019, more than half took place since 2000, with 20% of them occurring between 2010 and 2019. In the last five years of the study period, an average of 51 people died from mass shootings per year, compared with only eight people in the 1970s.
The Justice Department unveiled some of the study's highlights the day after President Joe Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland met with New York City's mayor to call for greater investments in local police to combat a recent rise in gun violence.
""This study — one of the most extensive assessments of mass violence to date — reveals a deeply unsettling trend: more Americans are dying at the hands of mass shooters than at any point in recent history,"" said Amy Solomon, the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs.
Researchers analyzed data on mass shootings using a publicly-available database, which draws from open source material such as social media and newspapers.

An analysis of some of the data by the National Institute of Justice found that suicidal intention is a ""strong predictor"" for mass shooting perpetrators, and that 31% of the people who committed mass shootings had experienced childhood trauma while 80% were ""in crisis.""
A large percentage of the shooters - 48% - also took steps to leak their plans in advance to family, friends, law enforcement or strangers.

ATLANTA (Reuters) -One of the three white men convicted of murdering Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man chased while running through a mostly white Georgia neighborhood, withdrew his guilty plea to federal hate-crime charges on Friday and will face trial next week alongside his two codefendants.
In a brief hearing in the U.S. District Court in Brunswick (NYSE:BC), Georgia, Travis McMichael said he would withdraw his guilty plea and proceed to trial on Monday alongside his father, Gregory McMichael, and their neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan.
Gregory McMichael had reached a similar plea agreement with prosecutors but his lawyers told the court on Thursday that he would head to trial.
All three men were convicted last year in a separate state trial for the murder of Arbery, a 25-year-old Black jogging enthusiast they saw running through the Satilla Shores neighborhood in coastal Georgia in February 2020. A state judge sentenced all three men to life in prison, ruling that the two McMichaels would not be eligible for parole.
Travis McMichael, 36, had said at a hearing earlier this week that he was willing to plead guilty to attacking Arbery because of his ""race and color"" after reaching a plea agreement with prosecutors. 
But he changed his mind after U.S. District Judge Lisa Wood rejected that agreement at a hearing on Monday. She said she could not accept https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-prosecutors-reach-hate-crime-plea-deals-ahmaud-arbery-murder-court-filings-2022-01-31 it because it bound her to sentencing McMichael to 30 years in federal prison before he was handed back to the state of Georgia to serve out the rest of his life sentence for murder. 
She said she needed more information to know whether a 30-year sentence was just, and cited emotional testimony from Arbery's family. 
Arbery's mother and other relatives had pleaded with the judge to reject the plea agreement because they wanted the men to remain in the Georgia prison system. Federal prisons are generally perceived as more comfortable than those run by states.
They also said a trial was the best way of establishing that Arbery was pursued because he was Black. 
Marcus Arbery briefly spoke to reporters outside the federal courthouse to say he saw next week's a trial as a step toward justice for his son's death.
Wood had warned the younger McMichael that if he pleaded guilty without a plea agreement or was convicted by a jury after trial she could end up giving him a sentence different than the 30-year one agreed to with prosecutors.
In the text of the rejected plea agreement, McMichael admitted for the first time that racism played a part in his decision to grab his shotgun, jump in his pick-up truck with his father and chase Arbery through the quiet looping streets of Satilla Shores.

Bryan's shaky cellphone video of McMichael shooting Arbery at close range caused outrage when it emerged months later and the public learned that none of the three white men had been arrested.
News of the McMichaels' plea agreements could come up in jury selection as it begins on Monday, and may extend the time it takes to seat impartial jurors. Rejected plea agreements cannot be admitted as evidence at trial according to federal court rules.

712,"<span>Feb 04, 2022 11:38AM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) -British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was fighting on Friday to shore up his authority after a senior aide resigned over his false claim that the leader of the opposition Labour Party failed to prosecute a notorious child sex abuser.
Johnson, who in 2019 won the biggest Conservative majority since Margaret Thatcher, has repeatedly refused to resign over reports that he and some of his staff attended Downing Street parties during COVID-19 lockdowns. 
Those revelations raised questions about Johnson's often chaotic style of leadership and have led to the greatest threat to him since he took office. They follow a series of other scandals.
Johnson admitted that problems needed to be fixed at the heart of Downing Street, which serves as both his home and the nerve centre of the British state.
Munira Mirza, his head of policy who had worked with him for 14 years, resigned on Thursday over Johnson's claim that Labour leader Keir Starmer failed to prosecute paedophile Jimmy Savile during his time as director of public prosecutions (DPP).
Johnson's finance minister, Rishi Sunak, said pointedly that he would not have made such a remark. Starmer has cast Johnson's comment as a ridiculous slur - and conspiracy theory - that shows Johnson is unfit to be British leader.
Ministers presented three additional resignations which followed Mirza as evidence that Johnson was fixing the problems at Downing Street and ""taking charge"", though there remained considerable anger at Johnson within his own party.
But on Friday an eighth Conservative member of parliament, Aaron Bell, stated publicly that he had lost confidence in Johnson and submitted a formal letter calling for him to go.
""The breach of trust that the events in No. 10 Downing Street represent, and the manner in which they have been handled, make his position untenable,"" Bell said.
To trigger a leadership challenge, 54 of the 360 Conservative MPs in parliament must write letters of no confidence to the chairman of the party's 1922 Committee.
Letters can also be submitted in private, and the total number is not made public until there are enough to trigger a leadership vote. 
Leading rivals within the Conservative Party include Chancellor of the Exchequer Sunak, 41, and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, 46.
""CHANGE IS GOOD""
A spokesman for Johnson said the resignations of the prime minister's three top aides -- his chief of staff, principal private secretary and director of communications -- had been agreed in advance of Mirza's departure after the publication of a report into the alleged lockdown-busting parties that cited ""serious failures of leadership"".
Asked if Johnson had lost control of his administration, the spokesman said: ""No."" He added the prime minister had addressed Downing Street staff earlier on Thursday to thank those leaving and to acknowledge that change was challenging.
He quoted from the Lion King film, saying also ""change is good"".
While opposition parties and some of Johnson's own lawmakers have called on him to quit, there is concern that toppling a British leader at this juncture would leave the West weakened as it faces a potential military crisis in Ukraine.
With inflation soaring at the fastest rate in 30 years, anger at the government is likely to deepen before local elections in May.
A snap poll by YouGov conducted on Jan. 31 showed that 63% of voters wanted Johnson to resign, though another YouGov poll showed just 31% thought he would resign. 

Asked what was going on in Downing Street, junior energy minister Greg Hands told Sky: ""Resignations have been made, resignations have been accepted.""
""This is the prime minister taking charge.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Texas man accused by U.S. federal prosecutors of threatening to kill election and government officials during a wave of violent rhetoric by believers in former President Donald Trump's false claim of voter fraud pleaded not guilty on Friday.
Chad Christopher Stark, 54, of Leander, Texas, is accused of https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-charges-texas-man-threatening-georgia-government-officials-2022-01-21 posting a Jan. 5, 2021, message on Craigslist that read in part: ""Georgia Patriots it's time to kill ... It's time for us to take back our state from these Lawless treasonous traitors.""
Stark is the first person charged by a new federal task force formed shortly after Reuters published the first in a series https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-trump-georgia-threats of investigative reports that have documented more than 850 threats and menacing messages to U.S. election workers. 
Stark appeared in a brief virtual court hearing on Friday in the Northern District of Georgia to enter his not guilty plea. He is currently out on bond pending trial.
The Stark indictment did not identify the victims of his threats, but Reuters previously reported that two of the officials include Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Governor Brian Kemp.
Both Raffensperger and Kemp are Republicans who defended the integrity of the Georgia election despite intense pressure from Trump, who in January 2021 called Raffensperger and told him to find enough votes to overturn his loss.
Trump continues to falsely claim he lost the November 2020 election due to widespread fraud despite multiple court losses and audits confirming Joe Biden's victory.
Remarks Trump made on Saturday at an event in Texas prompted a Georgia prosecutor https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/georgia-prosecutor-seeks-fbi-protections-after-trump-remarks-2022-01-31 who is conducting a criminal investigation of the former president to ask the FBI for protection. 

Stark's case is one of dozens under investigation by federal authorities.
The Justice Department last week unveiled charges https://www.reuters.com/world/us/nevada-man-charged-with-threatening-state-elections-official-2022-01-28 against a second man, 50-year-old Las Vegas resident Gjergi Luke Juncal, who they accuse of making threatening phone calls to a state election worker. He has pleaded not guilty, and a trial was tentatively scheduled for the end of March.

AMMAN/ATMEH, Syria (Reuters) - In a corner of Syria crammed with people uprooted by 11 years of civil war, the leader of Islamic State and his family hid in plain sight: they kept to themselves, neighbours did not pry into each other's past, the rent was paid on time.
The status quo was shattered on Thursday night, when U.S. special forces swept into the town of Atmeh in northwest Syria to raid his hideout.
Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Quraishi, head of one of the world's most feared militant groups, blew himself up to evade capture, killing several family members and others in the blast, according to the United States.
His death marks a blow to Islamic State as its fighters reemerge as a deadly threat in Syria and Iraq.
Until that point, locals believed that Quraishi was a Syrian merchant from Aleppo who had brought his family to the relative safety of Atmeh near the Turkish border, far from the frontlines of the Syrian conflict.
There was little to draw attention to the three-storey building on the edge of town since Quraishi, an Iraqi, rented an apartment there a year ago, taking the first floor initially before expanding to rent the top one too.
The children were generally well behaved and kept out of sight, sometimes accompanying their mother to the shops, said a woman who lived on the ground floor and knew her neighbours as ""the family of Abu Ahmed"".
""They kept to themselves and our kids played with their kids occasionally outside, but we never socialised with them,"" the woman, who gave her name as Ameena, said in a phone interview. She declined to give her full name for fear of retribution.
Ameena said she was once invited for tea by one of Quraishi's wives, Um Ahmad. She told Ameena her husband was a trader from Aleppo who had fled the city during the war. With hindsight, Ameena said she was struck by how rarely she saw him.
The women wore all-enveloping black gowns, typical of conservative Muslims.
While the family were not from Atmeh, this did not draw attention in an area where tens of thousands of people have fled from all over the country.
""We thought they could have gone through a lot, but as you know, here everyone has a tragedy and people rarely speak of what happened to them these years and everyone prefers to keep to themselves,"" Ameena said.
HIDING NEAR THE ENEMY
Quraishi took over the leadership of Islamic State following the death in 2019 of its founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who also died during a raid by U.S. commandos when he detonated explosives.
Baghdadi had also been hiding in northwest Syria, the last major bastion of rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad. Baghdadi's hideout was some 25 km (15 miles) from Atmeh, also in Idlib province.
Quraishi's hideout was close to a checkpoint operated by the armed group that controls most of the Idlib area - Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a jihadist faction formerly known as the Nusra Front that has been an Islamic State adversary for years.
It was also not far from Turkish troop positions in the nearby Afrin area of northwestern Syria.
Despite the close proximity of hostile forces, this was a relatively good hiding place for Quraishi as he sought to revive the fortunes of Islamic State, which controlled a third of Iraq and Syria in 2014 before being beaten into retreat.
Syrians say it is easy for strangers to go unnoticed. Beyond the internally displaced, the area also hosts foreign Islamists who travelled to the country during the war either as fighters or civilian volunteers.
Last October, another senior Islamic State leader, Sami Jasim, was captured in northwestern Syria in an Iraqi operation carried out with Turkish help.
A senior White House official said the blast was believed to have killed Quraishi, his two wives and a child on one floor, and likely a child who was on another floor with Quraishi's lieutenant and his wife, who were killed after firing on U.S. forces.
Syrian rescue workers said 13 people were killed after the raid began, including four women and six children.
Neighbours said four children were rescued after the assault - a 12-year-old girl, boys aged 7 and 4 and an infant. It was not clear if they were related to Quraishi. The badly damaged apartments were strewn with children's toys, witnesses added.
The U.S. official said Quraishi had been using the house and an unwitting family living on the first floor as a ""protective shield,"" a factor that complicated planning for the raid.
The landlord's son told Reuters that each apartment was rented for $160 a month.

""My dad entrusted me to take the rent and if he (Quraishi) had water or electricity or Internet issues we'd help him. We didn't know more about him,"" the son, who gave his name as Abu Omar, said.
Ahmed al Saloum, a 56-year-old carpenter who lived nearby, said he often saw a woman hanging laundry from a second floor balcony. ""They never aroused any suspicion,"" he said.

MOSCOW/SINGAPORE (Reuters) -President Vladimir Putin unveiled new Russian oil and gas deals with China worth an estimated $117.5 billion on Friday, promising to ramp up Russia's Far East exports at a time of heightened tension with European customers over Ukraine.
Russia, already Beijing's No. 3 gas supplier, has been strengthening ties with China, the world's biggest energy consumer, reducing its dependence on its traditional European energy customers.
""Our oilmen have prepared very good new solutions on hydrocarbon supplies to the People's Republic of China,"" Putin said at a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping to discuss closer cooperation.
""And a step forward was made in the gas industry,"" he added, referring to a new contract to supply 10 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year to China from Russia's Far East. Putin was in Beijing to attend the Winter Olympics.
The gas sales alone could generate around $37.5 billion over 25 years, according to Reuters calculations, assuming an average gas price of $150 per 1,000 cubic metres as reported by Russian gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) for its current deal with China.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the deal was for 25 years, while a Chinese industry source said it was for 30.
Separately, Russian oil giant Rosneft, headed by long-standing Putin ally Igor Sechin, signed a deal with China's CNPC to supply 100 million tonnes of oil through Kazakhstan over 10 years, effectively extending an existing deal.
Rosneft said the new deal was worth $80 billion. 
The agreements bolstered the rouble and the Russian stock market, including shares in Rosneft and Gazprom.
Putin has accused the United States of stoking tensions over Russia's neighbour Ukraine, which has angered Moscow by wanting to join NATO. More than 100,000 Russian troops have amassed near the border with Ukraine. Western countries accuse Moscow of planning an invasion, which it denies.
Russia is Europe's biggest provider of natural gas, and Western countries are worried that already strained supplies could be interrupted in the event of a conflict. However, the new deal with Beijing would not let Moscow divert gas otherwise bound for Europe, as it involves gas from the Pacific island of Sakhalin, not connected to Russia's European pipeline network. 
Gazprom said in a statement it planned to increase gas exports to China to 48 bcm per year, including via a newly agreed pipeline that will deliver 10 bcm annually from Russia's Far East.
Under previous plans, Russia aimed to supply China with 38 bcm by 2025. The announcement did not specify when it would reach the new 48 bcm target.
Gazprom, with foreign partners including Shell (LON:RDSa), already produces more than 10 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) per year in Sakhalin.
""Delivering gas to China's northeastern tip makes this project strategically attractive for China, as the only real alternative supply would be more expensive LNG,"" Moscow-based BCS brokerage said in a note about the 10 bcm deal. 
An industry source told Reuters earlier on Friday that Gazprom, which has a monopoly on Russian gas exports by pipeline, had agreed a 30-year contract with China's CNPC, with the first gas to flow through the new pipeline in two or three years.
The source said the gas deal would be settled in euros, as Moscow tries to diversify from the U.S. dollar and hedge itself against any potential sanctions from Washington.
POWER OF SIBERIA
Russia now sends gas to China via its Power of Siberia pipeline, which began pumping supplies in 2019, and by shipping LNG. It exported 16.5 bcm of gas to China in 2021, including 10.5 bcm via the Power of Siberia, which is also separate from the pipelines that send gas to Europe.

Putin was accompanied by several Russian officials and business executives, including Sechin. Gazprom head Alexei Miller was not in the delegation. 
China also lifted restrictions on Russian wheat and barley imports.

BEIJING (Reuters) - With Russian troops massed at Ukraine's borders, athletes from the two countries have formed a fragile peace at the Beijing Olympics, helped along by coronavirus restrictions meant to keep competitors apart. 
Ukraine has advised its athletes to avoid Russians where possible and instructed them how to behave in case they are provoked. COVID-19 restrictions in Beijing's Olympic bubble have limited but not eliminated interactions between them.
""We're not the best of friends,"" Ukrainian bobsledder Lidiia Hunko said of her Russian competitors. ""We spend time with our own team. We're not in contact with the Russians.""
An athlete's job at the Olympics, she said, was to win medals and proudly represent their country, not score political points. 
While she had not heard of any incidents between competitors from the two nations, she said the escalating political tensions had affected Ukrainian Olympians.
""This situation (around Ukraine) affects us because we all have family, we all have friends there,"" Hunko said. ""Of course we treat people as separate individuals, but it still leaves a mark.""
'JUST POLITICS'
Ukrainian athletes remain tight-lipped about the situation at home. The country's Olympic Committee has asked reporters not to query Ukrainian competitors about politics, saying it ""makes athletes lose the ground under their feet emotionally.""
When asked to describe the atmosphere in his home city of Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine, ice dancer Maksym Nikitin quickly changed the topic to the food served in the Olympic Village.
Figure skater Ivan Shmuratko dodged questions about the mood in Ukraine, saying he was at the Olympics to do his best. 
Russian Olympians, who are competing without their flag and national anthem because of doping sanctions, have emphasised that the harsh statements by the two countries' politicians have not seeped into interactions in Beijing. 
Camaraderie was visible at a recent short-track speed skating training session where a Russian, Semyon Elistratov, bronze medallist in the men's 1,500m at the 2018 Games, received a push from Ukraine's Oleh Handei to practice for the relay.
""We have friendly relations,"" Elistratov told RIA news agency. ""Oleh always tells me, 'Don't pay attention to that, it's just politics.'""

Russian officials have said they are against the ""politicisation"" of the Games, opposing the diplomatic boycott by some Western countries. 
""If Ukrainian athletes win at the 2022 Games, we will be sincerely happy for them and congratulate them on medals,"" Sports Minister Oleg Matytsin told TASS news agency.

Suu Kyi had been due in court on Thursday and Friday for hearings on corruption charges related to the leasing and purchase of a helicopter while in office. 
U.S.-funded RFA (Radio Free Asia) reported that Suu Kyi was allowed to miss the hearings at the request of her doctor because she was suffering from dizziness and nausea. 
But the source with knowledge of proceedings, who asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue, said while Thursday's hearing was postponed, Friday's was not and Suu Kyi did attend it.
The source said Suu Kyi's health was fine on Friday and that the next hearing would be on Feb. 11.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate Suu Kyi, 76, is on trial in more than a dozen cases that carry a combined maximum sentence of more than 150 years in prison. 
She has been already been sentenced to a total of six years in detention for other cases, in legal proceedings derided by her supporters, some Western governments, and human rights groups as a sham.
A new bribery charge was also announced against Suu Kyi on Thursday, accusing of her of receiving a $550,000 donation from a businessman, the state broadcaster reported.
Meanwhile, Suu Kyi is also due in court for the beginning of an election fraud trial on Feb. 14, after she was accused of influencing the 2020 vote to win a second term in office.
Suu Kyi has previously denied all the charges. Her lawyers have been barred from speaking about her cases.

A spokesman for the junta, which overthrew Suu Kyi's government in a coup last February, did not answer a call seeking comment. The military government has previously said Suu Kyi would be afforded due process by an independent court.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's official COVID-19 death toll crossed 500,000 on Friday, a level some data analysts said was breached last year but was obscured by inaccurate surveys and unaccounted dead in the hinterlands, where millions remain vulnerable to the disease.
The country, which has the fourth-highest tally of deaths globally, recorded 400,000 deaths by July 2021 after the devastating outbreak from the Delta variant of the coronavirus, according to official data. Some believe the figures were much higher.
""Our study published in the journal Science estimates 3 million COVID deaths in India until mid-2021 using three different databases,"" Chinmay Tumbe, an assistant professor at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, who co-authored the study, told Reuters. 
Last month, the Indian government dismissed the study as baseless in a notification saying there is a robust system of birth and death reporting. 
India's states record deaths from COVID after collating data from their districts. In the last few months, several states have updated the number of deaths, some under pressure from the country's top court. In most instances, authorities said there were lapses due to delayed registrations and other administrative errors.
India is currently in the midst of a third wave of the coronavirus led by the Omicron variant, which some top experts say is already in community transmission although federal officials say most cases are mild.
Last month, the government eased testing norms and told states to drop mandatory testing for contacts of confirmed cases unless they were old or battling other conditions. But, with the number of tests falling, the government issued a revised circular warning states they would miss the spread of the virus. 
According to official figures, India's overall number of COVID infections has reached 41.95 million, the second-highest globally behind the United States. 
To prevent new surges, the government has vaccinated three-fourths of the eligible 939 million adult population with the mandatory two-dose regime. 
Indian officials are carrying out a vaccination drive in remote parts of the country to increase lagging vaccination rates, with health workers going door-to-door to administer shots. 
""I make them understand how important vaccines are to escape from coronavirus,"" health worker Asmita Koladiya, who is forced to take her infant daughter along with her because of a lack of childcare, told Reuters.
In the country's capital Delhi, as new infections of the Omicron variant fell sharply off the peak, authorities further eased curbs and said they will allow schools and colleges to reopen from Monday, and permit private offices to be fully staffed. 
The city's sports complexes will also reopen, its Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said in a webcast on Friday.
RECONCILIATION WITH TIME, GRIEF
India's cumulative tally of 500,055 deaths on Friday included 1,072 fatalities reported over the last 24 hours, according to the federal health ministry. Out of this, 335 deaths were reported from the southern state of Kerala that has, for weeks, been updating data with deaths from last year. 
Kerala, with less than 3% of India's 1.35 billion population, accounts for nearly 11% of the total deaths reported in the country.
""Some states such as Kerala are recording their backlog deaths under judicial pressure, although not all states have done that,"" said Gautam Menon, a professor of physics and biology at Ashoka University near the capital who has been tracking the spread of the virus. 
In Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state of Gujarat, authorities have received over 100,000 claims for COVID-19 compensation, of which 87,000 claims have been approved, according to a senior government official. 

The number of claims received is nearly 10 times the official COVID-19 death toll of 10,545, as per government data. 
""There has not been any under-reporting of COVID-19 deaths...The policy for paying compensation is very liberal as per the Supreme Court's directives, which is why the number of applicants is more than the COVID-19 deaths,"" the official said, declining to be identified due to the sensitive nature of discussions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A lack of flights and the search for a new U.S. reception center are among the hurdles facing the White House as it races to speed up the evacuation of at-risk Afghans from their homeland, according to a senior U.S. official and others familiar with the new plan.
Other obstacles include difficulties in obtaining passports and an affordable housing shortage in the United States, they said. 
The plan's goal ""is just to make this more enduring and less of an emergency operation,"" the senior U.S. official said in describing the revamp, requesting anonymity to discuss internal operations.
The Biden administration has been under pressure to speed up Operation Allies Welcome from lawmakers, veterans groups and others angry that tens of thousands of Afghans who worked for the U.S. government and others at risk of Taliban retaliation were left behind when the last U.S. troops departed in August after 20 years of war.
Human rights organizations and the United Nations say the Taliban has stepped up detentions, abductions and killings. Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman Sayed Khosti has rejected the accusation of reprisal killings, saying no evidence had been presented. 
""People left behind are getting more and more desperate and we're going to start seeing more of the consequences of that, whether mass movement of refugees or meeting grim fates in Afghanistan,"" said a second senior U.S. official.
Advocacy groups say Washington should ensure the new plan will not suffer the types of setbacks that have hampered Afghan arrivals.
""We want to see enough resources applied to these issues so that even if one area fails or falters for a moment, there are options to make sure the pipeline isn't cut off,"" said Shawn VanDiver, a Navy veteran and president of #AfghanEvac, a coalition of advocacy groups. 
President Joe Biden on Tuesday ordered that up to $1.2 billion be made available for the effort, the largest operation of its kind since the Vietnam era. About 80,000 Afghans have been resettled since August.
The new plan calls for shifting the processing of Afghan evacuees for admission to the United States from reception centers on U.S. military bases that are being closed to a base in the Qatari capital of Doha.
FLIGHTS ARE 'MAIN CHALLENGE'
But two U.S.-chartered Qatar Airways flights a week from Kabul to Qatar's al Udeid military base are needed, with the goal of adding more flights, the U.S. official said.
The flights are the ""main challenge,"" said the official.
Differences between Qatar and the Taliban triggered a suspension of regular charters before Christmas.
""We're hoping we can get to regular order,"" the U.S. official said.
The Qatar Embassy and foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Qatar has told Washington it intends to close the reception center in September ahead of the World Cup, the U.S. official confirmed. The official said the U.S. was looking for alternatives, including reopening the air base center after the World Cup.
Once Afghan evacuees are processed for admission, they will be flown to the U.S. and placed with relatives or friends, provided housing by resettlement agencies or sent to a the planned reception center to help them resettle.
The Biden administration has housed tens of thousands of such evacuees on bases in the United States while their admission and resettlement arrangements were finalized.
The Pentagon has been closing those reception centers, with the last two expected to shutter this month, a U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official said, after the roughly 6,500 people there have been processed.
One of those two centers will remain open until the administration finds a civilian site, but a location has not been selected yet, the senior U.S. official and a congressional source said.
The State Department plans to process Afghans for refugee status within 30 days beginning in March, two U.S. officials said. That is far faster than typical refugee processing, which can take years.
To be sure, that creates additional challenges that the second senior U.S. official said would be difficult to surmount.
Speeding up the operation, the second senior official said, will require an agreement with the Taliban to prioritize passports for evacuees or a deal with Qatar to allow travel without them, more U.S. officials in Doha to process evacuees, and a ""higher tolerance of risk to speed up vetting.""
Afghans entering the United States through the refugee resettlement program will be able to proceed directly to their destinations on U.N.-funded flights.

The department also will complete the processing in Doha of tens of thousands of Afghans who worked for the U.S. government and have applied for Special Immigration Visas (SIVs), according to the official and two congressional aides. 
The goal is to process and fly to the United States 1,000 refugees and 1,000 SIV recipients a month, the official said.

AMMAN/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The leader of Islamic State died when he blew himself and family members up during a U.S. military raid in Syria, President Joe Biden said on Thursday, dealing a blow to the jihadist group's efforts to reorganize as a guerrilla force after losing large swathes of territory.
Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Quraishi, had led Islamic State since the death in 2019 of its founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was also killed when he detonated explosives during a raid by U.S. commandos. 
As U.S. forces closed in on Quraishi in northwestern Syria overnight, he triggered a blast that also killed members of his own family, including children, according to Biden and U.S. officials. 
The blast was so big it hurled bodies https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/islamic-state-leaders-bomb-blew-bodies-outside-building-us-officials-say-2022-02-03 out of the three-storey building where Quraishi was and into surrounding streets in the town of Atmeh, U.S. officials said, blaming Islamic State for all civilian casualties.
""Thanks to the bravery of our troops, this horrible terrorist leader is no more,"" Biden said in remarks at the White House.
A senior White House official said the blast was believed to have killed Quraishi, his two wives and a child on the third floor, and likely a child who was on the second floor with Quraishi's lieutenant and his wife, who were killed after firing on U.S. forces. Two additional fighters were killed after firing on U.S. helicopters, the official said. 
Quraishi had been using the house and an unwitting family living on the first floor as a ""protective shield,"" a factor that complicated planning for the raid, the official added. 
The official was unable to explain the discrepancy between those numbers and those provided by Syrian rescue workers, who said at least 13 people were killed, including four women and six children. 
""It's very clear from reviewing the operation in real time that the massive explosion on the third floor is what really caused the casualties,"" the official said. 
Quraishi's death is another setback for Islamic State nearly three years after its self-declared caliphate was dismantled and its fighters defeated by U.S. and Iraqi forces.
Since then, Islamic State, also known as ISIS, has waged insurgent attacks in Iraq and Syria. The most recent was last month when its gunmen stormed a prison https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-kurds-say-islamic-sate-militants-surrender-after-prison-raid-2022-01-24 in northeastern Syria housing Islamic State suspects. 
Quraishi, a 45-year-old Iraqi https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/abu-ibrahim-al-quraishi-islamic-states-slain-leader-2022-02-03, had remained largely in the shadows since succeeding Baghdadi who led the group when it launched a lightning expansion in 2014 that shocked the world. He was injured and lost a leg in a 2015 U.S. air strike, the U.S. official said. ISIS took control of large areas of Syria and Iraq, imposing strict Islamic rule over millions and inspiring attacks in the West.
Biden and U.S. officials described Quraishi as the ""driving force"" behind the 2014 genocide of minority Yazidis in northern Iraq, and said he oversaw a network of Islamic State branches from Africa to Afghanistan. 
""Last night's operation took a major terrorist leader off the battlefield and has sent a strong message to terrorist around the world: We will come after you and find you,"" Biden said. 
U.S. officials have been in touch with all partners in the counter-ISIS coalition since the operation, and all were resolved to continue fighting ISIS and the threat the group posed to their countries, the White House official said. 
The killing of Quraishi, also known as Haji Abdullah, helps restore some of the Biden administration's foreign policy credentials after it was widely criticized for last year's chaotic withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan.
U.S. officials expect ISIS to replace the dead leader. 
Residents in Atmeh, near the Syrian-Turkish border, said helicopters landed and heavy gunfire and explosions were heard during the raid that began around midnight. U.S. forces used loudspeakers to warn women and children to leave the area, they said. 
The Pentagon said 10 people were evacuated from the raid area, including children. General Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, told the Washington-based Middle East Institute that all of them were ""mobile and safe"" and left at the scene when U.S. forces departed. 
U.S. military procedures to guard against civilian casualties are under scrutiny https://www.reuters.com/world/study-faults-us-military-civilian-casualties-pentagon-plans-review-2022-01-27 following a high-profile mistaken drone strike in Afghanistan that the Pentagon initially hailed a success. 
BODIES IN THE RUBBLE
A video taken by a resident and seen by Reuters showed the bodies of two apparently lifeless children and a man in the rubble of a building at the location.
Other footage showed rescue workers loading what appeared to be a small body wrapped in a white plastic sheet into an ambulance. Other body bags were in the back of the vehicle.
Using head torches, the workers looked for remains through chunks of concrete, children's toys and women's clothing in the wreckage. A kitchen was blackened and burned, windows hung from their frames and plastic utensils were half melted.
Reuters could not independently verify the images. 
A Syrian man who witnessed the raid said he left his house after midnight and saw aircraft in the sky.
""Ten minutes later we heard screams. 'Surrender, the house is surrounded,'"" he said. ""There was shelling from airplanes and machine guns.""
Another witness said he saw several bodies at the scene. ""There was blood everywhere,"" he told Reuters. He said one U.S. helicopter appeared to suffer a mechanical failure and was blown up by the U.S. forces. 
Local leaders, security officials and residents in northern Iraq say Islamic State has been re-emerging as a deadly threat, aided by a lack of central control in many areas. 
""Quraishi's killing is a huge deal and a huge blow to ISIS because ISIS never heard from this new leader,"" Syria analyst Hassan Hassan said. ""ISIS will continue to be weak and under pressure as long as the Americans are on the ground in Iraq and Syria.""
Quraishi was hiding out in a region of Syria that is home to several militant groups including an al Qaeda-affiliated faction whose leaders include foreign fighters. 
U.S. forces have for years used drones to target jihadists in the area, but Thursday's operation appeared to be the largest by U.S. forces in the northwest since the raid that killed al-Baghdadi, said Charles Lister, senior fellow with the Washington-based Middle East Institute. 
Beyond Quraishi, who was once held in U.S. custody, little is known of the group's top levels - partly because it now operates in a secretive structure of autonomous local cells, rather than the centralised administration of the 'caliphate'.

The U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State said in mid-2019, after the group's battlefield defeat, that it retained 14,000 to 18,000 members, including 3,000 foreigners, though precise numbers are as elusive as the group itself.
Analysts say many local fighters may have slipped back into normal life, ready to re-emerge when the opportunity emerges.

(Reuters) - One of two men whose plea bargain on federal hate-crimes charges in the murder of Ahmaud Arbery was rejected by a judge last week has decided to proceed to trial rather than seek a new deal with prosecutors, court documents showed on Thursday.
Lawyers for Gregory McMichael and federal prosecutors filed a joint notice of withdrawal of McMichael's plea agreement, saying the deal is ""null and void"" and that both sides were ""ready for trial,"" reaffirming his original plea of not guilty.
The case docket in U.S. District Court in Brunswick (NYSE:BC), Georgia, also showed that a change-of-plea hearing scheduled for McMichael on Friday had been canceled.
McMichael, 66, and his son, Travis, 36, were both sentenced in state court last month to life in prison without parole for their convictions on murder and other charges in the February 2020 shotgun slaying of Arbery, 25.
A co-defendant, neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52, was sentenced to life with eligibility for parole after 30 years. All three men are white.
Arbery, who was Black, was shot to death by the younger McMichael after all three defendants had chased him down in pickup trucks as he jogged through the suburban neighborhood they shared.
The jury rejected claims by the McMichaels' lawyers that their clients were seeking to make a citizen's arrest of Arbery, whom they suspected of criminal activity, and had acted in self-defense when they confronted him.
The father and son subsequently reached a deal with the U.S. Attorney's Office for southern Georgia to plead guilty to federal hate-crimes charges and receive a 30-year sentence. 
As part of the deal, prosecutors agreed to recommend that the defendants be transferred to a federal penitentiary for 30 years before being returned to the Georgia prison system, whose conditions are widely considered to harsher than those of a federal prison.
But after vehement objections from Arbery's mother, U.S. District Judge Lisa Wood last week took the rare step of rejecting the terms of the plea agreement at a hearing for the younger McMichael, though not before he admitted for the first time that he had pursued Arbery because of his race.

Both McMichaels had been scheduled to return to court on Friday to formally re-enter guilty pleas. Court records indicated that only the son would appear for that hearing because the father had formally withdrawn his plea deal on Thursday.
It remained unclear whether Travis McMichael would seek a new plea agreement acceptable to the judge. There was no indication in court whether the third defendant, Bryan, was considering a plea bargain.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers proposed matching bills in the Senate and House of Representatives on Thursday that would require the United States to negotiate the renaming of Taiwan's de facto embassy in Washington as the ""Taiwan Representative Office,"" a move certain to rankle China.
It is currently called the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO), using the name of the island's capital city. 
Should the measures become law, any change in the office's name could provide cover to smaller countries to take similar steps to boost engagement with Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory. 
It would also be certain to create a new rift in U.S.-China relations, already at their lowest point in decades as Washington seeks to push back against what it sees as Beijing's growing economic and military coercion. 
The United States, like most countries, does not have official ties with democratically governed Taiwan, but is its biggest international backer. 
The bills direct the Secretary of State to ""seek to enter into negotiations"" with TECRO to rename its office as the ""Taiwan Representative Office.""
Republican Senator Marco Rubio and the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Bob Menendez sponsored the Senate bill, with Republican John Curtis and Democrat Chris Pappas leading on the House version.
""The U.S. must make clear that, despite all efforts by the Chinese Communist Party to intimidate and coerce Taiwan, hostile powers have no right to claim sovereignty over democratic countries,"" Rubio said.
Menendez told Reuters the bills were consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act defining the United States' unofficial ties with Taiwan, and demonstrate Washington's support for Taiwan ""to determine its own future.""
""We must take this step to strengthen our diplomatic partnership with Taiwan and counter China's repeated attempts to threaten and coerce nations around the globe,"" Pappas said.
The White House and U.S. State Department and China's embassy in Washington did not respond immediately to requests for comment. 
China chafes at any international references to Taiwan it sees as suggesting the island is its own country.

It downgraded its diplomatic relations with Lithuania and pressed multinationals to sever ties with the country after Taiwan opened an office in Vilnius last year called the Taiwanese Representative Office in Lithuania.
Beijing, which has never renounced the use of force to ensure eventual unification with Taiwan, calls the island's status the most sensitive issue in U.S.-China relations and the basis for ties between the two superpowers.

Krystsina Tsimanouskaya refused to board a flight back home last year when she was removed from the games against her will after publicly complaining about national team coaches. 
She defected to Poland, saying she feared for her safety if she returned to Belarus. President Alexander Lukashenko has said she was ""manipulated."" 
""We stand in solidarity with Ms. Tsimanouskaya and all others who have experienced the regime's attempts to silence criticism,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. 
Thursday's move relates to ""involvement in serious, extraterritorial counter-dissident activity"" but the State Department statement did not detail who was being targetted with the new visa limits.
Tensions are high between Russia and the United States over a possible invasion of Ukraine, as NATO says there has been a significant movement of Russian military forces into neighboring Belarus in recent days. 
Last May a Ryanair plane was also forced to land last May in the Belarusian capital Minsk when controllers cited a bomb threat. 
Once it was on the ground, a Belarusian dissident journalist on board the plane was arrested along with his female companion.
Belarus has said it acted legally and in accordance with all international norms, and accused the West of using the episode to try to undermine Lukashenko.
Blinken on Thursday called on Minsk ""to immediately release all political prisoners (and) to engage in sincere facilitated dialogue with the democratic opposition and civil society.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday called for greater investments in local police departments alongside social services in a visit to New York City aimed at projecting a united front against gun violence with Mayor Eric Adams after a series of violent crimes that have rattled the city.
Biden and U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland made the trip in the wake of the funerals of two city police officers who were fatally shot last month while responding to a 911 call.
The police killings are part of an overall surge in gun violence in U.S. cities, including Philadelphia and Chicago, since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. 
With more guns than people, the United States is by far the most heavily armed https://www.reuters.com/world/us/more-guns-than-people-why-tighter-us-firearms-laws-are-unlikely-2021-04-14 society in the world and sales to first-time buyers skyrocketed https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-guns-insight/u-s-gun-sales-soar-amid-pandemic-social-unrest-election-fears-idUSKBN2701HP in 2020. 
""We can't expect you to do every single solitary thing that needs to be done to keep a community safe. It's time to fund community policing to protect and serve the community,"" Biden said. 
The White House and Democrats are pushing back on Republican accusations that the party is weak on crime before critical midterm elections in November.
""We're not about defunding we're about funding,"" Biden said, explicitly rejecting the ""defund the police"" idea pushed by some Democrats after the 2020 killing of George Floyd, and adding he was asking for more funding for communities and community police. 
Biden touted the administration's five-part plan unveiled in June that sought to stem the flow of firearms and invest in police resources. He also announced new efforts, such as targeting gun trafficking from southern states to the U.S. Northeast and getting repeat gun offenders off the streets. 
""This doesn't violate anybody's Second Amendment right,"" Biden. ""There's no amendment that's absolute. You couldn't buy a cannon when this amendment was passed. There's no reason why you should be able to buy certain assault weapons.""
The Justice Department also announced new efforts to crack down on so-called ghost guns https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-proposal-would-crack-down-anonymous-ghost-guns-2021-05-07, unregistered and untraceable homemade weapons that can be made with a 3D printer.

Biden first traveled to New York police headquarters to join a meeting of the gun violence strategic partnership, which meets five days a week to share intelligence and develop plans. He will then go to a school to meet community leaders to talk prevention.
Biden's visit to the country's biggest city will be his first since Adams was sworn in as mayor at the beginning of the year. A former police officer, Adams centered his campaign on improving public safety, and spoke enthusiastically about working with Biden. 

""The president is here because he knows what the American people want: Justice, safety and prosperity,"" Adams said, adding he shared the sentiment. 
There is a reason ""they call me the Biden of Brooklyn"" Adams said, pledging to stand ""shoulder to shoulder"" with the president.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - A massive winter storm swept across the central and Northeast United States on Thursday where it was delivering heavy snow and ice, making travel treacherous if not impossible, knocking out power to thousands and closing schools in several states. 
Winter and ice storm warnings remained in effect for a wide swathe of the United States that reached from Texas up through the Midwest and into New England until Friday morning, the National Weather Service (NWS) said. 
More than 100 million people across at least 25 states were under winter weather alerts on Thursday, CNN reported.
After the storm dumped heavy snow on the Midwest on Wednesday, parts of the region were forecast to see another 6 inches (15 cm) of snow on Thursday, accompanied by high winds of up to 35 miles (56 km) per hour.
The storm wreaked havoc on air travel as more than 4,000 U.S. flights were canceled by midday, Flightaware.com reported. Some 2,000 flights were canceled in and out of Dallas airports alone. 
A damaging ice storm was underway in portions of Texas, Arkansas, Kentucky and Tennessee. More than a half inch of ice may accumulate by Friday morning in some spots, possibly causing power outages, tree damage and dangerous travel conditions, the weather service warned. 
""Everything will freeze overnight and heighten the potential for black ice tomorrow,"" The Arkansas Department of Transportation warned in a tweet.
More than 220,000 homes and businesses in Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee were without power on Thursday afternoon, Poweroutages.us reported.
""No power here in Walnut Grove Lake but I've got beer, firewood, food and a good sleeping bag. I just don't want frozen pipes,"" retired Navy senior chief Paul Stack said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Texas governor Greg Abbott said on Thursday that the state's power grid is ""fully functioning and continues to be reliable.""
Last winter, a deadly deep freeze crippled the grid, leaving millions without power. 
""Texas is experiencing one of the most significant ice events in decades,"" Abbott said. 

School districts in several states including Texas, Michigan and Ohio canceled classes on Thursday. Dallas closed schools attended by 145,000 students for Thursday and Friday. 
The storm will push temperatures down. Highs in many places across the Plains and Mississippi Valley will be between 20-40 degrees below average over the next few days, the NWS said.

LONDON (Reuters) -Four of Boris Johnson's closest aides resigned on Thursday in a turbulent day for his government, as the British prime minister tried to reset his administration in the face of a series of scandals that have put his position in peril.
Johnson's premiership is facing a growing crisis in the wake of anger over a series of alcohol-fuelled parties held at his Downing Street office and residence during coronavirus lockdowns which followed other missteps.
Angry lawmakers in his own Conservative Party, some of whom have already called for his resignation, have demanded an overhaul of his Downing Street operation if he is to remain in power.
On Thursday, three of his top aides - Chief of Staff Dan Rosenfield, Principal Private Secretary Martin Reynolds, and Director of Communications Jack Doyle - all resigned in what some Conservative lawmakers (MPs) said looked like the start of a somewhat disorganised reset in Johnson's administration.
However a fourth quit over a barb Johnson made at the leader of the main opposition Labour party, something for which his finance minister also criticised him.
""On Monday Boris Johnson promised MPs change. Tonight we see that change starting to happen and I welcome this quick action by the prime minister,"" lawmaker Stuart Anderson said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), one of a number of Johnson supporters who took to social media to applaud the shake-up.
Johnson pledged to change his leadership style after a report by senior civil servant Sue Gray into the gatherings held at his Downing Street office and residence condemned ""serious failures of leadership"". 
Rosenfield, Reynolds and Doyle were directly linked to the gatherings - Reynolds was reported to have sent an email asking attendees to ""bring your own booze"" to one.
Johnson's office said Rosenfield and Reynolds would remain in their posts for the time being.
Whether the clear out in Johnson's top team will be enough to see off the crisis remains to be seen.
COST OF LIVING SQUEEZE
His personal ratings have plummeted and his party has fallen well behind Labour in opinion polls amid a series of scandals and gaffes. The police are still investigating 12 of the lockdown gatherings, and a more detailed report from Gray with potentially more damaging revelations could follow afterwards.
The political problems also come as British households face a cost of living squeeze with energy prices set to soar in April, while the Bank of England also raised interest rates again on Thursday.
Johnson, who won a massive majority for the Conservatives in a 2019 election, has also been condemned this week for accusing Labour leader Keir Starmer of failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile, one of Britain's worst sex offenders, during his time as Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). 
The false claim https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-britain-savile-idUSL1N2RP200, which Starmer said amounted to Johnson ""parroting the conspiracy theories of violent fascists"", has angered not only opponents but also some within his own party.
Johnson has declined to apologise but did back down from the comments on Thursday, saying ""a lot of people have got very hot under the collar"".
""I'm talking not about the leader of the opposition's personal record when he was ... DPP and I totally understand that he had nothing to do personally with those decisions.""
However it failed to satisfy Munira Mirza, his head of policy who had worked with him for 14 years, and prompted her to quit her job, and also provoked criticism from finance minister Rishi Sunak. 
'INAPPROPRIATE'
""This was not the usual cut and thrust of politics; it was an inappropriate and partisan reference to a horrendous case of child sex abuse,"" The Spectator magazine cited Mirza as saying in a letter to Johnson.
""I hope you find it in yourself to apologise for a grave error of judgment made under huge pressure ... It is not too late for you but, I’m sorry to say, it is too late for me.""
Asked whether the prime minister should have apologised, Sunak, who along with foreign minister Liz Truss is considered a leading contender to replace Johnson should he be forced out, said: ""Being honest, I wouldn't have said it, and I am glad the prime minister clarified what he said."" 
Savile, a celebrated TV and radio host, was never prosecuted despite a number of police investigations. After his death in 2011 at age 84, it was revealed he had abused hundreds of victims.
Starmer, who headed the Crown Prosecution Service at a time when Savile was being investigated, had no direct involvement in the case, but did later apologise for the failings. 

Johnson said he was sorry to lose Mirza but rejected her assessment that his Starmer comments were inappropriate. 
""Well I don’t agree with that,"" he told 5 News.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The jury in lawyer Michael Avenatti's criminal trial said on Thursday it was struggling to decide whether he had defrauded porn star Stormy Daniels, who he represented in her legal battle with then-President Donald Trump.
Jurors reported being unable to agree after only four hours of deliberations over two days in federal court in Manhattan.
It would be rare for a judge to deem a jury deadlocked and declare a mistrial so quickly. U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman directed jurors to continue their deliberations, which began Wednesday afternoon.
Avenatti, 50, is charged with embezzling nearly $300,000 of Daniels' book proceeds, in part by forging her signature. 
He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted of wire fraud, plus a mandatory two-year term if convicted of aggravated identity theft. If he were acquitted of wire fraud, he must then also be acquitted of identity theft.
Avenatti, who is representing himself, has pleaded not guilty to both counts, calling his dispute with Daniels a disagreement over legal fees that has no place in court.
The brash, Los Angeles-based lawyer said he had a good-faith belief that his contract to represent Daniels entitled him to some money from her book proceeds, and therefore had no intent to defraud her.
In a second note to the judge on Thursday, jurors requested a definition of ""good faith,"" plus a transcript of Daniels' testimony.
Furman referred them to his original instructions, and said they must acquit Avenatti if he had an ""honest belief that he was entitled to take money or property"" from Daniels.
Avenatti rose to fame in 2018 while representing Daniels, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford, in lawsuits against Trump. 
Daniels, 42, is known for receiving $130,000 in hush money from Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to keep quiet ahead of the 2016 election about sexual encounters she says she had with Trump, who denies they took place.
Avenatti successfully sued him to get Daniels out of the nondisclosure agreement.

The criminal charges related to Daniels are among a slew of accusations that have ended Avenatti's career as a lawyer.
Avenatti is appealing a conviction and a 2-1/2-year prison sentence for extorting  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE), and faces dozens of charges in California that he cheated other clients and committed bank fraud, bankruptcy fraud and tax fraud.

(Reuters) - U.S. intelligence agencies believe Russia has formed a plan to fabricate a pretext for an invasion of Ukraine, potentially by producing propaganda videos showing a staged attack, the United States said on Thursday.
The United States accused Russia of formulating several options to give it an excuse for an invasion of Ukraine amid rising tensions with Western countries.
One of the options is a fabricated video showing the graphic aftermath of an explosion targeting Russian people, featuring corpses, mourners and equipment appearing to belong to Ukraine or allied nations, State Department spokesman Ned Price and a Biden administration official said.
""The video will be released to underscore a threat to Russia's security and to underpin military operations,"" the official said. ""This video, if released, could provide (Russian President Vladimir) Putin the spark he needs to initiate and justify military operations against Ukraine.""
TASS news agency cited Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responding to reports that Russia will stage fabricated attacks by Ukraine as saying: ""This is not the first report. Something similar was also said earlier. But nothing has come out.""
U.S. officials said they publicized their most specific allegation yet of possible Russian propaganda in order to ""dissuade"" Moscow from following through with such plans.
They said it was not clear if Russia has decided to take such a step or if they have decided whether to invade Ukraine.
""The production of this propaganda video is one of a number of options that the Russian government is developing as a fake pretext to initiate and potentially justify military aggression against Ukraine,"" Price told reporters.
""We don't know if Russia will necessarily use this or another option in the coming days.""
Price declined to provide more specifics or evidence of the video.
U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor Jonathan Finer in a media interview said the United States does not definitively know if this is the route Russia will take.
British foreign minister Liz Truss said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that the U.S. intelligence was ""clear and shocking evidence of Russia's unprovoked aggression and underhand activity to destabilise Ukraine.""

Russia has accused the United States of ramping up tensions and ignoring Moscow's calls to ease a standoff over Ukraine, a day after Washington announced it would send nearly 3,000 extra troops to Poland and Romania.
Russia has denied plans of an invasion but has amassed thousands of troops on its border with Ukraine.

LONDON (Reuters) -British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to shake up operations in his 10 Downing Street office to try to survive his gravest crisis yet over boozy events held at the heart of power during COVID-19 lockdowns.
Key to the organisational changes is a promise he made on Monday to lawmakers from his Conservative Party at a meeting in parliament to turn to Lynton Crosby, an Australian political strategist who has helped him before and is respected by many Conservative lawmakers, as an ad hoc ""strategic adviser"".
Johnson then reaffirmed his commitment to one of the promises that got him elected in 2019 - ""levelling up"" Britain to reduce chronic inequality between the affluent south of England and the more deprived north, which was welcomed more widely than expected.
Johnson has sent a clear signal: he is betting on a change of style targeting his administration rather than a change of substance to get through the scandal over alleged staff parties at No. 10 while the country was under lockdown to help curb the spread of COVID-19.
""He needs to start delivering so people start feeling the benefit,"" one veteran Conservative said on condition of anonymity. ""Just get stuff done.""
Another who attended the meeting said: ""The penny has dropped."" They said Johnson seemed to have finally understood that for many lawmakers, Downing Street felt remote, handing down orders without listening to other opinions in the party.
Since becoming prime minister in July 2019, Johnson has taken Britain out of the European Union and led it through the COVID-19 pandemic. He has also proved gaffe-prone and is now facing calls to resign, including from some Conservatives.
He is not out of the woods. After a failed rebellion by newer lawmakers fizzled out last month, he is now seeing a steady stream of more senior Conservatives announcing they are calling for him to go.
In the latest sign of the disarray that has put Johnson under intense pressure, Munira Mirza, his head of policy who had worked with him for 14 years, resigned on Thursday over a false accusation Johnson made against the opposition Labour party leader during heated exchanges in parliament on Monday. 
Johnson accused Labour chief Keir Starmer of having failed, when in a previous job as Director of Public Prosecutions, to prosecute one of Britain's worst sex offenders, stirring an uproar. Johnson tried to row back from the allegation on Thursday but later said he did not agree with Munira's statement that his comments were inappropriate.
Shortly afterwards, Johnson's office said the prime minister's director of communications had also left government.
CHANGE?
After the release of an initial report into the lockdown events by senior civil servant Sue Gray that cited ""serious failures of leadership"", and London police launched their own investigation into the reported parties, Johnson addressed worried Conservative lawmakers packed into a room in parliament.
The prime minister apologised, joked, acknowledged making mistakes and promised changes to his administration, four of the lawmakers who attended Monday's meeting told Reuters.
He accepted that his team in Downing Street needed to be more inclusive, his cabinet team of top ministers strengthened and that he had to be more accessible to lawmakers, many of whom have questioned whether he even knew their names, they said.
Johnson now plans to create a new office of the prime minister, with a permanent secretary to lead No. 10, and to review codes of conduct for government workers.
Central to appeasing his lawmakers was Johnson's announcement that Crosby ""was going to be asked to give strategic advice"", one of those present said.
Crosby helped Johnson get elected mayor of London in 2008 and win a second term four years later.
Crosby did not immediately respond to a Reuters email request for comment about his plans, which lawmakers said might involve a member of his team being brought on a more permanent basis into Downing Street.
Crosby is seen as a man who can ""focus and bring out the best version of Boris"", the veteran Conservative said, suggesting he could help rebuild relations between Downing Street and restive Conservative members of parliament. 
Another said Crosby and his team would bring ""the focus and the discipline to deliver"" on policy. 
But Crosby also carries risks for Johnson. He has in the past drawn fire over some of his campaign tactics and his return to favour will not placate all Conservatives.
Johnson faces other dangers as well. Intensified scrutiny of his actions will come when police complete their inquiry into the alleged lockdown parties and when Gray's full report comes out, and he is likely to be confronted by more calls to quit.
Aware of this, Johnson is seeking to reassure his party he will not make any big policy changes to ride out the crisis, but instead, when he can, return to be a tax-cutting, small-state Conservative - after pushing through much criticised increases to some taxes to tackle a health and social care crisis.

Johnson reinforced that message on Wednesday when his government set out its flagship ""levelling-up"" plan, the extension of a campaign pledge that helped the Conservatives win votes in longtime opposition strongholds in 2019. 
Johnson told parliament his government must now ""get on with the job"". Doing so is vital to his own future.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will on Sunday salute the 70th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II ascending the throne, but as the monarch celebrates another landmark, just how will her record-breaking reign be remembered?
To some commentators, her reign has been a 'golden age', reminiscent of that of her namesake Elizabeth I who ruled over England 400 years ago in what is considered one of the country's greatest periods.
Others say the 95-year-old's legacy is much less dramatic but nonetheless remarkable: ensuring the monarchy has survived in a time of huge social and economic upheaval.
""I think the queen's played a blinder,"" Anna Whitelock, Professor of the History of Monarchy at London's City University, said. 
""The definition of success for any monarch over time is to preserve the monarchy and ensure the succession. That is the primary job, and that's what she's done.""
Elizabeth ascended the throne aged 25 on Feb. 6, 1952, on the death of her father George VI, inheriting dominion over a Britain emerging from the ravages of World War Two when rationing was still in place and Winston Churchill was prime minister, as well as other nations spread across the globe. 
Since then presidents, popes, and prime ministers have come and gone, the Soviet Union has collapsed, and Britain's own once mighty empire has dissipated, replaced by a Commonwealth of 54 nations which Elizabeth was instrumental in creating, and whose success many regard as her greatest achievement.
""None of the other imperial powers have achieved that ... and in Britain, huge social and economic changes have been carried through on the whole peacefully and consensually,"" said Professor Vernon Bogdanor, an expert in British constitutional history. ""That's very remarkable.""
THE SECOND ELIZABETHAN AGE?
Elizabeth's reign has often been compared - sometimes unflatteringly - to that of her namesake whose 44 years on the throne in the 16th Century are regarded as England's Golden Age, when the economy grew, the country's influence expanded, and William Shakespeare and other writers flourished.
""Some people have expressed the hope that my reign may mark a new Elizabethan age,"" she said in her 1953 Christmas broadcast. ""Frankly I do not myself feel at all like my great Tudor forbear.""
Having never given an interview or made her personal views on political issues known, her own assessment of her reign - the longest in British history - is hard to ascertain. A senior royal aide told Reuters she would regard her legacy as a matter for others to judge.
Constitutional historian David Starkey has said there would be no second Elizabethan age, as the queen did not regard her role as embodying a historical period, but merely doing a job.
""She has done and said nothing that anybody will remember. She will not give her name to her age. Or, I suspect, to anything else,"" he wrote in 2015. 
""I say this not as criticism but simply as a statement of fact. Even as a sort of compliment. And, I suspect, the queen would take it as such. For she came to the throne with one thought only: to keep the royal show on the road.""
Such an assessment, though, does not do justice to how she has performed her role and moved with the times, said Matthew Dennison, author of a recent biography of the queen.
""I would argue that it is virtually impossible in 21st century Britain for any one person to embody the aspirations, the anxieties, the identities of what is an immensely disparate society,"" he told Reuters. 
He said her determination to perform her role as well as she could and refraining from voicing any views that might cause offence, had given her a moral authority beyond anything she had inherited as monarch.
SOFT POWER
Constitutionally, the British sovereign now has few practical powers and is expected to be non-partisan. 
However, historians say Elizabeth has wielded ""soft"" power, and made the monarchy a unifying, focal point for the nation amid great societal divisions, exemplified by her broadcast to reassure the public at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
While above the political fray herself, she still meets the prime minister for a private weekly audience. 
""They unburden themselves or they tell me what's going on or if they've got any problems and sometimes one can help in that way too,"" she said in a 1992 documentary. ""They know that one can be impartial, so to speak. I think it's rather nice to feel that one's a sort of sponge.""
Former leaders have said her years of experience have proved of great help, allowing them to speak candidly without fear of their conversations ever being made public.
""You can be utterly totally frank, even indiscreet with the queen,"" John Major, the British leader from 1990 to 1997, said.
Tony Blair, who replaced Major and was prime minister for a decade, said: ""She will assess situations and difficulties and can describe them without ever ... giving any clue as to political preference or anything like that. It's quite remarkable to see.""
Some historians say the queen will be looked upon as the last of her kind, a monarch from a time of when elites commanded unquestioned respect. But she would still, perhaps, be one of the country's greatest.

""There's no doubt that she will be up there as one of the greatest monarchs not just for her longevity, but for the period of change which she has witnessed,"" Whitelock said.
""And like Elizabeth I ... equally seminal for Britain and also Britain's place in the world.""

KUMASI, Ghana (Reuters) - In a dimly-lit room with racks of women's clothing, Ghanaian artist and LGBT+ activist Va-Bene Elikem Fiatsi flipped through photo self-portraits illustrating her transition to womanhood. 
Transitioning is not illegal in Ghana, but it will become so if a new law is passed, intended to tighten already strict anti-LGBT+ regulations which render same-sex relations illegal.
Homophobia is pervasive in the West African country and trans people are generally considered to be gay. 
Fiatsi first exhibited the photographs, dubbed ""Rituals of Becoming"", in 2017. Supportive audiences flocked to see the show in Ghanaian galleries.
Her work reflects how LGBT+ people in Ghana have navigated legal and social constraints to carve out a space to express their identities. 
But Fiatsi fears that even that limited space could now be closing with the new bill, which if it passes would see her risk prosecution every time she puts on a dress.
""To say I'm afraid is an understatement, but I am what I am,"" said Fiatsi, who runs an artist residence in Kumasi, Ghana's second city. 
""It feels like waiting to be slaughtered,"" she said.
Ghana is one of more than 30 African countries that outlaw same-sex relations. Guilty verdicts carry up to three-year prison sentences. 
A group of lawmakers from Ghana's opposition introduced what they called a ""Family Values Bill"" in November, which would impose jail terms of up to 10 years for advocacy of LGBT+ causes and between three and five years for those who ""hold out"" as lesbian, gay, non-binary, transgender and transsexual, or who undergo or perform surgical procedures for gender reassignment.
The bill, which has broad backing among lawmakers but has yet to be voted on, also includes a provision that would force some to undergo conversion therapy. Amnesty International said this could violate Ghana's anti-torture laws. 
No politician has come out publicly against it. President Nana Akufo-Addo urged civil debate and tolerance when the bill was introduced but did not take a stance on its content. 
Opponents say its passage would be a major setback for a country whose reputation as a friendly and stable democracy attracts tourists and investors. 
Its backers say LGBT+ activities threaten the concept of family which is central to the structure of all Ghana's ethnic groups. No voting date has been set. 
""I call it the 'Anti-Human' bill,"" said Fiatsi, who is a former Christian pastor. ""It takes away from our family values of being a tolerant country, and being hospitable and loving.""
""WE ARE ALL THE SAME"" 
There have been no national opinion polls on the bill. Advocates say LGBT+ people are often subject to physical abuse and blackmail in Ghana, and those who come out or are outed are frequently ostracised by friends and family. 
""There are some of my siblings and cousins who, for over five years, we never spoke, even though I love and miss them so much,"" said Fiatsi. ""Most of them think I'm just a demon.""
So do many of her former colleagues. Christian leaders have been among the most outspoken champions of the bill.
When public hearings began in November, Abraham Ofori-Kuragu, a spokesperson for the influential Pentecostal-Charismatic council, said he had never seen a law ""so bold in its presentation of the Ghanaian agenda.""
More than 70% of Ghana's 30 million people are Christian, and billboards with the faces of popular preachers adorn most street corners in the capital Accra. Some faith leaders condemn advocacy for LGBT+ rights as a Western imposition.
No longer welcome at the churches where she used to preach, Fiatsi channels her evangelism into art and activism. 
Her studio compound, where she hosts LGBT-friendly artist residency programmes, is filled with sculptures carved from tree trunks or shaped from old electronics. Murals and affirmations like ""We Are All The Same"" line the walls.
She has a global network of allies but she insists she will stay in Ghana out of solidarity with those unable to leave. 
Even as the perils of life as a trans woman rise, Fiatsi takes comfort in small acts of humanity.
Shortly after the bill was introduced, she travelled for a funeral to her family's village, her first time back in 20 years. 
She stood nervously in her dress and heels. Some people exchanged pleasantries, while others darted their eyes and quietly sniggered.

Before too long, the awkwardness gave way to familial warmth. A relative patted her back. Another asked how life was going. When someone made a snide comment, Fiatsi playfully stuck her tongue out before continuing her conversation.
""There are many more of us that will be born, even far after I'm gone,"" she said. ""What I do today is not for me, or even for those living today. It's for the future generation.""

AMMAN/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The leader of the jihadist group Islamic State died in a U.S. special forces raid in northern Syria on Thursday when he detonated a bomb that killed him and family members, the U.S. administration said. 
Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Quraishi had led the group since the death of its founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was also killed when he detonated explosives during a U.S. raid in 2019.
""Thanks to the skill and bravery of our armed forces, we have taken off the battlefield...the leader of ISIS. All Americans have returned safely from the operation,"" U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement.
Quraishi had remained largely in the shadows since succceeding Baghdadi who led the group at the height of its self-declared caliphate, when it controlled swathes of Syria and Iraq and ruled over millions of people.
Since its defeat on the battlefield nearly three years ago, the group has been waging insurgent attacks in Iraq and Syria.
A senior U.S. administration official told Reuters Quraishi was killed in the raid.
""At the beginning of the operation the terrorist target exploded a bomb that killed him and members of his own family, including women and children,"" the official said.
Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) earlier described Thursday's raid as a successful counter-terrorism mission, saying there were no U.S. casualties. 
Syrian rescue workers said at least 13 people including six children and four women were killed by clashes and explosions that erupted after the raid began, targeting a house in the Atmeh area near the Turkish border.
U.S. military procedures to guard against civilian casualties are currently under scrutiny https://www.reuters.com/world/study-faults-us-military-civilian-casualties-pentagon-plans-review-2022-01-27 following a high-profile mistaken drone strike in Afghanistan that the Pentagon initially hailed a success.

A number of jihadist groups with links to al Qaeda operate in northwestern Syria, the last major bastion of rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad in the decade-long Syrian war. Leaders of the Islamic State group have also hidden out in the area. 
Residents said helicopters landed and heavy gunfire and explosions were heard during the raid that began around midnight. U.S. forces used loud speakers to warn women and children to leave the area, they said.

Alphonso David was fired https://www.reuters.com/world/us/alphonso-david-fired-human-rights-campaign-president-cuomo-advice-nyt-2021-09-07 on Sept. 6 after New York state Attorney General Letitia James issued a report saying he had advised former Governor Andrew Cuomo about dealing with sexual harassment allegations, the organization's board said then.
The civil rights attorney filed his lawsuit in federal court in Brooklyn.
David, who said in his lawsuit that he was the 40-year-old group's first Black president, had held the post for two years. The Washington-based nonprofit group advocates for equal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people (LGBTQ).
“Today, I am filing a lawsuit for the millions of Black and Brown people who face discrimination every day but fear retaliation or lack the resources to challenge it,” David said in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post. 
In a copy of the complaint he posted on Twitter, David said the organization had a ""deserved reputation for unequal treatment"" of its nonwhite employees. He said the Human Rights Campaign's own employees had described it as a ""White Men’s Club"" where nonwhite staffers were marginalized, tokenized, and denied advancement to high-level positions.
The organization could not immediately be reached for comment.
According to the complaint, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) renewed David's contract for five more years in August and gave him a 30% raise. During contract renewal negotiations, the lawsuit said, board members told David he was underpaid compared with his white predecessor because of his race. 
The complaint also described an instance in which a white board member told the HRC president to stop mentioning race in public comments and said David regularly received pushback from senior colleagues on issues involving race.
Before serving as the group's president, David worked as counsel to then-Governor Cuomo.
In the lawsuit, David said that after he was interviewed over his involvement in Cuomo's handling of sexual harassment allegations, board members asked him to resign. He said that after he refused, he was terminated. 
At the time, the co-chairs of HRC's board, Morgan Cox and Jodie Patterson, said his assistance of Cuomo's staff had violated the group's mission and accused him of making false statements. 
The report by New York Attorney General James described allegations of sexual harassment by Cuomo, and efforts by his aides to retaliate against the then-governor's accusers. 

David was identified in the report as having been involved in efforts to undermine Cuomo's first accuser, Lindsey Boylan.
Cuomo stepped down as governor in August after a state investigation concluded that he sexually harassed women who worked for him, including a state trooper. He at times expressed regret for making young women uncomfortable, but denied criminal wrongdoing and said it was ""unfair"" he had to resign.

QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) -Insurgents armed with bombs and guns attacked two Pakistani military bases overnight, killing seven soldiers while losing 13 of their own men, the army said on Thursday, in the latest violence in the resource-rich southwestern Balochistan province where China is investing.
The attacks came hours before Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan arrived in Beijing for the opening of the Winter Olympics, where he will have meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other leaders.
""Our armed forces repulsed the big attacks,"" Khan and Minister of Interior Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad said separate statements.
The army said the attacks were simultaneous and coordinated, and that some of the attackers were still encircled by the military. 
Ethnic Baloch guerrillas have been fighting the government
for decades for a separate state, saying the central government unfairly exploits Balochistan's rich gas and mineral resources.
The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) group claimed responsibility in a statement sent to a Reuters reporter, saying its suicide bombers had detonated explosive-laden vehicles at the entrances of the bases killing more than 100 soldiers.
A security official dismissed that figure as ""utterly rubbish"".
Last week, the insurgents killed 10 soldiers in an attack on a post near the port of Gwadar on the Arabian Sea, the heaviest casualty toll for the army in the Balochistan insurgency in years.
Islamabad blames arch-rival India for supporting the insurgency, a charge Delhi denies, and says such anti-Pakistan groups often use neighbouring Afghanistan to plan attacks. 
""As per initial investigation, intelligence agencies have intercepted communications between terrorists and their handlers in Afghanistan and India,"" the Pakistani army said. 
A Taliban government spokesman Bilal Karimi denied it. ""In our country, nothing has happened yet, if anything has happened in Pakistan it is their internal issue,"" he told Reuters. 
Indian external affairs ministry didn't respond to a request for comment. 
CHINA CONCERNS
A Pakistani security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the nature of the equipment used in the attack raised serious questions about who was providing logistical support.
The attackers used ""state of the art weapons and equipment like M-16s, 7D rifles (foreign origin), foreign manufactured night vision devices (NVDs),"" the official said.
Baloch guerrillas usually attack gas projects, infrastructure and the security forces. They also attack Chinese projects, and occasionally kill Chinese workers despite Pakistani assurances that it is doing everything it can to protect the projects.
China is involved in the development of the Gwadar port and other projects in the province as part of a $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which is part of Beijing's Belt and Road initiative.
Khan and his team would be exploring economic opportunities on the visit to Beijing, including trying to persuade Chinese businesses to set up in Pakistan, Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin said.

The BA.2 sub-variant has begun to replace Omicron's more common ""original"" BA.1 variant in countries such as Denmark. Data from there suggests no difference in disease severity, according to another WHO official.
""BA.2 ... has been reported in five countries, that is Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Senegal as well as South Africa,"" Dr Nicksy Gumede-Moeletsi told an online media briefing.
""We are very concerned,"" she said, adding that BA.2 was proving hard to identify because it was not always picked up by the S-Gene  Target  (NYSE:TGT) Failure criterion, which is used to distinguish the original Omicron from other variants.
Gumede-Moeletsi said the WHO was working very closely with laboratories, asking them to forward samples that had come back without being flagged as Omicron for further analysis, in order to gain a more precise picture of the spread of BA.2.
The BA.1 version of Omicron has been somewhat easier to track than prior variants. That is because BA.1 is missing one of three target genes used in a common PCR test. Cases showing this pattern were assumed by default to be caused by BA.1.
BA.2, sometimes known as a ""stealth"" sub-variant, does not have the same missing target gene as the original Omicron variant. 

Instead, scientists are monitoring it the same way they have prior variants, including Delta, by tracking the number of virus genomes submitted to public databases such as GISAID.
As with other variants, an infection with BA.2 can be detected by coronavirus home tests kits, though they cannot indicate which variant is responsible, experts said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's meeting with New York Mayor Eric Adams on Thursday to discuss combating escalating gun crime signals Democrats want to send a message that they will not cede the issue of public safety to Republicans this election year. 
Republicans contend that a pandemic-era spike in homicides and gun crimes in urban areas across the nation is tied to Democratic backing for the “defund the police” movement that arose out of the racial justice protests of 2020 – even though many Democrats, including Biden, have never supported slashing police funds.
The sharp rise in gun deaths over the last two years has put pressure on Democratic mayors of large cities to instead boost police funding and hire more officers, moves sometimes at odds with the progressive arm of the party's push for policing reforms.
With U.S. voters ranking crime among their top concerns and support for Biden eroding in the suburbs, a Biden adviser and several Democratic strategists said the president's decision to visit the New York Police Department headquarters with Adams offers a chance for Biden to refashion the political narrative around Democrats and crime ahead of November's midterm congressional elections.
“Democrats at large and the president are frustrated that we continue to get tagged on this ‘defund the police' nonsense that the large part of the Democratic Party does not agree with,” said Mark Riddle, executive director of Future Majority, a moderate Democratic research firm.
The Biden political adviser, who asked not to be named, said the Biden administration will argue that lax gun laws and enforcement favored by Republicans are helping drive the rise in crime and making policing more dangerous.
Will O’Grady, a spokesperson for the Republican National Committee, said, ""Biden and Democrats have failed on crime,"" pointing to spikes in homicides in cities such as Chicago, Atlanta and Oakland. ""Biden's visit to New York is too little too late.""
Biden arrives in New York as a rash of violence has shaken America's most populous city, where memories of rampant crime through the 1970s to 1990s remain strong.
The city has been roiled in recent weeks by shootings of police officers. Homicides in 2021 rose 3% over 2020 and a massive 53% from pre-pandemic levels in 2019, though the numbers remain lower than in the early 1990s.
Adams, a former New York police captain, was elected as mayor https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/democrat-eric-adams-wins-new-york-city-mayoral-election-2021-11-03 last year over more left-leaning Democrats with a promise to reform the police department and get tough on crime.
Since taking office in January, Adams has riled progressives by pledging to roll back some criminal justice reforms enacted by his predecessor Bill de Blasio. He seeks to give judges more power to detain suspects before trial, increase the use of solitary confinement in jails and re-activate a special anti-crime NYPD unit that was disbanded after being accused of overly aggressive tactics.
He also has pledged to add more cops to the streets to combat rising gun violence. He has asked for the federal government for help in stemming the flow of weapons into the city and for Congress to pass measures banning assault weapons and making gun trafficking a federal offense. 
NERVOUS PROGRESSIVES 
Some progressives view Biden’s embrace of Adams with alarm. 
“It’s a little bit disappointing,” said Stanley Fritz, political director for Citizen Action of New York, a liberal advocacy group. “I’m worried about the message.”
Fritz said he hopes Biden presses Adams for a more wide-ranging approach to combating crime by attacking poverty and homelessness and increasing mental health services. 
“Hiring more cops and giving them more money is not going to solve the problem,” Fritz said. “I want to believe they are going to do the right thing, but I am not very confident.”
In the 2020 election, Biden explicitly rejected calls by progressives to divert funding for police departments to social services, while assuring them that he supported police-reform measures. 
In office, he has advocated for more spending on both police and preventative measures. “We shouldn’t be cutting funding for police departments,"" Biden told the U.S. Conference of Mayors last month. ""I proposed increasing funding.""
Experts have attributed the surge in homicides over the last two years to the COVID-19 pandemic, which emptied downtowns, shredded the economy and disrupted social services, along with easy access to illicit firearms and a shift in policing strategies following the 2020 racial justice protests.
In the most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted Jan. 26-27, both Democrats and Republicans listed crime fourth among their top issues of concern, behind the economy, public health and healthcare. 
Republican Glenn Youngkin made rising crime an issue during his successful campaign against Democrat Terry McAuliffe last November in the Virginia governor’s race, and it became one of a host of concerns that led some suburban voters who had backed Biden to swing to Youngkin.
More suburban voters have disapproved of Biden's performance since last summer than approved, with the recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showing his support with the key voting bloc at 48%.

“Democrats are admittedly very concerned about the suburbs getting away from them,” said Joel Payne, a Democratic strategist who worked for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign. “It’s not surprising that the president is going to start signaling issues he knows are going to play well in those communities.”
Biden likely would not have done such an event during his presidential campaign, Payne said, given that he was trying appease both moderates and liberals in the party in the run-up to the election. “It shows how the politics have changed.”

Cambodia is currently chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which late last year sprung a surprise by barring Myanmar's junta from key meetings over a failure to honour a peace plan agreed with the bloc.
Cambodia Prime Minister Hun Sen had sought to re-engage with the junta and had indicated he wanted to invite its leaders to meetings of the 10-member bloc again. 
But ASEAN members had not reached a consensus on inviting Foreign Minister Wunna Maung Lwin amid a lack of progress in the peace plan, said Cambodia's Foreign Ministry spokesman Chum Sounry. 
""Meanwhile, we encourage Myanmar to be represented at the retreat by a non-political level rather than leaving the seat empty,"" Chum Sounry told Reuters, adding it was up to Myanmar to decide who the representative should be.
A spokesman for Myanmar's junta did not answer a telephone call seeking comment. 
Cambodia is due to host the meeting of ministers on Feb. 16 and 17.
Myanmar has been in crisis since the military overthrew an elected government a year ago, with around 1,500 civilians killed in the junta's crackdown on its opponents, according to figures cited by the United Nations human rights office.
Troops in the countryside are also fighting on multiple fronts with pro-democracy groups that have taken up arms and ethnic minority forces.
Cambodia said in a statement on Wednesday it was ""deeply concerned"" about reports of continued violence and a deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Myanmar. 
""ASEAN member states underline the urgency of the immediate cessation of violence and for all parties to exercise utmost restraint,"" it said.

But divisions over the issue have persisted and Hun Sen met military leader Min Aung Hlaing in Myanmar on Jan 7, a trip that had some regional neighbours worried it could be construed as an endorsement of the junta. 
Hun Sen has come under pressure to hold Min Aung Hlaing to the ASEAN peace agreement and some members have demanded ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who is on trial, be freed and allowed to join a peace process.

WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - The United States will send nearly 3,000 extra troops to Poland and Romania to shield Eastern Europe from a potential spillover from the crisis over the massing of Russian troops near Ukraine, U.S. officials said on Wednesday.
Russia has denied plans to invade Ukraine but signalled it was in no mood for compromise on Wednesday by mocking Britain, calling Prime Minister Boris Johnson ""utterly confused"" and accusing British politicians of ""stupidity and ignorance"".
Moscow has deployed more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders and says it could take unspecified military measures if its demands are not met, including a promise by NATO never to admit Kyiv.
A  Stryker  (NYSE:SYK) squadron of around 1,000 U.S. service members based in Vilseck, Germany would be sent to Romania, the Pentagon said, while around 1,700 service members, mainly from the 82nd Airborne Division, would deploy from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to Poland. Three hundred other service members will move from Fort Bragg to Germany.
U.S. President Joe Biden said the deployment was consistent with what he had told Russian President Vladimir Putin: ""As long as he is acting aggressively we're going to make sure we can reassure our NATO allies and Eastern Europe that we're there,"" he said, according to media reports on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
The objective, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said, was to send a ""strong signal"" to Putin ""and frankly, to the world, that NATO matters to the United States and it matters to our allies"".
""We know that (Putin) also bristles at NATO, about NATO. He's made no secret of that. We are making it clear that we're going to be prepared to defend our NATO allies if it comes to that. Hopefully it won't come to that.""
Poland's Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said the U.S. deployment was a strong sign of solidarity. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg also welcomed it, saying the alliance's response to Russia was defensive and proportional.
Efforts to reach a diplomatic solution continued, despite some Western countries describing Russia's main demands as non-starters and Moscow showing no sign of withdrawing them.
Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron discussed coordination of diplomatic efforts and plans to impose economic costs on Moscow should it invade Ukraine, the White House said. Macron said he was planning to talk to Putin soon too.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan is set to visit his counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine on Thursday after pitching Turkey as a mediator to ease tensions with Russia, while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said he would meet Putin in Moscow soon, without giving a date. 
The Kremlin said Putin told Britain's Johnson that NATO was not responding adequately to its security concerns. Johnson's office said he had told Putin an incursion would be a ""tragic miscalculation"" and they had agreed to apply a ""spirit of dialogue"".
On Tuesday, Johnson had accused Russia of holding a gun to Ukraine's head, drawing caustic remarks from Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov before the call with Putin. Johnson had rescheduled the call to answer questions in parliament about accusations his staff violated COVID-19 lockdown rules.
""Russia and President Putin are open to communicating with everyone,"" Peskov said. ""Even to someone who is utterly confused.""
Russia's Foreign Ministry mocked Johnson's foreign secretary, Liz Truss, for saying in an interview that Britain was ""supplying and offering extra support into our Baltic allies across the Black Sea"" - two bodies of water that are on opposite sides of Europe - ""as well as supplying Ukrainians with defensive weapons."" The UK Foreign Office later said she was listing separate geographic areas of support.
""Mrs Truss, your knowledge of history is nothing compared to your knowledge of geography,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova wrote in a blog post. ""If anyone needs saving from anything, it's the world, from the stupidity and ignorance of British politicians.""
BEAR VS FOX
A day earlier, in his first public comments about the Ukraine crisis this year, Putin suggested Russia was being forced to protect itself from U.S. aggression.
Washington has said it will not send troops to Ukraine itself to shield it from a Russian attack, but would impose financial sanctions on Moscow and send arms to help Ukrainians defend themselves.
Russia, still Europe's main energy supplier despite being under U.S. and EU sanctions since annexing Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, brushes off additional sanctions as an empty threat.
Washington and its allies have rejected Russia's two main demands - that Ukraine be barred from ever joining NATO and that deployments of troops in eastern European countries that joined the alliance after the end of the Cold War be rolled back.
Spanish newspaper El Pais released what it said was a leaked copy of a U.S. response to Russian demands, in which Washington offered talks with Moscow on an agreement for both sides to refrain from stationing offensive missiles or troops in Ukraine.
Washington could also provide reassurance that it had no cruise missiles in Poland or Romania, and discuss steps to prevent dangerous incidents at air or sea, said the document, which appeared to be in line with the public U.S. position.

""I have seen nothing to suggest these documents are not authentic,"" State Department spokesperson Ned Price said.
""What we have conveyed ... are proposals for further diplomatic engagement. This will require engagement in good faith, some concerted fairly technical discussions, if they are going to result in anything,"" he said.

740,"<span>Feb 03, 2022 01:06AM ET</span>","DUBAI (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates said it intercepted three drones that entered its airspace over unpopulated areas early on Wednesday in the fourth such attack on the Gulf commercial and tourism hub in the past few weeks.
The first three assaults, including a missile attack on Monday during a visit by Israel's president, were launched by Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis in an escalation with a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia and which includes the UAE.
The Houthis have not yet announced a new operation and Wednesday's drones attack was claimed by a little-known group calling itself the ""True Promise Brigades"", according to U.S.-based SITE Intelligence Group, which follows jihadist websites.
The group's only other claim was in January 2021, when it said it launched a drone at Saudi Arabia, which is locked in several proxy conflicts with rival Iran, including in Yemen.
The UAE defence ministry said it was ""ready to deal with any threats"" and was taking ""all necessary measures"" to protect the country which prizes its reputation as a safe business haven.
On Tuesday, the United States said it was sending fighter jets to assist the UAE after the attacks, one of which was aimed at a base hosting U.S forces and followed a Jan. 17 strike that killed three people in Abu Dhabi.
The unprecedented attacks on the U.S.-allied country are an escalation in the seven-year Yemen war. The Houthis had focused cross-border assaults at Saudi Arabia but extended them to the UAE last month after Emirati-backed local forces joined fighting against the group in energy-producing regions.
If confirmed, the claim by the ""True Promise Brigade"" could indicate an upswing in violence involving militias seeking to help ally Iran oppose Western and Gulf Arab adversaries, according to some analysts.
""If Alwiyat al-Waad al-Haq came out of hibernation and did launch drones at the UAE ... then this was likely an Iran-directed or at very least Iran-tolerated operation,"" Michael Knights at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy said in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post, using the group's Arabic name.
Sunni Muslim Gulf powers have called on global powers trying to salvage a nuclear pact with Iran to also tackle Shi'ite Iran's regional proxies and missiles programme.
Tehran has not directly commented on the UAE attacks but has called for a political solution to the Yemen crisis.

Iran's foreign minister discussed Yemen with his Emirati counterpart by telephone on Wednesday. 
The UAE largely reduced its military presence in Yemen in 2019 and has been engaging with Tehran under de-escalation efforts largely driven by economic priorities.

741,"<span>Feb 02, 2022 10:55PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Mississippi joined 36 other U.S. states in legalizing marijuana for medical use on Wednesday, as the governor signed legislation permitting cannabis for treatment of severe, debilitating health conditions such as cancer, AIDS and Alzheimer's disease.
Announcing enactment of the bill, Governor Tate Reeves said the final version passed last week by the Republican-controlled legislature was designed to curb recreational marijuana use, such as by allowing patients to obtain no more than 3 ounces of cannabis per month, or 3.5 grams a day.
Reeves, a first-term Republican, said that limit alone would result in ""hundreds of millions of fewer joints on the streets"" compared with the original, more permissive version of the bill. The new law becomes effective immediately.
Under it, an individual can legally obtain medical marijuana only if diagnosed with one of approximately two dozen qualifying conditions, including cancer, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, muscular dystrophy, Alzheimer's, autism, post-traumatic stress disorder and severe injury.
The measure also permits cannabis to be prescribed for any ""pain state in which the cause of the pain cannot be removed or otherwise treated ... and which no relief or cure of the cause of the pain is possible.""
Written certification must be provided by a licensed healthcare professional with whom patients have a bona fide relationship, and the bill requires an in-person office visit to obtain one.
Only a physician can prescribe for young adults between the ages of 18 and 25, and parental consent is also required for minors.
Mississippi voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure to establish a medical cannabis program in November 2020, but it was later invalidated when the state Supreme Court struck down the state's entire ballot initiative process.

According to the National Conference of State Legislators (NCSL), Mississippi becomes the 37th of 50 states to allow some form of medical marijuana program, even though cannabis remains classified as an illegal narcotic under U.S. federal law.
As of November, 18 states and the District of Columbia have enacted measures to regulate cannabis for non-medical use by adults, the NCSL said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Conservative lawmakers on Wednesday ousted Erin O'Toole as leader, angry over the main opposition party's third straight loss to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals in a 2021 election.
Legislators voted 73 to 45 to replace O'Toole, who took over as head of the Conservative Party in August 2020. He had vowed to defeat Trudeau but instead led the right-leaning party to a disappointing finish in 2021 elections.
O'Toole, in remarks posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), said he would remain in Parliament, pledging ""unwavering loyalty"" to the next leader.
The party selected Candice Bergen, the Conservative's deputy head, as interim leader on Wednesday night ahead of a convention to choose a permanent successor to O'Toole, according to a statement. Bergen, in parliament since 2008, faced criticism last year after an undated photo emerged of her wearing a ""Make America Great Again"" hat, a slogan of former U.S. president Donald Trump. 
Some disenchanted Conservatives said O'Toole had pulled the party too far into the middle during the campaign, announcing major policies without consultation.
O'Toole, who represents a parliamentary district in the vote-rich province of Ontario, said the tactic was needed to attract more moderate voters. 
But the move irritated many in his party, which has a strong populist wing. His ouster means it is likely the Conservatives will now swing more to the right.
""What's next is they lose the next election,"" said one gloomy former senior Conservative official.
Potential leadership candidates include the party's finance critic Pierre Poilievre, a lawmaker who is a favorite of the right wing. He strongly backed a protest by truckers opposed to COVID-19 vaccine mandates which has paralyzed central Ottawa.
""You need only take a walk down the street in front of Parliament to see how divided we are,"" O'Toole said, urging his party to ""realize that our country is divided and people are worried."" 
O'Toole initially distanced himself from the demonstration, which insiders said had infuriated some legislators at a time when they were already unhappy with his performance.
""The lack of contrition and humility from Mr. O'Toole and how he conducted himself after the election ... is ultimately what did him in. There was no plan for how they were going to do things better,"" said Jamie Ellerton, a conservative strategist and principal at Conaptus, a public relations firm.
O'Toole's ouster is potentially good news for Trudeau, who has now seen off four Conservative leaders and can govern while his rivals are focused on succession issues. No date for a leadership convention has been set.
Trudeau heads a minority government, though he can rely on steady support from the leftist New Democrats to pass legislation. He thanked O'Toole for his service.
One senior Liberal strategist said Trudeau's party needed to avoid sounding triumphant. 
""This might be good for now but nobody can say it's good for long,"" said the strategist, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.

The current Conservative Party was created in 2003 through a merger of a center-right party and populist right-wing party, and some fret about a split. After the vote, legislators stressed the party was united.
""There is never a good time for a lot of things but sometimes you have to deal with them,"" Pierre Paul-Hus, the party's public safety critic, told reporters. Legislators will select an interim chief later on Wednesday.

(Reuters) - Former Miami Dolphins head coach Brian Flores said on Wednesday his refusal to throw games as a way to improve the football club's chances of landing a top draft pick ultimately cost him his job.
Flores, who was fired last month by Miami, alleged in a proposed class action complaint on Tuesday that Dolphins owner Stephen Ross offered him $100,000 for every loss in 2019 as incentive to help the team land a higher draft pick in 2020.
Asked to comment on Flores' accusations, the Dolphins referred Reuters to a statement the team issued on Tuesday that said ""the implication that we acted in a manner inconsistent with the integrity of the game is incorrect.""
The order for drafting players is mostly determined by each team's finish in the previous season, with the teams ranked lowest in the standings getting the first picks.
The thrust of the lawsuit was to accuse the NFL and its 32 teams of discriminating against Black candidates for coaching and management jobs. Flores is Black. 
The NFL, in a statement on Tuesday responding to the suit, said the claims of racial bias were without merit and that its clubs were committed to ensuring equitable employment practices.
""This game's done a lot for me. I grew up not far from here in the projects in Brownsville, Brooklyn. I didn't grow up with a lot. This game, you know, changed my life,"" Flores, in his first interview since the lawsuit was filed, told ""CBS Mornings"" on Wednesday when asked about the alleged financial incentive.
""So, to attack the integrity of the game, that's what I felt was happening in that instance. And I wouldn't stand for it ... I think it hurt my standing within the organization and ultimately was the reason why I was let go.""
Miami's decision to part ways with Flores was one of the more surprising head coach firings of the 2021 NFL season given the Dolphins won eight of their final nine games after starting the season 1-7.
Flores, who took over a struggling Miami team in 2019, went 24-25 during his three seasons in charge but failed to lead them to the playoffs, a drought that dates back to the 2016 season.
According to Flores, teams have conducted ""sham interviews"" with Black candidates to satisfy a 2003 NFL policy known as the Rooney Rule requiring that minorities be interviewed for coaching jobs.
Flores alleges that the New York Giants interviewed him for a head coach position last week, having already decided to hire a white coach, Brian Daboll.

In a statement on Tuesday the Giants said they were ""pleased and confident with the process that resulted in the hiring of Brian Daboll"" and that Flores ""was in the conversation to be our head coach until the eleventh hour.""
Flores told ""CBS Mornings"" the lawsuit was filed with the hopes of creating change in the hearts and minds of those who hire head coaches, executives and other team leaders. Black coaches are rare in a sport where 70% of the players are Black.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The FBI said on Wednesday it has not detected any explosive devices, after several historically Black colleges and universities across the United States reported receiving bomb threats earlier this week.
""Although at this time no explosive devices have been found at any of the locations, the FBI takes all threats with the utmost seriousness and we are committed to thoroughly and aggressively investigating these threats,"" the FBI said.
It added that the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces are leading the ongoing investigation, and the threats are being investigated as racially or ethnically motivated violent extremism and hate crimes.
The bomb threats on Monday https://www.reuters.com/world/us/several-historically-black-colleges-universities-receive-bomb-threats-2022-01-31 led schools to cancel classes and issue shelter-in-place orders across the nation.

On Tuesday, at least a dozen more https://www.reuters.com/world/us/more-us-black-colleges-universities-receive-bomb-threats-2022-02-01 historically Black colleges received similar bomb threats, all of which coincided with the first day of U.S. Black History Month.
The FBI has previously said that domestic terrorism, including threats from white supremacists, is growing across America.
Last month, the Justice Department announced https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-justice-department-forming-unit-counter-domestic-terrorism-2022-01-11 it was forming a new unit to combat domestic terrorism threats.
Jill Sanborn, the FBI's executive assistant director for the FBI's National Security Branch, told lawmakers during a congressional hearing that ""racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists advocating for the superiority of the white race and anti-government or anti-authority violent extremists ... present the most lethal threat.""

NBC News on Wednesday reported https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/six-juveniles-identified-fbi-persons-interests-bomb-threats-historical-rcna14591 that the FBI has identified six ""tech savvy"" juveniles as persons of interest in connection with the bomb threats.

(Reuters) -The National Football League's Washington Football Team said on Wednesday they will now be called the Commanders following a lengthy review on how best to replace a name and logo that were widely criticized as disrespectful of Native American culture.
The team retired their controversial Redskins name in mid-2020 along with a logo that featured a profile of a red-faced Native American with feathers in his hair.
That followed a long campaign from critics and came amid calls for racial justice and a threatened loss of sponsors.
A number of Native American Groups were quick to celebrate the team's name change and Ray Halbritter, leader of the Change the Mascot campaign, said it was a victory for all of those around the world seeking to advance inclusivity.
""While the official changing of the name is cause for celebration, today's announcement by the Washington NFL team should not be treated as a simple rebranding,"" Halbritter, Oneida Indian Nation Representative, said in a statement.
""Depicting this as a mere rebranding rather than righting a wrong is another indignity. It is important we never forget what it took to get to this moment, and recognize how social change like this is possible.""
For the last two seasons, the Washington club adopted the generic and temporary ""Football Team"" moniker while it worked to develop a new identity.
NEW IDENTITY
The Commanders name and primary ""W"" logo are the result of an 18-month process that the team, which will stick with their traditional burgundy and gold color scheme, said included over 40,000 fan submissions, countless surveys, focus groups and meetings.
""As an organization, we are excited to rally and rise together as one under our new identity while paying homage to our local roots and what it means to represent the nation's capital,"" team co-owner Dan Snyder said in a news release.
Snyder, who bought the storied franchise in 1999, had long fought off public pressure in the past to change the team's branding and went as far as saying the club would never change their name.
Critics ramped up pressure on the team to change the name amid a nationwide reckoning on racism and police brutality triggered by the 2020 death of George Floyd, a Black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck.
Snyder eventually softened his stance after FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX), which owns the naming rights to the team's suburban stadium in Landover, Maryland, urged the club to rebrand.
PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) both followed FedEx's lead and said they welcomed the call for a review of the name.
U.S. President Joe Biden signalled his approval for the new name with a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post that included a photo of his dog, a German Shepherd named Commander, on the White House grounds along with the message: ""I suppose there's room for two Commanders in this town.""
'PIVOTAL MOMENT'
The team that became the Redskins was founded in 1932 as the Boston Braves. Their name was changed to Redskins the following year and they moved to Washington in 1937.
The team have won three Super Bowls and are one of the NFL's marquee franchises, ranked by Forbes last August as the league’s fifth most valuable at $4.2 billion. 
Many American professional and collegiate sports teams have nicknames on Native American themes. Major League Baseball's Atlanta Braves, the National Hockey League's Chicago Blackhawks and NFL's Kansas City Chiefs have all said they have no plans to change their names.
MLB's Cleveland franchise said last July they would change their name to the Guardians from Indians after the 2021 season, a move that drew praise from Native American groups who had long viewed the old name as disparaging.
Crystal Echo Hawk, the founder and executive director of activist group IllumiNative, also supported the Commanders name but suggested more work needs to be done to end the use of Native American imagery across all sports.

""Today we celebrate a pivotal moment decades in the making but also recognize the costs that came with this victory,"" said the IllumiNative founder.
""The Washington Football Team, now known as The Commanders, are the latest example that teams can make the decision to end a racist practice that has plagued professional sports.""

746,"<span>Feb 02, 2022 04:22PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - New York City police officer Wilbert Mora was remembered for his love for a job he had wanted since he was a boy, his gentle personality and his heroism during a St. Patrick's Cathedral funeral on Wednesday, two weeks after he was killed responding to a call. 
Mora, 27, was shot along with officer Jason Rivera after they and a third officer, a rookie, responded to a Jan. 21 disturbance in Harlem in which a woman said she was having a fight with one of her sons. Rivera, 22, also died from his injuries and his funeral service was last week.
Hundreds of mourners and New York police officers, dressed in pressed blue suits and white gloves, packed the iconic Manhattan cathedral. 
Wilson Mora said his brother was an affectionate, impossibly patient, big teddy bear of a man whose smile lit up rooms. 
""I just want you to know that I was always proud of you,"" he said. ""I love you baby bro and I will always miss you."" 
Mora was born the youngest of four children in the Dominican Republic. He came to the United States when he was 7 years old. Even as a young boy, all he ever wanted to do was to become a police officer, Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell said. 
""He absolutely loved this job,"" Sewell said. ""With a kind, gentle soul and infectious laugh, he cared deeply about his family and truly valued his friends."" 
Mora, an organ donor to five people, gave even in his death, speakers during the service said. 
Mora's funeral was held hours after another police officer was shot and wounded in Queens when two suspects tried to steal his car when he was on his way to work, local media reported.
Last week, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a former police captain, announced a plan to end gun violence that included increasing the number of police officers in the city's most violence-plagued communities.

""New Yorkers understand the risk and sacrifice you make every day and we applaud you for that,"" Adams told officers in the pews for Mora's funeral. ""We are going to give you the resources to fight this senseless violence. It's New Yorkers against the killers and we will not lose.""

OTTAWA (Reuters) -An ongoing protest in Canada's capital is unlikely to succeed in its objective of repealing COVID-19 vaccine mandates, but is pulling a troubled Conservative opposition even further to the right, eroding its chances of returning to power.
The Conservatives, who lost their third consecutive election to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals last year, are torn between leaning towards populism or moderating their policies to attract the centrist voters who will likely be key to winning the next election, which could occur within two years.
On Wednesday, this split cost Conservative leader Erin O'Toole his job https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/main-rival-canadas-trudeau-will-resist-efforts-oust-him-2022-02-01 as party leader. Conservative lawmakers decided to remove him by a 73-45 vote. 
O'Toole's reluctance to quickly embrace the anti-mandate protest in Ottawa ""galvanized"" those who wanted the Ontario politician to go, said a former senior Conservative official, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. 
A shift to the right poses a problem for the Conservatives because of the middle-of-the-road character of most Canadian voters, on the right and left, said Darrell Bricker, chief executive officer of pollster Ipsos Public Affairs.
    ""There is no national government lead by a hard-right option. It's basic math,"" he said.
The protest continued to cause gridlock in downtown Ottawa as demonstrators seek to overturn COVID-19 vaccine mandates championed by Trudeau, including one for cross-border truckers https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canadas-trudeau-slams-fear-mongering-over-covid-vaccine-mandate-truckers-2022-01-24. 
About 79% of Canadians have had two COVID-19 vaccine shots and many of the measures to fight the pandemic, including mask or vaccination requirements, had been largely accepted as common-sense public health measures by politicians across the political spectrum. 
But opposition to pandemic restrictions is growing increasingly political, with some - like the demonstrators in Ottawa - adopting the more polarized views espoused south of the border by former U.S. President Donald Trump.
""The pulling towards a more Trumpian ideology, or more Trump-esque political discourse, is something that we've seen in Canada,"" said Shachi Kurl, president of the Angus Reid Institute polling company.
Trump praised the Ottawa protest where hateful symbols often seen at his rallies, like Confederate flags or swastikas, have been spotted among the crowd, prompting many Canadians to express their outrage on social media. 
'PAINTED INTO A CORNER' 
On Monday, O'Toole warned that if the party swerved too far to the right, it would be ""angry, negative, and extreme."" He has yet to comment on being removed as Conservative leader.
The latest COVID-19 wave, driven by the Omicron variant, has started to turn opinion against lockdowns, and that is especially true for Conservative voters. 
About 54% of Canadians say it is time to end restrictions, an Angus Reid poll showed this week, up from 39% since the first part of January. Of that, 81% of past Conservative voters agreed it was time to end restrictions, compared with 34% of Liberal voters.
Trudeau, who heads a minority government that depends upon opposition support to pass legislation, would be the obvious winner if serious turmoil riles the Conservatives, especially if - as some predict - the party splits in two.
The Liberal leader, who first took power in 2015, this week bashed ""those who fly racist flags"" and defended vaccination as a tool that can help end the pandemic.
The current Conservative Party was formed by the 2003 merger of the right-wing Canadian Alliance and the center-right Progressive Conservatives. That merged party won three consecutive federal elections between 2006 and 2011. 
The party, however, has struggled to raise money since the Sept. 20, 2021 election loss, garnering C$3.1 million ($2.44 million) in the fourth quarter of last year, less than half that generated in the same quarter of 2020 and less than what the Liberals brought in, according to official data. 

""The Conservatives are painted into a corner,"" Kurl said, because they alienate their centrist supporters by backing the anti-mandate protest, and their right-leaning supporters if they do not.

(Reuters) - The federal trial for three former Minneapolis police officers charged with violating George Floyd's civil rights in a deadly 2020 arrest has been paused until at least next Monday after one of the defendants tested positive for the coronavirus.
U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson declined to say which of the defendants had tested positive for the virus, which causes COVID-19, and it was unclear whether or not the defendant was exhibiting symptoms. 
He announced the pause on Wednesday morning after defendants Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng had arrived, according to notes shared by reporters admitted into courtroom in the U.S. District Court in St. Paul, where capacity has been sharply limited by COVID-19 precautions. Thomas Lane, the third defendant, was not present, according to reporters.
All three men were involved in the arrest on a Minneapolis street on May 25, 2020, and have been accused of violating Floyd's rights by failing to stop their colleague Derek Chauvin from kneeling on the dying Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes.
Cellphone video of Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on the handcuffed Black man's neck as he begged for his life galvanized one of the largest protest movements seen in the United States.
Chauvin was convicted on state murder charges in April, 2021, and changed his plea to the federal civil rights charges to guilty in December. A state judge sentenced him to 22-1/2 years in prison; his sentence may end up extended by a few years when he is sentenced by a federal judge.
His three colleagues have pleaded not guilty to the federal charges, as well as state charges of aiding and abetting murder, for which they face trial in Minneapolis in June. 

They say they were not responsible for Chauvin's conduct, and two of them note they were rookies with only a few days on the job with what they called inadequate training by the Minneapolis Police Department, some of which was being done by Chauvin himself.
A spokeswoman for the federal courts in Minnesota said the defendant would be retested before the trial resumed.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Michael Avenatti ""got tangled in his own web of lies"" after stealing money from a former client, porn star Stormy Daniels, a U.S. prosecutor said on Wednesday in closing arguments at the fraud trial of the celebrity lawyer.
Avenatti countered that there was insufficient evidence of fraud, telling jurors during his closing argument in federal court in Manhattan that he was simply being paid for his work representing Daniels in litigation against then-President Donald Trump.
Avenatti is accused of routing nearly $300,000 in book proceeds destined for Daniels to an account he controlled in 2018. The 50-year-old attorney has pleaded not guilty to wire fraud and identity theft, and could face up to 22 years in prison if convicted. The trial is in its eighth day. 
Daniels, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford, testified last week that Avenatti falsely led her to believe her publishing company was late in disbursing advances for her memoir, ""Full Disclosure,"" when in fact he already had the funds.
""She thought he was her advocate. But he betrayed her, and he told lies to try to cover it all up,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Sobelman told jurors in his closing argument. ""The defendant got tangled in his own web of lies. He got caught.""
Avenatti -- who is representing himself despite not specializing in criminal law -- has downplayed his dispute with Daniels as a disagreement over legal fees that has no place in criminal court. 
The Los Angeles-based lawyer has argued that the contract he signed to represent Daniels in cases against Trump entitled him to a reasonable portion of her book proceeds. 
Their contract provided that Avenatti and Daniels would later agree on a dollar amount. Daniels said she paid Avenatti a symbolic $100 retainer, expecting him to finance legal costs through online crowdfunding.
In the trial's most memorable moment, Avenatti cross-examined Daniels, 42, about her interest in paranormal activities, in an effort to undermine her credibility.
""There is insufficient evidence, ladies and gentlemen, to show that Michael Avenatti ever intended to defraud Ms. Daniels or had a scheme to defraud Ms. Daniels,"" Avenatti told jurors on Wednesday.
""People expect to be paid for their work, no matter what you do,"" he continued. ""There should be nothing controversial about that basic concept."" 
U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman, who oversees the trial, asked Avenatti to refer to himself in the third person in some contexts so he could not use his closing argument as a chance to testify.
No witnesses testified in Avenatti's defense. Had he chosen to testify, Avenatti would likely have faced tough cross-examination by prosecutors. 
Daniels is known for receiving $130,000 in hush money from Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to keep quiet ahead of the 2016 election about sexual encounters she says she had with Trump, who denies they took place.
Avenatti successfully sued Trump to get Daniels out of the nondisclosure agreement.

The criminal charges related to Daniels are among a slew of accusations that have ended Avenatti's career as a lawyer.
Avenatti is appealing a conviction and a 2-1/2-year prison sentence for extorting  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE), and faces dozens of charges in California that he cheated other clients and committed bank fraud, bankruptcy fraud and tax fraud.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain vowed to repair the economic and social fabric of its ""broken heartlands"" on Wednesday, as the government set out a long-awaited plan to flesh out promises that helped Prime Minister Boris Johnson win a big parliamentary majority in 2019.
With Johnson now reeling from public anger over lockdown parties held at his Downing Street residence, his government published plans to funnel investment into towns and regions to mitigate deep-rooted social and economic inequalities.
Economists say geographical disparities in health, education and incomes are large and persistent, with cities such as London, Oxford and Cambridge accused of sucking funding and talent out of the rest of Britain.
Michael Gove, the minister tasked with delivering the policy, known as 'levelling up', said the 2016 Brexit vote to leave the European Union was a ""wake-up call"" that former industrial towns could no longer be overlooked. 
""Economic opportunities spread more equally across the country is at the heart of levelling up, but it's also about community as well,"" he told parliament. ""It's about repairing the social fabric of our broken heartlands.""
Along with a promise to ""get Brexit done"", Johnson's 2019 pledge to prioritise growth in parts of the country outside the affluent southeast helped him to win parliamentary seats in areas that had never voted Conservative before. 
Gove said the plan would result in the biggest shift of power from London to local leaders in modern times. 
'EXTREMELY CHALLENGING'
Successive British governments, both Conservative and Labour, have sought for decades to address inequality by devolving power from Westminster to the regions, but with only limited success. 
Critics say that in the last decade these efforts were patchy and undermined by budget cuts even as some local authorities won new policymaking powers in areas such as transport and planning.
The policies announced on Wednesday include a government spending commitment on research and development, the creation of new mayors and the promotion of innovation clusters. 
Opposition Labour Party lawmaker Lisa Nandy criticised Gove's plan as a list of recycled policies that failed to provide new funding or address the heart of the problems.
Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies also sounded a note of scepticism.
""Meeting the core ambition of simultaneously improving education and skill levels and availability of high paying jobs in poorer regions will prove extremely challenging. Without that, levelling up will not happen,"" he said. 
In a foreword to the policy paper, the prime minister said it would be his ""defining mission"" to level up the country. 
""I am determined to break that link between geography and destiny so that it makes good business sense for the private sector to invest in areas that have for too long felt left behind,"" he wrote.

Johnson is struggling to shore up his premiership after damaging revelations of parties in his Downing Street office and other government buildings held during COVID-19 lockdowns that have upset voters and alienated some lawmakers in his own Conservative Party.
A report on the gatherings on Monday pointed to ""serious failures of leadership"" at the heart of British government.

751,"<span>Feb 02, 2022 11:41AM ET</span>","BRASILIA (Reuters) -COVID-19 infections and deaths in the Americas are still increasing, but the rise in infections seems to be slowing down in places hit earliest by the Omicron variant, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said on Wednesday.
Most of the 7 million new cases reported in the past week were in North America -- some 4 million new infections -- while Chile and Brazil posted record numbers of daily cases. Deaths have more than doubled in Cuba, the Bahamas and Antigua and Barbuda, the regional health agency said.
PAHO said 63% of people across Latin America and the Caribbean have now been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and the region has some of the highest COVID-19 vaccination coverage in the world.
But it remains the most unequal region in the world, with uneven coverage between countries: while 14 countries have fully immunized 70% of their populations, the same number of countries have yet to protect 40% of their people, the agency said. 
More than 54% of people in low- and middle-income countries in the region have yet to receive a single COVID-19 vaccine, PAHO director Carissa Etienne said in a briefing.
There are also some worrisome gaps. For example, in the United States and Anguilla, vaccine coverage among the elderly is lower than in younger groups who are less at risk for severe COVID disease, she said. 

There are also serious blind spots because of a lack of detailed vaccination data in some countries. 
Without those numbers, authorities will not know what proportion of high-risk groups, like the elderly, pregnant women, or health workers, have been protected, Etienne said.

JALAWLA, Iraq (Reuters) - Yousif Ibrahim no longer travels by night along the roads around his hometown of Jalawla in northeastern Iraq. He fears getting caught up in attacks by Islamic State.
""The police and army don't come into our area much anymore. If they do, they get shot at by militants,"" said the 25-year-old, who sells fish for a living in a nearby market.
Nearly three years after the group lost its final enclave, Islamic State fighters are re-emerging as a deadly threat, aided by the lack of central control in many areas, according to a dozen security officials, local leaders and residents in northern Iraq.
Islamic State is far from the formidable force it once was, but militant cells often operating independently have survived across a swathe of northern Iraq and northeastern Syria, and in recent months they have launched increasingly brazen attacks.
""Daesh (Islamic State) isn't as powerful as it was in 2014,"" said Jabar Yawar, a senior official in the Peshmerga forces of Iraq's northern autonomous Kurdistan region.
""Its resources are limited and there's no strong joint leadership,"" he told Reuters in the city of Sulaimaniya. ""But as long as political disputes aren't solved, Daesh will come back.""
Some fear that could be starting to happen.
In late January, Islamic State carried out one of its deadliest attacks against the Iraqi army for years, killing 11 soldiers in a town near Jalawla, according to security sources.
The same day, its militants stormed a prison in Syria under the control of U.S.-backed Kurdish militia in an attempt to free inmates loyal to the group.
It was the biggest attack by Islamic State since the collapse of its self-declared caliphate in 2019. At least 200 prison inmates and militants were killed, as well as 40 Kurdish troops, 77 prison guards and four civilians.
Officials and residents in northern Iraq and eastern Syria lay much of the blame on rivalries between armed groups. When Iraqi, Syrian, Iranian and U.S.-led forces declared Islamic State beaten, they faced off against each other across the territory it had ruled.
Now Iran-backed militias attack U.S. forces. Turkish forces bomb Kurdish separatist militants. A territorial dispute rumbles on between Baghdad and Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region.
The tensions are undermining security and good governance, causing confusion that Islamic State once thrived on.
For Ibrahim, that means crossing checkpoints manned variously by Iraqi soldiers and Shi'ite Muslim paramilitaries to get to work in a town controlled until a few years ago by Kurds.
The remote farmland between each military outpost is where Islamic State militants hide out, according to local officials.
A similar pattern plays out across the 400-mile corridor of mountains and desert through northern Iraq and into Syria where Islamic State once dominated.
Towns like Jalawla bear the scars of fierce fighting five or so years ago - buildings reduced to rubble and scarred with bullet holes. Banners honouring slain commanders from different armed groups jostle for space in town squares.
IRAQI DISPUTES
In some parts of Iraq where Islamic State operates, the main dispute is between the government in Baghdad and the autonomous northern Kurdish region, home to huge deposits of oil and strategic territory that both sides claim.
The jihadists' deadliest attacks in Iraq in recent months have taken place in those areas. Dozens of soldiers, Kurdish fighters and residents have been killed in violence that local officials blamed on militants loyal to the group.
According to Yawar, Islamic State fighters use the no-man's-land between Iraqi army, Kurdish and Shi'ite militia checkpoints to regroup.
""The gaps between the Iraqi army and the Peshmerga are sometimes 40 km (25 miles) wide,"" he said.
Mohammed Jabouri, an Iraqi army commander in the province of Salahuddin, said the militants tended to operate in groups of 10-15 people.
Because of the lack of agreement over territorial control, there are areas where neither the Iraqi army nor Kurdish forces can enter to pursue them, he added.
""That's where Daesh is active,"" he told Reuters by telephone.
Iraqi state paramilitary forces aligned with Iran in theory coordinate with the Iraqi army, but some local officials say that does not always happen.
""The problem is that local commanders, the army and the paramilitaries ... sometimes don't recognise each other's authority,"" said Ahmed Zargosh, mayor of Saadia, a town in a disputed area.
""It means Islamic State militants can operate in the gaps.""
Zargosh lives outside the town he administers, saying he fears assassination by Islamic State militants if he stays there at night.
SYRIA AND THE BORDERS
Islamic State militants at the other end of the corridor of contested territory, in Syria, are taking advantage of the confusion to operate in sparsely populated areas, according to some officials and analysts.
""Fighters (are) entering villages and towns at night and having complete free rein to operate, raid for food, intimidate businesses and extort 'taxes' from the local population,"" said Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think-tank.
""They've got many more local fissures, be they ethnic, political, sectarian, to exploit to their advantage.""
Syrian government forces and Iran-backed militias hold territory to the west of the Euphrates river and U.S.-backed Kurdish forces are stationed to its east, including where the prison attack occurred.
The picture on the Iraqi side of the frontier area is no less complex.
Soldiers and fighters aligned with Iran, Turkey, Syria and the West control different segments of land, with separate checkpoints sometimes just a few hundred feet apart.
Iran and its proxy militias seek to maintain control of Iraqi-Syrian border crossings that are Tehran's gateway to Syria and Lebanon, according to Western and Iraqi officials.
U.S. officials blame those militias for attacking the 2,000 or so American troops stationed in Iraq and Syria fighting Islamic State. Tehran has not commented on whether Iran is involved.
Turkey, meanwhile, launches drone strikes from bases in northern Iraq against Kurdish separatist militants operating on either side of the border.
COLLAPSE OF THE CALIPHATE
At the peak of its power from 2014-2017, Islamic State ruled over millions of people and claimed responsibility for or inspired attacks in dozens of cities around the world.
Its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared his caliphate over a quarter of Iraq and Syria in 2014 before he was killed in a raid by U.S. special forces in northwest Syria in 2019 as the group collapsed.
Armed forces in northern Iraq and northeast Syria say that the sheer number of groups, all enemies of Islamic State, would squash any resurgence.
In the wake of the prison assault, the U.S.-led military coalition fighting Islamic State said in a statement that recent attacks had ultimately made it weaker.
Not all local communities are convinced.

""After the Syria prison attack, we're scared Daesh could come back,"" said Hussein Suleiman, a government worker in the Iraqi town of Sinjar, which Islamic State overran in 2014 and where it slaughtered thousands of members of the Yazidi minority.
""Islamic State came from Syria last time. Iraqi troops and Kurdish forces were here then too, but they fled.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The detained founder of the right-wing Oath Keepers, Stewart Rhodes, will be moved to Washington to await trial on charges of seditious conspiracy for his alleged role in the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, a federal judge ruled on Wednesday.
Rhodes' attorneys had asked U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta to permit Rhodes to stay in Texas, saying it would be too burdensome for them to have to travel back and forth to Washington to prepare for his trial, scheduled for July 11.
""It is not unusual for locally detained January 6th defendants to have counsel who are not in the Washington, D.C. area,"" Mehta wrote in his order. ""The court will not grant Mr. Rhodes more favorable treatment than those similarly-situated defendants.""

Rhodes, 56, is the most high-profile of the more than 725 supporters of then-President Donald Trump charged for their roles in storming the Capitol in a failed bid to block Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's election.
Last month, a magistrate judge in Texas ruled that Rhodes https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-judge-jails-oath-keepers-founder-rhodes-ahead-sedition-trial-2022-01-26 should remain in jail pending trial. He is contesting that decision.

LONDON (Reuters) -The world's first ""human challenge"" trial in which volunteers were deliberately exposed to COVID-19 to advance research into the disease was found to be safe in healthy young adults, leaders of the study said on Wednesday.
The data supports the safety of this model and lays the groundwork for future studies to test new vaccines and medicines against COVID-19 using this kind of trial by the end of this year, the team added.
Open Orphan is running the project, launched last February, with Imperial College London, Britain's vaccines task force and Orphan's clinical company  hVIVO.
Scientists have used human challenge trials for decades to learn more about diseases such as malaria, flu, typhoid and cholera, and to develop treatments and vaccines against them.
The Imperial trial exposed 36 healthy male and female volunteers aged 18-29 years to the original SARS-CoV-2 strain of the virus and monitored them in a quarantined setting. They will be followed up for 12 months after discharge.
No serious adverse events occurred, and the human challenge study model was shown to be safe and well tolerated in healthy young adults, the company said.
""People in this age group are believed to be major drivers of the pandemic and these studies, which are representative of mild infection, allow detailed investigation of the factors responsible for infection and pandemic spread,"" said Chris Chiu, chief investigator on the trial and professor of infectious diseases at Imperial.
The Imperial researchers said they now planned to start a similar study using the Delta variant, and will share their framework around the globe to allow similar research.
That could provide a crucial route to testing new vaccines, antivirals and diagnostics against COVID-19 more quickly, particularly if transmission rates fall in the real world.
Imperial said it could start tests like this using human challenge trials by the end of 2022.
In April, Oxford University launched another human challenge trial which sought to reinfect people to deepen understanding about immunity.
CLINICAL INSIGHTS
The results of the Imperial study, published on a pre-print server and yet to be peer reviewed, also provide some clinical insights that could inform public health policies. 
Researchers found that symptoms start to develop on average about two days after contact with the virus, Imperial said, which is earlier than the widely held view that the virus has an incubation period of around five days.
The infection first appears in the throat; infectious virus peaks about five days into infection, which is also when the most significant symptoms are usually noticed, the researchers said. At that stage, the virus is significantly more abundant in the nose than the throat.
They also found that rapid lateral flow tests were a reliable indicator of whether infectious virus was present and therefore the person was likely to be able to transmit the virus. Most people had live virus in their nose for an average of 6.5 days, they said.
Eighteen volunteers became infected, 16 of whom went on to develop mild-to-moderate cold-like symptoms, including a stuffy or runny nose, sneezing, and a sore throat, Imperial said.
Some experienced headaches, muscle/joint aches, tiredness and fever. None developed serious symptoms. 
Thirteen infected volunteers temporarily lost their sense of smell, but this returned within 90 days in all but three participants – the remainder continue to show improvement after three months.
There were no changes seen in their lungs, or any serious adverse events. Only one person had any lingering symptoms by six months - a slightly reduced sense of smell which was improving.

The trial used the lowest dose necessary to infect people, although the team said it was comparable to real-world infections.
The scientists will now study other elements from the trial, including investigating why the 16 of the 34 participants in the final analysis did not get infected despite exposure. Some had detectable virus in their nose but did not go on to test positive twice on PCR tests, the threshold the team used for confirmed infection.

The European Union already has standards for products from household appliances to toys, but now wants a system for its green and digital transition that goes beyond product safety or inter-operability to include environmental and labour criteria and its democratic values.
""Technical standards are of strategic importance. Europe's technological sovereignty, ability to reduce dependencies and protection of EU values will rely on our ability to be a global standard-setter,"" Internal Markets Commissioner Thierry Breton said in a statement.
Hydrogen's use as a clean fuel, increased production of batteries, connected devices and artificial intelligence all raise issues about environmental and labour standards, data protection and cybersecurity.
EU officials point to China's new strategy on standardisation introduced at the end of the last year, saying this highlights a need for the bloc to act faster and join forces with other ""like-minded"" countries.
The EU executive will also fund standardisation projects in neighbouring countries and in Africa.
The Commission proposal wants more standards set more rapidly for COVID-19 vaccines and medicines, recycling of critical raw materials, clean hydrogen, low-carbon cement, semiconductors and data.
Standards can take four to six years to develop, EU officials say.

The Commission proposal seeks to align projects funded by its Horizon Europe research and innovation programme with its standardisation aims and, with many experts nearing retirement age, promote this as a career opportunity for young people.
The proposal will also give a stronger voice to national authorities in the EU's 27 member states on standard-setting, to limit the influence of non-EU companies or bodies in areas such as cybersecurity and hydrogen.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union says it is ready to impose ""massive"" economic sanctions on Russia if it invades Ukraine, but officials and diplomats say the threat depends on complex negotiations involving 27 member states that are far from complete. 
An invasion in the next few days, they say, would probably be too soon for EU negotiators who are still trying to find a package of measures that all can agree. 
Moscow denies it is planning an invasion and has accused the West of hysteria over a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine's borders.
""Energy dependency makes a deal more difficult for the EU than for the United States. Getting political agreement is harder,"" said a senior EU diplomat. ""There's no free lunch. We have a deep relationship with Russia so there will be economic pain, and for some more than others.""
It was not immediately clear which EU countries have been the most hesitant in negotiations or when the bloc might be ready to move on sanctions which it says would have ""massive consequences and severe costs"". 
Talks are being held in secret between EU capitals and the bloc's executive body, the European Commission, not as a group in Brussels.
""Conversations are under way with member states. We don't want to do this in public. Moscow is good at exploiting divisions,"" said a second EU diplomat. 
EU economies are more exposed than the United States. Their exports to Russia declined by a fifth in the two years following Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 that led to Western sanctions being imposed on Moscow, according to EU data.
Germany's position as the EU's biggest consumer of Russian gas will be crucial in negotiations. Diplomats see no big difference so far between France and Germany, the EU's traditional big powers, on the need for tough sanctions.
Russia is the EU's fifth-largest trading partner overall, and Russia supplied 44% of the gas the EU imported in 2020. But gas makes up from 75% to 100% of the value of gas imports in Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Romania, Latvia, Estonia and Finland, according to EU data.
Germany and Italy are among the biggest exporters to Russia, with sales in sectors from manufactured goods to mining. 
Many governments want to know what constitutes a trigger for sanctions, something privately raised by EU foreign ministers at a meeting last month. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, visiting Moscow, said sanctions were counterproductive. 
""For now we're just working on the package. The question of when we would activate them, that hasn't been decided,"" said a third EU diplomat. 
Russian intervention in Ukraine could range from covert action such as orchestrating a coup to cyberattacks and a full-blown invasion, Western military experts say. 
SOFTER ON OLIGARCHS?
Mindful of the delays to a first round of EU sanctions imposed on Belarus in 2020 over a crackdown on mass street protests in the former Soviet republic, the European Commission is drawing up proposals on sanctions after exploring what is workable in meetings with member states.
Once all 27 have been consulted, discussions between EU states can start, with the goal of having something ready to present to EU leaders if Russia invades. 
EU diplomats and officials say the EU's sanctions would not be identical to those of the United States and that nothing is off the table, including punitive measures over the SWIFT global interbank payments system used for Russian money flows.
There would be a clear grading system, or ""escalation ladder"" of severity of sanctions, depending on Russian actions. 
Hitting Russian individuals with travel bans and asset freezes would be a first response. But the EU does not yet have a list of names, even if there is general agreement that - unlike the United States - Putin himself would not be a target because of a desire to keep diplomatic channels open. 
Also unlike the United States, which want to target Russia's economic elite with funds in the West, the EU says it would need clear evidence of oligarchs' wrongdoing or risk legal challenges to the sanctions in European courts.
There is more agreement on imposing sanctions on Russian defence companies or introducing export controls on Western technology, possibly linked to artificial intelligence.
Other measures could include extending a list of state-owned enterprises banned from doing business with the EU, sanctions on specific Russian products and on the Russian financial and banking sectors although Austrian, Hungarian, Italian and French banks have local branches in Russia.

The energy sector sanctions remain the most difficult because Russia could restrict gas supplies to Europe. Germany has signalled it might take punitive measures over Nord Stream 2, a recently completed pipeline from Russia to Germany, but Berlin faces tough choices before it acts.
Targeting Russia's coal sector is also under discussion.

The positions set out in the two documents, which were officially handed to Moscow on Jan. 26, are consistent with public statements by Washington and its allies in the past, particularly in terms of offering military transparency.
The United States has also long said that NATO's European missile shield in Romania, and a planned site in Poland, will not serve as a future defence against Russian rockets, but to defend against threats from Iran and the wider Middle East.
In its written reply, the United States offered transparency over its Romanian and Polish missile sites if Moscow did the same at two sites in Russia.

In the NATO document, the 30-member alliance said: ""the reversal of Russia's military build-up in and around Ukraine will be essential for substantive progress.""
The West says more than 100,000 Russian troops are positioned on Ukraine's borders and in Belarus. Russia denies Western accusations it is planning to invade Ukraine.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Beijing's COVID-shortened Olympic torch relay began on Wednesday with basketball great Yao Ming and a Chinese soldier wounded in a bloody 2020 border clash with India among the first to carry the symbolic flame on a journey that will last only three days.
The route taking the flame to landmarks including the Great Wall is far more modest than the globe-spanning tour ahead of Beijing's 2008 Summer Games that was disrupted by protests.
Because of COVID-19, only selected members of the public will witness the relay, as will be the case during the Feb. 4-20 Games, which take place inside a ""closed loop"" keeping competitors and other Olympics personnel away from the public.
""That is, of course, bad luck but what can you do?"", Georgios Iliopoulos, Greece's ambassador to China and a torch-bearer, said when asked if he was worried that the 2022 Games would be remembered as the ""corona Olympics"". 
""You cannot stop life and we do the best we can to continue with what we have to deal with,"" he said before carrying the red-and-silver spiral that resembles a fluttering ribbon.
COVID-19 and China's battle against it was reflected in Wednesday's lineup, which included Pang Xinghuo, vice director at the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control and a regular at coronavirus media briefings.
Movie director Zhang Yimou, who is reprising his 2008 role as opening ceremony director, was torch-bearer number 134. 
""I really hope Gu Ailing can win a medal,"" Zhang told Chinese media, referring to the U.S. born freestyle skier also known as Eileen Gu, who is competing for China. 
The flame will travel to competition zones before ending its journey with the lighting of the Olympic cauldron at Friday's opening ceremony.
Wednesday's event began when Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng lit a torch from a cauldron in the shape of traditional vessel known as a zun, then handed it to 80-year-old Luo Zhihuan, who as a speed skater was China's first winter sports world champion.
The first day ended at Big Air Shougang, a former steel mill that was turned into an Olympic venue.

Among Wednesday's torch-bearers was Qi Fabao, a People's Liberation Army regimental commander who was seriously wounded during a 2020 border clash with Indian troops that killed four Chinese soldiers.
Asked during the sub-freezing morning how he felt as an Olympics torch-bearer, Yao, who played for the Houston Rockets, said: ""Pretty cold, because the previous two times were for the Summer Olympics. But it's warm to hold a flame in the winter.""

KYIV/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the West on Tuesday of deliberately creating a scenario designed to lure it into war and ignoring Russia's security concerns over Ukraine. 
In his first direct public comments on the crisis for nearly six weeks, a defiant Putin showed no sign of backing down from security demands that the West has called non-starters and a possible excuse to launch an invasion, which Moscow denies.
""It's already clear now ... that fundamental Russian concerns were ignored,"" Putin said at a news conference with the visiting prime minister of Hungary, one of several NATO leaders trying to intercede with him as the crisis has intensified.
Putin described a potential future scenario in which Ukraine was admitted to NATO and then attempted to recapture the Crimea peninsula, territory Russia seized in 2014.
""Let's imagine Ukraine is a NATO member and starts these military operations. Are we supposed to go to war with the NATO bloc? Has anyone given that any thought? Apparently not,"" he said.
Russia has massed more than 100,000 troops on the Ukrainian border and Western countries say they fear Putin may be planning to invade.
Russia denies this but has said it could take unspecified military action unless its security demands are met. Western countries say any invasion would bring sanctions on Moscow.
The Kremlin wants the West to respect a 1999 agreement that no country can strengthen its own security at the expense of others, which it considers at the heart of the crisis, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. 
He raised the charter signed in Istanbul by members of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which includes the United States and Canada, during a call with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
Lavrov said Blinken accepted the need to discuss the matter further whilst a U.S. account of the call focused on the need for Moscow to pull back.
""If President Putin truly does not intend war or regime change, the Secretary told Foreign Minister Lavrov then this is the time to pull back troops and heavy weaponry and engage in a serious discussion,"" a senior State Department official told reporters. 
The U.S. is willing to discuss giving the Kremlin a way to verify the absence of Tomahawk cruise missiles at NATO bases in Romania and Poland, if Russia shares similar information about missiles on certain Russian bases, Bloomberg reported. 
The White House and State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment but a source familiar with the situation said the United States has only offered to have talks on a variety of Russia's concerns, such as arms control issues in the appropriate forums.
'INSTRUMENT'
Putin had not spoken publicly about the Ukraine crisis since Dec. 23, leaving ambiguity about his personal position while diplomats from Russia and the West have been engaged in repeated rounds of talks.
His remarks on Tuesday reflected a world view in which Russia needs to defend itself from an aggressive and hostile United States. Washington is not primarily concerned with Ukraine's security, but with containing Russia, Putin said.
""In this sense, Ukraine itself is just an instrument to achieve this goal,"" he said. 
""This can be done in different ways, by drawing us into some kind of armed conflict and, with the help of their allies in Europe, forcing the introduction against us of those harsh sanctions they are talking about now in the U.S."" 
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has often sparred with Western European leaders over democracy in his own country, said he believed after his talks with Putin that there was room for a compromise.
""I got convinced today that the existing differences in positions can be bridged and it is possible to sign an agreement that would guarantee peace, guarantee Russia's security and is acceptable for NATO member states as well,"" Orban said.
GUN TO UKRAINE'S HEAD
As Western countries rush to show solidarity with Ukraine, the U.S. urged Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro to cancel a visit with Putin in Russia, a source told Reuters. 
On Tuesday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson met President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv and accused Putin of holding a gun to Ukraine's head to demand changes to the security architecture in Europe.
""It is vital that Russia steps back and chooses a path of diplomacy,"" Johnson said. ""And I believe that is still possible. We are keen to engage in dialogue, of course we are, but we have the sanctions ready, we're providing military support and we will also intensify our economic cooperation.""
Johnson said any Russian invasion of Ukraine would lead to a military and humanitarian disaster. 
""There are 200,000 men and women under arms in Ukraine, they will put up a very, very fierce and bloody resistance,"" he said. ""I think that parents, mothers in Russia should reflect on that fact and I hope very much that President Putin steps back from the path of conflict and that we engage in dialogue.""
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, also visiting Kyiv, said Poland would help Ukraine with gas and arms supplies, as well as humanitarian and economic aid.
""Living close to a neighbour like Russia, we have the feeling of living at the foot of a volcano,"" said Morawiecki.

Zelenskiy, who has repeatedly played down the prospect of an imminent invasion, signed a decree to boost his armed forces by 100,000 troops over three years. He urged lawmakers to stay calm and avoid panic. 
The troop increase was ""not because we will soon have a war ... but so that soon and in the future there will be peace in Ukraine,"" Zelenskiy said.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also told Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in a telephone call on Tuesday that Washington would send the guided missile destroyer the USS Cole to partner with the UAE navy ahead of a port call in Abu Dhabi.
""The Secretary also informed the Crown Prince of his decision to deploy 5th Generation Fighter aircraft to assist the UAE against the current threat and as a clear signal that the United States stands with the UAE as a long-standing strategic partner,"" the U.S. Defense Department said in a release.
The UAE on Monday intercepted a missile during a visit by Israel's president, the third such attack in two weeks claimed by the Iran-aligned group that is battling a Saudi-led coalition that includes the UAE.
A week earlier, the U.S. military said it had fired multiple Patriot missile interceptors at two inbound missiles which the Houthis said they fired at the UAE's al-Dhafra air base.
The Emirati envoy to the United Nations last week said the UAE may upgrade its defensive capabilities and was in discussions with the United States. 
The United States would continue providing early warning intelligence and collaborate on air defence, Austin told Sheikh Mohammed, the UAE's de facto ruler.

The attacks on the UAE, the region's commercial and tourism hub, are an escalation in the Yemen war, in which the Houthis have repeatedly launched missiles and drones at Saudi Arabia.
The coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 after the Houthis ousted the government from the capital, Sanaa.

761,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 11:31PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Myanmar's shadow government, set up after last year's military coup, said it accepts the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to hear allegations that the country committed genocide against its Rohingya minority.
Before the military seized power last year, Myanmar's government led by the now-ousted Aung San Suu Kyi had filed preliminary objections to the ICJ over the case brought by Gambia in a move seen as likely to delay proceedings.
The National Unity Government (NUG), a parallel administration including deposed lawmakers in exile, said in a statement issued on Tuesday that it had withdrawn all preliminary objections to the case.
Still, it is not clear whether this would affect the legal process since the NUG said that through a ""bureaucratic idiosyncrasy"" the ICJ has been communicating with Myanmar diplomats in Brussels who were under the control of the junta. 
""Should the ICJ recognise the military, it would embolden the junta to continue and escalate its daily atrocity crimes,"" the NUG said in a statement. 
It urged the ICJ to deal with Myanmar's permanent representative to the United Nations, Kyaw Moe Tun.
The ICJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment and a spokesman for Myanmar's junta did not answer a telephone call seeking comment.
More than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims fled Myanmar's Rakhine State in 2017 after a military crackdown. 
Rights groups documented killings of civilians and burning of villages and U.N. investigators concluded that the military campaign, launched after attacks on the security forces by Rohingya insurgents, had been executed with ""genocidal intent"".
In December 2019, Suu Kyi, then Myanmar's civilian leader, attended hearings at The Hague to ask judges to dismiss the case.

Suu Kyi has been put on trial by the junta and faces years in jail, though the removal of her government has sparked mass protests and a bloody crackdown on dissent by the army. 
With Myanmar's military government fighting for international recognition, sources close to the case have previously said the junta has been engaging with the ICJ to submit court-ordered reports every six months on the situation with the Rohingya. The reports are not public.

BISSAU (Reuters) -Guinea-Bissau's President Umaro Sissoco Embalo survived an attempted coup on Tuesday but said many members of the security forces had been killed repelling an attack on democracy that may have been linked to drug trafficking.
Earlier, heavy gunfire rang out near a government compound where Embalo had been chairing a cabinet meeting. The situation was unclear for several hours, during which the African Union and West African bloc ECOWAS condemned what they called ""an attempted coup"".
The fast-moving events in the former Portuguese colony on the West African coast came just over a week after the military in Burkina Faso, another country in the region, deposed the president there.
Appearing in the evening in a video posted on the Guinea-Bissau presidency's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, Embalo said attackers had tried to enter the compound just after the cabinet meeting but had been repelled.
""It wasn't just a coup. It was an attempt to kill the president, the prime minister and all the cabinet,"" he said.
He added that the attack ""was well prepared and organised and could also be related to people involved in drug trafficking"", giving no further details.
Poverty-stricken Guinea-Bissau is viewed by the United Nations as a major waypoint for Latin American cocaine headed for Europe. U.S. and European authorities have long suspected that some in the country's military are involved in the drug trade.
Embalo, who had enjoyed strong support from the military during a previous political crisis, suggested in his video that the army was not involved in Tuesday's attack.
""I can assure you that no camp joined this attempted coup. It was isolated. It is linked to people we have fought against,"" he said, without elaborating.
He said arrests had begun of people involved, but he did not know how many.
'COUP CONTAGION'
Portugal's President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said on his official website he had spoken to Embalo by telephone and had ""conveyed his vehement condemnation ... of these attacks against the constitutional order of Guinea-Bissau"".
Prior to Embalo's video, the African Union had said some government members were being detained and had called on the military to release them, without giving details.
Political instability has blighted Guinea-Bissau for decades, with nine previous coups or attempted coups since independence in 1974.
During the hours of confusion on Tuesday, the Portuguese embassy had urged its citizens in Guinea-Bissau to stay at home while U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was ""deeply concerned"" by what was going on in the capital Bissau.
Embalo had begun chairing an extraordinary cabinet meeting at around 10 a.m., entering the government palace with a heavy security detail, a diplomatic source said. While he was present in the building, gunfire began outside.
The cabinet meeting was being held to prepare for a forthcoming ECOWAS summit in response to last week's military takeover in Burkina Faso, the latest in a rash of coups across the region in the last 18 months.

""It looks increasingly hard to argue against the idea of coup contagion,"" said Eric Humphrey-Smith, an analyst at risk consultancy Verisk (NASDAQ:VRSK) Maplecroft.
""When added to successful coups in Mali, Burkina Faso, Guinea and Chad in the past year, there is no doubt that West African leaders are nervously looking over their shoulders.""

DENVER (Reuters) - A former University of California at Los Angeles instructor accused of posting online threats of violence against the campus, disrupting a day of classes, was arrested in Colorado on Tuesday after a standoff with police, officials said.
Matthew Christopher Harris, 31, drew authorities' attention on Monday night after an 800-page manifesto with references to mass shootings and bombings was allegedly emailed by Harris to students and faculty of the UCLA philosophy department where he once taught, police said.
As a precaution, university officials canceled in-person classes for all 31,000 students on the Los Angeles campus on Tuesday, UCLA officials said in a statement, while law enforcement officials mounted an interstate hunt for Harris.
UCLA campus police traced the former instructor to an apartment building in Boulder, Colorado, across the street from the University of Colorado’s flagship campus, and alerted authorities there, Boulder Police Chief Maris Herold told a news conference.
As Harris became aware early Tuesday that police had surrounded the apartment house, he sent out ""additional threats to numerous individuals,"" which ""elevated the level of concern,"" police said in a statement.
In response, Boulder police evacuated a nearby elementary school and sent out reverse-911 telephone calls advising members of the public in the vicinity to remain indoors.
Herold said law enforcement negotiators made telephone contact with Harris, who ultimately surrendered without incident about four hours after the siege began.
The heavy police presence rattled residents of the Boulder neighborhood, just two miles from a grocery store where a lone gunman killed 10 people in a shooting last year.
Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty said Harris was detained on state charges, but as the alleged threats involved multiple states, he could face federal charges as well.
Harris attempted to buy a handgun in Colorado last fall but the purchase was denied because a background check revealed a protective order had been filed against him in California, Dougherty said.
Herold said the written manifesto contained thousands of ""very disturbing"" references to violence, including allusions to ""bombs"" and a ""schoolyard massacre."" Harris was also suspected of posting threatening videos online, police said.
Los Angeles television station KABC reported the footage in question involved hundreds of clips, including video of the 2017 mass shooting at a Las Vegas music festival and the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado.

Police did not immediately disclose what specific grievances Harris may have raised in the threats he was accused of making.
UCLA officials said in-person classes would resume as normal on Wednesday now that Harris was in custody.

(Reuters) -U.S. regulators are considering the first COVID-19 vaccine for children under the age of 5, the only age group not yet eligible for the shots, after  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) began the regulatory approval process on Tuesday.
A decision is expected as soon as this month.
The companies said they began submitting data for an emergency use authorization even though they did not meet a key target in their clinical trial of 2- to 4- year olds. They are submitting the data at the request of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in order to address an urgent public health need in the age group, they said.
The arrival of a vaccine for younger children could help harried parents who have had to contend with quarantines and closures of pre-schools and daycare centers. 
""Having a safe and effective vaccine available for children in this age group is a priority,"" acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said. She said the agency asked for the application because of the recent Omicron surge.
The FDA said an outside committee of expert advisers would meet on Feb. 15 to discuss the authorization. If that goes forward, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention also needs to sign off on how the vaccinations will be implemented, following a meeting of its own advisers. Those meetings have tended to follow within a week or so of FDA decisions.
The drug companies said they are asking the FDA for authorization of the first two doses of a planned three-dose regimen. 
""If two doses are authorized, parents will have the opportunity to begin a COVID-19 vaccination series for their children while awaiting potential authorization of a third dose,"" Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said. 
He said the company believes three doses of the vaccine will be needed ""to achieve high levels of protection against current and potential future variants."" 
The companies expect to complete submitting data to the FDA in the coming days, with data on the third dose to follow.
Pfizer and BioNTech are testing a 3-microgram dose of the vaccine in the age group, compared with a 10-microgram dose in 5- to 11-year-olds and 30 micrograms for people aged 12 and older.
The companies said they expect to have ample supply of the 3-microgram shots should the FDA authorize the vaccine.
EVIDENCE OF CLINICAL BENEFIT?
The move could speed up the inoculation timeline for this age group by months. If a third dose is eventually authorized, many children could already have begun the regimen. Pfizer is currently testing two doses three weeks apart, followed by a third dose at least eight weeks later.
In December, Pfizer said it was amending its clinical trial to test a three-dose version of the vaccine because the lower-dose generated an immune response in 2- to 4-year-olds that was inferior to the response measured in those aged 16 to 25. In 6- month- to 24-month-old children, the vaccine generated an immune response in line with 16- to 25-year-olds.
John Grabenstein, former executive director of medical affairs for vaccines at Merck, said he believes regulators should consider the vaccine as a two-dose course, rather than as the first two doses of a planned three dose regimen.
""I cannot think of any example ever where the FDA reached a regulatory decision without knowing the data from the end of the trial,"" Grabenstein said. ""I just can't believe that they would authorize getting started without knowing what the third dose would do.""
But John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College, said the plan ""sounds like a creative solution to a real problem, and there's no safety implications, which would otherwise be a dealbreaker.""
The vaccine is already approved for emergency use in children in the United States as young as 5. It has full approval for adults.
The FDA also has authorized a third booster dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech shot for adults and children aged 12 and older. It gave the green light for a two-dose vaccine for children ages 5 to 11.

It remains unclear how many parents will choose to vaccinate their younger children.
Vaccinating children has been slow in the United States with only around 22% of 5- to 11 year-olds having received two shots since the campaign to inoculate that age group began in November.

RICHMOND, Va. (Reuters) - A year after George Floyd's murder sparked the toppling of Confederate statues, the United States continues removing segregationist symbols at an unprecedented rate, according to a Southern Poverty Law Center report released on Tuesday.
But the removal of 73 statues, signs and school names in 2021 goes beyond the math, said Lecia Brooks, the center's chief of staff.
Demand for the destruction of symbols such as those honoring Confederate commander Robert E. Lee shows an awakening to the harm inflicted on the American public by honoring racist figures, racial equality advocates say.
""We've seen tremendous movement with respect to the removal of monuments and memorials dedicated to Robert E. Lee,"" Brooks said, noting that more shrines honored him nationwide than any other Confederate leader.
""What this tells us is that the public has become educated about these so-called Confederate leaders and are demanding they be removed from public space.""
Teardowns included the removal in September of a Robert E. Lee statue from its base in Virginia's capital city of Richmond after a year-long legal battle over the monument that was the focus of protests over racial injustice.
In its report ""Whose Heritage?"", the center said the May 25, 2020 murder of Floyd, a Black man killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis, sparked a racial reckoning and removal of symbols at 159 sites across the nation.
Teardowns of Confederate symbols in both 2020 and 2021 far outpaced 2019, when just 21 of them were dismantled, the report said.

Removal campaigns, often spearheaded by student groups and local officials, face hurdles in six southern states that created or passed so-called heritage bills to outlaw removal of Confederate symbols, Brooks said.
In Montgomery, Alabama, the City Council in October renamed Jeff Davis Avenue, which honored Confederate states President Jefferson Davis, to Fred D. Gray Avenue in honor of the lawyer for Rosa Parks, a Black woman whose refusal to give up her seat on a segregated bus helped launch the American civil rights movement. The state attorney general's office is contesting the renaming.

(Reuters) -Streets in some of Myanmar's main cities were nearly deserted on Tuesday as opponents of military rule held ""silent strikes"", marking the first anniversary of a coup that led to deadly chaos and snuffed out tentative steps towards democracy.
The United States, Britain and Canada imposed new sanctions on the military and joined other countries in calling for a global halt in arms sales to Myanmar, a year after Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government was overthrown.
Since its bloody suppression of protests in the weeks following the coup, the military has faced armed resistance on multiple fronts in the countryside from groups allied with the ousted government https://widerimage.reuters.com/story/in-myanmar-jungle-civilians-prepare-to-battle-military-rulers.
On Tuesday, an explosion took place during a procession of military supporters in the eastern border town of Tachileik, two witnesses told Reuters. The blast killed two people, said one of the witnesses, and wounded more than 30 others.
State media on Tuesday said junta chief Min Aung Hlaing extended a state of emergency for a further six months to address threats from ""internal and external saboteurs"" and ""terrorist attacks and destruction"".
Activists urged people to stay indoors and businesses to close in a silent show of defiance, despite warnings of arrests, jail and a seizure of businesses.
""We might be arrested and spend our life in jail if we're lucky. We might be tortured and killed if we're unlucky,"" saidyouth activist Nan Lin.
A military spokesman did not respond to telephone calls seeking comment on Tuesday.
STREETS QUIET
Images on social media showed quiet streets in various cities including Mandalay, Magway, Myitkyina and Yangon, where pictures on a page put up by strike organisers later showed a small protest at which people threw red paint on the ground.
A man set himself on fire in the central town of Kyaukdataung and was in a serious condition in hospital, according to a resident and to local news outlets, which said the man was protesting at intermittent power supplies. 
""He set fire to himself at the Main Street in front of the electricity office,"" a resident told Reuters by phone. ""He is in a serious condition. The situation is quite unstable here today.""
There were also pro-junta events in several locations, including the capital, Naypyitaw, where thousands attended a rally, some dancing and holding aloft photographs of Min Aung Hlaing, with banners wishing him good health.
The was no claim of responsibility for the explosion in Tachileik and a local militia group did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The town's news agency said a soldier was among the two killed, and veterans among the wounded.
""We all heard an explosion and people ran randomly, shouting loudly,"" a witness told Reuters by phone. ""I hid inside the house."" 
Another witness told Reuters two people died instantly and the town was now deserted. 
HUGE BACKLASH
Such violence has become commonplace in Myanmar in the year since Suu Kyi and other ruling party members were arrested as they prepared to take their seats in parliament, after winning a 2020 election the generals accused them of rigging.
The coup triggered a huge backlash, with strikes and protests that led to about 1,500 civilians being killed in crackdowns and more than 11,787 unlawfully held, according to United Nations human rights office figures on Tuesday.
A junta spokesman did not respond to calls seeking comment on the U.N. figures. It has previously disputed similar numbers from human rights groups.
The U.N. human rights expert on Myanmar, Tom Andrews, on Tuesday said the junta was functioning like a criminal enterprise, harming its people and stealing their resources.
""The international community must take strong, meaningful steps to cut the junta's access to weapons, funds and legitimacy,"" Andrews said. 
The military has accused the U.N. of bias and interference https://reut.rs/3pIgjFn and is refusing to bow to international pressure, despite a corporate retreat https://reut.rs/3gt2jtj from Myanmar and sanctions.
The military ruled for decades after a 1962 coup but had begun to withdraw from politics in 2010, freeing Suu Kyi after years of house arrest. 
Her party formed a government after a 2015 election, but was required to share power with the army until the military abruptly ended the experiment with reform a year ago.
Life has become a grind for many since then with the economy withering https://reut.rs/3GfwE90, regular power cuts and internet curbs.
Suu Kyi, 76, is on trial in more than a dozen cases https://reut.rs/3uc4zgv that carry a combined maximum sentence of more than 150 years in prison.
An internationally backed diplomatic effort led by Southeast Asian countries has faltered. 

""It's very lamentable, until this time there has not been significant progress,"" Indonesia's foreign ministry said.
Singapore said conditions for the Myanmar people continued to deteriorate and called for progress and Suu Kyi's release.

(Reuters) -Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady announced his NFL retirement on Tuesday after an age-defying career during which he won a record seven Super Bowl championships and established himself as arguably the greatest player in the sport's history.
The 44-year-old Brady, known for his tenacity, intelligent playmaking abilities and remarkable leadership, spent 20 seasons with the New England Patriots where he won six Super Bowl titles and added another last year in his first season with the Bucs.
""I have always believed the sport of football is an 'all-in' proposition - if a 100% competitive commitment isn't there, you won't succeed, and success is what I love so much about our game,"" Brady wrote in a lengthy social media post.
""There is a physical, mental, and emotional challenge EVERY single day that has allowed me to maximize my highest potential. And I have tried my very best these past 22 years. There are no shortcuts to success on the field or in life.
""This is difficult for me to write, but here it goes: I am not going to make that competitive commitment anymore. I have loved my NFL career, and now it is time to focus my time and energy on other things that require my attention.""
Brady's decision follows a dominant season during which he led the NFL in touchdown passes and passing yards. He could win a fourth league Most Valuable Player trophy, which would make him the oldest player to win the award.
In what proved to be his final game, Brady rallied the Bucs from a 27-3 second-half deficit against the Los Angeles Rams nine days ago but his team were ultimately eliminated from the playoffs by a last-second field goal.
A surefire first-ballot Hall of Famer, Brady's decision to retire comes after conflicting reports over the weekend about his competitive future. 
""I've done a lot of reflecting the past week and have asked myself difficult questions,"" wrote Brady.
""And I am so proud of what we have achieved. My team mates, coaches, fellow competitors, and fans deserve 100% of me, but right now, it's best I leave the field of play to the next generation of dedicated and committed athletes.""
PATRIOTS DYNASTY
A lightly regarded prospect coming out of college, Brady was the 199th pick in the 2000 NFL Draft but made the most of his chance when it finally came and in doing so turned around the fortunes of the Patriots franchise.
At the start of the 2001 campaign Brady was a then-unknown backup but took over the starting role in the second game of the season after starter Drew Bledsoe went down with an injury and he never relinquished the role.
Brady went on to lead the Patriots to an 11-3 record that season, which culminated with an upset win over of the St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl where he was named the game's MVP and so began one of the greatest dynasties across any sport.
""Tom Brady will be remembered as one of the greatest to ever play in the NFL,"" said NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.
""An incredible competitor and leader, his stellar career is remarkable for its longevity but also for the sustained excellence he displayed year after year.
""Tom made everyone around him better and always seemed to rise to the occasion in the biggest moments.""
But Brady's career was not without controversy.
He was suspended for the first four games of the 2016 season as a result of the so-called ""Deflategate"" scandal after the NFL discovered the Patriots used underinflated balls in a 45-7 rout of the Indianapolis Colts that sent them to the Super Bowl.
In 2020, Brady made a surprising decision to join a Bucs team that had not been to the post-season in 13 years and said at the time the move was in part to seek out new challenges and do things that had never been done before.
But despite a different setting, the result was familiar.
Brady, in his first season with his new team, reached his 10th Super Bowl and Tampa Bay became the first team to play the championship game in their home stadium. Brady also became the second quarterback to win a title with two separate teams.
""To my Bucs team mates the past two years, I love you guys, and I have loved going to battle with you. You have dug so deep to challenge yourself, and it inspired me to wake up every day and give you my best,"" said Brady.
""I am always here for you guys and want to see you continue to push yourselves to be your best. I couldn't be happier with what we accomplished together.""
RECORD SETTER
A Northern California native, Brady rewrote the NFL record book during his glittering career, including holding the mark as the all-time leader in passing yards, passing touchdowns and quarterback wins.
He appeared in a record 10 Super Bowls, winning the game's MVP award five times, and his 15 Pro Bowl selections is the most in league history.
Brady is the father of three and he and his wife, supermodel Gisele Bundchen, have been building a house together near Miami. He said how he spends his days will be a ""work-in-progress"" but that he wants to spend time giving to others.
""My playing career has been such a thrilling ride, and far beyond my imagination, and full of ups and downs. When you're in it every day, you really don't think about any kind of ending,"" said Brady.

""As I sit here now, however, I think of all the great players and coaches I was privileged to play with and against -the competition was fierce and deep, JUST HOW WE LIKE IT.
""But the friendships and relationships are just as fierce and deep. I will remember and cherish these memories and re-visit them often. I feel like the luckiest person in the world.""

(Reuters) -At least a dozen historically Black colleges and universities in the United States received bomb threats and put their campuses on lockdown on Tuesday, a day after a rash of similar threats forced several of them to cancel classes. 
The threats in cities from Baltimore to New Orleans coincided with the first day of U.S. Black History Month. 
""We don't think it's by coincidence that we received this particular threat at this particular time,"" said A. Zachary Faison, Jr., president of Edward Waters (NYSE:WAT) University in Jacksonville, Florida.
A 3:30 a.m. caller to the Jacksonville sheriff's office warned that ""multiple explosive devices"" had been placed around the campus and would be detonated 12 hours later, followed by a school shooting, Faison said. 
Local law enforcement officers with dogs were patrolling the campus as of midday on Tuesday, he said. The Jacksonville sheriff's office declined comment.
In a statement the FBI said it was aware of the bomb threats and working with its law enforcement partners to address potential threats. It encouraged members of the public to report anything suspicious to the bureau.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki told a press briefing that ""we take these threats incredibly seriously,"" but said the White House still did know what had motivated the threats.
The U.S. intelligence community warned months ago of a threat that racially motivated violent extremists, such as white supremacists, would seek to carry out mass-casualty attacks on civilians. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-terrorism/u-s-report-warns-of-threats-from-white-supremacists-militias-idUSKBN2B92SG
Howard University in Washington, Morgan State University in Maryland, Spelman College in Georgia and Xavier University of Louisiana were among the colleges that received threats, according to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) posts and statements from the schools.
""Institutions in the Black community become targets when issues of race, issues of civil rights, issues of equality bubble to the surface and become the focal point of American society,"" said Howard University librarian Lopez Matthews, Jr.
Matthews said Howard University came under threat from racist attackers during riots in Washington in 1919, and again in the 1960s during the U.S. civil rights movement. 
Howard gave the all clear a few hours after the campus received a threat at around 2:55 a.m., but not all students were reassured. 
""We will not let (the threats) deter us from fulfilling our mission of providing superior educational experiences to our students,"" Howard University said in a statement.
Half of Caleb Brown's classmates were absent from his film-directing class on Tuesday morning, the Howard senior told Reuters in an interview.
""For just today and tomorrow, if we could have gone virtual and they could have brought in a team to sweep every building on campus from top to bottom to really check and make sure that campus is safe, I would feel more at ease,"" said Brown, 22, a television and film major.

By noon on Tuesday, at least six of the colleges that received threats had investigated them and issued ""all clear"" messages, though some, including Spelman and Tougaloo College in Mississippi, were still holding class virtually for the day. 
On Monday, several of the colleges told students and staff to shelter in place and canceled classes for the day after similar bomb threats. Authorities said they did not find any suspicious devices, allowing the schools to reopen.

OUAGADOUGOU (Reuters) - The last time rebellious soldiers attempted to overthrow Burkina Faso's government in 2015, Marcel Tankoano was among thousands of protesters who took to the streets to oust the junta. Within days, loyalist forces had restored the president to power.
Last week, Tankoano was on the streets again, this time celebrating the military coup that toppled the country's elected president, Roch Kabore.
""Since the 1990s there has been a wave of democracy across West Africa. But that democracy has failed the people,"" said Tankoano, a civil society leader, at his home outside the capital Ouagadougou. ""We must be clear, we need a military regime.""
His change of heart reflects disenchantment across West Africa's Sahel region, where elected governments have failed to contain growing militant violence over the last decade that has killed thousands of people and displaced millions more.
Emboldened by popular anger, militaries in Mali, Guinea and Burkina Faso have taken matters into their own hands, staging four coups in 18 months and reversing democratic gains that had seen the region shed its tag as Africa's ""coup belt"".
Poverty and corruption have further undermined faith in civilian rulers, worrying international partners including France and the United States who have troops in the region fighting Islamist insurgents and fear greater instability.
On Monday, authorities in Mali, where there have been two coups since August 2020, ordered the French ambassador to leave the country as disagreement with the junta escalated - another blow to the international fight against militancy.
""People are not against democracy as a principle, but they are very disenchanted with elected leaders,"" said Maggie Dwyer, a lecturer at the University of Edinburgh who has studied military coups in West Africa.
""There is more leniency for military leadership now during the insurgency than in peacetime.""
'ONLY HOPE'
Tankoano's change of mind was gradual.
The militant threat first came to West Africa in Mali in 2012, when Islamist fighters, some with links to al Qaeda, hijacked an ethnic Tuareg uprising.
The French military initially pushed the militants back, but they regrouped and in 2015 unleashed a wave of deadly attacks that later spread to Burkina Faso and Niger.
One of the first signs of trouble in Burkina Faso came in January 2016; al Qaeda claimed an attack on a restaurant and cafe in Ouagadougou that killed 30 people.
Since then, the insurgency has grown, especially in rural areas that have borne the brunt of violence in the Sahel, a vast belt of mostly arid land south of the Sahara desert.
Underequipped armies have struggled to fight back, and the blame has largely fallen on civilian administrations who have also been tarnished by public perceptions of corruption.
Thousands of people protested in Burkina Faso in November after 49 military police officers and four civilians were killed by militants near a gold mine in the remote north - the worst attack on security forces in recent memory.
Personnel stationed at the gendarmerie post had run out of food and were forced to slaughter animals in the vicinity, according to a memo sent by the post's commander to his superiors and seen by Reuters.
During demonstrations that followed, Tankoano was arrested and spent 25 days in jail. He came out convinced Kabore must go.
Days later, soldiers led by Lieutenant Colonel Paul-Henri Damiba , frustrated by the rising death toll, meagre pay and poor living conditions, staged a coup.
""You can't just have one meal a day and talk about democracy,"" Tankoano said.
It is not clear what the junta will do differently to the government it ousted, given limited resources at its disposal. Reuters has not been able to reach the Burkinabe military for comment on its plans since it took power. 
'OUR ONLY HOPE'
Across the border in Mali, security has not noticeably improved under the military-led government, which said last month it was not ready to hold elections and would stay in power until 2025.
The 15-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) imposed strict sanctions. In response, thousands of people protested in support of the junta.
Moussa Diallo, an electrician in Bamako, the Malian capital, said he voted for former president Ibrahim Boubacar Keita when he came to power in 2013.
Then came the violence. Attacks on civilians and the military have continued since 2015, leaving many destitute and under the control of groups linked to global jihadist networks including Islamic State.
Meanwhile, Keita bought a $40 million presidential jet, causing an uproar at home. His son Karim came under fire in the local press for partying on the Spanish island of Ibiza.
Diallo was fed up. He joined mass protests in 2020 calling for Keita's ouster. By August, Keita was gone.
""The (military-led government) asked for five years. Of course it's a long time, but what does that represent in the life of a nation?"" Diallo told Reuters.
""We have not moved forward in 30 years of democracy. They are our only hope of recovering.""
LAWLESSNESS
Across the Sahel, thousands of people have been killed in Islamist violence, which, while not producing a parallel state as it did in parts of Syria and Iraq, has left Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso in crisis.
Millions have been forced to leave their villages, creating a burden for urban centres and families who support them.
In some rural areas, local government has vanished.
In Dori, a small town in northeast Burkina Faso, violence has decimated the livestock trade that once drove the local economy. The number of residents has trebled to 80,000 as people flee attacks in nearby villages, said mayor Ahmed Aziz Diallo.
Schools are jammed with kids, 150 to a room; residents must walk many kilometres to get water.
Because of death threats and insecurity, Diallo spends most of his time in Ouagadougou, 260 km (160 miles) to the south. When he does make the journey home, he no longer drives the pitted road from the capital but takes a plane instead.
He said residents felt abandoned by the state. It makes sense that they would support a military takeover, he added.
""When in times of despair you see a light somewhere, nature would have you cling to that glow."" 
Residents caught in the middle shrug at the mention of democracy.
Boureima Dicko, a 70-year-old herder, said he fled the commune of Tin-Akoff in northern Burkina Faso 10 days ago after gunmen killed seven civilians in a raid. He walked for two days through the bush with his 14-year-old daughter to the nearest town before taking a bus to Ouagadougou.
Dicko is staying in a community of displaced people in a warren of alleyways and mud brick huts that abuts the runway of the capital's main airport. His only possessions are what he took with him: blankets, a mat, a small stove and a plastic water canister.

The 60 goats that he used to shepherd along the riverbanks and through the grasslands of Tin-Akoff are gone, stolen by militants. Now each day he walks from his windowless hut to a busy highway to beg.
""Maybe the military will change things,"" he said, before adding: ""I don't know if they will help. I cannot see the future.""

(Reuters) - The year 2021 ranked as the fourth-warmest year on record in the United States, with December 2021 being the warmest December ever recorded, as the country was hit by 20 separate billion-dollar disasters, according to an overview of a government report published on Monday.
The analysis from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) came hours after European Union scientists said last year was the world's fifth hottest on record, adding to evidence pointing toward the globe's long-term warming trend.
NCEI is a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The agency will release its full annual climate report on Jan. 13.
""I wish I could say otherwise, but I expect even more of this in the years and decades to come,"" Russell Vose, chief of the climatic analysis and synthesis branch at NCEI, told Reuters.
In the contiguous United States, the six warmest years in 127 years of record-keeping have all occurred since 2012, NCEI said in the overview of a comprehensive climate report.
The average temperature in the contiguous United States 2021 was 54.5 Fahrenheit (12.5 Celsius), 2.5 degrees above the 20th century average. The record of 55.3 Fahrenheit (12.94 Celsius) was set in 2012.
""The consequences of climate change impact each and every American, especially disadvantaged communities across the nation. We must act on climate now to build a better, and more safe future for all"", said Eddie Johnson, chairwoman of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space and Technology. Johnson said the report was ""heartbreaking"".
Temperatures were particularly high in the Northeastern states of Maine and New Hampshire, which recorded their second-warmest years ever. States in the Northeast, Midwest and West also logged far above-average temperatures, while conditions in Southern states were closer to average.
The report also found that the nation experienced 20 weather and climate disasters with losses exceeding $1 billion each. Those events included wildfires in the Western United States, a cold snap in the middle of the country in February that caused power outages for nearly 10 million people, December tornadoes in Kentucky and surrounding states, among others.
It was the second-highest number of so-called billion-dollar events on record. The highest was 22 events in 2020.

Total U.S. disaster costs topped $145 billion for the year. Hurricane Ida, which hit the U.S. Gulf Coast in August, brought the most losses at $75 billion.
Fatalities related to those events reached 688 and were the highest in a decade.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. auto safety regulators on Tuesday said traffic deaths rose 12% in the first nine months of 2021 to 31,720 - the highest number killed on American roads in that period since 2006, according to its initial estimate.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said in the third quarter traffic deaths were estimated to have risen 3.9%.
The 12% reported increase, or 3,395 additional deaths, in the first nine months is the highest reported since NHTSA began using its current traffic fatality tracking system in 1975.
The numbers suggest the United States surpassed 40,000 traffic deaths in 2021 for the first time since 2007. Road deaths through September slightly outpaced the 11.7% increase in vehicle miles traveled.
Last Thursday, the U.S. Transportation Department (USDOT) released a strategy designed to cut the soaring number of traffic deaths on American roads that it calls a ""crisis.""
NHTSA said 38 states were projected to have increases in traffic deaths in the first nine months, while two states were unchanged and 10 states and Washington DC were projected to have decreases.
Idaho led all states with a 36.4% increase, followed by Nevada at 30%, Oregon at 29.3%, Minnesota 25.5%, North Dakota 23.6% and Texas 22.3%.
In an interview, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said he wants to see a ""mentality shift"" away from traffic deaths as acceptable.
""The country has just become used to it. We've just come to assume or expect that it's inevitable,"" Buttigieg told Reuters. ""We would never tolerate 40,000 deaths in aircraft in the United States"" or from food poisoning at restaurants or in subways.""
Last week, Buttigieg outlined the department's new ""National Roadway Safety Strategy."" He wants to encourage designing safer roads and safer vehicles and is embracing ""Vision Zero"" - the idea that the United States could eventually eliminate all traffic deaths.
Traffic deaths surged after coronavirus lockdowns ended in 2020 as more drivers engaged in unsafe behavior like speeding and driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
NHTSA plans to write rules to require automatic emergency braking technologies on new passenger vehicles and heavy trucks, and is scheduled to write other new regulations but that often takes years.
One factor for the big jump in 2020 was that drivers who remained on the roads engaged in riskier behavior, NHTSA said.
As U.S. roads became less crowded, some motorists perceived police were less likely to issue tickets because of COVID-19, experts say.
NHTSA released behavioral research findings from March 2020 through June indicating incidents of speeding and traveling without a seatbelt were higher than before the pandemic.

772,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 11:02AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -About 6,500 people have been told to evacuate their homes in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, due to a fire at a fertilizer plant where 600 tons of potentially explosive ammonium nitrate was stored, city officials said on Tuesday.
The blaze at the Weaver Fertilizer Plant started Monday evening. Residents within one mile (1.6 km) of the plant were urged to evacuate and stay away from their homes for up to 48 hours.
Winston-Salem Fire Chief William ""Trey"" Mayo said during a news conference on Tuesday that 500 tons of ammonium nitrate and 5,000 tons of finished fertilizer were at the site when the fire began. Another 100 tons of ammonium nitrate were in a railcar adjacent to the site. 
If exposed to intense heat, ammonium nitrate can trigger an explosion https://reut.rs/3IKx1tU. Fumes from ammonium nitrate can also be an irritant, fire officials said. 
""We can't stress enough how important it is and how seriously people need to take this. If you are within a mile of the plant, you need to leave,"" Mayo said.
No injuries had been reported and the cause of fire was not known.
Firefighters responded to a call at 6:45 p.m. local time on Monday and fought the blaze for an hour and half before they abandoned their attempts to extinguish the fire due to the risk of an explosion, Mayo said.
""Right now, we are in a waiting game. It's not worth having firefighters go in and try to put the fire out,"" said Matthew Smith, a hazardous material expert with the state of North Carolina. ""As the fire burns, it is also losing fuel.""
The city's Mayor Pro Tempore Denise Adams, who lives near the facility, said she was watching television when she heard sirens from fire trucks. 
""A few minutes later, I heard this tremendous boom,"" Adams said during the news conference. ""Then, about an hour later, there was another boom.""
On Tuesday, a state helicopter will take a hazmat specialist over the facility to access the situation and take photographs. 
""Aside from drone surveillance this morning, this will be our first real daytime look at it just to get an indication of how much fire involvement there is in the area where the ammonium nitrate is stored,"" Mayo said. 
Officials are monitoring area quality outside of the 1-mile radius of the facility. Winston-Salem residents who have respiratory conditions were urged to stay indoors. 
Video footage from a drone showed several large smoke plumes rising from the site. 
An old unmanned fire truck was hooked up to a hydrant and dousing the railcar loaded with ammonium nitrate on fire at the facility with water, Assistant Fire Chief Jerry Hardison said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post. 
""The area where ammonium nitrate was added is not actively burning at this time. It's smoldering"" Hardison said, noting that the temperature of the fire needs to be kept under 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204°C), the flash point of ammonium nitrate. 

In 2020, a massive blast at a warehouse used to store ammonium nitrate in Beirut, Lebanon, killed at least 100 people and injured nearly 4,000, while an explosion at a Texas fertilizer plant killed 15 and injured about 200 in 2013.
""We are not out of the woods,"" Mayo said when asked to compare the situation in Winston-Salem to the previous deadly explosions.

773,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 09:47AM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) -Suspected reinfections account for around 10% of England's COVID-19 cases so far this year, a Reuters analysis suggests, after the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) changed how it calculates coronavirus data.
With increased numbers of people catching the disease again since the Omicron variant began to predominate at the end of 2021, Britain on Monday started incorporating possible COVID-19 reinfections into its daily data.
""Reinfection remained at very low levels until the start of the Omicron wave. It is right that our daily reporting processes reflect how the virus has changed,"" said Steven Riley, UKHSA’s Director General of Data and Analytics.
Overall case numbers were continuing to trend lower, he added.
Prior to Dec. 6, the proportion of daily cases in England thought to be reinfections had been below 2% for nearly six months.
That rate is estimated to have risen to 9.9% so far in 2022, a Reuters analysis of UKHSA data found. 
In Italy, a spokesman for the National Institute of Health said that re-infection cases currently stood at around 3% of all infections, up from around 1.5% before Omicron.
Monday's data switch, treating positive COVID tests separated by at least 90 days as separate infections, was extrapolated back to the start of the pandemic. 
The UKHSA said there had been 588,000 possible reinfections in England to date, taking the total number reported in Britain to 17.3 million.
The first suspected reinfection in England was on June 19, 2020.

Britain's daily COVID statistics previously would only count people who had tested positive for the first time. 
Monday's daily case data revealed 92,368 new infections with 51 deaths. Britain has reported 155,754 COVID deaths overall, the seventh highest tally globally.

LONDON (Reuters) -The public must be told if British Prime Minister Boris Johnson or his staff are fined for attending parties at Downing Street during coronavirus lockdowns, opponents said on Tuesday after police said they would not name anyone issued with a fine.
British police are investigating 12 possible COVID-19 rule-breaking gatherings, many held at Johnson's office and residence, including some attended by the prime minister himself. 
The inquiry, which is reviewing 500 pieces of evidence and more than 300 photographs, is expected to take weeks. 
A limited report by senior civil servant Sue Gray on Monday found that alcohol-fuelled events had taken place at 10 Downing Street when rules banning all but limited social mixing were in force, and there had been ""serious failures"" of leadership.
However, Gray said she had been unable to provide a ""meaningful report"" because of the ongoing police investigation.
Johnson has come under pressure to confirm that Gray's full findings will be made public when the police inquiry is complete, and to detail if detectives had issued fines to him or his staff.
Asked on Tuesday, Johnson's spokesman said: ""I'm not going to get into speculation, obviously it's a matter for the police.""
However, London's Metropolitan Police said they would not be naming anyone who received a fixed penalty notice fine (FPN), usually 100 pounds, in line with usual practice.
""Our approach during the pandemic has been to confirm the number of FPNs issued to people at particular events and to explain what those FPNs were issued for,"" a police statement said.
Johnson's opponents said there needed to be full disclosure.
""I can't believe this needs saying. The public have a right to know if the prime minister is found to have committed an offence by the police,"" Angela Rayner, deputy leader of the main opposition Labour Party, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
""Number 10 said they would publish the full report. They cannot be allowed to backtrack or hide the results of the police investigation.""
Liberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey said Johnson had to come clean and resign if he had broken the rules.
Johnson's personal ratings and support for his Conservative Party have plummeted since revelations about parties emerged late last year, posing a serious threat to his premiership. 
Opinion polls showed most British voters felt Johnson should resign: 69% in a Savanta ComRes poll and 63% in a YouGov survey.
Although there is rising dissent in his own party, in order to trigger a leadership challenge 54 of the 359 Conservative members of parliament must submit letters of no confidence and that figure has not been reached.

After initially saying that no rules were broken, Johnson has repeatedly declined to answer specifics about his attendance at some of the gatherings.
He later admitted being at one but said he thought it was a work event. On Monday, he repeatedly declined to say if he had been at a gathering at his own apartment above the 10 Downing Street office, citing the police investigation.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's armed forces would respect a victory by leftist former President Luiz Inacio Lula de Silva in this year's presidential race, two retired generals told Reuters, adding to recent signs by military brass distancing themselves from the political project of far-right incumbent President Jair Bolsonaro.
Bolsonaro, a former army captain, brought unprecedented numbers of military officers into his government, including key cabinet posts. He has also questioned the credibility of Brazil's voting system, raising fears he might not accept defeat in the October election, as his political counterpart, former U.S. President Donald Trump, did in the United States.
That has focused speculation on how the armed forces would react, given strong rank-and-file support for Bolsonaro's 2018 election and a historic distrust of Lula and his Workers Party. 
Concerns about army election interference stem from Brazil's brutal 21-year military dictatorship that ended in 1985, after which the country set rules to separate the armed forces from politics.
""Whoever wins the elections will govern Brazil. There is no other alternative but to respect the will of the people,"" said retired General Carlos Alberto dos Santos Cruz, who served as a minister under Bolsonaro for five months in 2019 but was fired after falling out with the president.
""I cannot imagine the armed forces behaving any other way,"" dos Santos Cruz said in an interview last week.
Political analysts and a former defense minister said the military's prestige has paid a price as Bolsonaro blurred the line between his government and the armed forces. A weak economy and the vaccine-skeptic president's poor handling of the coronavirus pandemic are driving up his rejection rates and early opinion polls show Lula could sweep the election handily.
COVID-19 vaccine mandates has become a wedge between Bolsonaro and what he frequently calls ""my army,"" personalizing the public institution.
Army leadership requires troops to be vaccinated; and the head of health regulator Anvisa, retired Admiral Antonio Barra Torres, wrote an open letter to the president urging him to retract criticism of his staff for authorizing the vaccination of children against the coronavirus.
""The recent statements on vaccines show Bolsonaro was unable to impregnate the armed forces with his extreme right-wing ideology,"" said former Defense Minister Celso Amorim.
Amorim, who was also Lula's foreign minister from 2003 to 2010 and continues to advise his candidacy, said he is not worried about the military blocking a third term for the former union organizer.
As president, Lula resisted left-wing calls to prosecute members of the armed forces leaders for the crimes of a 1964-1985 military dictatorship. He also oversaw ambitious spending on fighter jets, submarines and tanks, Amorim noted.
""Bolsonaro tried to co-opt the military, but he couldn't,"" he said. 
'GROSS ERRORS'
Retired General Otavio Rego Barros, Bolsonaro's spokesman until he was fired without replacement in 2020, said in a column last week that the military was not responsible for the ""gross errors"" of the Bolsonaro administration.
""The Armed Forces are reaffirming themselves as a state institution, away from party politics,"" wrote Rego Barros.
On Monday, Brazilian Air Force Commander Carlos de Almeida Baptista Junior told the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper that the military had no party and would ""salute"" whoever became their commander in chief in the next presidential election.
Another retired officer, General Paulo Chagas, who campaigned for Bolsonaro in 2018, told Reuters that many of his colleagues had soured on the president as he appeared to fail to live up to the anti-corruption platform on which he ran.
""To avoid impeachment he has had to ally himself with politicians that he used to call thieves and they used to call him a fascist,"" Chagas said. He said despite the military's skepticism of Lula, the armed forces would recognize a fair election victory as such.
Some generals thought they could keep Bolsonaro under their tutelage by joining his government, but the opposite happened, according to Creomar de Souza at Dharma political risk consultancy. ""He made them bend. Those who did not agree left or were fired,"" he said.

Andre Cesar, a political analyst for Hold Legislative Advisors, agreed many military officers have signaled they are ""pretty disgusted"" with Bolsonaro's political leadership.
""I see the army looking for an honorable way out of this trap they fell into with the Bolsonaro government,"" he said.

776,"<span>Feb 01, 2022 04:00AM ET</span>","BEIJING (Reuters) - The Russian athletes taking part at this month's Beijing Olympics will be competing without their flag and national anthem because of doping sanctions.
Here is why sanctions were imposed on Russian sport and what they mean for the country's athletes.
WHY ARE THERE SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA?
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) imposed sanctions against RUSADA, Russia's national anti-doping agency, in December 2019. The measures carried a series of consequences for Russian sport on the global stage. 
WADA said Russian authorities had ""brazenly and illegally manipulated"" data from the Moscow Laboratory (NYSE:LH), despite their handover being a condition for RUSADA's reinstatement.
The agency had been declared ""non-compliant"" by WADA in November 2015 after a report found evidence of mass doping in Russian athletics. 
The WADA sanctions, among other things, barred Russia from flying its flag at major sporting events for a four-year period. The sanctions were later halved after a Russian appeal. 
WHAT HAS RUSSIA DONE ABOUT IT?
RUSADA appealed against the decision at the Lausanne-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). 
In December 2020, CAS - sport's highest court - ruled to partially uphold the sanctions but halved them to two years. The sanctions are set to end on Dec. 16, 2022.
The sanctions bar Russia from hosting, bidding or being awarded hosting rights for major international sporting events, including the Olympic and world championships.
They also bar the country from flying its flag and having its anthem played at such events.
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR RUSSIAN ATHLETES IN BEIJING?
The Russian delegation in Beijing, which includes 212 athletes, cannot display the country's tricolour flag or any national emblems or symbols.
Instead of representing Russia, athletes are competing as representatives of the Russian Olympic Committee under the acronym ""ROC"". 
Their uniforms bear the logo of the Russian Olympic Committee -- three flames in the colours of the national flag with the Olympic rings below them -- instead of Russia's flag.
Russian Olympic champions will be awarded their gold medals to Pyotr Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No.1, which was selected to replace the national anthem.
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR RUSSIAN OFFICIALS?
The sanctions also mean Russian government officials cannot participate or attend the Olympics. There are exceptions to this rule, however. 
Senior officials who are invited by the head of state of the host country can still attend. Invited by Chinese President Xi Jinping to the Beijing Games, Russia's President Vladimir Putin will fill the void left by many foreign dignitaries who are boycotting the opening ceremony on Feb. 4.
HOW HAVE RUSSIANS COMPETED AT PREVIOUS OLYMPICS?
Russians competing in Beijing will be under the same restrictions as their compatriots who took part in last year's Tokyo Summer Olympics. 
Russia was also deprived of its flag at the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games in South Korea as punishment for state-sponsored doping at the 2014 Sochi Games.

Many Russians were also banned from the 2016 Rio Summer Games in response to a WADA-commissioned report that found systematic doping across a large number of Olympic disciplines. 
Russia has acknowledged some shortcomings in its implementation of anti-doping rules but denies running a state-sponsored doping programme.

Chinese-claimed Taiwan has feared Beijing could ""downgrade"" Taiwan's status by putting its athletes alongside those from Chinese-run Hong Kong at the opening ceremony, a senior Taiwan official familiar with the matter told Reuters last week.
Sub-tropical Taiwan, which has no winter sporting tradition and has never won a medal at the winter Games, is sending four athletes to Beijing, the same number as the last winter Games in 2018.
Taiwan had said on Friday the team would not be at the opening or closing ceremonies, blaming delayed flights and tough anti-COVID-19 rules.
But Taiwan's Olympic committee said late Monday it had received ""several notices"" from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) ""requiring all delegations to the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics to cooperate in sending personnel to attend the opening and closing ceremonies"".
Based on its respect of the Olympic spirit and after discussions with Taiwan's Sports Administration, they will ""adjust"" the plan and ""cooperate with the policy to send staff to attend the opening and closing ceremonies"".
It did not say how many of the 15-member team, including trainers, would be there.
The Beijing Games are happening amid heightened tensions between China and Taiwan, including repeated Chinese military activity near the island.
Taiwan competes in most sporting events, including the Olympics, as ""Chinese Taipei"" at the insistence of Beijing, which sees democratically governed Taiwan as part of ""one China"".

On Wednesday, China's Taiwan Affairs Office referred to Taiwan's team as being from ""China, Taipei"", rather than the official terminology of ""Chinese Taipei"".
That drew a rebuke from Taiwan's China-policy making Mainland Affairs Council, which said China intentionally used the wrong name.

DUBAI (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates said on Monday it intercepted a ballistic missile fired by Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi movement as the UAE hosted Israeli President Isaac Herzog on his first visit to the Gulf business and tourism hub.
In the third such attack on the U.S.-allied Gulf state in the last two weeks, the Houthis' military spokesman said they fired Zulfiqar missiles at Abu Dhabi and launched drones at Dubai.
He reiterated a warning to residents and firms to ""stay away from vital headquarters and facilities"" in the UAE, which prides itself as a safe business haven and global tourism destination.
The United States condemned the assault - which followed a Jan. 17 strike on a fuel depot in Abu Dhabi that killed three people - in an escalation of the Yemen war between the Houthis and a Saudi-led coalition, which includes the UAE.
U.S. President Joe Biden said his administration has been in ""daily contact"" with the UAE to address the threats.
The Pentagon said U.S. forces in the UAE activated Patriot missile defenses but that it was the Emirates' surface-to-air interceptors that actually struck down the incoming missile. It left open the possibility of additional defensive military assistance.
""We continue to ... explore opportunities to improve our defenses and the defenses of our Emirati partners as well,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) told a news briefing. A senior Emirati official described the attacks as ""useless"" provocations. ""Those who test the UAE are mistaken,"" the official, Anwar Gargash, said in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post.
The assaults have led to rare security jitters among some residents in a country where expatriates are a majority, but have had no visible impact on daily life, with restaurants and beaches packed during the peak mild winter season. 
UAE market sentiment has weakened following Houthi missile launches but economic analysts say the attacks, mostly thwarted, have not dampened business or investor confidence yet.
The UAE said the missile was intercepted at 20 minutes past midnight and its debris fell on an uninhabited area.
It came as Israel's president was visiting the capital where he discussed security and bilateral relations with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
""While Israel's president is visiting the UAE to build bridges and promote stability across the region, the Houthis continue to launch attacks that threaten civilians,"" U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a tweet. 
Herzog pressed on with his visit to Expo 2020 in Dubai. 
He voiced hope more countries would normalise relations with Israel as the UAE did when it, along with Bahrain, forged ties in 2020 under U.S.-brokered pacts dubbed the ""Abraham Accords."" 
""There are only two alternatives for this region. One is peace, prosperity, cooperation, joint investments ... or alternatively, what Iran is doing, which is destabilising the region and using its proxies to employ terror,"" Herzog later said in a statement issued by his office.
Herzog departed the UAE on Monday, seen off at an airport by Emirati foreign minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a video from the Israeli president's office showed.
REGIONAL SECURITY
The accords have built a new axis between Israel and Sunni Muslim Gulf states based mainly on shared concerns over Shi'ite Iran, including its proxies and its ballistic missile programme. 
At the same time, the UAE has been engaging directly with Iran under de-escalation efforts driven by economic priorities. An Iranian business delegation is due to visit Expo in February.
The Saudi-led coalition accuses Iran of supplying arms to the Houthis, a charge both the group and Tehran deny. The Yemen conflict is seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Israel offered the UAE security and intelligence support after the Jan. 17 attack. Last year, it joined a naval drill with UAE, Bahraini and U.S. forces. Emirati and Israeli state-owned weapons makers have signed deals to jointly develop an advanced drone defence system and unmanned military vessels. 
The Houthis have frequently carried out missile and drone launches on Saudi Arabia in the nearly seven-year war before expanding strikes on the UAE this month.

The UAE had largely ended its military presence in 2019 but Yemeni forces it arms and trains recently joined battles against the Houthis in key energy-producing regions.
The coalition has recently also carried out deadly air strikes on Houthi-held areas.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden promised Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, on Monday that he will soon designate Qatar as a major non-NATO ally, granting special status to a key friend in a turbulent region.
During a meeting in the Oval Office, Biden said he planned to notify the U.S. Congress soon of the designation, which is granted by the United States to close, non-NATO allies that have strategic working relationships with the U.S. military.
“Qatar is a good friend and reliable and capable partner. And I’m notifying Congress that I will designate Qatar as a major non-NATO ally to reflect the importance of our relationship. I think it’s long overdue,"" Biden told reporters with the emir sitting at his side.
Qatar is the world's largest supplier of liquefied natural gas and may divert supplies to Europe if the Ukraine conflict disrupts Russian gas deliveries to the continent.
Biden's agenda for the Oval Office also included the Iran nuclear talks and relations with Afghanistan, where Washington's interests are now represented by the small Gulf country.
Tamim was also meeting separately with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and discussing arms sales and other military issues with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, an official told reporters.
Biden said he and the emir had a lot on their agenda on Monday including strengthening commercial and investment cooperation.
He hailed a new deal that Qatar Airways Group signed with Boeing (NYSE:BA) that he said will create ""tens of thousands of good-paying jobs.'
 Boeing Co  secured a launch order from Qatar Airways for a new freighter version of its 777X passenger jet and a provisional order for 737 MAX jets in a Washington ceremony on Monday. 

Biden said the United Arab Emirates defeated a ballistic missile attack launched by the Houthis from Yemen on Sunday. ""We've been in daily contact with UAE to address those threats,"" he said.
He said he had directed the Pentagon's Austin to do everything he could to communicate the support of the United States for the UAE, Saudi Arabia and throughout the Gulf region.

(Reuters) -A U.S. judge in Georgia rejected plea agreements reached between federal prosecutors and two of the three white men convicted of murdering Ahmaud Arbery, saying she was not willing to be bound to the 30-year federal prison sentence set in the agreement.
The unusual decision by U.S. District Judge Lisa Wood came after Travis McMichael, one of the three attackers due to face trial next week on federal hate-crime charges, admitted for the first time he had pursued the 25-year-old Black man because of his race. 
The decision means the parties must either return to court with a more acceptable deal when the hearing resumes on Friday morning or prepare next week for trial.
McMichael had appeared in the U.S. District Court in Brunswick (NYSE:BC), Georgia, in an attempt to change his plea to guilty, admitting to a charge of using a gun in his attempt to apprehend Arbery because of his ""race and color,"" resulting in Arbery's death. He fired at Arbery three times at close range with his shotgun.
His father, Gregory McMichael, had also been due to change his plea to guilty as part of an agreement at a subsequent hearing on Monday over the objections of Arbery's relatives, who successfully begged Wood not to accept the deals.
The McMichaels have already faced trial at the state level when they were convicted of murder last November in a court in Brunswick alongside their neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan and sentenced to life in prison. The state judge ruled that only Bryan would ever be able to seek parole.
State prosecutors said the men ""assumed the worst"" about the Black man running through their neighborhood, unfairly thinking he must have been fleeing some crime when they chased him down in pickup trucks before cornering and shooting him in February 2020. 
MOTHER'S APPEAL TO JUDGE
In rejecting the federal agreement, Wood acknowledged emotional testimony on Monday by Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, and other relatives who begged the judge not to accept the deal.
They said they were alarmed that prosecutors had agreed to recommend McMichael be transferred to a federal prison for 30 years before returning him to the custody of the Georgia prison system for the rest of his life. Federal prisons are generally perceived as less brutal environments than typical state prisons.
""Granting these men their preferred conditions of confinement will defeat me. It gives them one last chance to spit in my face after murdering my son,"" Cooper-Jones told the court. ""The state of Georgia already gave these men exactly what they deserve. Please leave it that way.""
Assistant U.S. Attorney Tara Lyons said the government had repeatedly consulted with Arbery's family, and that they had previously not opposed an agreement as the best way to ensure that the McMichaels would admit race played a role in their crimes and give up their right to appeal a federal conviction.
""I understand the anger, the pain and the struggle that the family is feeling with this resolution,"" she said in asking the judge to accept the deal. 
In a statement after the hearing, U.S. Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said the Justice Department respected the court's decision and that the agreements had been entered ""only after the victims' attorneys informed me that the family was not opposed to it.""
Judges rarely reject plea agreements. Rejections can occur if judges believe the agreements do not adequately address the nature of the crimes, the rights of victims, or the interests of the public.
Wood said that under the plea agreement before her she would be bound to accept the 30-year federal sentence, and that she needed more information before she could decide if that was just.
""If I accept it, it locks me in to that sentence,"" she said.
Federal judges on occasion reject a plea agreement when they disagree with prosecutors' proposed sentence in order to avoid any surprises at the later sentencing hearing, according to Paul Applebaum, a criminal defense attorney in St. Paul, Minnesota.
""It's just the right thing to do if she has a problem with it,"" Applebaum said, adding that the two sides could continue negotiations for a different deal ahead of trial.
Arbery's killing sparked national outrage when cellphone video taken by Bryan of the shooting emerged months later and the public learned that local authorities had declined to arrest his pursuers.
Earlier in the hearing, Travis McMichael admitted he had shared racist sentiments in text messages and social media posts for many years.
""Defendant Travis McMichael did not belong to any hate groups and did not set out on February 23, 2020, to carry out an act of violence against an African-American person,"" said the proposed plea agreement, which was read aloud in court. ""But he had made assumptions about Ahmaud Arbery that he would not have made if Ahmaud Arbery had been white.""
McMichael admitted that in his messages he had associated Black skin ""with criminality,"" and that he had supported vigilante efforts to harm or kill Black people, ""particularly those he saw as criminal.""

Prosecutors also called an FBI agent to the stand, who testified that a search of McMichael's cellphone showed he frequently referred to Black people as ""monkeys,"" ""savages"" and another racist slur.
No notice was made of a plea agreement with Bryan, who is also due to stand trial on Feb. 7. Bryan's lawyer did not respond to requests for comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. lawyer Michael Avenatti said on Monday he does not intend to take the stand to defend himself at trial on charges he defrauded his former client, the adult film actress Stormy Daniels.
""At this time I'm not intending on testifying,"" Avenatti told U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman on Monday outside the jury's presence.
Prosecutors say Avenatti, 50, embezzled nearly $300,000 owed to Daniels under a book deal, the latest in a series of criminal allegations that have cost Avenatti a legal career that peaked in 2018 when he successfully sued former U.S. President Donald Trump on Daniels' behalf.
Avenatti has pleaded not guilty to charges of wire fraud and identity theft. He has characterized the dispute with Daniels, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford, as a disagreement over legal fees that has no place in criminal court.
Prosecutors rested their case in the Manhattan federal court trial on Monday, giving Avenatti the opportunity to present a defense case. 
Avenatti on Friday said he was ""strongly leaning in favor"" of testifying in his own defense, but on Monday he said he was leaning in the opposite direction.
The brash lawyer has been representing himself in the Manhattan federal court case since last Tuesday, the trial's second day. 
It is risky for criminal defendants to testify in their own defense, because it exposes them to potentially aggressive cross-examination by prosecutors.

Daniels, who testified as a prosecution witness last week, is known for receiving $130,000 in hush money from Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen in exchange for keeping quiet ahead of the 2016 election about a sexual liaison she says she had with Trump, who denies the affair happened. 
Avenatti successfully sued Trump to get Daniels out of an agreement not to disclose the affair.

Albany State University in Georgia, Delaware State University in Delaware, Southern University and A&M College in Louisiana, Howard University in Washington, Bowie State University in Maryland and Bethune-Cookman University in Florida were among the schools that received threats on Monday morning.
At Delaware State University, campus police issued an ""all-clear"" about 12:45 p.m. EST, lifting a lockdown for residential students who had been sheltering in dorm rooms throughout the morning. 
""No classes for the rest of the day, but everything will be back to normal tomorrow,"" said spokesman Carlos Holmes, after the school told employees and students to stay away until further notice. 
It was the second time this month that Black colleges and universities faced bomb threats. On Jan. 5, eight historically Black colleges and universities received such threats, but no suspicious packages or explosives were found.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that bomb threats against Black universities were ""disturbing"" and that President Joe Biden was aware of the reports of those threats.
Federal and local authorities investigated.
""It is a federal crime to use interstate facilities to make a bomb threat,"" Tom Chittum, acting deputy director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) told reporters in a call. 
Bowie State University lifted its shelter-in-place order about 2 p.m. EST. Officials told students and staff earlier to shelter-in-place and closed the campus for the day. 
Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Florida, was placed on lockdown, the Daytona Beach Police Department said. Police said around noon they had ""cleared the campus of any bomb threat.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo will not face criminal charges related to sexual harassment claims that led to his resignation last year after the last county prosecutor investigating allegations from one of several women said he had no legal basis to pursue a case.
""To be clear, this decision is based solely upon an assessment of the law and whether the People can establish a legally sufficient case under controlling precedent,"" Oswego County District Attorney Gregory Oakes said in a statement on Monday about accusations by Virginia Limmiatis
""In no way should this decision be interpreted as casting doubt upon the character of credibility of Ms. Limmiatis, or how harmful the acts she experienced were,"" Oakes said.
Cuomo resigned in August after an investigation by New York Attorney General Letitia James concluded that he sexually harassed 11 women. The Democrat was in his third term as governor.
Limmiatis, who works for an energy company, last March accused Cuomo of touching her chest inappropriately at an event in 2017. She said she feared reporting him because he was a powerful figure.
The Oswego district attorney's decision does not mean Cuomo is innocent of abusing his power, an attorney for Limmiatis said in a statement.
""Not every violation of law results in a criminal prosecution,"" Mariann Wang, the attorney, said. 
Limmiatis' claims were included in James' report, which said Cuomo violated the law and created a ""toxic"" workplace when he groped, kissed or made suggestive comments to women. 
Cuomo has said his accusers had misinterpreted his words, gestures and demeanor.
Rich Azzopardi, a spokesman for Cuomo, said on Monday that James' report was a ""political hit job"".
""As now five DAs have verified, none of the accusations in Tish James’ fraud of a report have stood up to any level of real scrutiny,"" he told Reuters. ""As we’ve said since the beginning, the truth will come out.""
James' office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

James had declined to charge Cuomo after announcing the findings of her report in August. 
Oakes's decision not to charge Cuomo follows similar moves by prosecutors in Manhattan, Nassau, Westchester and Albany counties.

785,"<span>Jan 31, 2022 02:20PM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) -The British government plans to revoke its decision to make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for health workers in England after warnings that an already-stretched service could face serious staff shortages. 
The policy would have required employees in the state-run National Health Service and social care workers to be fully vaccinated by April 1. This means they would have to receive their first shot this week to meet that deadline. 
The policy announced in November met resistance from some workers, with warnings that sacking those who did not comply could leave the health service facing significant staff shortages. A number of lawmakers in Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party have also criticised the decision.
Health minister Sajid Javid said on Monday the government would launch a consultation into whether the policy was still needed with the emergence of the Omicron variant, which is more transmissible but results in milder symptoms.
""Subject to the responses...the government will revoke the regulations,"" Javid told parliament. 
""While vaccination remains our very best line of defence against COVID-19 I believe that it is no longer proportionate to require vaccination as a condition of deployment."" 
England has abandoned COVID-19 measures introduced to combat the Omicron variant, including compulsory mask-wearing on public transport and in shops and guidance to work. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland decide their own measures, which have generally been stricter.
The government has faced criticism for its overall handling of the pandemic in which Britain has reported more than 155,000 deaths from COVID-19 in total, the seventh highest death total in the world.
More than 75,000 health workers - about one in 20 employees - have not had a COVID vaccine, according to the NHS. 
The Royal College of Nursing and the Royal College of Midwives had previously pushed for the government to extend the deadline to prevent a mass shortage in the health service, saying the policy amounted to ""self-sabotage"". 

The backlash against mandatory vaccination in Britain is in line with wider sentiment across the world as people from the United States to Ukraine argue that such rules violate human rights and civil liberties.
The government previously said that vaccinations were crucial to contain the spread and reducing severity of the infections, and thereby cut down cases that need to be hospitalised.

Here is a timeline of the main events in Ukraine's political history since it won independence from Moscow in 1991.
* 1991: Leonid Kravchuk, leader of the Soviet republic of Ukraine, declares independence from Moscow. In a referendum and presidential election, Ukrainians approve independence and elect Kravchuk president.
* 1994: Kravchuk loses a presidential election to Leonid Kuchma, also a former communist, in elections deemed largely free and fair by observers.
* 1999: Kuchma is re-elected in 1999 in a vote riddled with irregularities.
* 2004: Pro-Russian candidate Viktor Yanukovich is declared president but allegations of vote-rigging trigger protests in what becomes known as the Orange Revolution, forcing a re-run of the vote. A pro-Western former prime minister, Viktor Yushchenko, is elected president.
* 2005: Yushchenko takes power with promises to lead Ukraine out of the Kremlin's orbit, towards NATO and the EU. He appoints former energy company boss Yulia Tymoshenko as prime minister but, after infighting in Ukraine's pro-Western camp, she is sacked.
* 2008: NATO promises Ukraine it will one day join the alliance. 
* 2010: Yanukovich defeats Tymoshenko in a presidential election. Russia and Ukraine clinch a gas pricing deal in exchange for the extension of the lease for the Russian navy in a Ukrainian Black Sea port.
* 2013: Yanukovich's government suspends trade and association talks with the EU in November and opts to revive economic ties with Moscow, triggering months of mass rallies in Kyiv. 
* 2014: The protests, largely focused around Kyiv's Maidan square, turn violent. Dozens of protesters are killed. In February, parliament votes to remove Yanukovich, who flees. Within days, armed men seize parliament in the Ukrainian region of Crimea and raise the Russian flag. Moscow annexes the territory after a March 16 referendum which shows overwhelming support in Crimea for joining the Russian Federation.
- In April, pro-Russian separatists in the eastern region of Donbass declare independence. Fighting breaks out which has continued sporadically, despite frequent ceasefires, into 2022.
- In May, businessman Petro Poroshenko wins a presidential election with a pro-Western agenda.
- In July, a missile brings down passenger plane MH17 en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, killing all 298 people on board. The weapon used is traced back by investigators to Russia, which denies involvement.
* 2017: An association agreement between Ukraine and the EU is passed, opening markets for free trade of goods and services, and visa-free travel to the EU for Ukrainians.
* 2019: A new Ukrainian Orthodox church wins formal recognition, angering the Kremlin.
- Former actor and comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy defeats Poroshenko in an April presidential election, and promises to tackle corruption and end the simmering conflict in eastern Ukraine. His Servant of the People party wins a July parliamentary election.
- U.S. President Donald Trump asks Zelenskiy in July to investigate Joe Biden, then his rival in the U.S. presidential race, and Biden's son Hunter Biden over possible business dealings in Ukraine. The call eventually leads to a failed attempt to impeach Trump.
* March 2020 – Ukraine goes into its first lockdown to curb COVID-19.
* June 2020 – IMF approves a $5 billion lifeline to help Ukraine stave off default during a pandemic-induced recession.
* Jan. 2021 – Zelenskiy appeals to Biden, who is now U.S. president, for Ukraine to join NATO.
* Feb. 2021 – Zelenskiy's government imposes sanctions on Viktor Medvedchuk, an opposition leader and the Kremlin's most prominent ally in Ukraine.
* Spring 2021 – Russia masses troops near Ukraine's borders. They are partly dispersed after what Russia says was a training exercise.
* Oct. 2021 - Ukraine uses a Turkish Bayraktar TB2 drone for first time in eastern Ukraine, angering Russia.
* Autumn 2021 – Russia again begins massing troops near Ukraine. 
* Dec. 7 - Biden warns Russia of sweeping Western economic sanctions if it invades Ukraine.
* Dec 17 - Russia presents detailed security demands including a legally binding guarantee that NATO will give up any military activity in eastern Europe and Ukraine. 
* Jan 10 - U.S. and Russian diplomats fail to narrow differences on Ukraine, and subsequent talks also bring no major breakthrough. 
* Jan 14 - A cyberattack warning Ukrainians to ""be afraid and expect the worst"" hits Ukrainian government websites. 
* Jan. 17 – Poroshenko returns to Ukraine to face charges in a treason case. Russian forces start arriving in Belarus, to the north of Ukraine, for joint drills. 
* Jan 24 - NATO puts forces on standby and reinforces eastern Europe with more ships and fighter jets. Some Western nations start evacuating non-essential embassy staff from Kyiv.

* Jan 26 - Washington presents a written response to Russia's security demands, repeating a commitment to NATO's ""open-door"" policy while offering a ""principled and pragmatic evaluation"" of Moscow's concerns.

(Reuters) - More than 100,000 Americans died from diabetes in 2021, marking the second consecutive year for that grim milestone and spurring a call for a federal mobilization similar to the fight against HIV/AIDS. 
The new figures come as an expert panel urges Congress to overhaul diabetes care and prevention, including recommendations to move beyond a reliance on medical interventions alone. A report released earlier this month calls for far broader policy changes to stem the diabetes epidemic, such as promoting consumption of healthier foods, ensuring paid maternal leave from the workplace, levying taxes on sugary drinks and expanding access to affordable housing, among other areas. 
In 2019, diabetes was the seventh-leading cause of death in America and claimed more than 87,000 lives, reflecting a long-running failure to address the illness and leaving many more vulnerable when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, creating new hurdles to accessing care. 
Since then, the nation’s toll from diabetes has increased sharply, surpassing 100,000 deaths in each of the last two years and representing a new record-high level, according to a Reuters analysis of provisional death data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Diabetes-related deaths surged 17% in 2020 and 15% in 2021 compared to the prepandemic level in 2019. That excluded deaths directly attributed to COVID-19. The CDC concurred with the Reuters analysis and said additional deaths from 2021 are still being tallied. 
""The large number of diabetes deaths for a second year in a row is certainly a cause for alarm,"" said Dr. Paul Hsu, an epidemiologist at UCLA's Fielding School of Public Health. ""Type 2 diabetes itself is relatively preventable, so it's even more tragic that so many deaths are occurring.""
In a new report, the National Clinical Care Commission created by Congress said that the United States must adopt a more comprehensive approach to prevent more people from developing type 2 diabetes, the most common form, and to help people who are already diagnosed avoid life-threatening complications. About 37 million Americans, or 11% of the population, have diabetes, and one in three Americans will develop the chronic disease in their lifetime if current trends persist, according to the commission. 
""Diabetes in the U.S. cannot simply be viewed as a medical or health care problem, but also must be addressed as a societal problem that cuts across many sectors, including food, housing, commerce, transportation and the environment,"" the commission wrote in its Jan. 5 report to Congress and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). 
The federal panel recommended Congress create an Office of National Diabetes Policy that would coordinate efforts across the government and oversee changes outside health policy. It would be separate from HHS and could be similar to the White House Office of National AIDS Policy, according to Dr. William Herman, commission chairman and a professor of internal medicine and epidemiology at the University of Michigan. 
""We aren’t going to cure the problem of diabetes in the United States with medical interventions,"" Herman told Reuters. ""The idea is to pull something together across federal agencies, so they are systematically talking to one another."" 
U.S. Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington who chairs the Senate health committee, helped create the commission in 2017 and said she is studying the recommendations closely. 
""People with diabetes and other chronic illnesses were already facing challenges well before the pandemic hit, and COVID has only made these problems worse,"" Murray said in a statement to Reuters. ""It is absolutely crucial to research and find solutions to better support diabetes patients and get them the care they need."" 
MORE CASES, WORSE PROGNOSIS
As Reuters reported last year in a series, diabetes represents a major public health failure in the United States. The number of Americans with the disease has exploded in recent decades, and their prognosis has worsened, even though spending on new treatments has soared. 
The pandemic has proven especially deadly for people with diabetes. People with poorly controlled diabetes have at least a two-fold greater risk of death from COVID-19, according to the report. And diabetes and its complications are more common in low-income Americans and people of color, longstanding disparities that were further exposed during the pandemic. 
Dr. Shari Bolen, a commission member and an associate professor of medicine at Case Western Reserve University and the MetroHealth System in Cleveland, said the staggering number of diabetes deaths is ""disheartening but also a call to action."" 
The federal panel's report marked the first such review on diabetes since 1975. During that time, the prevalence of diabetes among U.S. adults has increased from 5.3% in the late 1970s to 14.3% in 2018, it said. Direct medical costs related to diabetes were $237 billion in 2017, and there was an estimated $90 billion lost to lower productivity in the United States. 
High costs for doctor's visits, medications and supplies force many diabetes patients to forgo or delay routine care. Many patients and U.S. lawmakers have expressed outrage at the rising price of insulin, which type 1 diabetes patients must take their entire lives and which is sometimes required to keep type 2 patients’ disease under control. The commission endorsed proposals such as capping insulin price increases to the rate of inflation and government negotiation of drug prices. 
Murray and other lawmakers have pushed for a provision in the Biden administration's proposed Build Back Better legislation that would cap the cost of insulin at $35 for many patients. 
To further ease financial barriers, the panel recommended that patients’ out-of-pocket costs be waived for other ""high-value"" treatments, including certain diabetes drugs, continuous glucose monitors, basic supplies and diabetes education. 
The commission also highlighted the risks of overtreatment in older adults with type 2 diabetes. Reuters wrote about that risk in November and how a drug industry campaign for an aggressive treatment target led to an epidemic of potentially lethal incidents of low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia. The panel asked federal health officials to track overtreatment among Medicare patients to ""reduce the incidence of severe hypoglycemia and improve patient safety."" 

The commission said the United States should better promote the purchase of fruits and vegetables in food assistance programs and ensure mothers have paid family leave to aid breastfeeding, which can help reduce the risk of diabetes in mothers and is associated with a reduced risk of obesity and diabetes in children. The panel also recommended imposing taxes on sugary drinks that would raise their shelf price by 10% to 20% and using the revenue to expand access to clean drinking water and fund similar programs. 
HHS deferred comment to Herman. In a statement, the CDC said the report's recommendations offer a detailed roadmap to ""addressing rising health-care costs attributed to diabetes, and reducing racial, ethnic, and income-related disparities in diabetes outcomes.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A coalition of Christians and Catholics on Monday called on Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam to drop charges against media tycoon Jimmy Lai and other political activists jailed or in custody under a China-imposed national security law.
The petition by more than a dozen Christian and Catholic groups and leaders was handed to a government representative outside Hong Kong's government headquarters. 
""She could be active in asking Beijing (for an amnesty),"" said Catholic priest Franco Mella, referring to Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam, who is a devout Catholic. 
""Let's hope she gives an answer to the voice of her conscience as a Catholic,"" Mella said, flanked by Reverend Chi Wood Fung, a Hong Kong Anglican priest and former lawmaker. ""I hope more voices can be heard about the possibility of an amnesty for them.""
Lam's office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
Among the signatories was Reverend Alan Smith of St. Albans in the U.K. and the former Archbishop of Armagh in Ireland, Lord Eames. Mella said he hoped the Pope would ""join his voice"" in speaking out on rights issues in Hong Kong.
China imposed a sweeping national security law in June 2020 outlawing subversion, collusion with foreign forces, terrorism and secession with possible life imprisonment. More than 160 people have been arrested under the legislation.
Some Western governments and rights groups say authorities are using the law to silence dissent and curb freedoms.
Chinese and Hong Kong authorities, however, say the law has brought stability to the financial hub after protracted pro-democracy protests in 2019.
Among the most prominent national security law defendants are 47 pro-democracy activists and former lawmakers arrested in a mass raid in early 2021, as well as former media tycoon and China critic Lai.
Although some of Hong Kong's government and commercial elites are Catholic and pro-Beijing, including Lam, other Catholics have long been active in the pro-democracy and anti-government movements including Lai and former law professor Benny Tai.

Some observers see Hong Kong's broad religious freedoms and traditions, like the rule of law, as one of the remaining strongholds of the ""one country, two systems"" model under which Britain handed its former colony back to Chinese rule in 1997.
The Basic Law, the mini-constitution that governs ""one country, two systems"", explicitly provides for freedom of conscience and broad religious freedom.

A Chinese official told reporters in January that any behavior against the Olympic spirit, and ""especially against Chinese laws and regulations"" would be subject to punishment.
Senator Jeff Merkley and Representative James McGovern, both Democrats, cited the remark in a public letter to the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC), writing that risks to freedom of expression and data privacy at the Games ""demand an urgent effort"" to address.
""Chinese authorities have imposed exit bans on U.S. citizens, and even jailed foreign nationals, for political or specious reasons,"" said the lawmakers, who lead the U.S. Congressional-Executive Commission on China. 
The USOPC should ""redouble efforts"" to engage with the International Olympic Committee (IOC), fellow national Olympic committees, and the U.S. State Department to ensure that plans and procedures are in place to protect athletes should they be punished for free expression, they said. 
""We further request that the USOPC communicate to the public that it is taking such steps,"" they said, adding that the committee should be ""prepared to defend any Olympians who speak out.""
Rights groups have long criticized the IOC for awarding the Games to China, citing its treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups, which the United States has deemed genocide. China denies allegations of human rights abuses.
Some Western countries, worried about information security, have suggested their delegations not bring their own mobile phones to the Feb. 4-20 Olympics.

Researchers have said the Beijing Organizing Committee's MY2022 app, which all attendees must use for COVID-19 monitoring, has flaws that make it vulnerable to privacy breaches.
Several countries, including the United States, Britain, and Australia, have announced diplomatic boycotts of the Games over concerns about human rights in China, though their athletes will still compete.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and its allies have prepared a list of Russian elites in or near Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle to hit with economic sanctions should Russia invade Ukraine, a senior administration official said on Monday.
""The individuals we have identified are in or near the inner circles of the Kremlin and play a role in government decision making or are at a minimum complicit in the Kremlin's destabilizing behavior,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The United States has developed specific sanctions packages for both Russian elites who meet the criteria and their family members, and these efforts are being pursued in coordination with U.S. allies and partners, the official said.
Targeting Russian oligarchs is only one part of a plan by the United States and its allies to punish Putin should he launch an invasion of Ukraine after massing tens of thousands of troops on the Ukraine border. Russia denies that it plans to invade Ukraine.
President Joe Biden has not ruled out putting sanctions on Putin https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-seeks-protect-europes-energy-supplies-if-russia-invades-ukraine-2022-01-25 himself. 
U.S. officials have already detailed other penalties https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/exclusive-us-could-hit-russia-smartphone-aircraft-part-imports-if-it-invades-2021-12-21 that include sanctions on Russian financial institutions and export control measures that could attempt to choke off broad swaths of industrial and consumer technologies to Russia. 
The official would not provide names of Russian figures who could be sanctioned. 
""There is a broad list of individuals we can pull from,"" the official said, noting that some will be from a classified list of senior Russian political figures and oligarchs outlined in Section 241 of the ""Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act"" in a report sent to the U.S. Congress in 2018. 
""We cannot disclose the contents of this list or name specific names given flight risks, but it provides ample targets and family networks involved in stashing their assets,"" the official said.

The official said many of the individuals are particularly vulnerable targets because of deepened financial ties with the West.
""Putin's cronies will no longer be able to use their spouses or other family members as proxies to evade sanctions. Sanctions would cut them off from the international financial system and ensure that they and their family members will no longer able to enjoy the perks of parking their money in the West and attending elite Western universities,"" the official added.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea confirmed on Monday it had launched a Hwasong-12 ballistic missile, the same weapon it had once threatened to target the U.S. territory of Guam with, sparking fears the nuclear-armed state could resume long-range testing. 
The launch of the intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) was first reported by South Korean and Japanese authorities on Sunday. It was the seventh test conducted by North Korea this month and the first time a nuclear-capable missile of that size has been launched since 2017.
The United States is concerned North Korea's escalating missile tests could be precursors to resumed tests of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and vowed an unspecified response ""designed to show our commitment to our allies,"" a senior U.S. official told reporters in Washington.
""It's not just what they did yesterday, it's the fact that this is coming on the heels of quite a significant number of tests in this month,"" the official said, while urging Pyongyang to join direct talks with no preconditions.
North Korea has said it is open to diplomacy, but that Washington's overtures are undermined by its support for sanctions and joint military drills and arms buildups in South Korea and the region.
Amid a flurry of diplomacy in 2018, including summits with then-U.S. President Donald Trump, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared his nuclear force complete and said he would suspend nuclear testing and launches of the country's longest-range missiles.
Kim said he was no longer bound by that moratorium after talks stalled in 2019, and North Korea suggested this month it could restart those testing activities because the United States had shown no sign of dropping its ""hostile policies.""
It is unclear if IRBMs such as the Hwasong-12 were included in Kim's moratorium, but none had been tested since 2017.
North Korea analysts said the tests appear aimed at securing global acceptance of its weapons programmes, whether through concessions or simply winning tired acquiescence from a distracted world. 
""The world’s distraction on other issues actually seems to be working to North Korea’s benefit right now,"" Markus Garlauskas, a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council think tank and former U.S. national intelligence officer for North Korea.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the recent flurry of North Korean missile tests was reminiscent of heightened tensions in 2017, when North Korea conducted multiple nuclear tests, launched its largest missiles, and drew threats of ""fire and fury"" from the United States.
South Korean Defence Minister Suh Wook visited his country's Army Missile Command on Monday to check its readiness in the face of the North Korean launches, the ministry said in a statement.
""North Korea’s series of missile test-fires, including intermediate-range ballistic missiles, pose a direct and serious threat to us and a grave challenge to international peace and stability,"" Suh said after being briefed. ""We will maintain a full military readiness posture that can respond immediately to any situation.""
Japan's Defence Minister Nobuo Kishi told reporters North Korea was escalating its provocation of the international community and said its ""remarkable improvement"" in missile technology ""cannot be tolerated"".
BOOSTING MISSILE CAPABILITIES
Sunday's test ""confirmed the accuracy, safety, and operational effectiveness of the produced Hwasong-12 type weapon system,"" North Korean state news agency KCNA reported.
State media coverage of the launch made no mention of the United States, and Kim was not reported to have attended. North Korean officials said this month the tests are for self defence and not targeted at any specific country.
Kim vowed ahead of the New Year to bolster North Korea's military capabilities in the face of international uncertainties caused by ""hostile policies"" by the United States and its allies. 
North Korea has previously said the Hwasong-12 can carry a ""large-size heavy nuclear warhead,"" and analysts estimate it has a range of 4,500 km (2,800 miles).
In August 2017, just hours after Trump told the North that any threat to the United States would be met with “fire and fury”, the commander of the North’s Strategic Forces said it was “seriously considering a plan of enveloping fire” involving a simultaneous launch of four Hwasong-12 missiles toward Guam.

That year North Korea flight-tested the Hwasong-12 at least six times, including flying it over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido twice.
KCNA said Sunday's missile launch was conducted in such a way as to ensure the safety of neighbouring countries, and that the test warhead was fitted with a camera that took photos while it was in space.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's leader has left open for more than five months a seat on the panel that selects the city's judges, three lawyers familiar with the situation said.
The unprecedented delay raises questions over the autonomy of the city's judiciary, these lawyers and nine diplomats and scholars told Reuters. 
Nomination of judges by the Judicial Officers' Recommendation Commission is increasingly important as some of these jurists will rule on issues such as prosecutions under a controversial national security law that Beijing imposed on the city in 2020 to punish subversion, terrorism, secession and collusion with foreign forces.
Lam has delayed the decision to act on the nomination of British-trained trial lawyer Neville Sarony, who is in his early 80s, to the seat reserved for a barrister on the commission.
Sarony has in recent newspaper columns criticised Hong Kong government policies, voicing support for free speech and some pro-democracy lawyer activists. He declined to comment on his nomination.
Reuters could not determine the reasons for the delay.
A Lam spokesman said the “appointment of (a) member” to the panel was being processed by the government and would be announced in due course. 
The spokesman did not respond to questions over why the decision on Sarony had been delayed or whether Lam would reject him outright and seek a new name from Hong Kong's Bar Association.
    Pro-Beijing media and some Chinese officials have branded the barristers' association as ""anti-China"" for its criticisms of government moves such as a 2019 proposal to allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial.
    The absence has removed the voice of barristers from the panel, whose other seats go to judges, a solicitor, the city's justice secretary and three others not involved in the practice of law. 
In Hong Kong and some other common law jurisdictions, the legal profession is split between barristers, who are courtroom advocates, and solicitors, who mostly handle other legal issues.
    ""Without a barrister, the set-up of the commission looks skewed in favour of the establishment,"" said a legal scholar who has monitored the committee for several years. ""Barristers can provide an important independent voice, particularly when the prosecution side is represented through the secretary for justice."" 
    City leaders have previously acted within weeks to fill vacancies on the nine-member commission. Over the past decade, public records show, appointments to the panel have been made before the predecessor's resignation takes effect. Lawyers say this highlights the routine nature of the process.
    The selection ""is usually a mere formality but this time there is silence, and this strange delay,"" said one lawyer familiar with the situation. Another said Lam ""appears to be waiting for a new team at the Bar to come up with a new, more acceptable name.""
    By delaying the decision on the barrister's nomination, Lam is using her influence over the commission in a way not seen before and that strengthens the hand of pro-government figures on the panel, said the diplomats, lawyers and scholars.
     The lawyers and scholars say they are not aware of a previous instance when Hong Kong's chief executive did not promptly accept the recommendations of the Bar Association or the Law Society, the solicitors' association.
They say they fear the situation could further threaten the social and commercial freedoms the financial hub was guaranteed when Britain handed its former colony back to China in 1997.
    COLONIAL LEGACY
    The panel, created in 1976, has operated in its current form since 1991, under British and Chinese rule. It reports to the chief executive.
    The Bar Association's new chairman, Victor Dawes, did not respond to Reuters requests for comment on Sarony's nomination. Dawes said after his election on Jan. 20 that his team would defend the rule of law and speak out on human rights issues if necessary. 
    In response to Reuters questions to the commission's chair, Chief Justice Andrew Cheung, a Judiciary spokesman said the city's chief executive has the power to appoint members to the committee, including a barrister of her choice, although she must ""consult"" the Bar Association on the matter.
    The spokesman said there was no question of the committee ""acting other than independently"", in line with the independence guaranteed by the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution.
    The commission is one of many British-era legal legacies written into the Basic Law, which scholars and lawyers say underscore the importance of keeping Hong Kong's common law system secure under Chinese rule.
    Hong Kong elects a chief executive in March. Lam has not said whether she intends to seek re-election.
    The panel's deliberations are secret. It is a crime to divulge or attempt to interfere in them.
The committee made 45 judicial nominations in 2020 that ""were accepted by the chief executive"", according to the committee's most recent annual report. It was not clear whether any were rejected.
    Sarony was tapped by the Bar Association to replace veteran human rights barrister Philip Dykes, a former bar chairman, who resigned on Aug. 5 before the end of his term.
    Dykes said he was unable to comment on his resignation.
Sarony, one of the city's most senior barristers, has handled a wide variety of cases in Hong Kong since 1985 and is known for his personal injury work. He is not considered by his peers to be a partisan political figure or, like some other barristers, viewed as an activist lawyer.
   He also writes columns for the Hong Kong Economic Journal. Recent pieces have included criticism of the Hong Kong government over its changes to legal aid and its COVID-19 quarantine policies. Some have also criticised the actions of the British government.

    In April he expressed support for barrister and former democratic legislator Margaret Ng after her April 16 conviction for illegal assembly. She received a 12-month sentence, suspended for 24 months.
""I have very little respect for politicians of any persuasion, but Margaret is that rara avis, a dedicated, honest and committed representative of the people of Hong Kong,"" Sarony wrote.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The U.N. Security Council is due to meet in public on Monday, at the request of the United States, to discuss Russia's troop build-up on the border with Ukraine as international diplomacy aimed at easing tensions moves to the world body in New York.
The United States describes the meeting of the 15-member body as a chance for Russia to explain itself, while Russia signaled it could try and block it. Nine votes are needed for the meeting to proceed and Washington is ""confident"" it has sufficient support.
But aside from all members having the opportunity to air their views openly, there will be no action by the council - even if Russia were to invade Ukraine. A simple statement needs consensus support and Russia could veto any bid for a resolution.
Russia is one of five permanent, veto-wielding powers on the council along with the United States, France, Britain and China. The Security Council is charged with maintaining international peace and security. One day after the meeting, Russia is set to assume the council's rotating presidency for February. 
""The U.S. and its allies will use the U.N. as a political theater where they can publicly shame Russia in the event of war,"" said Richard Gowan, U.N. director at Crisis Group, a think-tank.
""I fear that this will be just one more crisis, like the Ethiopian war and Burmese coup, that shows what little clout the U.N. carries in the real world,"" he added.
WHAT HAPPENED WITH CRIMEA?
If Russia's military escalates the crisis, diplomats and foreign policy analysts say diplomacy and action at the United Nations is likely to mirror what happened in 2014 after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region.
The Security Council has met dozens of times since then to discuss the Ukraine crisis. In March 2014, it voted on a U.S.-drafted resolution opposing a referendum on the status of Crimea and urging countries not to recognize it. It received 13 votes in favor, China abstained and Russia cast a veto. 
Seeking to demonstrate Russia's international isolation, Western countries then took a similar text to the 193-member General Assembly, which adopted a resolution declaring the referendum invalid. It received 100 votes in favor, 11 against and 58 abstentions, while two dozen countries didn't vote. 
General Assembly resolutions carry political weight but are not legally binding. Unlike the Security Council, no country has veto power in the General Assembly.
WHAT ARE WESTERN DIPLOMATS DOING?
So far, Western diplomacy at the United Nations during the latest military build-up has largely focused on trying to rally support - should they need it - among U.N. members by accusing Russia of undermining the U.N. Charter.
The Charter is the founding document of the United Nations, outlining its purposes and principles agreed in 1945.
""Russia's actions toward Ukraine are not only a regional issue,"" U.S. President Joe Biden's ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told reporters last week.
""They impact every U.N. member state, and we must be prepared to stand together in unity and solidarity should Russia defy the shared values and principles that undergird our international system,"" she said. 
WHAT CAN RUSSIA DO AS SECURITY COUNCIL PRESIDENT?
On Tuesday, Russia takes over the council's rotating presidency for February. This is largely an administrative role, but does involve scheduling meetings, so some diplomats warn Russia could delay any attempts by council members to request another discussion on actions by Russia.

As things stand, the council is already due to discuss Ukraine on Feb. 17, diplomats said. It is a regularly scheduled meeting on the Minsk agreements, which were endorsed by the council in 2015 and designed to end a separatist war by Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine. 
The General Assembly is also set to hold an annual discussion on ""the situation in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine"" on Feb. 23.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Dozens of trucks and other vehicles blocked the downtown area of Ottawa for a second day after thousands descended on Canada's capital city on Saturday to protest against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and COVID-19 vaccine mandates.
Trucks remained parked on the streets near parliament on Sunday, a day before lawmakers are due to resume work after the holiday break. Hundreds of protesters were out on Sunday, too. Some truckers said they will not leave until the mandate is overturned. 
Former U.S. President Donald Trump, speaking at a rally in Texas on Saturday, praised the Canadian protesters for ""resisting bravely these lawless mandates"", in a sign the politicization of the pandemic seen mostly south of the border has spread north.
In solidarity with the Ottawa rally, truckers and protesters have blocked a Canada-U.S. border crossing in southern Alberta, police said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
In Ottawa, thousands gathered peacefully on Saturday and there were no arrests, though several incidents are now being investigated by police. 
""Several criminal investigations are underway,"" Ottawa police said on Twitter, including for the ""desecration of the National War Memorial"" and ""threatening/illegal/intimidating behaviour to police/city workers and other individuals"".
One protester was filmed dancing on the war memorial - the tomb of the unknown soldier - and flags bearing swastikas were seen in the crowd. A downtown mall shut down because protesters refused to wear masks.
Michael Cooper, a Conservative lawmaker who handed out coffee at the protest, was pictured standing near a Canadian flag bearing a Swastika during a TV interview. He later released a statement condemning the ""reprehensible"" protester on Twitter.
Canada's top soldier, Chief of the Defence Staff General Wayne Eyre, denounced a woman filmed dancing on the tomb of the unknown soldier, saying he was ""sickened"".
""We do not condone any disrespectful behavior,"" the official Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page for the rally said on Saturday. 
The demonstration started out as a protest against a vaccine requirement for cross-border drivers, but turned into a demonstration against the Trudeau government with a strong anti-vaccination streak. 
Due to security concerns, Trudeau and his family left their downtown Ottawa home on Saturday. Earlier this week Trudeau said the convoy represented a ""small fringe minority"" who do not represent the views of Canadians. 
About 90% of Canada's cross-border truckers and almost 79% of the population has had two COVID-19 vaccine shots. Canada is now in the middle of a spike in Omicron variant cases that is straining hospitals.
Transport Minister Omar Alghabra ruled out reversing any of the mandates on Sunday.
""Vaccines are our best way to protect ourselves and our economy from COVID-19,"" Alghabra said in an interview with the CanaBC. ""It is unacceptable to see the swastika being flown anywhere,"" he added.
Canada's Conservative Party supported the protest, which aimed a lot of its anger - in signs and chants - directly at Trudeau. The right-wing People's Party of Canada, which holds no seats in parliament, turned out at the rally.
""We are super-spreaders of freedom,"" People's Party leader Maxime Bernier said in a speech on Saturday.

Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said some protesters had harassed a soup kitchen, demanding free meals because their refusal to wear masks meant they were not to order in restaurants, according to an interview with the CBC.
""You have the right to protest, you've had your protest, please move on,"" Watson said.

""Iguanas are cold-blooded. They slow down or become immobile when temps drop into the 40s (4-9 Celsius). They may fall from trees, but they are not dead,"" the service said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Temperatures in South Florida reached a low of 25 degrees Fahrenheit on Sunday morning, according to the National Weather Service, and high temperatures on Sunday were expected to remain in the upper 50s to low 60s.
The nation's Northeast was walloped on Saturday by a deadly winter storm that prompted several states to declare emergencies and forced the cancellation of more than 1,400 flights.
Zoologist Stacey Cohen, a reptile expert at Palm Beach Zoo in Florida, explained the iguana phenomenon to television station WPBF.
""Their bodies basically start to shut down where they lose their functions and so they are up in the trees on the branches sleeping and then because it gets so cold, they lose that ability to hang on and then they do fall out of trees a lot,"" Cohen said.
Although most of the reptiles will likely survive this period of immobilisation, Cohen said freezing temperatures were a threat to their survival and pointed to a cold snap in 2010 that wiped out a large number of the population.
""Cold is a very, very life-threatening thing for them because they are from parts of Central and South America close to the equator where it always stays very warm,"" she said.

Green iguanas are not native to Florida, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. They were accidentally introduced as stowaways in cargo ships and are considered an invasive species. They can weigh up to 17 pounds (7.5 kg) and measure over five feet (1.50 metres) in length.
These iguanas are not the first animals to suffer the cold this winter. Hundreds of thousands of farmed fish died from thermal shock in a lagoon in northwestern Greece after a heavy snowstorm crippled the country last week.

BEIJING (Reuters) - A Chinese figure skating judge who served a suspension for giving preferential marks to his compatriots will serve on a technical judging panel at the Beijing Winter Olympics, competition records show, drawing consternation from a competitor affected by his work in the past. 
Huang Feng received a one-year suspension in June 2018 for biased judging of pairs figure skating at the Pyeongchang Olympics that year. 
For the Beijing Games, which begin on Friday, Huang is listed as a technical controller, an official who supervises technical specialists and can propose corrections regarding the level of difficulty identified for a given element.
When the International Skating Union (ISU) disciplinary commission suspended Huang in 2018, it said he had shown ""obvious and systematic bias"" at the Pyeongchang Games. 
""The seriousness of his misconduct is aggravated by the fact that it was committed at the Olympic Winter Games, the doubtlessly most important and prestigious competition that exists in figure skating,"" its decision said. 
Huang moved to have all charges against him dismissed, according to the ISU disciplinary commission. 
Huang could not be reached for comment. The Chinese Figure Skating Association did not respond to a request for comment and a call to its office went answered. 
The ISU, which had sought to bar Huang from officiating in Beijing, did not respond to a request for comment.
Prior to the 2018 Games, the ISU Officials Assessment Commission sent Huang a letter saying that his judging at the 2017 ISU Grand Prix Final showed ""clear support for the two Chinese pairs without any objective reasons either in elements and in components"".
""This has been evaluated as national bias,"" the letter said, according to the ISU disciplinary commission.
'REWARD'
Figure skating has been rocked by judging scandals and conflicts of interest, including a purported vote-trading scheme at the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics that sparked sweeping reforms.
At the 2018 Games, Canadian pairs skater Meagan Duhamel and partner Eric Radford won bronze. Duhamel said that when she studied the detailed scores, she realised one judge had been particularly harsh in marking some pairs. 
She was not surprised when Huang was suspended later that year.
""You should not be allowed to be suspended, and your reward is working the next Olympics,"" Duhamel, who retired after Pyeongchang, told Reuters.
""We as a sport have been trying to clear those people out, not welcome them back in.""

Bruno Marcotte, who coached Duhamel, his wife, said Huang would face heightened scrutiny in Beijing. 
""I dream that one day judges will represent the ISU and not their countries,"" he told Reuters. ""But I don't think that will happen any time soon.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. senators are very close to reaching a deal on legislation to sanction Russia over its actions on Ukraine, including some measures that may take effect before any invasion, two leading senators said on Sunday.
Senators Bob Menendez, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and James Risch, its top Republican, hoped to move forward on the bill this week.
""I would describe it as that we are on the one-yard line,"" Menendez said on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" using an American football reference meaning very close to the goal.
There is strong bipartisan resolve to support Ukraine and to punish Russia if it invades Ukraine, Menendez said. Asked if an agreement will be reached this week, he said, ""I believe that we will get there."" 
Senior Biden administration officials will hold a classified briefing for all U.S. senators on Thursday, a Senate aide said. Congressional leaders had requested a briefing on the situation. 
Russia has been building up its forces on Ukraine's borders for months and has demanded NATO pull troops and weapons from eastern Europe and bar the former Soviet state from ever joining the U.S.-led military alliance.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy supports immediate action and has criticized the West for waiting to impose more damaging sanctions.
The Senate bill would target the most significant Russian banks and Russian sovereign debt, as well as provide more U.S. military assistance to Ukraine. 
Some of the sanctions in the bill could take effect before any invasion because of what Russia has already done, Menendez said, including cyber attacks on Ukraine, false flag operations and efforts to undermine the Ukrainian government internally. 
More crushing sanctions would follow if Russia invades, he said, ""but the lethal aid would travel no matter what.""
There are still areas of disagreement between senators from the two parties, especially over whether to impose sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline.
""We're working on that. I think that's going to be the last T-crossed, I-dotted before we put them all across the finish line,"" Risch said. 
Ukraine is asking for both actions - sanctions right now and more after any invasion, Kyiv's ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova, said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" 

Markarova downplayed the simmering tensions laid bare on Friday when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused the United States of fueling panic over a possible Russian invasion.
""There is no friction,"" she said. ""We can have difference of opinions"" but the United States is Ukraine's strategic partner and friend and relations are at their highest level in decades.

MATHURA, India (Reuters) - In the streets around a revered religious site in the Indian city of Mathura where a temple and mosque stand side-by-side, the handful of Muslim restaurants that remain are mostly empty or shuttered.
A ban on meat last year by the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh state, a Hindu monk who issued the order on religious grounds, has decimated their trade.
Now the saffron-clad Yogi Adityanath, up for re-election in key state polls next month, has turned his attention to the temple itself, suggesting he will champion the Hindu cause in a long-running dispute with Muslims over who owns the site.
The issue has become a central part of the ruling party's campaign to extend its grip on power in Uttar Pradesh, home to 200 million people and the bellwether of national politics.
Hindus and Muslims have argued for decades over who should control the site, echoing other disputes in India that have, on occasions, flared into deadly riots between the two communities.
While communal violence in India is sporadic, clashes erupted across the country in early 2020 over a citizenship law that Muslims said was discriminatory. Dozens of people died.
Now mention of the Mathura dispute during campaign rallies and on social media has the city's Muslims worried, according to interviews with more than 20 residents.
""An old case which has been settled ... is being revived because we have a new, triumphalist Hinduism,"" said Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, author of several books on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Hindu nationalist movement.
""There is a greater emphasis on playing the temple card.""
Opinion polls suggest that the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), to which Adityanath belongs, will win the vote in Uttar Pradesh, despite broad discontent over the economy and the government's handling of the pandemic.
The chief minister, seen by some analysts as a potential successor to Modi, has cast the ballot as ""80% versus 20%"", figures he did not fully explain. The percentages closely match the Hindu and Muslim share of the population across the state.
Adityanath's office did not respond to a request for comment on the situation in Mathura.
'NOTHING TO FEAR'
The BJP swept to power in Uttar Pradesh on a Hindu-first agenda in 2017, and did not field a single Muslim candidate. Indians vote for powerful state legislatures separately from nationwide parliamentary elections.
That victory reflected the party's dominance nationally, since Modi stormed to power in 2014 after appealing to the Hindu majority.
The main opposition Congress party complains that by putting Hindus first, he and the BJP discriminate against minorities and risk stoking violence. Modi has defended his record and says his economic and social policies benefit all Indians.
Jamal Siddiqui, head of the BJP's minority commission, said the party was working to increase the number of minority candidates in Uttar Pradesh and the four other states going to the polls next month.
""I hope the minority community will participate both in elections and in government,"" he told Reuters. ""The Modi government has protected religious sites for all religions. Now, instead of being afraid of saffron, Muslims are coming closer.""
Suspicion of the BJP among Muslims in Mathura had been caused by misleading claims from opposition parties, Siddiqui added.
'NO COMPROMISE'
Among the holiest cities in Hinduism, Mathura, some 150 km south of New Delhi, is believed to be the birthplace of Krishna, one of the most important Hindu deities.
A temple standing on the reputed site of his birth was razed and replaced by a mosque, known as the Shahi Eidgah, in the 17th century during the Islamic Mughal empire. A Hindu temple complex built in the 1950s now backs on to the mosque.
An agreement was brokered in 1968 to settle the use of the land, and the two structures stood like ""two sisters"" until legal action to demolish the mosque began in 2020, said Z. Hassan, president of the trust that runs the Eidgah.
""I have been here for 55 years. I have not felt tension between Hindus and Muslims,"" he said. ""Only in the last few years this idea has come that there are two communities.""
The case, brought to a local court by several Hindu priests, says the 1968 agreement was fraudulent.
""This land is very important to us,"" said Vishnu Jain, the lawyer acting for the petitioners. ""I don't believe in any kind of dialogue. There is only one compromise which can happen – that they will be out of this property.""
Both sides expect the case to last for years.
The local dispute has been taken up by Adityanath and several other BJP leaders during campaigning.
He told a rally last month that work on constructing a temple in Mathura, along the lines of a similar development in Ayodhya, was ""in progress"", without giving more detail.
Ayodhya was the scene of communal violence in 1992 and 1993 in which more than 2,000 people died, after a mob demolished the 16th century Babri Masjid mosque that many Hindus claimed was on the birthplace of Lord Rama - another important deity.
A court ruling allowing the construction of a temple on the site of the Babri Masjid was a major campaign issue in the 2019 general election, when the BJP increased its majority.
'THE LAND IS OURS'
Many Hindu residents of Mathura support plans to reclaim the land from the mosque.
""The land is ours and should be given back,"" said Bipin Goswami, an 19-year-old with his face daubed saffron with sandalwood paste.
Local authorities mobilized thousands of security personnel in December after fringe Hindu groups announced an attempt to place a statue of Krishna inside the mosque on the anniversary of the Babri Masjid's destruction.
The attempt failed, but at the mosque, ringed with barbed wire and lookout towers since the early 1990s, police now check the ID cards of everyone entering the complex.
Aved Khan, a 30-year-old Muslim who has a food cart in Mathura, said he changed the name of his business from Srinath Dosa to American Dosa Corner after a group of men demanded that he stop using a Hindu name.
""You are Muslim, how can you have this name?"" one of the men asked, tearing down the stall's signs, according to a police report of the incident in August.
Rajesh Mani Tripathi, national president of the Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi Mukti Dal - a hardline Hindu group that was also behind the attempt to install the statue - told Reuters he was one of the men involved in the altercation.
""If he was Muslim then he should write his name on the banner and should not cheat people by mentioning a Hindu name,"" he said.
Muslims in Mathura also complained about Adityanath's decision in September to ban meat within a 3 km radius of the temple.
At the empty Royal Restaurant, one of the few in the area remaining open, cooks fashion traditional lamb kebabs and chicken tikka out of soya.
""Before the BJP there was no tension here,"" said Sajid Anwar, standing before his shuttered Labbaik Restaurant.

Anwar said there was no demand for vegetarian food among Muslims. He is waiting for the election results before deciding whether to close permanently.
""If Yogi returns, I will have to find another trade.""

The two-day meeting of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) foreign ministers comes amid the Biden administration's concerns about China, even as tensions with Russia over Ukraine rachet up in Europe.
China has previously denounced the Quad as a Cold War construct and a clique ""targeting other countries"".
Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne did not specify a date for the meeting, but said in a statement she looked forward to welcoming the Quad foreign ministers to Australia in coming weeks.
""We are a vital network of liberal democracies cooperating to give our region strategic choices, with a focus on practical steps to build the resilience and sovereignty of all states,"" Payne said.
The government of Prime Minister Scott Morrison is deepening Australia's partnerships in the region amid ""strategic competition, threats to liberal international order and increasing uncertainty"", she added.
Japanese media had previously reported the Quad meeting could be held virtually because of pandemic restrictions surrounding international travel. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said in a tweet on January 27 he has tested positive for COVID-19.
Canberra officials hope the timing of the February meeting will allow Jaishankar to recover and return a negative test.

Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi is also expected to attend.
The Quad grouping has previously discussed boosting the supply of COVID-19 vaccines to the region, supply chains for semiconductors and technology cooperation. It has also held joint naval exercises.

U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres’ report to the U.N. Security Council paints a picture of worsening living conditions for Afghanistan’s 39 million people despite an end of combat with the Taliban's takeover in August.
""An entire complex social and economic system is shutting down,"" Guterres said.
The report sounds the latest in a series of warnings the U.N. chief has issued in recent months about the humanitarian and economic crises that accelerated after the Taliban seized Kabul as the last U.S.-led foreign troops left and international donors cut critical financial aid.
Guterres recommended the council approve a restructuring of the U.N. mission to deal with the situation, including the creation of a new human rights monitoring unit.
The U.N. mission ""continues to receive credible allegations of killings, enforced disappearances and other violations"" against former officials, security force members and people who worked for the U.S.-led international military contingent despite a general amnesty announced by the Taliban, the report said.
The mission has determined as credible reports that more than 100 of those individuals have been killed – more than two-thirds of them allegedly by the Taliban or their affiliates – since Aug. 15, it said.

There also are credible allegations of the extra-judicial killings of at least 50 people suspected of belonging to the local branch of the Islamic State militant group, according to the report.
""Human rights defenders and media workers continue to come under attack, intimidation, harassment, arbitrary arrest, ill-treatment and killings,"" it said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States is concerned North Korea's escalating missile tests could be precursors to resumed tests of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles, a senior U.S. official said on Sunday, while urging Pyongyang to join direct talks with no preconditions.
North Korea conducted its largest missile test since 2017 on Sunday, sending a suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile soaring into space.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in said a recent flurry of North Korean missile tests was reminiscent of heightened tensions in 2017, when North Korea conducted multiple nuclear tests and launched its largest missiles.
He said the latest launch took North Korea a step closer to fully scrapping a self-imposed moratorium on testing its longest-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), which it hasn't tested since 2017.
A senior official of the Biden administration was asked in a briefing for journalists whether Washington shared the concern that Pyongyang might resume ICBM and nuclear testing.
""Of course, we're concerned,"" he said. ""It's not just what they did yesterday, it's the fact that this is coming on the heels of quite a significant number of tests in this month. And that follows on tests at the end of the year going back to September, of a variety of systems.""
""We obviously don't want to see further testing and we've called upon to DPRK to refrain from further tests,"" he said, referring to North Korea by the initials of its official name.
North Korea's testing spree is a major unwanted headache for the Biden administration as it seeks to head off any plans by Russia to invade Ukraine and contends with relations with China at their worst level in decades.
Under President Joe Biden, Washington has repeatedly sought talks with North Korea but has been rebuffed. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un held three summits with Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, but the talks did not realize Kim's demand for a removal of sanctions on Pyongyang.
The official said the latest North Korean test was part of an ""increasingly destabilizing"" pattern and in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions and therefore international law.
""It requires a response,"" he said. ""You will see us taking some steps that are designed to show our commitment to our allies ... and at the same time we reiterate our call for diplomacy. We stand ready and we are very serious about trying to have discussions that address concerns on both sides.""
The official did not detail the nature of the response.
Despite urging dialogue, Washington has maintained sanctions on North Korea and imposed more following recent tests and sought to encourage the U.N. Security Council to follow suit.
However, China and Russia delayed a U.S. bid to impose U.N. sanctions on five North Koreans Washington has accused of procuring goods for its weapons programs.

Asked whether the United States could secure Chinese and Russian support for new sanctions, the official replied:
""Our belief is that they understand their responsibilities as Security Council members to make sure that the Council's resolutions are enforced and the Council takes up its responsibility promote peace and stability in the region.""

802,"<span>Jan 30, 2022 03:20PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Sunday called on Afghanistan's Taliban rulers to release a U.S. civil engineer who was abducted two years ago and is believed to be the last American hostage held by the Taliban.
Mark Frerichs, a 59-year-old U.S. Navy veteran from Lombard, Illinois, who worked in Afghanistan for a decade on development projects. He was kidnapped a month before the February 2020 U.S. troop pullout deal was signed and was transferred to the Haqqani network , a brutal Taliban faction accused of some of the deadliest attacks of the war. 
Monday marks his second year in captivity.
""Threatening the safety of Americans or any innocent civilians is always unacceptable, and hostage-taking is an act of particular cruelty and cowardice,"" Biden said in a statement. 
""The Taliban must immediately release Mark before it can expect any consideration of its aspirations for legitimacy. This is not negotiable.""
Biden pulled U.S. troops out of Afghanistan in August in a chaotic withdrawal that drew sharp criticism from Republicans and his own Democrats as well as foreign allies and punctured his approval ratings. 
Frerichs' family has criticized the U.S. government for not pressing harder to secure his release. Last week, his sister, Charlene Cakora, made a personal plea to Biden in a Washington Post opinion piece titled, ""President Biden, please bring home my brother, the last American held hostage in Afghanistan.""
The United States has raised Frerich's case in every meeting with the Taliban, the State Department said in a statement. ""We call on the Taliban to release  him. We will continue working to bring him home,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken added in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post.
U.S. and Taliban officials met for the first time since the pullout in October in Doha, Qatar, which had hosted talks on Afghanistan that led to the troop withdrawal.
The Qatari emir was due to visit the White House on Monday on a range of issues that will include global energy security, the White House said last week. Qatar represents U.S. interests in Kabul.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) -Gunmen killed a Christian priest and wounded another as the clerics drove home from church in Pakistan’s northwestern city of Peshawar on Sunday, police said.
Two attackers on a motorcycle opened fire on the car on the city's ring-road, killing Pastor William Siraj instantly, officers added.
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the shooting in a city where scores of people died in a twin suicide bombing outside a church in 2013 - one of the deadliest attacks on Pakistan's Christian minority.
Azad Marshall, the most senior bishop in the Church of Pakistan, condemned the attack and tweeted: ""We demand justice and protection of Christians from the Government of Pakistan.""
Pakistan's northwestern areas bordering Afghanistan have seen a rise in militant attacks on security forces in recent days, many of them claimed by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a group which associates itself with the Afghan Taliban.
TV footage showed emergency services removing Siraj from the car, and people chanting ""Long live Jesus Christ"" as they carried his body on a bed through the streets to a house. Mourners hugged each other and sobbed.

Pastor Siraj's colleague - named by Bishop Azad as the Reverend Patrick Naeem - was out of danger and being treated for his injuries, a spokesman for the city's Lady Reading hospital said.
Bishop Azad said both were clergy of the Diocese of Peshawar in the Church of Pakistan, which is a union of protestant churches including the Methodists and the Anglicans.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - An exhausted and emotionally drained Rafa Nadal walked gingerly towards an exercise mat in the players' gym at the Australian Open and collapsed on it in a heap.
Hardly surprising given the 35-year-old had just spent five hours and 24 minutes on the Rod Laver Arena court, bathed in sweat, rallying from two sets down to edge out world number two Daniil Medvedev - an opponent 10 years younger.
He may have had little left in the tank, but after a few minutes on the mat he picked himself up, got on his exercise bike and got on with his cool-down routine.
""(It) has been a very emotional night,"" Nadal told reporters afterwards, having fought back against the U.S. Open champion to clinch a men's record 21st Grand Slam title.
""Even now I am destroyed, honestly, physically. I can't think much, I can't remember a lot of moments of the match.""
Before Sunday, the last time the Spaniard won from a two-set deficit was 15 years ago, and a second Australian Open title was the last thing he had expected, he said.
A couple of months back he was even considering retiring after a foot problem that has troubled him throughout his carrier resurfaced, forcing him to miss a chunk of the 2021 season including Wimbledon, the Olympics and the U.S. Open.
Underprepared and not in the best of health after suffering a bout of COVID-19, Nadal said he did not expect to go all the way at Melbourne Park, where his only previous success came way back in 2009.
Yet he stitched together an 11-match winning streak following his arrival Down Under, outlasting even the top-seeded Medvedev, who beat arguably the greatest hardcourt player ever in Novak Djokovic in straight sets in New York, in an intensely emotional and physical battle.
Nadal lost about 4 kilograms during his five-set battle in the last eight against Denis Shapovalov and under the floodlights on Sunday he sweated profusely from the start - leaving many in the stands wondering if he would even last if the contest went the distance against the supremely fit Russian.
But the Spaniard said he enjoyed the fight.
""I was not ready physically for these kind of battles, honestly. I didn't practice enough to be ready for it,"" he said.
""But tonight has been very special. I gave it everything that I had inside, believe me. I am, yeah, super, super tired. I even can't celebrate.""
Nadal has lost four championship matches on the blue hardcourts at Melbourne Park before, including a couple in the final set, and he was not going to go down without a fight on Sunday.
""I was repeating to myself during the whole match, 'I lost a lot of times here having chances, sometimes I was a little bit unlucky',"" he said, adding that his Australian campaign gave him more confidence that he could continue playing.

""I just wanted to keep believing till the end. I just wanted to give myself a chance. Just fight, just keep belief in trying to find a solution.
""Tonight has been unforgettable. I feel very lucky. At the same time I fought a lot and I worked a lot to try to come back to the tour and to give myself a chance to keep playing tennis.""

LONDONDERRY (Reuters) -Ireland on Sunday called on Britain to ensure justice for the families of 13 peaceful protesters shot dead by its soldiers on ""Bloody Sunday"" in 1972 as thousands marked the 50th anniversary of one of the defining days of the Northern Ireland conflict. 
The British government in 2010 apologised for the ""unjustified and unjustifiable"" killings of 13 Catholic civil rights protesters by British soldiers in the Northern Irish city of Londonderry on Jan. 30, 1972 - and of a 14th who died later of his wounds. 
None of those responsible for the shootings has been convicted and last July British prosecutors said the only British soldier charged with murder will not face trial - a decision that is being challenged by relatives.
""There should be a route to justice,"" Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told state broadcaster RTE after laying a wreath and meeting with relatives of the victims. 
""As somebody said, our children were buried 50 years ago but we still haven't laid them to rest ... because we don't have justice,"" he said. 
Coveney reiterated the Irish government's opposition to a proposal by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government to halt all prosecutions of soldiers and militants to try to draw a line under the conflict - a move that angered relatives and has been rejected by all the main local political parties.
""We absolutely cannot and will not support that approach,"" he said. 
Relatives holding white roses and photographs of those killed led thousands of people in retracing route of the 1972 march in Sunday's memorial events.
Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin looked on as the names of all the Bloody Sunday victims were read out.
""The full process of the courts and of justice should be deployed,"" Martin told journalists after the ceremony. 
No-one from the British government attended the events and senior loyalist Northern Irish politicians also stayed away.
Johnson in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post on Saturday described Bloody Sunday as ""one of the darkest days of the Troubles"" and said Britain must learn from the past. 
A spokesperson for the British government said it was ""absolutely committed to addressing legacy issues comprehensively and fairly.""

""This will include measures that focus on information recovery, so that families can know what happened to their loved ones, and which promote reconciliation, so all communities in Northern Ireland can move forward,"" the spokesperson said. 
More than 3,000 people were killed before the 1998 peace process largely ended years of conflict between Irish nationalist militants seeking unification with the Republic of Ireland and the British Army and loyalists determined to keep the region of Northern Ireland under British rule.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) -Rafa Nadal roared back from two sets down to edge Daniil Medvedev in a classic Australian Open final and claim a record 21st Grand Slam title only months after fearing his glorious career might be over.
With Novak Djokovic forced out by deportation and Roger Federer recovering from knee surgery, the Spanish great is now one major title clear of his ‘Big Three’ rivals after surviving the 2-6 6-7(5) 6-4 6-4 7-5 thriller at Rod Laver Arena.
""It was one of the most emotional matches in my tennis career,"" Nadal said after the five-hour 24-minute epic.
""It's just amazing now (given) one month and a half ago I didn't know if I will be able to be back on the tour playing tennis again.
""And today I'm here in front of all of you having this trophy with me.""
Riding a wave of raucous support from the crowd, a vintage Nadal pulled off his greatest escape to deny Medvedev again, less than three years after leaving the rangy Russian heartbroken in five sets at the 2019 U.S. Open final.
In a match steeped in drama that stretched into the early hours of Monday morning, sixth seed Nadal was two points from the title but was broken as he served for the match at 5-4.
He held firm to break Medvedev again and served out the match to love, with a backhand volley the final coup de grace. 
Dropping his racket, Nadal shook his head and grinned, then kicked a tennis ball away and pumped his fists in delight.
Tributes flew in from around the world, with Federer and Djokovic quick to congratulate him.
""A few months ago we were joking about both being on crutches. Amazing. Never underestimate a great champion,"" Federer wrote on social media.
""Amazing achievement,"" said Serbian Djokovic. ""Always impressive fighting spirit that prevailed another time.""
It was a triumph that defied time and logic, with the 35-year-old Nadal fighting back from a two-set deficit for the first time in 15 years -- the last time against Mikhail Youzhny at Wimbledon in 2007.
It came 10 years after losing a five-set marathon to Djokovic in the 2012 Australian Open, which lasted nearly six hours.
Having suffered three other final defeats in 2014, 2017 and 2019, Nadal can now savour a second crown at Melbourne Park, 13 years after beating Federer in another epic decider in 2009.
The long hair and pirate shorts of that era have fallen by the wayside, but the class and fighting spirit endure despite titanic battles with his body.
He missed Wimbledon due to fatigue and the U.S. Open with a chronic foot condition, leaving him on the brink of quitting the sport in late-2021.
'THE KID STOPPED DREAMING'
Just making the second week at Melbourne Park felt miraculous for the Spaniard, who joins Djokovic, Rod Laver and Roy Emerson (NYSE:EMR) as the only men to win all four Grand Slam titles at least twice each.
Thrashed by Djokovic in last year's final, U.S. Open champion Medvedev has now lost three out of his four major deciders.
Often booed and heckled by sections of the shamelessly pro-Nadal crowd, Medvedev admitted the frosty reception had hurt him, and he was still raw hours after the match.
After a lengthy monologue in his post-match media conference, Medvedev said he would gladly skip Wimbledon or the French Open if he could instead play in front of home fans in Russia.
""The kid stopped dreaming. The kid is going to play for himself,"" he said with emotion.
""It will be tougher to continue tennis when it's
like this.""
The hyped-up crowd was often unruly and one intruder jumped on the court to protest Australia's detention of refugees as Nadal struggled to serve out the second set.
After a brief delay as the protester was bundled off court by security, Medvedev went two sets up after sealing the tiebreak and flapped his hands at the crowd with a smirk.
It proved a red rag to a bull as Nadal and the terraces united to harry Medvedev through the rest of the match.
The Russian was left begging for crowd control from the chair umpire as Nadal stormed back into the game.
""They are idiots. No brains. Empty brains. Probably in their life it must be very bad,"" he grumbled during a change of ends.
The 25-year-old's frustrations only grew as the match wore on and his court coverage waned. He frowned as a trainer worked on his left thigh but dragged himself out to make a game of it.

Nadal, however, was not to be denied.
Ten years Medvedev's senior, with creaky knees and a suspect foot, the Spaniard finished full of running, showing himself and the world that further records may yet be at his mercy.

SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korea conducted its largest missile test since 2017 on Sunday, sending a suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile soaring into space, seen as taking the nuclear-armed country a step closer to resuming long-range testing.
South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff reported that a projectile believed to be a single ballistic missile was launched about 7:52 a.m. (2252 GMT) from North Korea's Jagang Province toward the ocean off its east coast. 
South Korea's National Security Council (NSC), which convened a rare emergency meeting presided over by President Moon Jae-in, said the test appeared to involve an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), which North Korea has not tested since 2017.
The launch takes North Korea a step closer to fully scrapping a self-imposed moratorium on testing its longest-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), Moon said.
He noted that this month's flurry of missile tests was reminiscent of the heightened tensions in 2017, when North Korea conducted multiple nuclear tests and launched its largest missiles, including some that flew over Japan.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has said he is no longer bound by that moratorium, which included a stop to nuclear weapons tests and was announced in 2018 amid a flurry of diplomacy and summits with then-U.S. President Donald Trump.
North Korea's rulers suggested https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkorea-warns-it-may-rethink-moratorium-nuclear-missile-tests-2022-01-19 this month they could restart those testing activities because the United States and its allies had shown no sign of dropping their ""hostile policies."" 
""The United States condemns these actions and calls on (North Korea) to refrain from further destabilizing acts,"" the U.S. military's Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement after Sunday's launch.
A U.S. State Department spokesperson said the launch demonstrated the threat posed by North Korea's unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programmes, and called for it to engage in diplomacy.
""It is provocative,"" the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said in an interview with ABC. Washington has repeatedly offered to hold discussions with North Korea without preconditions, she said.
BIGGER MISSILES
It is unclear if IRBMs were included in Kim's moratorium, but those, too, have not been tested since 2017. 
South Korea's JCS and Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno separately said the missile is estimated to have reached an altitude of 2,000 km (1,243 miles) and flown for 30 minutes to a distance of 800km. IRBMs typically have ranges of 600 to 3,500 miles, while ICBMs have ranges exceeding 3,500 miles.
Missile experts said the data could indicate a test of an IRBM such as the Hwasong-12, which was last tested in 2017, or a new type. 
""Regardless of whether it’s a IRBM or ICBM, this is a strategic missile of some sort and clearly not the same as the prior tests in the January 2022 test series to date,"" George William Herbert, an adjunct professor at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies and a missile consultant, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
The launch could make January the busiest ever for North Korea's missile programme https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/flurry-missile-tests-displays-nkoreas-increasingly-diverse-arsenal-2022-01-28, which analysts say is expanding and developing new capabilities despite strict sanctions and United Nations Security Council resolutions that ban the country's ballistic missile tests.
Its latest launches included a test of two short-range ballistic missiles and their warheads on Thursday, and an updated long-range cruise missile system tested on Tuesday.
Noh Kyu-duk, Seoul's special representative for Korean peninsula peace and security affairs, held a phone call with his U.S. counterpart Sung Kim. They both condemned the latest missile launch.
Noh also held a call with his Japanese counterpart and agreed to continue working toward resuming dialogue with North Korea, according to the South Korean government. 
'RAMPING UP TESTS'
The test comes less than a week before the opening of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, which is North Korea's main political and economic partner. Pyongyang has said it would be skipping the Games because of the COVID-19 pandemic and ""hostile forces.""
""Kim seems to be ramping up tests in bid to pressure both Washington and Beijing over sanctions just ahead of the Olympics,"" said Yang Uk, research fellow at Center for Foreign Policy and National Security.
In an address ahead of the New Year, Kim Jong Un called for bolstering the military with cutting-edge technology at a time when talks with South Korea and the United States have stalled.
Since then, North Korea has tested a dizzying array of weapon types, launch locations, and increasing sophistication as denuclearisation talks remain stalled.
Jagang Province was the site of two launches this month of what North Korea said was a ""hypersonic missile,"" which could reach high speeds while flying and maneuvering at relatively low altitudes, but the ranges reported on Sunday were higher and farther than those earlier tests.
""The ballistic missile launch and the ones before it are a threat to our country, the region and the international community,"" Matsuno said. ""This series of launches violate U.N. resolutions and we strongly protest this action by North Korea.""
South Korea's NSC condemned the launch as a violation of the resolutions and a challenge to international peace efforts, using stronger language than previous tests, when it typically expressed ""strong regret.""

The tests appear aimed at modernizing North Korea's military, bolstering national pride ahead of several major North Korean holidays, and sending a message of strength as the country grapples with economic crises caused by sanctions and COVID-19 lockdowns, said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha University in Seoul.
""The Kim regime hears external discussions of its domestic weaknesses and sees South Korea’s growing strength,"" he said. ""So it wants to remind Washington and Seoul that trying to topple it would be too costly.""

The UAE, along with Bahrain, signed U.S.-brokered normalisation agreements with Israel, dubbed the ""Abraham Accords"", in 2020. The two Gulf states and Israel share concerns about Iran and its regional allies.
Isaac Herzog discussed security and bilateral relations with the UAE's de facto ruler Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. 
The UAE has in the past fortnight been attacked twice with drones and missiles, claimed by Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group. Israel has responded by offering security and intelligence support to the UAE against further drone attacks. 
""We completely support your security requirements ... We are here together to find ways and means to bring full security to people who seek peace in our region,"" Herzog said during the meeting, in comments released by his office. 
Sheikh Mohammed said Israel and the UAE share a ""common view of the threats to regional stability and peace, particularly those posed by militias and terrorist forces"". 
The presidency in Israel is a largely ceremonial post. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett visited the UAE in December.
En route to the UAE President Herzog's plane flew over Saudi Arabia, which Herzog said was ""a very moving moment"". Riyadh has not yet followed its Gulf neighbours in normalising ties with Israel, but Israeli officials express hope this will happen.
""The Abraham Accords should be continued and more nations should join us,"" Herzog said. 
Palestinian Islamist militant group Hamas, which opposes countries normalising with Israel, said such visits ""encourage the occupation to continue escalating its aggression against our Palestinian people and denial of their rights"".

The heads of the Manufacturers Association of Israel and of the Israel Export Institute, travelling with Herzog, discussed a $10 billion fund set up under the Abraham Accords and how the UAE might help Israel find new Middle Eastern and Asian markets, the Association said.
President Herzog met the UAE's foreign minister and other officials, UAE news agency WAM said. He will also meet Jewish communities in the UAE, which is the region's commercial and tourism hub.

(Reuters) - Nine people died and six were injured after a six-car crash in north Las Vegas on Saturday when a Dodge Challenger traveling at a ""high rate of speed"" ran through a red light and crashed with multiple vehicles at an intersection.
The driver of the Dodge Challenger was among the dead, police said, adding that ""speed is a factor"" in the crash that took place on Saturday afternoon.
The ages of those who died ranged from juveniles to middle-aged adults, the police said in a press briefing late on Saturday. Two people were taken to a hospital where one died and the other was in critical condition.
The U.S. Transportation Department (USDOT) on Thursday released a strategy designed to cut the soaring number of traffic deaths on American roads that it called a ""crisis.""
In October, USDOT said deaths jumped 18.4% in the first six months of 2021 from the same period a year earlier, for the most deadly first half on U.S. roads since 2006 and the largest six-month increase recorded in the Fatality Analysis Reporting System's history, which has been in use since 1975.
""Please making this a safer community by slowing down, (and) paying attention to speed limits"", officer Alexander Cuevas from the North Las Vegas Police Department told the press briefing.
""Please do not drive distracted,"" he added.
The probe into the incident was ongoing.

Singer-songwriters Neil Young and Joni Mitchell are removing their music from Spotify in protest that the popular streaming service has allowed the airing of misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.
Harry and Meghan signed a series of corporate deals, including to produce and host podcasts for Spotify, as part of their efforts to make a living following their split with Britain's royal family announced in 2020.
""Hundreds of millions of people are affected by the serious harms of rampant mis- and disinformation every day. Last April, our co-founders began expressing concerns to our partners at Spotify about the all too real consequences of COVID-19 misinformation on its platform,"" the spokesperson said.
""We have continued to express our concerns to Spotify to ensure changes to its platform are made to help address this public health crisis. We look to Spotify to meet this moment and are committed to continuing our work together as it does.""
Contacted by Reuters on Sunday through its website, Spotify had no immediate comment. 
The Swedish company has previously said it worked to balance ""both safety for listeners and freedom for creators"" and had removed more than 20,000 podcast episodes related to COVID-19 in accordance with its ""detailed content policies.""

Young objected to his music being played on the same platform as Joe Rogan's top-rated postcast ""The Joe Rogan Experience"". Rogan has stirred controversy with his views on the pandemic, government mandates and vaccines to control the spread of the coronavirus.
Earlier this month, 270 scientists and medical professionals signed a letter urging Spotify to take action against Rogan, accusing him of spreading falsehoods on the podcast.

LONDON (Reuters) - The British government will introduce new legislation this week to broaden the scope of sanctions it can apply to Russia in an effort to deter aggression towards Ukraine, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said on Sunday.
With tens of thousands of Russian troops massed near the Ukrainian border, Truss has previously refused to rule out personal sanctions against President Vladimir Putin if Russia invades Ukraine, something that Moscow denies it is planning to do.
Western countries including Britain have threatened to impose https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/how-financial-western-sanctions-might-target-russia-2022-01-19 a range of new financial and economic sanctions on Russia if it invades Ukraine.
""What the legislation enables us to do is hit a much wider variety of targets. So there can be nobody who thinks that they will be immune to those sanctions,"" Truss, who is due to visit both Ukraine and Russia in the next two weeks, told Sky News.
Previously only companies with a direct involvement in destabilising Ukraine could be targetted, she said. Under the plans to be set out this week, that would now be widened and could include Russian financial institutions, energy companies and oligarchs close to the Kremlin.
""Any company of interest to the Kremlin and the regime in Russia would be able to be targeted so there will be nowhere to hide for Putin's oligarchs, for Russian companies involved in propping up the Russian state.""
Asked if the new powers could include the ability to seize property in London, Truss said: ""Nothing is off the table."" 
The Center for American Progress, a U.S. think tank, said in an article about sanctions https://www.americanprogress.org/article/how-the-united-states-should-respond-if-russia-invades-ukraine last week that Britain would face a challenge uprooting wealthy Russians with Kremlin links from London given close ties ""between Russian money and the United Kingdom’s ruling conservative party, the press, and its real estate and financial industry"".
Asked about this, Truss said: ""There's a real threat here to freedom and democracy in Europe. And that is more important than short term economic gains, both for the United Kingdom but also for our European allies.""
NATO DEPLOYMENT
The British government said on Saturday https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britain-considering-major-nato-deployment-amid-ukraine-crisis-2022-01-29 it was considering making a major NATO deployment as part of a plan to strengthen Europe's borders in response to the massed Russian troops.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to visit the region next week, and also will speak to Putin by phone.

Britain has provided lethal weapons to Ukraine to help it defend itself as well as a small number of military personnel to provide training, but Truss said on Sunday it was ""very unlikely"" British combat troops would be sent to fight in Ukraine.
She added that the Ukrainians would ""fight hard"" if Russia were to invade, and it was likely to result in a ""quagmire"" comparable to its past military involvements in Afghanistan or Chechnya.

Russia has forced the U.S.-led defence alliance and the 57-member Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to negotiate over regional security by massing around 100,000 troops near Ukraine while denying it plans to invade.
Russian President Putin said on Friday the United States and NATO had not addressed Moscow's main security demands in their standoff over Ukraine but that it was ready to keep talking.
""Today, through the Foreign Ministry, we are sending an official request to our colleagues in the Alliance and the OSCE, urging them to explain how they intend to implement (their) commitment not to strengthen their security at the expense of the security of others,"" Lavrov said on state television. 
""If they do not intend to do so, then they should explain why. This will be a key question in determining our future proposals, which we will report to the Russian President Vladimir Putin,"" Lavrov said. 

Russia will seek from the West not just promises, but legally binding security guarantees, ""that would ensure security on the entire European continent, with full, equal regard to Russia's legitimate interests"", Lavrov said.
Russia has demanded NATO pull back troops and weapons from eastern Europe and bar its neighbour Ukraine, a former Soviet state, from ever joining. Washington and its NATO allies reject that position but say they are ready to discuss other topics such as arms control and confidence-building measures.

Lai went to Honduras this week for the inauguration of its president, seeking to shore up shaky ties with one of Taiwan's last remaining diplomatic allies. 
Only 14 countries maintain official ties with Taiwan, viewed by Beijing as Chinese territory with no right to the trappings of a state.
Stopping off in San Francisco on Friday on his way back to Taiwan, Lai said he had spoken virtually with Pelosi, one of the ruling Democratic Party's most high-profile politicians.
""I was pleased to meet with @SpeakerPelosi, a champion of human rights and true friend to Taiwan. We are committed to working together to strengthen the U.S.-Taiwan partnership,"" Lai tweeted, sharing a picture of the video call, also attended by the de facto Taiwanese ambassador in Washington, Hsiao Bi-khim.
Lai briefly talked with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris in Honduras on Thursday https://www.reuters.com/world/us-taiwanese-vice-presidents-speak-rare-encounter-honduras-2022-01-28, a rare encounter that was highly symbolic and provoked anger in Beijing at a time of simmering tension with Washington.
The United States has no formal relations with Taiwan, but is its most important international backer and arms supplier.
China's foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said in a statement on Sunday that China firmly opposes any form of official exchange between the United States and Taiwan, and has lodged a ""solemn representation"" with the United States over Lai's virtual meetings with U.S. lawmakers. 
""We urge the U.S. to abide by the one-China principle and the stipulations in the three China-U.S. joint communiqués, immediately stop the erroneous acts of having official exchanges with Taiwan, avoid sending any wrong signal to the 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces, and refrain from further undermining China-U.S. relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.""
Transiting Los Angeles on his way to Honduras, Lai also spoke virtually with over a dozen members of the U.S. Congress.
Lai is a potential contender to be president in Taiwan's next election in 2024.
Taiwan has been heartened by the continued U.S. support offered by the Biden administration, which has repeatedly talked of its ""rock-solid"" commitment to the democratically governed island.

That has strained already poor Sino-U.S. relations.
China and the United States could end up in a military conflict if the United States encourages Taiwan's independence, Beijing's ambassador https://www.reuters.com/world/china/support-taiwan-independence-could-spark-us-military-conflict-with-china-chinese-2022-01-28 to Washington said in a U.S. radio interview broadcast on Friday.

Last May, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen accused https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-says-china-blocked-deal-with-biontech-covid-19-shots-2021-05-26 China of blocking a deal with Germany's BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) for COVID-19 vaccines, after Beijing offered the shots to the island via a Chinese company just as Taiwan was dealing with a rise in domestic infections. 
Beijing has angrily denied trying to stop Taiwan getting vaccines, and also offered Chinese-developed shots which the island rejected, citing safety concerns. China claims Taiwan as its own territory.
Less than two weeks after Tsai's comments, Senator Tammy Duckworth, visiting Taipei with two other U.S. lawmakers, said the United States would donate https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/three-us-senators-arrive-taiwan-meet-president-2021-06-05 750,000 vaccine doses to Taiwan.
Speaking to the Illinois Democrat during a stop over in San Francisco while on the way back to Taiwan from Honduras, Lai offered his thanks.
Lai said he was ""especially grateful to her last year when Taiwan was unable to obtain vaccines due to the China factor"", Taiwan's presidential office said, citing the de facto U.S. ambassador to Washington Hsiao Bi-khim, who is accompanying Lai.
""She not only actively advocated that the Biden administration should provide vaccines to Taiwan, but also personally went to Taiwan to announce that the United States would donate Taiwan vaccines.""
In Beijing, China's foreign ministry said Lai's accusation was ""total fiction"", calling it a ""malicious slandering and smearing of the true face of the mainland"". 
Taiwan eventually began receiving the BioNTech vaccines, jointly developed with  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), in September.
But that was only after Taiwan's government allowed major Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn, as well as its high-profile billionaire founder, Terry Gou, along with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd and a Taiwanese Buddhist group to negotiate on its behalf for the doses.
While Lai, a possible presidential candidate in 2024, was ostensibly abroad for the new Honduran president's inauguration, he made good use of his time to engage in diplomacy with the United States, Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier.
He briefly https://www.reuters.com/world/us-taiwanese-vice-presidents-speak-rare-encounter-honduras-2022-01-28 talked to U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris while in Honduras, drawing Chinese anger, and on Friday had a virtual meeting https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/taiwan-vp-wraps-up-overseas-trip-with-us-house-speaker-meeting-2022-01-29 with U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
On Saturday Lai also spoke to three former members of the Trump administration, including former national security adviser H.R. McMaster and Matt Pottinger, Trump's then-senior Asia adviser, Taiwan's presidential office said.

That hour-long discussion focussed on military issues including ""the proper preparations Taiwan"" should have to maintain security and stability in the Taiwan Strait, the statement said.
China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control.

(Reuters) - Tom Brady, widely considered the greatest quarterback in NFL history, is set to retire after 22 seasons and a record seven Super Bowl victories, ESPN reported on Saturday, although other outlets said he had yet to make up his mind.
The 44-year-old spent 20 seasons with the New England Patriots, winning six Super Bowls, before relocating to Tampa Bay and leading the Buccaneers to a Super Bowl championship last season.
The ESPN report came as something of a surprise after Brady led the league in touchdown passes and passing yards this season and could still potentially win his fourth league MVP trophy next month.
Brady's agent Don Yee told Reuters that people should wait to hear directly from Brady about his plans.
""I understand the advance speculation about Tom's future,"" Yee said in an email.
""Without getting into the accuracy or inaccuracy of what's being reported, Tom will be the only person to express his plans with complete accuracy.
""He knows the realities of the football business and planning calendar as well as anybody, so that should be soon.""
The Buccaneers said they could not confirm the news.
""Unfortunately, we are not in a position to know anything relating to the various reports,"" the team's communications manager Chris King told Reuters.
""I don't have anything to offer at this point in time."" 
The Buccaneers tried to convince Brady to come back for another season but he chose to prioritize his family and his health, ESPN reported.
But Brady's father disputed the ESPN report, telling KRON4 News that his son was not retiring.
Brady called the Bucs to inform them that he was ""not even close"" to making a decision on retirement, the Athletic reported late Saturday, citing a source.
Earlier in the day, Brady's company TB12 appeared to confirm the ESPN report when it celebrated Brady in a since-deleted tweet listing his accomplishments.
""Thank you for it all,"" the tweet said.
ESPN said it stood by its reporting, adding that Brady had wanted to make the announcement on his own terms.
'SATISFIED' WITH CAREER 
In a podcast recorded after Tampa Bay were eliminated from the playoffs by the Los Angeles Rams last weekend, Brady said he was ""satisfied"" with his career, ramping up speculation that he was ready to walk away from the game.
""I said this a few years ago, it's what relationships are all about,"" Brady said. 
""It's not always what I want. It's what we want as a family. And I'm going to spend a lot of time with them and figure out in the future what's next.""
Brady is the father of three and he and wife Gisele Bundchen have been building a house together near Miami.
""I'll know when I know,"" Brady said during the podcast. 
""I think for all of us, you know, we can all decompress a bit. It's been six straight months of football. Every day consumed by day in and day out football. And I think now it's just some time to spend some time with my family and spend some time with my kids.""

The Northern California native, who was selected with the 199th pick of the 2000 NFL draft, is the league's all-time leader in passing yards, passing touchdowns and quarterback wins.
He appeared in a record 10 Super Bowls, winning the game's MVP award five times, and his 15 Pro Bowl selections is the most in league history.

Ardern, in self-isolation https://www.reuters.com/world/new-zealand-pm-ardern-is-self-isolating-after-exposure-covid-positive-case-2022-01-29 until Tuesday, took a coronavirus test on Sunday after being exposed to an infected person. Results were expected later on Sunday or on Monday, her office said.
Journalist Charlotte Bellis said in an article in the New Zealand Herald that she could not return from Afghanistan, where she had been reporting, after Ardern's government rejected her application for an exemption to gain entry.
""When the Taliban offers you - a pregnant, unmarried woman - safe haven, you know your situation is messed up,"" Bellis wrote, saying she was trapped with her Belgian partner.
Bellis's case has spurred a heated debate on social media about New Zealand's strict COVID-19 rules and its tough border controls, with some calling Bellis's case an example of bureaucratic ""cruelty"" but others defending the system. 
Her Jan. 24 application was rejected because it was for travel on Feb. 27 - more than the 14 days after application allowed for people needing time-critical medical treatment, said Chris Bunny, head of Managed Isolation and Quarantine.
Bellis received a response inviting her to reapply within the 14-day window and contact the agency if she intended to bring her flights forward, Bunny said in a statement. 
He said the agency wrote to Bellis on Sunday that she may apply under another emergency allocation, for New Zealand citizens and residents in a location or situation where there is a serious risk to their safety and their only option is to return.
""Our emergency allocation team keep a close eye on applications, and Charlotte's location of Afghanistan came to their attention,"" Bunny said.
Bellis said in the article she had chosen travel dates outside the window due to a scarcity of flights out of Kabul and to ""give us time to appeal if we were rejected"".

New Zealand's borders have been shut to foreigners since March 2020. The government pushed back plans for a phased reopening from mid-January to the end of February out of concern about a potential Omicron outbreak, as in neighbouring Australia.
A country of five million people, New Zealand has had 15,910 confirmed coronavirus cases and 52 deaths.

DAKAR (Reuters) -About 50 people were sentenced to death, many in absentia, in Democratic Republic of Congo on Saturday in connection with the murders of U.N. experts Zaida Catalan and Michael Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) in 2017, a defence lawyer in the case said.
A local immigration official was among those given death sentences while an army colonel was given 10 years in prison, said Tresor Kabangu, who represented several defendants in the trial. Congo has observed a moratorium on the death penalty since 2003 so those convicted will serve life sentences.
Human rights groups say investigators have ignored the potential involvement of higher-level officials, and Catalan and Sharp's families said they did not believe the ultimate masterminds had been brought to justice. 
Catalan, a Swede, and Sharp, an American, were investigating violence between government forces and a militia in the central Kasai region in March 2017 when they were stopped along the road by armed men, marched into a field and executed.
Congolese officials have blamed the killings on the Kamuina Nsapu militia. They initially denied any state agents were involved but later arrested the colonel and several other officials who they said were working with the rebels.
After a nearly five-year trial marked by repeated delays and the deaths of several defendants in custody, a military court in the city of Kananga delivered its verdict on Saturday.
Among those sentenced to death was Thomas Nkashama, a local immigration official who met with Catalan and Sharp the day before their fatal mission, Kabangu told Reuters. Others were alleged members of the militia.
Colonel Jean de Dieu Mambweni, who also met with Catalan and Sharp before their mission, was sentenced to 10 years, Kabangu said.
A number of the defendants were convicted in absentia because they were either never apprehended or escaped from custody. 
Catalan's sister, Elisabeth Morseby, said after the verdict that testimony in the case was of dubious reliability given how much time the defendants had spent together in prison and said the conviction of Mambweni was a smokescreen.
""In order for the truth to emerge, all suspects, including those higher up in the hierarchy, need to be questioned, which has not yet been done,"" she told Reuters.
Sharp's mother, Michele, said she was glad some perpetrators were being held accountable, but wondered who gave the orders. 
""Surely someone in the upper echelons of power,"" she said. ""We await further developments.""
Congo's chief military prosecutor was not immediately available for comment. Prosecutors have previously said that they followed the available evidence.
Sweden's foreign minister, Ann Linde (NYSE:LIN), urged Congolese authorities to cooperate with a U.N. mechanism involved in the investigation to shine further light on the matter. 
""Crucial that investigation concerning others involved continues to further uncover truth and bring justice,"" she said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).

Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to visit the region next week, and also will speak to Vladimir Putin by phone.
Johnson is considering the biggest possible offer to members of the NATO defence pact in the Nordics and Baltics, which would double troop numbers and send defensive weapons to Estonia, his office said.

ROME (Reuters) -Italian head of state Sergio Mattarella was re-elected for a second term on Saturday, with party chiefs asking him to carry on after a week of fruitless, often fraught voting in parliament to choose a successor.
Relieved party chiefs thanked 80-year-old Mattarella for agreeing to remain, but the failed attempts to replace him during seven rounds of balloting have left deep scars, with potentially dangerous repercussions for political stability.
Nonetheless, financial markets are likely to react positively to the status quo, which will see Prime Minister Mario Draghi, who had made clear he hoped to become president himself, continuing as prime minister instead.
Draghi said in a statement that Mattarella's re-election was ""splendid news for Italians,"" thanking him for ""his decision to go along with the extremely strong will of parliament.""
Pope Francis sent the re-elected president a telegram of congratulations.
At the eighth round among more than 1,000 lawmakers and regional delegates in the Chamber of Deputies, loud and prolonged applause broke out when Mattarella passed the 505 votes needed for election.
He had previously ruled out remaining in office, but with the country's political stability at risk he changed his mind in the face of appeals from parliamentary leaders who met him at his palace earlier in the day.
In brief comments from the palace, Mattarella said the ongoing coronavirus crisis and Italy's difficult economic and social conditions meant he was duty bound to accept the decision of parliament.
He said that even though he had had other personal plans, he was ""committed to matching the expectations and hopes of the people"". 
In Italy's political system, the president is a powerful figure who gets to appoint prime ministers and is often called on to resolve political crises. Governments in the euro zone's third-largest economy survive around a year on average.
RECRIMINATION
The leader of the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) Enrico Letta, who had championed Mattarella's re-election, spoke to reporters to express ""enormous thanks ... for his generous choice towards the country.""
Draghi earlier called Mattarella and urged him to stay on, a political source said.
Relations among the parties in the ruling coalition have deteriorated during the election process amid mutual recrimination over the failure to find a consensus figure.
Draghi's coalition includes the main centre-left and centre right parties as well as the right-wing League, the once anti-establishment 5-Star movement and a range of smaller parties.
""The overall political backdrop has become less supportive for Draghi's government, which is facing a daunting task in the year or so left before the next general election,"" said Wolfango Piccoli of political risk consultancy Teneo.
On the right, while both the League and centre-right Forza Italia in the end embraced the appeal for Mattarella to continue, their ally Brothers of Italy, which has not joined them in government, denounced the behind-the-scenes manoeuvring.
""Parliament has shown it is not fit for Italians,"" said Brothers of Italy leader Giorgia Meloni in a statement.
She accused her allies of ""bartering away"" the presidency to ensure the government remains in place until the legislature ends in 2023, and said the conservative bloc ""needs to be re-founded.""
PD chief Letta, who has emerged stronger from the week of cross-party confrontation, said ""the political landscape has changed,"" and some observers are forecasting changes in Draghi's cabinet team in the near term.

Even before the deal among their leaders, lawmakers had been increasingly backing Mattarella in the daily ballots, with his tally rising to 387 in the seventh round earlier on Saturday.
In the end he got 759 votes, 94 more than at his first election in 2015 and the second highest tally for any Italian head of state after Sandro Pertini, president from 1978 to 1985.

ARGUINEGUIN, Spain (Reuters) - Spain's sea rescue service on Wednesday picked up more than 300 migrants trying to reach the Canary Islands in rickety boats, with nine of them clinging to a semi-sunken dinghy.
The rescue service said it was unaware of any drownings as reported by a rights group.
Helena Maleno, founder of the Walking Borders migration monitoring group, said 18 people had died trying to make the perilous crossing to the island of Lanzarote from Africa. Reuters could not confirm that figure independently.
The rescue service said on its Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account 319 migrants were rescued off six boats, including one carrying as many as 120 people, and were taken to Lanzarote and Gran Canaria.
Reuters footage showed dozens of people wrapped in red blankets arriving before dawn at the port of Arguineguin on a rescue boat and being helped off it to the pier by masked emergency workers in protective suits.
Ten people, including a pregnant woman and a baby, were sent to health centres, but none of them were in danger. 
The islands off the coast of West Africa have become the main destination for migrants trying to reach Spain, with a much smaller share trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea to the Spanish mainland.

A total of 22,316 migrants arrived in the Canaries illegally in 2021, compared with 23,271 the previous year. Last year was one of the busiest for such crossings in the past decade, according to interior ministry data.
Walking Borders said more than 4,400 migrants, including at least 205 children, were lost at sea trying to reach Spain in 2021, more than double the figure from 2020 and the most since the group began counting in 2018.

KYIV (Reuters) - From Monday to Friday, Mykhaylo is a lawyer, Alexander is an IT programmer and Konstantin freelances in online advertising.
On Saturday, the three came together in an abandoned construction site on the outskirts of Kyiv to train as Ukrainian army reservists, ready to be called up in the event of any war breaking out with neighbouring Russia.
Nervous over the threat of some 120,000 Russian troops massed near the border with Ukraine, Kyiv has launched a new Territorial Defence force this year, which it wants to build up into a corps of up to 130,000 people.
While they may stand little chance against the much bigger and better-equipped professional Russian army, reservists like them could be tasked with protecting civilian sites in Kyiv amid any conflict.
Saturday's training brought together about 70 locals, some in full infantry gear with hunting rifles and with combat experience from back when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and then backed rebels fighting government troops in eastern Ukraine.
Others in sneakers and casual sportswear were handed mock wooden rifles.
""I am worried,"" said Konstantin Sevchuk, the 43-year-old freelancer who said he had so far avoided any contact with the military after serving a year in the eastern Donbass region in 2014/15 during Ukraine's general mobilisation.
""It doesn't really fit into my life, I didn't really want it. But now the situation is such that it's needed.""
While IT programmer Alexander took part in the 2013/14 ""Maidan"" mass pro-democracy protests in Kyiv, he said he did not feel ready to fight when Moscow reacted to the overthrow of Ukraine's pro-Russian president by annexing Crimea.
""Now I'm in my mid-30s and it's time for me to join,"" he said, his face covered with a blue scarf. ""It's better to join now than when it's too late. I want to be prepared.""
Breathing heavily after getting up and dropping to the snow-covered ground numerous times with his heavy equipment, Mykhaylo, 39, was enthusiastic about going to fight.
""My inclination towards war craft has been there long before the war. Now it makes perfect sense to do it,"" he said during the showcase exercises. 
While the United States has warned that a military intervention is likely and imminent, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that too much ""panic"" is hurting the economy of 41 million people.
Russian President Vladimir Putin says the West has not addressed Moscow's main security demands in the crisis over Ukraine but that he is ready to keep on talking.
The West meanwhile has threatened Russia with heavy economic sanctions should it invade Ukraine again.
While Moscow insists it does not want a war, it has also dismissed calls to withdraw its troops, saying it can deploy them as it sees fit on its own territory. It has cited the Western response as evidence that it is the target, not the instigator, of aggression.
UKRAINE
The motley crew of reservists - arriving in everything from a small Suzuki to 4x4 vehicles and even an electric Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) - were sometimes critical of Zelenskiy and had differing views on NATO.
But they shared a feeling that Ukraine, formerly a Soviet republic, wanted to decide its own fate independently of its old overlord Moscow.
""I want a peacefully developing Ukraine,"" said Konstantin. ""I want it to be a flourishing peaceful country, like Poland, like the Czech Republic, like Germany, like all European countries.""
Mykhaylo said he wanted his children ""to be born and live their lives in a law-abiding and democratic country. That they know what freedom is and are ready to fight for it.""

Alexander noted how years of tensions with Russia - over Crimea, the eastern region of Donbass and Ukraine's aspirations for closer integration with the West, but also over gas supplies and the difficult history the two nations share - had changed his country.
""We've grown up as a nation. We understand what we want and how to get there. We've only made small steps, but we know that we are Ukrainians. We're not the Soviet Union anymore.""

Bromley Magistrates' Court convicted Amrit Magar on Friday after he was captured several times on door camera footage at the 19-year-old player's house in south London, where she lives with her parents.
Magar, a former delivery driver, left Raducanu flowers, a love note and a hand-drawn map, picturing his 23-mile (37-km) walk from his house in northwest London to reach her, the court heard, according to the Daily Mail.

He will be sentenced by the court next month.
""Since all this has happened, I have felt creeped out,"" Raducanu said in a statement to the court, according to the Daily Mail. ""I feel very apprehensive if I go out, especially if I am on my own.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) -Ash Barty is rarely emotional on court but when she accomplished her dream of winning the Australian Open, which also ended the home nation's 44-year wait for a singles champion, she tilted her head back and let out an almighty roar.
Fans all around Melbourne Park and around the country were also roaring with joy as the world number one fought back from 5-1 down in the second set against big-hitting American Danielle Collins to complete a 6-3 7-6(2) win and clinch her third Grand Slam title.
""It was a little bit surreal,"" the 25-year-old said about her celebratory cry of ""Yes"". ""I didn't quite know what to do or what to feel. 
""Just being able to let out a little bit of emotion, which is a little bit unusual for me, and being able to celebrate with everyone who was there in the crowd, the energy was incredible tonight.""
Since Barty won her first major at Roland Garros in 2019 and subsequently climbed to the top of the rankings, there has been growing anticipation that she would finally be the one who would end the sports-loving country's wait for a homegrown tennis champion.
The closest she came before was in 2020 when she lost in the semi-finals. Barty finally fulfilled that expectation by becoming the first Australian to be crowned singles champion at the Grand Slam since Chris O'Neil won the women's title in 1978.
""I think the expectation was that I would always come out and give my best, and that's all I've ever done,"" she said. ""Now to be able to have this part of my dream kind of achieved is amazing.""
Barty's adoring fans, many of them in green and gold, flocked to Melbourne Park on Saturday in anticipation of celebrating 'Australia Day' for a second time in three days.
The 25-year-old did not disappoint.
O'Neil was among those cheering on from the stands on a floodlit Rod Laver Arena. When Barty converted her first match point with a forehand crosscourt winner, 12,000 hollering fans leapt to their feets to hail the new champion.
Fittingly, organisers had arranged for Barty to receive the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup from her idol, mentor and fellow indigenous Australian, Evonne Goolagong Cawley.
""This is a dream come true for me, and I am so proud to be an Aussie,"" said Barty, who teared up when Goolagong Cawley was announced as the trophy presenter.
""It was really special just to be able to give her a hug. It's the first time I've seen her in 12 months.""
ALL SURFACES 
Barty has now won Grand Slam titles on three different surfaces, with 23-time major champion Serena Williams the only other active female player to have achieved the feat.
Barty said it was ""pretty amazing"" and Australian great Rod Laver agreed.
""A Grand Slam champion on three different surfaces, you are the complete player @AshBarty and I am so happy for you tonight,"" tweeted Laver, who was among those lucky enough to have a ringside seat.
Barty came into the contest having won 11 of her past 13 finals and had conceded just 21 games during the past fortnight, dropping serve only once. She also had a 3-1 head-to-head lead against the 28-year-old American.
But it was the 27th seeded Collins who was the first to set up a break point in the match with some forceful groundstrokes. 
A calm and composed Barty found the range with her serve to get out of trouble and then nosed ahead by breaking Collins in the next game when her opponent served up a double fault.
If Barty believed she would cruise to victory, there was more drama and more fight left in Collins.
Some uncharacteristic forehand errors from Barty allowed Collins, who will make her top-10 debut when the rankings are updated on Monday, to break early in the second set. 
The American let out a shriek of ""Come On"" after opening up a 3-0 lead. She then broke Barty's delivery, which looked almost impregnable this past fortnight, a second time in the set. 
But when Collins appeared to be on the verge of levelling the match as she served at 5-1, the Australian showed nerves of steel and raised her game.
Barty got the set back on serve and then dominated the tiebreak to complete a memorable comeback that left the home nation rejoicing.

""As Australians, we're extremely lucky to have the tennis history and the rich history that we do, particularly here at the Australian Open,"" an emotional Barty said. ""I'm a very, very small part of that. 
""I'm still trying to figure out what I'm doing myself, but to be a very small part of an amazing history in tennis as an Australian is really, really neat.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Russia's military buildup near Ukraine has expanded to include supplies of blood along with other medical materials that would allow it to treat casualties, in yet another key indicator of Moscow's military readiness, three U.S. officials tell Reuters.
Current and former U.S. officials say concrete indicators -- like blood supplies -- are critical in determining whether Moscow would be prepared to carry out an invasion, if Russian President Vladimir Putin decided to do so.
The disclosure of the blood supplies by U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, adds another piece of context to growing U.S. warnings that Russia could be preparing for a new invasion of Ukraine as it masses more than 100,000 troops near its borders. 
These warnings have included President Joe Biden's prediction that a Russian assault was likely and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's remarks that Russia could launch a new attack on Ukraine at ""very short notice."" 
The Pentagon has previously acknowledged the deployment of ""medical support"" as part of Russia's buildup. But the disclosure of blood supplies adds a level of detail that experts say is critical to determining Russian military readiness.
""It doesn't guarantee that there's going to be another attack, but you would not execute another attack unless you have that in hand,"" said Ben Hodges, a retired U.S. lieutenant general now with the Center for European Policy Analysis research institute.
The Russian Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a written request for comment
Ukraine's deputy defence minister Hanna Malyar denied the information.
""This information is not true. Such 'news' is an element of information and psychological war. The purpose of such information is to spread panic and fear in our society,"" she said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
On Friday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy criticised a ""feeling abroad"" that a war had already started. ""We don't need this panic,"" he told reporters in Kyiv.
A White House spokesperson did not immediately comment on any Russian movement of blood supplies but noted repeated public U.S. warnings about Russian military readiness.
The Pentagon declined to discuss intelligence assessments.
SECURITY DEMANDS
The three U.S. officials who spoke about the blood supplies declined to say specifically when the United States detected their movement to formations near Ukraine. However, two of them said it was within recent weeks.
Russian officials have repeatedly denied planning to invade. But Moscow says it feels menaced by Kyiv's growing ties with the West. 
Eight years ago it seized Crimea and backed separatist forces who took control of large parts of eastern Ukraine.
Russia's security demands, presented in December, include an end to further NATO enlargement, barring Ukraine from ever joining and pulling back the alliance's forces and weaponry from eastern European countries that joined after the Cold War.
Putin said on Friday the United States and NATO had not addressed Russia's main security demands in their standoff over Ukraine but that Moscow was ready to keep talking.
Biden has said he will not send U.S. or allied troops to fight Russia in Ukraine but told Ukraine's Zelenskiy in a phone call on Thursday that Washington and its allies stand ready to respond decisively if Russia invades the former Soviet state, the White House said.
The United States and its allies have said Russia will face tough economic sanctions https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/how-financial-western-sanctions-might-target-russia-2022-01-19 if it attacks Ukraine.

Western countries have already imposed repeated rounds of economic sanctions since Russian troops seized and annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014.
But such moves have had scant impact on Russian policy, with Moscow, Europe's main energy supplier, calculating that the West would stop short of steps serious enough to interfere with gas exports.

WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian troop buildup along its border with Ukraine includes supplies of blood https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/exclusive-russia-moves-blood-supplies-near-ukraine-adding-us-concern-officials-2022-01-28 for the wounded, three U.S. officials told Reuters, a detail reinforcing U.S. comments that Russia ""clearly"" now has the capability to move on its neighbour.
The disclosure by the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, adds to growing U.S. concern that Russia could be preparing for a new invasion of Ukraine as it has amassed more than 100,000 troops near its borders.
The Russian Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a written request for comment.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said the West has not addressed Moscow's main security demands in the crisis over the former Soviet state - but he said that it was ready to keep talking, offering some hope that an attack is not imminent.
Putin offered his first reaction to the U.S. and NATO responses to Russia's demands in a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron after weeks of personal public silence.
The Kremlin quoted Putin as telling Macron he would study the responses provided by Washington and NATO this week before deciding on further action.
Current and former U.S. officials said indicators like the blood supplies were critical in determining whether Moscow would be prepared to carry out an invasion, if Putin decided to do so. 
A French presidency official said Putin, in his call with Macron, had underlined that he did not want the situation to intensify, echoing conciliatory comments by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who said Moscow did not want war.
""Attention was drawn to the fact that the U.S. and NATO replies did not take into account Russia's principal concerns,"" the Kremlin said of Putin's conversation with Macron.
It listed those concerns as avoiding NATO expansion, not deploying offensive weapons near Russia's borders and returning NATO ""military capabilities and infrastructure"" to how they were before former Warsaw Pact states in eastern Europe joined.
""The key question was ignored - how the United States and its allies intend to follow the principle of security integrity ... that no one should strengthen their security at the expense of another country's security,"" it said.
The United States and NATO have said some of Russia's demands are non-starters but have also left the door open to dialogue. 
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the Western military alliance was watching closely as Russia moves troops and arms into Belarus for drills.
He said NATO was ready to increase its troop presence in eastern Europe if Russia took further aggressive actions against Ukraine, and cautioned that a Russian attack could take many forms including a cyber attack, attempted coup or sabotage.
""From the NATO side we are ready to engage in political dialogue. But we're also ready to respond if Russia chooses an armed conflict confrontation,"" Stoltenberg said in Brussels.
U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the United States remained focused on countering Russian disinformation, including anything that could be used as a pretext for attacks on Ukraine.
""While we don't believe that President Putin has made a final decision to use these forces against Ukraine, he clearly now has that capability,"" Austin told reporters.
He said ""there are multiple options available to (Putin) including the seizure of cities and significant territories, but also coercive acts and provocative political acts like the recognition of breakaway territories.""
U.S. General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Russia's deployment was larger than anything in scale and scope since the Cold War and said the United States strongly recommended that Russia stand down.
If Russia invades, the outcome would be ""horrific"" and result in significant casualties, Milley said.
ENERGY SUPPLIES 
Lavrov said he expected to meet U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken again in the next couple of weeks. Their last meeting, in Geneva https://www.reuters.com/world/top-diplomats-us-russia-meet-geneva-soaring-ukraine-tensions-2022-01-21 on Jan. 21, produced no breakthrough. 
""If it depends on Russia, then there will be no war. We don't want wars. But we also won't allow our interests to be rudely trampled, to be ignored,"" Lavrov told Russian radio stations.
He said, without giving details, that the U.S. counter-proposals were better than NATO's. 
A senior U.S. administration official said the United States welcomed Lavrov's comment on Russia not wanting war, but ""we need to see it backed up by swift action"".
A U.N. Security Council meeting on Monday on the build-up of Russian forces on the border with Ukraine will be ""an opportunity for Russia to explain what it is doing"", the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The United States and the European Union have warned Russia that it will face economic sanctions if it attacks Ukraine.
These would build on sanctions imposed on Russia since it annexed Crimea and backed separatists in east Ukraine in 2014, though there are divisions among Western countries over how to respond as Europe is dependent on Russia for energy supplies.
U.S. President Joe Biden and Ursula von der Leyen, who heads the EU executive, the European Commission, said they had agreed to cooperate on guaranteeing Europe's energy security https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/biden-eu-pledge-cooperation-energy-security-amid-russia-threat-2022-01-28 but gave no details.
Washington has been in talks with energy-producing countries and companies around the world over a potential diversion of supplies to Europe if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior Biden administration official told reporters this week.
EU officials have repeatedly called for unity in the bloc over Ukraine, with some concerned that Germany - worried about energy supplies - has not taken a tougher stance.
Russia has dismissed calls to withdraw its troops, saying it can deploy them as it sees fit on its own territory. It has cited the Western response as evidence that Russia is the target, not the instigator, of aggression.

Ukraine has suggested a Russian attack is not imminent though an economically damaging war is possible. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy criticised a ""feeling abroad"" that a war had already started.
""We don't need this panic,"" Zelenskiy told reporters in Kyiv.

LONDONDERRY (Reuters) - Five decades after British soldiers killed 13 unarmed Catholic civil rights marchers on one of the defining days of the Northern Ireland conflict, relatives are still searching for the justice they believe is needed for a scarred society to heal. 
Family and friends of the 13 Catholics who died in Londonderry on ""Bloody Sunday"", Jan. 30, 1972 - and of a 14th who died later of his wounds - gathered this week for a series of commemorations to mark the event that helped fuel three decades of bitter sectarian and political violence. 
While a judicial inquiry found in 2010 that the victims were innocent and had posed no threat to the military, the commemorations come just months after prosecutors announced that the only British soldier charged with murder will not face trial.
""Our generation are very slowly dying off... and we would like to see it [justice] when we're still alive,"" said Jean Hegarty, whose brother Kevin McElhinney was shot dead aged 17. She supports legal action to bring the soldier to trial.
""My head would say no, but my heart would still like to believe that we can see at least some soldiers face a court,"" she said. 
BITTERNESS
Northern Ireland's 1998 peace process has been hailed around the world for its success in largely ending a conflict in which more than 3,000 people were killed. 
Irish nationalist militants seeking unification with the Republic of Ireland faced off against the British Army and loyalists determined to keep the province British. 
But nearly a quarter of a century after the peace, the bitterness lingers.
A number of flags of the British Army's Parachute Regiment, whose members shot the protesters, were hung from lamp posts in the city in the run-up to the commemorations, something that has become an annual ritual. The regiment condemned the action.
A leading member of Northern Ireland's pro-British Democratic Unionist Party complained that ""countless words"" had been written about Bloody Sunday but little about two soldiers shot dead by Irish nationalist militants a few days earlier.
While the Irish Republican Army (IRA) was responsible for about half of the deaths in the conflict, nationalists argue the violence was spurred by a repressive state that denied them their rights - and rarely more vividly than on Bloody Sunday. 
""I'm disappointed by the belligerence of politicians,"" said Hegarty. ""In some respects there has not been a lot of change. In some respects there has been tonnes."" 
Commemorations this weekend will include a memorial service on Londonderry's main square and a play centred on a famous photograph of priest Edward Daly holding up a white handkerchief to British soldiers as men tried to carry a dying man to safety. 
The play will be performed entirely by locals in a city where January 30 retains a ""real deep poignancy"", said director Kieran Griffiths, who worked closely with the relatives. 
Gleann Doherty, whose father Patrick was among those killed on Bloody Sunday, believes the relatives have been given more closure than most impacted by the conflict. The detailed inquiry led Britain's then-Prime Minister David Cameron in 2010 to apologise for the ""unjustified and unjustifiable killings"".
The current British government last year announced a plan to halt all prosecutions of soldiers and militants in a bid to draw a line under the conflict - a move that angered relatives and has been rejected by all the main local political parties. 

""We're sort of one of the lucky - if you can call it lucky - ones to have some sort of answers to what happened,"" said Doherty. 
""It's fairly difficult to get any sort of reconciliation... when you have the British government trying to close the door on any possibility"" of justice, he added.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Daily COVID-19 infections among athletes and team officials at the Beijing Winter Olympics jumped to 19 on Friday from two a day earlier, as Games organisers warned of more cases in coming days.
Including the athletes and officials, 36 Games-related personnel were found to be infected - 29 when they arrived at the Beijing airport and seven already in the ""closed loop"" bubble that separates event personnel from the public, the organising committee said in a statement on Saturday.
""We are now just going through the peak period of people arriving in China and therefore we expect to see the highest numbers at this stage,"" the Games' medical chief, Brian McCloskey, told a news conference.
Organisers are ""confident"" in their system of COVID-19 prevention, and infections are unlikely to leak out into the public, McCloskey said.
Cases among athletes and team officials exceeded those for ""other stakeholders"", including media, sponsors and staff, for the first time since China started releasing daily numbers of Olympics-related coronavirus cases on Jan. 23, according to a Reuters tally of previous statements.
""It's annoying that every morning you need to get up a little earlier specially to get a PCR test. I think that in a few days, it will be like brushing your teeth,"" Russian hockey player Anton Slepyshev told RIA news agency.

""Everyone is concerned that the test result will suddenly turn out to be positive. But the reality is such that we are living with COVID. We accept all the risks and fears,"" he said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A leading Hong Kong university on Saturday covered a painted slogan commemorating China's Tiananmen Square crackdown, the latest instance of a public June 4 memorial being removed in China-ruled Hong Kong.
A Reuters journalist saw about a dozen construction workers wearing yellow hard hats erect grey metal construction hoardings around a ""martyrs slogan"" painted across the length of the University of Hong Kong's (HKU) Swire bridge.
The slogan, painted in Chinese characters on the pavement, read: ""The souls of the martyrs shall forever linger despite the cold-blooded massacre. The spark of democracy shall forever glow for the demise of evil.""
Asked why the university, which took down a ""Pillar of Shame"" Tiananmen statue https://www.reuters.com/world/china/hong-kong-university-fences-off-tiananmen-statue-campus-2021-12-22 in December, covered the 20-character slogan, an HKU spokesperson said by email, ""The University of Hong Kong regularly conducts maintenance works at various locations and facilities, with the above site being one such project.""
For over three decades, it has been a tradition for students at HKU to repaint the slogan on the bridge before the anniversary of 1989 crackdown.
The fencing-off of the 20-metre (65-foot) long slogan is the latest step in Hong Kong involving memorials, people or organisations affiliated with the sensitive date and events to mark it.
Rights groups and witnesses say thousands may have been killed in the Beijing crackdown on students and democracy activists. Chinese officials have given a death toll of about 300.
The former British colony had long been the only place on Chinese soil where June 4 could be publicly remembered, unlike mainland China where it is a taboo topic and censored. For the past two years, however, authorities have barred an annual candlelight vigil, citing COVID-19.
In December, three local universities took down sculptures commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown in Beijing in which hundreds, perhaps thousands of people were killed after Chinese troops fired upon civilians.
Authorities have been clamping down in Hong Kong under a national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020 that some foreign governments, including the United States, say is being used to suppress civil society, jail democracy campaigners and silence dissent.

Authorities say the law has restored order and stability after massive street protests in 2019.
Several workers and security guards at the bridge site declined to comment on the work. Parts of the slogan that could not be surrounded by the nearly 2-meter (6 1/2-foot) high hoarding were overlaid with metal plates on the road.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - An unnamed woman has filed a lawsuit that accuses musician Chris Brown of drugging and raping her on a Florida yacht in December 2020 and seeks $20 million in damages from the Grammy-winning singer.
The civil lawsuit, filed on Thursday by a musician and choreographer identified as Jane Doe, said she was invited by Brown to meet him at Star Island, Florida, home of rapper Sean Combs. When she arrived, she boarded a yacht and accepted Brown's offer of a drink as they discussed her career, the filing said.
After a second drink, the woman suddenly began to feel disoriented and physically unstable, according to the lawsuit. She said Brown dragged her to a bedroom, removed her bikini bottoms and had sex with her without consent, the lawsuit said. 
An attorney for Brown, 32, and two other representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.
Writing on Instagram, Brown said: ""Whenever I'm releasing music or projects, 'THEY' try to pull some real bulls–t,"" and included a blue cap emoji, which is used as slang for lies.
Brown pleaded guilty to assaulting singer Rihanna when the pair were dating in 2009, an incident that made headlines around the world after a photo of her bruised face was released.
A woman also accused Brown of raping her in a Paris hotel room in 2019. The singer denied the allegation and filed a defamation complaint against the accuser. No charges were filed.
In the new lawsuit, the woman said Brown called her the day after the incident and told her to take an emergency contraceptive pill to prevent any pregnancy.

The filing said she saw Brown twice after that encounter. At one of those meetings, he became ""irate"" when she turned down an invitation to his bedroom, the complaint said. 
The woman has experienced ""dramatic mood swings, loss of appetite, panic attacks and has engaged in self harm,"" said the lawsuit, which was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. She is seeking a jury trial and $20 million in damages.

Lai went to Honduras this week for the inauguration of its new president, seeking to shore up shaky ties with one of Taiwan's last remaining diplomatic allies. 
Only 14 countries now maintain official ties with Taiwan, viewed by Beijing as Chinese territory with no right to the trappings of a state.
Stopping off in San Francisco on Friday on his way back to Taiwan, Lai said he had spoken virtually with Pelosi, one of the ruling Democratic Party's most high-profile politicians.
""I was pleased to meet with @SpeakerPelosi, a champion of human rights and true friend to Taiwan. We are committed to working together to strengthen the U.S.-Taiwan partnership,"" Lai tweeted, sharing a picture of the video call, also attended by the de facto Taiwanese ambassador in Washington, Hsiao Bi-khim.
Lai briefly talked with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris in Honduras on Thursday https://www.reuters.com/world/us-taiwanese-vice-presidents-speak-rare-encounter-honduras-2022-01-28, a rare encounter that was highly symbolic and provoked anger in Beijing at a time of simmering tension with Washington.
The United States has no formal relations with Taiwan either, but is its most important international backer and arms supplier.
Transiting Los Angeles on his way to Honduras, Lai also spoke virtually with over a dozen members of the U.S. Congress.
Lai is a potential contender for president in Taiwan's next election in 2024.
Taiwan has been heartened by continued U.S. support offered it by the Biden administration, which has repeatedly talked of its ""rock-solid"" commitment to the democratically governed island.

That has further strained already poor Sino-U.S. relations.
China and the United States could end up in a military conflict if the United States encourages Taiwan's independence, Beijing's ambassador https://www.reuters.com/world/china/support-taiwan-independence-could-spark-us-military-conflict-with-china-chinese-2022-01-28 to Washington said in a U.S. radio interview broadcast on Friday.

In Vilnius, he will discuss bilateral economic cooperation, and U.S. ""strong support for Lithuania in the face of political pressure and economic coercion from the People’s Republic of China,"" the statement said.
Fernandez will be accompanied by U.S. Export-Import Bank officials to discuss implementation of a $600 million memorandum of understanding to expand opportunities for U.S. exporters and Lithuanian buyers in areas such as high-tech manufacturing, business services and renewable energy, according to the statement.
In Brussels, Fernandez will discuss transatlantic trade and investment through the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, the statement said.
The United States, which is seeking to push back against growing Chinese influence worldwide, has backed Lithuania in its dispute with China over Taiwan, a self-ruled island Beijing claims as its own.
China downgraded its diplomatic relationship with Lithuania and pressed multinationals to sever ties with the country after Taiwan opened a representative office in Vilnius last year called the Taiwanese Representative Office in Lithuania, rather than using the word Taipei as is more common.
EU authorities launched a challenge at the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Thursday, accusing China of discriminatory trade practices against EU member Lithuania that they say threaten the integrity of the bloc's single market.
Lithuania's Foreign Ministry said on Thursday it hopes its trade dispute with China will be solved with consultations between China and the EU.

Commenting on the WTO case, Taiwan's Cabinet's Office of Trade Negotiations said late Friday it ""fully supports"" the EU and Lithuania and opposes China's ""inappropriate economic coercion"".
""Our country will work with other like-minded partners such as Lithuania and the EU to prevent China from using coercive economic and diplomatic measures, to maintain a rules-based international trading system,"" it added in a statement.

(Reuters) - Nearly a year after his son was last seen being hauled away by Myanmar junta troops, 66-year-old Win Hlaing says he just wants to know whether he is alive.
One night last April, a neighbour phoned to tell him his son, Wai Soe Hlaing, a young father who ran a phone shop in Yangon, had been detained in connection with protests against the Feb. 1 military coup.
They traced the 31-year-old to a local police station, according to Win Hlaing and The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), a non-profit that has been documenting arrests and killings.
Then the trail went cold. He had vanished.
Reuters called the police station but was unable to determine the whereabouts of Wai Soe Hlaing, or the missing relatives of two other people who were interviewed for this article.
A spokesman for the junta did not respond to emailed requests for comment and did not answer phone calls seeking comment.
Wai Soe Hlaing is among many people who activists and families say have disappeared since Myanmar was plunged into turmoil after the military overthrew the elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi.
The AAPP estimates more than 8,000 people are detained in prisons and interrogation centres, including Suu Kyi and most of her cabinet, while about 1,500 have been killed. Reuters was unable to independently verify the figures from the AAPP.
They say hundreds have died after being detained. The junta has said the figures are exaggerated and that the AAPP spreads false information. The junta has not disclosed the number of people in detention. 
    SEARCH FOR LOVED ONES
The military does not notify relatives when a person is arrested and prison officials often do not do so when they arrive in jail, so families laboriously search for their relatives by calling and visiting police stations and prisons or relying on accounts from local media or human rights groups.
Sometimes they send food parcels and take it as a sign their relative is being held there if the package is accepted, a Human Rights Watch report said.
    In many cases, AAPP co-founder Bo Kyi said, the organisation has been able to determine someone has been detained but not where. 
   Tae-Ung Baik, chair of the United Nations' working group on enforced disappearances told Reuters the group had received reports from families in Myanmar of enforced disappearances since last February and was ""seriously alarmed"" by the situation.
In a border town, 43-year-old activist Aung Nay Myo, who fled there from the northwestern Sagaing region, said junta troops took his parents and siblings from their home in mid-December and he does not know where they were.
    He believes they were detained because of his work as a satirical writer. Among them is his 74-year-old father, left disabled by a stroke.
    ""There is nothing I can do but worry every moment,"" Aung Nay Myo said. 
    Two police stations in the town of Monywa, their hometown in Sagaing region, did not answer phone calls seeking comment.
In some areas, resistance to the junta has spiralled into conflict, with fighting displacing tens of thousands of people across the country, according to the U.N. Thousands have fled across borders to Thailand and India.
VIRAL IMAGE
In the northeastern Kayah state, where fighting has been fierce, Banyar Khun Naung, director of the non-profit Karenni Human Rights Group, said at least 50 people were missing.
The group is trying to help families search, asking recently released prisoners any names they remembered.
""The families of missing people are in great pain, especially mentally, as it is exhausting not to know where their loved ones are,"" he said.
    Myint Aung, in his mid-50s and now living in a camp for internally displaced people in Kayah, said his 17-year-old son Pascalal disappeared in September.
    The teenager told his father he was going to travel to their home in the state capital Loikaw to check on the situation, but never came back, Myint Aung said.
Instead, he was detained by security forces, Myint Aung told Reuters by phone, saying that local villagers told him. When he visited the station to deliver food, he found soldiers guarding the area and ran away.
Since then, Myint Aung has heard nothing of his son, but the rights group told him he was no longer at the police station, citing conversations with several people recently freed. Reuters was unable to independently verify this information.
Banyar Khun Naung, the Karenni rights group director, said the teenager was one of two young men pictured making the ""Hunger Games"" salute adopted by protesters as they were detained kneeling by the side of a road, lashed together with rope by a soldier, in an image widely circulated on social media. His sister confirmed by phone it was Pascalal.
The photo appeared in a viral post from an account that appeared to belong to a high-ranking soldier, with the caption, ""While we let them do what they want before we put bullets through their heads"". The account was subsequently deleted and Reuters was not able to reach its owner for comment.
""He's an underage civilian boy and he didn't do anything wrong,"" his father Myint Aung said.

    Police in Loikaw did not answer phone calls from Reuters seeking comment.
    In Yangon, the family of Wai Soe Hlaing tell his four-year-old daughter her father is working somewhere far away. Sometimes, Win Hlaing said, she murmurs about him: ""My papa has been gone too long.""

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) -Xiomara Castro was sworn in as Honduras' first woman president on Thursday in front of a cheering crowd including U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, who pledged U.S. government support to stem migration and fight corruption.
Castro's inauguration ends the eight-year rule of Juan Orlando Hernandez, a one-time U.S. ally who has been accused in U.S. courts https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-honduras/honduran-president-target-of-u-s-investigation-court-filings-show-idUSKBN2A8291 of corruption and links to drug traffickers. Even as Hernandez left office a U.S. congresswoman called for him to be indicted, and for requests to be made for his extradition.
Castro, flanked by her husband, former President Manuel Zelaya, was sworn in at a packed soccer stadium where supporters applauded her vows to fix the country's massive debt burden. 
""The economic catastrophe that I'm inheriting is unparalleled in the history of our country,"" a somber Castro said in her inaugural address.
Her government also faces tests over a sharply divided Congress, and relations with China due to Honduras maintaining diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
Harris, who was loudly applauded when introduced during the inauguration, congratulated Castro over her ""democratic election.""
In a meeting shortly after the ceremony, Harris promised to collaborate on migration issues, economic development and fighting impunity, and said she welcomed Castro's plans to request United Nations help to establish an anti-corruption commission. 
Harris has been tasked with addressing the ""root causes"" of migration in Central America's impoverished Northern Triangle of countries, but her trip comes as U.S. President Joe Biden's popularity at home has waned and his immigration strategy https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-children-insight-idCAKBN2C21FH has stalled https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bidens-immigration-goals-fade-after-setbacks-us-mexico-border-2022-01-20.
""We do very much want and intend to do what we can to support this new president,"" said one administration official.
Castro tweeted that she appreciated Harris' visit and the Biden administration's willingness to support the Honduran government.
Harris also pledged to send Honduras several hundred thousand more COVID-19 vaccine doses along with 500,000 syringes and $1.3 million for health and educational facilities. 
The two did not discuss China, she told reporters. 
    U.S. officials want to work with Castro both to curb illegal immigration from Central America and shore up international support for Taiwan as part of its efforts to stem China's influence. 
Honduras is one of the few countries maintaining diplomatic ties with Taipei instead of Beijing, and Castro during her campaign backtracked on comments that she might switch allegiance to China as president.
    Taiwanese Vice President William Lai attended the inauguration in a bid https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/taiwan-vice-president-leaves-shore-up-shaky-alliance-with-honduras-2022-01-25 to bolster ties with Castro's government. Harris said the two spoke https://www.reuters.com/world/us-taiwanese-vice-presidents-speak-rare-encounter-honduras-2022-01-28 over their common interest in Central America.
Luis Leon, director of the Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy in Central America, said Harris' arrival was a boost for Castro in the dispute over control of Congress and in addressing Honduras' weak economy.
""MAELSTROM OF LOOTING""
Castro said it was ""practically impossible"" to make current debt payments without a restructuring, after debt jumped sevenfold under her two conservative predecessors. 
The country's total debt stands at about $15.5 billion, or nearly 60% of gross domestic product, an economic problem Castro frequently highlighted ahead of her landslide win in November. 
""My government will not continue the maelstrom of looting that has condemned generations of young people to pay the debt they incurred behind their back,"" she added.
She vowed to immediately give more than 1 million poor Hondurans free electricity, with bigger consumers subsidizing the cost.
Castro, who describes herself as a democratic socialist, has vowed to tackle corruption, poverty and violence, chronic problems that have fueled U.S.-bound migrants. 
But her legislative program has been jeopardized https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/honduras-next-president-blasts-party-betrayal-congress-2022-01-21 by renegade politicians from her leftist Libre party who allied with the opposition National Party to vote for one of its members to head Congress, breaking a pact with a key electoral ally.
Castro also takes office at a time of controversy for her predecessor Hernandez, who had served a maximum two consecutive terms as president and had been a longstanding U.S. ally in immigration and anti-narcotics operations.
U.S. Congresswoman Norma Torres has called for Hernandez's indictment on drug charges, and for U.S. officials to request his extradition.
But Hernandez may be shielded from extradition for up to four years, as he was sworn in https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/hours-out-office-honduras-ex-president-gains-immunity-through-regional-post-2022-01-28 as a member of the Central American parliament shortly after Castro's inauguration.

He has repeatedly denied accusations of corruption and links to drug traffickers.
Hernandez's brother last year was sentenced by a U.S. judge to life in prison plus 30 years for drug trafficking.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Lawyer Michael Avenatti on Friday sought to undermine the credibility of porn star Stormy Daniels, the U.S. government's star witness against him at his fraud trial, by challenging her belief in paranormal activity and professed ability to speak with dead people.
In five hours of cross-examining his former client, Avenatti tried to undercut the government's claim that he had embezzled nearly $300,000 from Daniels, who he represented in lawsuits against former President Donald Trump.
Avenatti, 50, has pleaded not guilty to fraud and identity theft, and has portrayed his dispute with Daniels as a disagreement over legal fees. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 22 years in prison. 
Daniels had described herself in testimony as an actress, writer and director working on a documentary-style TV show, ""Spooky Babes,"" where she and others investigated paranormal activity.
""How do you speak with the dead?"" Avenatti asked Daniels on the fifth day of his trial.
""I don't know, it just happens sometimes,"" the 42-year-old answered, adding that she used ""cards"" and ""meditation"" and sometimes recorded the conversations.
Daniels also said she considered herself a ""medium"" who could communicate with nonliving spirits, and said ""yes"" when Avenatti asked if she had experienced ""poltergeist phenomenon.""
The exchanges came after Daniels testified on Thursday that Avenatti ""stole from me"" by diverting $300,000 from her book contract to an account of his own. 
Avenatti rose to fame in 2018 when Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, hired him to help her get out of a nondisclosure agreement with Trump. 
Daniels is known for receiving $130,000 in hush money from former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen to keep quiet before the 2016 election about sexual encounters she said she had with Trump. The former president has denied having sex with Daniels.
AVENATTI MAY TESTIFY
After jurors left the courtroom on Friday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Sobelman said the prosecution intended to rest its case on Monday, and Avenatti said he was ""strongly leaning in favor"" of testifying in his own defense.
Avenatti took over his defense on Tuesday from two federal public defenders, citing a ""breakdown"" in their relationship. Those lawyers remain on the case as ""standby"" counsel.
U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman, who presides over the case, said that should Avenatti decide to testify, he could write out questions for one of those lawyers to read. Avenatti said that would be his preferred approach.
It is risky for criminal defendants to testify in their own defense, because it exposes them to potentially aggressive cross-examination by prosecutors. 
Before Daniels testified on Friday, Furman rejected Avenatti's objection to prosecutors' alleged failure to turn over some evidence. 

Avenatti used the same objection to win a mistrial last August in California, where he faced separate fraud changes, but Furman said it had no bearing on the Daniels case. 
""This is a red herring, a distraction, smoke and mirrors,"" Furman said, also outside jurors' presence.

MIAMI (Reuters) - The U.S. Coast Guard on Friday said it has returned 40 people to Cuba after intercepting two vessels near Florida while two people were being investigated for human smuggling.
Increasing numbers of migrants are trying their luck at sea amid growing economic problems in Caribbean nations. 
The vessels were spotted near the Florida Keys on Sunday and on Tuesday. Two suspected smugglers were transferred to Homeland Security Investigations, a Coast Guard statement said. 
""People illegally entering the U.S. using smugglers put their lives in the hands of criminals,"" said Coast Guard Lieutenant Commander Mark Cobb. ""Migrant smugglers are ruthless criminals who only care about profit.""
U.S. sanctions and the COVID-19 pandemic, which has reduced international tourism, have hurt Cuba's economy. The Coast Guard said that its crews have interdicted 690 Cubans since Oct. 1, compared with 838 in the 12 months ending on Sept. 30.
Haitian boat migration is on the rise due to an economic downturn and a spike in gang-related kidnappings that have worsened since the July assassination of President Jovenel Moise.
The Coast Guard on Thursday said it had intercepted a sailing vessel carrying 191 Haitians. [L1N2U723B]
It also called off its search for 34 people who disappeared after a boat carrying 40 people capsized off Florida's coast. U.S. authorities have not released the nationalities of those on board.

Five bodies were recovered, and there was one survivor. Colombia's foreign ministry on Friday said it would assist that survivor, a citizen identified as Juan Montoya, who was transferred to a Miami hospital in the custody of immigration authorities. His sister, Maria Montoya, died in the accident.
The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Officers dressed in blue uniforms with white gloves carried the flag-draped coffin of Jason Rivera, 22, one of four New York City officers shot over the past week, into a funeral service held in Manhattan's iconic St. Patrick's Cathedral.
As his fellow officers consoled each other and wiped tears from their eyes, Rivera's widow, Dominique Luzuriaga, said she felt lost without him. 
""I couldn't believe you left me. Seeing you in a hospital bed wrapped in sheets, not hearing when I was talking to you, broke me,"" Luzuriaga said in a eulogy, her voice cracking. ""Although I gained thousands of blue brothers and sisters, I'm the loneliest without you.""
Rivera was shot along with officer Wilbert Mora, 27, after they and a third officer, a rookie, responded to a Jan. 21 disturbance https://www.reuters.com/world/us/two-new-york-city-police-officers-shot-harlem-are-critical-condition-2022-01-22 in Harlem in which a woman said she was having a fight with one of her sons. 
Shortly after arriving on the scene, Rivera and Mora were fired upon in a narrow hallway by the woman's adult son. The rookie officer then shot the suspect, LaShawn McNeil, 47. Both Mora and McNeil died of their injuries this week. 
Mayor Eric Adams told mourners at Rivera's funeral that the slain officer had helped make New Yorkers feel safe. 
""He can still hear us from a distance. He hears our voices, he hears our prayers, he hears our hopes,"" Adams said. ""We as a city, as a state and as a nation, we say thank you, Jason.""
Adams, a former police captain, is grappling with a spike in violent crime and police shootings, including a separate incident last week in which a 16-year-old was charged with shooting and wounding an officer in the Bronx. 

The suspect was released Thursday on a $250,000 bond, which Adams said was proof the city's public safety system needed reform. 
""New Yorkers should all be outraged that a repeat offender, accused of shooting at a police officer, is today walking free on bond because judges are precluded from even considering danger to the community,"" Adams said in a statement.

ROME (Reuters) -Italy moved closer on Friday to electing its first ever female president after five days of stalemate in repeated parliamentary ballots forced party leaders to seek a compromise solution.
Political sources said a likely candidate was Elisabetta Belloni, a career diplomat who heads the secret services, with Justice Minister Marta Cartabia also in the reckoning.
""I am working so that we have a smart, woman president,"" rightist League leader Matteo Salvini told reporters after meeting the heads of the two main centre-left parties, the Democratic Party (PD) and 5-Star Movement. 
""I hope that tomorrow we have closure,"" he added.
Giuseppe Conte, the 5-Star leader, said he also wanted a woman to replace outgoing head of state Sergio Mattarella, whose seven-year term ends next week.
""I am very happy that the other political forces are also showing that they want to agree on a high-level female profile,"" he wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
The president is a powerful figure in Italy, who gets to appoint prime ministers and is often called on to resolve political crises in the euro zone's third-largest economy, where governments survive barely a year on average.
Unlike in the United States or France, where presidents get elected in a popular vote, in Italy, some 1,009 parliamentarians and regional representatives chose the president in a secret ballot, which party leaders sometimes struggle to control.
Centre-right leaders from the League, Forza Italia and Brothers of Italy infuriated their opponents earlier on Friday when they ordered their lawmakers to vote for conservative Senate speaker Elisabetta Casellati in the day's first ballot rather than seek a consensus candidate.
The move proved an embarrassing flop, with Casellati securing just 382 ballots, far below the 505 required to win.
SPY PROBLEM
Stung by the defeat, Salvini immediately opened discussions with his opponents to find a non-partisan, female candidate.
While Belloni has many supporters, some parliamentarians have expressed deep reservations about promoting the head of intelligence to the president's Quirinale palace.
""You don't go from the secret service to the Quirinale. Those who don't understand this have no institutional culture,"" former prime minister Matteo Renzi said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), announcing that his small Italia Viva party would never vote for her.
The repeated failure to find any sort of consensus has poisoned the political atmosphere, with potentially dangerous consequences for the stability of the broad coalition backing Prime Minister Mario Draghi's government.
Draghi himself has made clear he would like the job of president, but the main parties have so far refused to put his name to a vote, partly out of fears that the abrupt switch of roles could cause the fragile government to implode.
Without a swift deal, there has been growing speculation that the parties might eventually ask Mattarella to accept a second mandate, even though he has so far ruled this out.

Two government members said on Thursday that his re-election was a strong possibility, seeing it as the best solution to guaranteeing political stability at a time when hundreds of Italians are still dying each day of COVID-19.
Tellingly, Mattarella easily topped Friday's second parliamentary ballot, drawing almost 340 votes even though none of the parties had called on their lawmakers to back him.

(Reuters) - The half-century-old bridge that collapsed in Pittsburgh on Friday ahead of President Joe Biden's visit highlighted the perilous state of much of the United States' transportation infrastructure, which is due to get a trillion-dollar infusion over the coming years. 
Like nearly 44,000 other spans nationwide, the Fern Hollow Bridge in Pittsburgh is rated in poor condition, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation's 2021 national inventory.
Ten people sustained minor injuries when the snow-covered span collapsed into a wooded gully around 6 a.m. (1100 GMT), authorities said. Several nearby homes were temporarily evacuated after a massive natural gas leak caused by the collapse, which was brought under control.
Built in 1970, the four-lane bridge carries an average of 14,500 vehicles per day along Forbes Avenue, one of the city's main arteries, according to Transportation Department data. 
It is one of 31 bridges in the city rated in poor condition. 
""We're going to fix them all,"" Biden said on a visit to the collapse site. 
Pittsburgh City Council member Corey O'Connor said the damage could have been worse. ""If it was rush hour, we would be looking at a couple hundred cars down in that valley,"" he told CNN. 
A ""poor"" rating does not necessarily mean a bridge is at risk of collapsing, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers, but it does mean they should be inspected regularly. The collapsed bridge was inspected last September, the city's fire chief told reporters.
Biden's $1 trillion infrastructure spending package, the largest such investment in decades, is already providing billions of dollars for upgrades to bridges, roads and transit.
REPAIR DOLLARS FLOW TO PENNSYLVANIA 
The Transportation Department announced earlier this month that it was distributing $5.3 billion to states for bridge repair, a dramatic increase over previous years.
Pennsylvania got the third-largest share, a total of $327 million. The state is a political battleground and played a key role in Biden's 2020 presidential victory. All 10 of the state's Democratic lawmakers in the Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives voted for the infrastructure package, and nine out of Pennsylvania's 10 Republicans voted against it.
The money will come in handy. 
Roughly 11% of the Northeastern state's 30,000 bridges are in poor condition, according to the national inventory, nearly twice the national average. Those bridges handle 5% of daily traffic in Pennsylvania.
The state's bridges were given a grade of D-plus by the civil engineering society in a 2018 report. Its roads and sewer, water, and transit systems also received low marks. 
The society said the state had made progress since approving a fuel-tax hike in 2013 to fund repairs. The group praised Pennsylvania's bridge-inspection program, which it said exceeded federal standards.
Pittsburgh, a hilly city of about 300,000 people located at the confluence of three major rivers, has 732 bridges within city limits, which Biden said was more than any other city in the world. Roughly 4% of them are in poor condition. 

City officials have pressed the Transportation Department to make it easier to lower speed limits and improve pedestrian safety.
Karina Ricks, the city's former transportation director, took a senior job last year with the Federal Transit Administration.

LONDON (Reuters) -An inquiry into COVID-19 lockdown-breaking gatherings in Downing Street that might determine the future of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson could be further delayed after the police asked for the report to make only ""minimal reference"" to those events.
Johnson, facing the gravest threat to his premiership over the alleged lockdown-busting parties at his residence and office at Number 10, has so far weathered growing calls to resign over the events, asking for lawmakers to wait for the report.
Led by senior civil servant Sue Gray, it is looking into several allegations that staff, and Johnson, attended parties in Downing Street in breach of the rules they had themselves imposed on the population to fight the coronavirus pandemic.
It had been expected to be released this week but that time scale was derailed when on Tuesday, London's Metropolitan Police said they had opened an investigation into some of the events to assess whether criminal offences had been committed.
The force has itself faced criticism for initially declining to investigate the allegations.
Officials are working on ways to publish Gray's report without compromising the criminal investigation, and some lawmakers fear that it will be watered down.
It could, some lawmakers say, also be delayed. 
The Metropolitan Police initially said it was wanted minimal reference to events it was investigating in Gray's report to ""avoid any prejudice to our investigation"", but changed its language in a later statement.
""In order to protect the integrity of the police investigation, as is appropriate in any case, and to be as fair as possible to those who are subject to it, the Met has asked for minimal reference to be made in the Cabinet Office report to the relevant events,"" Commander Catherine Roper said in a statement, referring to the department which supports the prime minister and helps implement his policies.
""This will only be necessary until these matters are concluded, and is to give detectives the most reliable picture of what happened at these events.""
The police said it had received information it had requested from the Cabinet Office to support its investigation, which would be prompt. 
""We have not delayed this report and the timing of its release is a matter for the Cabinet Office inquiry team,"" Roper said.
A spokesman for Johnson said the investigation's terms of reference stated that Gray and her team would keep in contact with the police.
""Again it's an independent investigation, we haven't been privy to the details of that investigation or any of its content,"" he told reporters.
KEY TO FUTURE
Gray's report, which she will deliver to Johnson before it is published and presented to parliament, is seen as crucial to his fate, and he and his ministers have said people should not reach any conclusions before its release.
She is looking into what has become weeks of a steady drip of stories about events in Downing Street, with reports of aides stuffing a suitcase full of supermarket alcohol, breaking a children's swing and dancing until the early hours.
Johnson's spokesman has said the prime minister does not believe he broke the law and that Downing Street wants the report to be published as soon as possible.
But officials say the police investigation has complicated the report's publication because they have to determine what can be left in it and what elements need to be removed. The risk, lawmakers say, is that the most damaging conclusions could be removed. 
""From the Met statement, it's clear that the most serious allegations will not be available for parliament to view and could possibly delay the report further,"" said Andrew Bridgen, a Conservative lawmaker who has called for Johnson to resign.
""This does nothing to diminish my view that the prime minister's position is untenable,"" he told Reuters. 
Opposition politicians have also demanded that Johnson resign and accuse him of persistently lying.
The Scottish National Party's leader in parliament, Ian Blackford, said the Gray report must be published in full without any more delay.
""People are understandably concerned that this increasingly looks like a cover-up,"" he said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).

""The prime minister cannot be allowed to wriggle off the hook by using the Metropolitan Police investigation as an excuse to further delay or doctor the report.""
But the delay has given space to efforts by Johnson and his supporters to persuade colleagues not to try to trigger a confidence vote in him. Some lawmakers have said they would wait until the report before moving against him.

French RMC radio said later that a mission including French DGSI secret service agents and an investigating magistrate would travel to Saudi Arabia, where the rally was held, as soon as Saturday for several days, citing sources close to the probe.
""They will be welcomed by the Saudi authorities before a first briefing on Sunday"", RMC said.
French anti-terrorism prosecutors opened a preliminary investigation earlier this month into an explosion under a support vehicle at the rally at the end of December, in which French race driver Philippe Boutron was seriously injured.
They have also heard from witnesses about a second incident in which a support truck, belonging to the team of Franco-Italian rally competitor Camelia Liparoti, caught fire, the source confirmed to Reuters. 
French radio RMC said the driver heard a ""boom"" before the fire broke out.
""A mission is planned for very soon,"" the source said, adding that, contrary to what has been said in some French media, ""the Saudis have never been resistant"" to cooperating.
The source said there had been no urgency for French investigators to go on the ground because they started their probe by hearing French witnesses as they came back from Saudi Arabia.
This phase of the probe is now over, the source said.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has said ""there were hypotheses"" that the incident, in which Boutron was injured, ""was a terrorist attack"".
But Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry said on Jan. 8 that an initial investigation into the first blast had not raised any criminal suspicions.
The source said that at this stage, Saudi Arabia's stance has not changed.
Some of the witnesses debriefed upon return to France mentioned the second incident, the source said, without adding any details. The origin of the fire is unclear, Liparoti herself said on Instagram at the start of January.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden family finally has a cat.
First lady Jill Biden's office has announced America's first family is excited to welcome a two-year-old, gray-and-white-striped feline named Willow to the White House.
Biden, a community college professor, named the cat after her hometown of Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, the first lady's spokesperson Michael LaRosa said.
""A farm cat from Pennsylvania, Willow made quite an impression on Dr. Biden in 2020 when she jumped up on the stage and interrupted her remarks during a campaign stop,"" LaRosa said. ""Seeing their immediate bond, the owner of the farm knew that Willow belonged with Dr. Biden.""
Dr. Biden had said in April that the family had a female cat ""waiting in the wings.""

ATLANTA (Reuters) - The family of Ahmaud Arbery, a Black jogger who was chased by three white men in pickup trucks and gunned down in south Georgia in 2020, says that the men's federal hate crimes trial will do what the state court did not - reckon with race.
The three men - a father and son and their neighbor - were convicted last November in a Brunswick (NYSE:BC), Georgia state court of murdering Arbery, 25, and sentenced to life in prison.
""That's not enough,"" said Arbery's father, Marcus Arbery, who believes issues of race raised in the new trial may have an impact beyond the courtroom. 
""My son isn't coming back,"" but ""maybe it'll save another Black son,"" he said.
Civil rights activists say the new trial, which begins on Feb. 7, is a key moment in the country's reckoning with racial injustice. Arbery's murder was another example of deadly violence being used against a Black man, they say.
Gregory McMichael, 66, a former police officer, his son Travis McMichael, 36, and William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52, are each charged with interference with rights, a hate crime which carries a maximum of life in prison. All are also charged with attempted kidnapping, and the McMichaels face gun violations.
All three have pleaded not guilty to all charges. Their attorneys have declined to comment to Reuters.
Carol Anderson, an Emory University professor of African American studies who has watched the case closely, said the trial was ""absolutely necessary"" even though the men had already been convicted of murder.
""We must be clear, it was his blackness that put him in the crosshairs of these men,"" Anderson said. ""And that makes this a hate crime. This is part of the truth telling that society must have.""
The McMichaels and Bryan told police they thought Arbery was a burglar and that they tried to detain him as he ran through their mostly white Satilla Shores neighborhood. Arbery was shot after a five-minute chase by the men in their trucks. The McMichaels claimed Arbery grappled with the shotgun leveled by Travis McMichael, who fired the weapon.
In the six-week state trial, the prosecution largely avoided race. Prosecutor Linda Dunikoski mentioned it once in her closing arguments. The men attacked Arbery “because he was a Black man running down the street,” she said.
Dunikoski has not commented publicly on why she avoided race. In pre-trial hearings state prosecutors had reserved the option to introduce evidence of racial animus, including Travis McMichael's vanity license plate featuring the flag flown by the southern pro-slavery Confederacy during the 1861-1865 Civil War. Today it is viewed by some as a symbol of white supremacism and by others a reminder of their Southern heritage.
In an arraignment hearing in 2020, Special Agent Richard Dial of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said Bryan told his office that Travis McMichael uttered a racial slur as Arbery lay dying.
Dial also told the court that he had evidence from social media and elsewhere that Travis McMichael had used racial slurs in the past.

It is not clear whether the vanity plate or Dial's evidence will be featured in the new trial. 
In recent closed-door pre-trial hearings, defense attorneys have argued over what evidence can and cannot be presented to the jury. Court documents on the pleadings have been sealed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden has tapped a team of White House advisers with lengthy Supreme Court and Senate confirmation experience as he prepares to nominate the first Black woman to be an associate justice.
Biden will consult closely with Vice President Kamala Harris in a selection process that will be led in part by chief of staff Ron Klain, White House counsel Dana Remus, senior counsel Paige Herwig, and senior adviser Cedric Richmond, the White House said.
The team will need to guide Biden's choice through what could be a bruising confirmation process from Republicans who hold 50 seats in the Senate, while tending to Democratic groups, from lawmakers to advocates, that have a stake in his decision.
Biden is expected to work from a list of about 10 or fewer people to pick a nominee. The White House may begin reaching out to and potentially meeting with possible Supreme Court picks as soon as next week.
On Thursday, Biden said he planned to nominate a Black woman to the post, a historic first https://www.reuters.com/world/us/retiring-us-justice-breyer-appear-with-biden-white-house-2022-01-27 that he called ""long overdue"".
Activists had urged outgoing Justice Stephen Breyer, 83, to retire to ensure Biden gets an unfettered Supreme Court pick while Democrats control the Senate. 
""We don't want to take our time with this,"" said Brian Fallon, executive director of advocacy group Demand Justice, welcoming a speedy process. Breyer has ""given us a bit of a gift"" with his early-in-the-year announcement, allowing the process to get started now and avoid hurdles, such as a senator catching COVID-19, that could derail it later.
November's midterm elections could give control of the Senate to Republicans, making it more difficult for any Biden nominee to win the simple majority vote necessary for the lifetime Supreme Court seat. 
RBG, ALITO 
Klain, who worked for Biden when he served on the U.S. Senate's judiciary committee, has a long background in Supreme Court nominations. He served as a ""sherpa,"" or guide through the confirmation process for former Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died in 2020. Both she and Breyer were selected by former President Bill Clinton.
Remus was a clerk under Associate Justice Samuel Alito and Herwig has overseen a flurry of judicial nominations and confirmations since Biden came into office, resulting in https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/safelinks/1/atp-safelinks.html the most of any president in his first year since Ronald Reagan.
Biden himself chaired the Senate judicial committee from 1987 to 1995.
""It is hard to find a more tested team than the one President Biden has to work on the Supreme Court nomination,"" said Anita Dunn, a former senior adviser to Biden. The president is likely to spend a huge amount of his personal time reading decisions and opinions by the judicial candidates, she said. 
Names expected to be on Biden's list include Ketanji Brown Jackson https://www.reuters.com/world/us/former-public-defender-jackson-among-possible-biden-supreme-court-picks-2022-01-26, a federal judge; Leondra Kruger https://www.reuters.com/world/us/potential-biden-supreme-court-pick-leondra-kruger-known-moderate-california-2022-01-26, a justice on the California Supreme Court; and Sherrilyn Ifill https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/historic-first-black-women-judges-who-could-join-us-supreme-court-2022-01-27, a prominent civil rights lawyer who heads the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. 
REPUBLICANS ON BOARD? 
White House officials have not yet chosen a ""sherpa"" to shepherd a nominee through get-to-know-you meetings at the Capitol, and have not ruled out picking a Republican, one source familiar with the situation said.
The White House believes Harris does have the authority to break a tie vote on a Supreme Court pick in a Senate split evenly between Democrats and Republicans, but thinks it can get some Republicans to back Biden's choice and make a tie-breaker unnecessary, the source said.
Democratic Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer has pledged https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-democrats-plan-move-swiftly-biden-supreme-court-pick-2022-01-26 to make the confirmation process as short as a month. Biden said he intended to announce his nominee before the end of February.
The White House sees no need to follow Schumer's 30-day push for a confirmation, particularly since Breyer will remain on the bench until June, the source familiar with the process said. 

The White House may need the extra time. Biden's team will need to look at candidates' qualifications, conclude vetting procedures, appease senators pushing for candidates from their home states, and meet with civil rights groups and other parties with an interest in the nominee.
""Managing all of that is a pretty significant effort,"" he said Andy Wright, a former member of Biden's transition team who is now a partner at K&L Gates.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Scientists have detected what appears to be an incredibly dense star behaving unlike anything else ever seen - and suspect it might be a type of exotic astrophysical object whose existence has until now been only hypothesized.
The object, spotted using the Murchison Widefield Array telescope in outback Western Australia, unleashed huge bursts of energy roughly three times per hour when viewed from Earth during two months in 2018, the researchers said. 
It may be the first known example of what is called an ""ultra-long period magnetar,"" they said. This is a variety of a neutron star - the compact collapsed core of a massive star that exploded as a supernova - that is highly magnetized and rotates relatively slowly, as opposed to fast-spinning neutron star objects called pulsars that appear from Earth to be blinking on and off within milliseconds or seconds. 
""It's mind-bogglingly wonderful that the universe is still full of surprises,"" said radio astronomer Natasha Hurley-Walker at the Curtin University node of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) in Australia, lead author of the study published this week in the journal Nature.
The object may be continuously beaming strong radio waves from its north and south poles. As that beam swept through the line of sight from Earth's vantage point, it appeared to switch on every 18 minutes and 11 seconds for about 30 to 60 seconds, then off again. That is an effect similar to a lighthouse with a rotating light that seems to blink on and off from the perspective of a stationary observer.
It was found in a broader research effort mapping celestial sources of radio waves. 
""This is an entirely new kind of source that no one has ever seen before,"" Hurley-Walker said. ""And while we know the Milky Way must be full of slowly spinning neutron stars, no one expected them to be able to produce bright radio emission like this. It's a dream come true to find something so totally unexpected and amazing."" 
It is located relatively close to Earth in cosmic terms, roughly 4,200 light years - the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km) - away.
""It's incredibly bright when it's 'on.' It's one of the brightest radio sources in the sky,"" said study co-author Tyrone O'Doherty, a Curtin ICRAR node doctoral student who found the object.
It fits into a category called ""transients"" - astrophysical objects that appear to turn on for limited amounts of time. ""Slow transients"" like a supernova can suddenly appear then disappear a few months later as the stellar explosion dissipates. Pulsars are ""fast transients,"" rapidly blinking on and off. Transients between these two extremes had remained elusive until now.
    Neutron stars including pulsars are among the universe's densest objects. They are roughly 7.5 miles (12 km) in diameter - akin to the size of a city - but with more mass than our sun. A neutron star with an extreme magnetic field, a magnetar, could potentially power the radio pulsations, the researchers said. 
As for why its rotation is so slow, it could be that it is very old and has slowed over time, according to Curtin ICRAR node astrophysicist and study co-author Gemma Anderson.
""This is more likely to be the 'first of its kind' rather than 'one of a kind,"" Anderson said.
It also perhaps could be another type of dead star called a white dwarf or something completely unknown, Hurley-Walker said.

The researchers have not detected it since 2018.
""We are now monitoring this object using many different radio telescopes in the hope it switches 'on' again,"" Anderson said.

The United States, the European Union and Britain have repeatedly warned Putin against attacking Ukraine after Russia deployed around 100,000 troops near the border with its former Soviet neighbour.
Russian officials say the West is gripped by Russophobia and has no right to lecture Moscow on how to act after it expanded the NATO military alliance eastwards after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union and sowed chaos in Iraq and Syria. 
Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), a part of the GCHQ eavesdropping intelligence agency, warned large organisations to bolster their cyber security resilience amid the deepening tensions over Ukraine. 
Western leaders say the 21st Century will be defined by a struggle between democracies and rivals such as China and Russia who they say are challenging the post-Cold War consensus militarily, technologically and economically.
""Over several years, we have observed a pattern of malicious Russian behaviour in cyberspace,"" said Paul Chichester, NCSC director of operations.
A cyber attack on Ukraine earlier this month warned Ukrainians to ""be afraid and expect the worst"". Ukraine said Moscow was behind the attack. 
""Incidents in Ukraine bear the hallmarks of similar Russian activity we have observed before,"" said Chichester.
The world's top cyber offensive powers are the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia and China, according to a 2020 ranking by the Belfer Center at Harvard's Kennedy School. 

Britain's spymasters say Russia remains the biggest immediate threat to the West but Communist China's long-term dominance of technology poses a much bigger problem. 
""UK organisations are being urged to bolster their cyber security resilience in response to the malicious cyber incidents in and around Ukraine,"" Britain's National Cyber Security Centre said.

(Reuters) -A federal judge invalidated the results of an oil and gas lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday saying the Biden administration failed to properly account for the auction's climate change impact.
The decision has cast uncertainty over the future of the U.S. federal offshore drilling program, which has been a big source of public revenue for decades but also drawn the ire of activists concerned about its impact on the environment and contribution to global warming. 
The Gulf of Mexico accounts for 15% of existing U.S. oil production and 5% of dry natural gas output, according to the Energy Information Administration. 
In the decision, Judge Rudolph Contreras of the United States District Court of the District of Columbia ruled to vacate the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's Lease Sale 257, which offered about 80 million offshore acres (37.4 million hectares) in the Gulf of Mexico in an auction last November. 
The sale generated more than $190 million, the highest since 2019, on 1.7 million acres sold. It drew bids from U.S. oil majors including  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX)
Thursday's decision came after the environmental group Earthjustice challenged the sale on behalf of four other green groups, arguing U.S. President Joe Biden's Interior Department was relying on a years-old environmental analysis that did not accurately consider greenhouse gas emissions that would result from development of the blocks.
Contreras agreed, faulting the administration for excluding foreign consumption from its greenhouse gas emissions analysis and for ignoring the latest science about the role of oil and gas development on global warming.
The Interior Department, which oversees federal oil and gas development, said it was reviewing the decision.
CAMPAIGN PLEDGE
Biden campaigned for the White House partially on a pledge to end federal oil and gas drilling to fight climate change, but efforts to suspend new auctions failed after Gulf Coast states sued.
""We have documented serious deficiencies in the federal oil and gas program,"" Interior spokesperson Melissa Schwartz said in a statement. ""Especially in the face of the climate crisis, we need to take the time to make significant and long overdue programmatic reforms."" 
Congress has mandated that the United States hold regular auctions of public lands for oil and gas development.
""We are pleased that the court invalidated Interior’s illegal lease sale,"" said Brettny Hardy, Earthjustice’s senior attorney, in a statement. ""We simply cannot continue to make investments in the fossil fuel industry to the peril of our communities and increasingly warming planet.""
It was unclear how the ruling would affect the administration's plans to offer more than 300,000 acres of onshore leases to drillers by the end of this quarter. Like the Gulf sale, those auctions were initiated after a federal judge in June ordered the government to resume oil and gas leasing. 
The offshore drilling industry slammed the decision.
""Uncertainty around the future of the U.S. federal offshore leasing program may only strengthen the geopolitical influence of higher emitting - and adversarial - nations, such as Russia,"" National Ocean Industries Association President Erik Milito said in reaction to the ruling. 

Scott Lauermann, a spokesman for oil industry lobby group the American Petroleum Institute (API), said the API was ""reviewing the decision and ""considering our options.""
The decision is not the first time a court has cited faulty environmental analyses in blocking oil and gas development on federal lands. In August, a federal judge reversed the government's approval of a $6 billion ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) development in Alaska, a decision that was cited in Contreras' ruling.

MIAMI (Reuters) -The U.S. Coast Guard on Thursday called off a three-day search for 34 people lost at sea off Florida from a boat that capsized while engaged in what officials suspect was an attempt to smuggle migrants into the United States from the Bahamas.
Round-the-clock search operations were halted at nightfall, Coast Guard Petty Officer Jose Hernandez said, hours after U.S. authorities reported recovering four more bodies, bringing the tally of confirmed fatalities to five.
A lone survivor was rescued on Tuesday morning after a tug boat crew found him clinging to the mostly submerged hull of the overturned boat. He said none of the 40 people aboard had been wearing life jackets.
Since then, a small armada of Coast Guard and Navy vessels and aircraft have crisscrossed at least 1,500 square miles of open sea off Florida's Atlantic coast, an area about the size of Rhode Island.
Captain Jo-Ann Burdian, commander of the Coast Guard's Miami sector, said earlier on Thursday that the quest for more victims would be ""suspended"" at sunset ""if we don't receive additional specific information to help redirect our search.""
Asked if the remaining 34 missing migrants should be presumed dead, Burdian said: ""It does mean that we don't think it's likely that anyone else has survived.""
The survivor told authorities the ill-fated vessel left the Bahamas' Bimini islands, about 50 miles (80 km) east of Miami, on Saturday night, and capsized the next morning in rough seas. He was picked up about 45 miles (72 km) east of Fort Pierce Inlet, off Florida's Atlantic coast, about midway between Miami and Cape Canaveral. 
The Coast Guard and U.S. Homeland Security Department officials have said the vessel was involved in a human smuggling attempt, but the nationalities of those on board have not been disclosed.
Anthony Salisbury, the agent in charge of the Homeland Security Investigations office in Miami, said it had opened a criminal inquiry seeking to prosecute anyone who organized or profited from the venture. 
In a separate incident, the Coast Guard reported intercepting a sailing vessel on Tuesday off another area of the Bahamas overloaded with 191 Haitian migrants believed to be headed for Florida.
The Coast Guard said 189 people on that boat were turned over to Haitian authorities on Thursday. A mother and her child were transferred ashore to Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital, for medical treatment on Tuesday, the day the boat was interdicted, the Coast Guard said.

Voyages of vessels carrying Haitian migrants have grown more frequent as the Caribbean island nation faces worsening economic and political crises, as well as gang-related kidnappings.
The two incidents underscored a surge in migrants seeking passage to Florida in flimsy vessels through the Caribbean by way of the Bahamas, a known hub for seaborne human smuggling.

SEOUL (Reuters) - This January has been one of the busiest months ever for North Korea's missile testing, with launches displaying a dizzying array of weapon types, launch locations, and increasing sophistication.
From hypersonic missiles and long-range cruise missiles to missiles launched from railcars and airports, the tests highlight the nuclear-armed state's rapidly expanding and advancing arsenal https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-capability-analys-idUSKCN1SG0CR amid stalled denuclearisation talks.
North Korea hasn't tested its longest-range intercontinental ballistic missiles or nuclear weapons since 2017, but leader Kim Jong Un has pushed for more ""military muscle"" https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkorea-says-leader-kim-attended-successful-hypersonic-missile-test-2022-01-11 to counter what he sees as threats from the United States and its allies in Asia.
Kim visited an unidentified ""important"" munitions factory, state media said this week, underscoring his vow not only to improve capabilities, but mass produce and deploy more weapons.
Here are the different types of weapons tested so far this month: 
'HYPERSONIC' MISSILES
North Korea said it tested a new type of ""hypersonic missile"" https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkorea-tests-hypersonic-missiles-global-race-new-rockets-2022-01-11 on Jan. 5 and again on Jan. 11, with Kim Jong Un reported to have attended the second launch. https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkorea-says-leader-kim-attended-successful-hypersonic-missile-test-2022-01-11
Hypersonic weapons usually fly towards targets at lower altitudes than ballistic missiles and can achieve more than five times the speed of sound - or about 6,200 kms per hour (3,850 mph). 
Despite their name, analysts say the main feature of hypersonic weapons is not speed but their manoeuvrability, which can help them evade missile defence systems.
South Korean officials questioned https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/skorea-casts-doubts-north-koreas-hypersonic-missile-claims-2022-01-07 the capabilities of the missile after the first test, saying it did not appear to demonstrate the range and manoeuvrability claimed in a state media report and featured a Manoeuvrable Reentry Vehicle (MaRV) rather than the type of next-generation hypersonic glide vehicle developed by countries like China and Russia. Those officials later said the second test appeared to demonstrate greater performance.
Analysts said if Pyongyang can perfect such weapons, it would represent a potential major upgrade https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkoreas-hypersonic-missile-tests-raise-military-stakes-asia-2022-01-14 in its striking power against its nearby adversaries, complicating efforts by the United States and its Asian allies to counter that. 
KN-23 SRBM
On Jan. 14 North Korea launched a pair of short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) from a train https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-used-railway-born-missile-fridays-test-kcna-2022-01-14 near the northern border with China, in what state media said was a short-notice drill aimed at boosting the proficiency of the troops operating the missiles.
North Korea first tested https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkorea-launches-were-test-new-railway-borne-missile-system-kcna-2021-09-15 the rail-based system in September, saying it was designed as a potential counter-strike to any threatening forces.
Despite the country's limited and sometimes unreliable rail network, rail mobile missiles are a relatively cheap and efficient option to improve the survivability of their nuclear forces, making it difficult for enemies to detect and destroy them before being fired, according to analysts.
The missiles appeared to be KN-23 SRBMs, which were first tested in May 2019, and are designed to evade missile defences by flying on a lower, ""depressed"" trajectory, experts said.
North Korea fired another pair of KN-23 missiles on Thursday, this time from a wheeled launching vehicle.
The tests confirmed the ""explosive power"" of its conventional warhead, state media said, while analysts noted it travelled on its lowest trajectory yet.
KN-24 SRBM
North Korea launched two short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) in a rare test https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkorea-tested-tactical-guided-missiles-monday-kcna-2022-01-17 from an airport in its capital, Pyongyang, on Jan. 17.
The pair of missiles ""precisely hit an island target"" off the east coast, according to state media.
Analysts said the missiles appeared to be KN-24 SRBMs which were last tested in March 2020 and appear to have entered mass production and deployment with military units. 
The KN-24 resembles the U.S. MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and, like the KN-23, is designed to evade missile defences and carry out precision strikes on a flatter trajectory than traditional ballistic missiles.
LONG-RANGE CRUISE MISSILE
State media reported two long-range cruise missiles were fired on Tuesday, travelling 1,800 km before hitting a target island in the sea off North Korea's east coast.
The cruise missile would play a role in ""boosting the war deterrence of the country,"" state news agency KCNA said.
In September, North Korea tested a new ""strategic"" https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkorea-test-fires-long-range-cruise-missile-kcna-2021-09-12 cruise missile for the first time, seen as possibly the country's first such weapon with a nuclear capability.

Analysts said the latest cruise missile appeared to be similar, but also showed signs of being a possible variant.
North Korea's cruise missiles usually generate less interest than ballistic missiles because they are not explicitly banned under U.N. Security Council Resolutions, but analysts say land-attack cruise missiles can be no less a threat than ballistic missiles.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Adult film actress Stormy Daniels told jurors at her former lawyer Michael Avenatti's criminal fraud trial on Thursday that he ""stole from me and lied to me"" by diverting proceeds from a book she wrote. 
Testifying as a prosecution witness, Daniels said in Manhattan federal court that Avenatti - whom she had retained to help her escape a non-disclosure agreement with then-U.S. President Donald Trump - told her he would ""never take a penny"" from the 2018 memoir, titled ""Full Disclosure."" 
But Avenatti embezzled nearly $300,000 of proceeds intended for Daniels, prosecutors have said, in part by forging her signature on instructions to the publisher about where to send the funds. Daniels, 42, said Avenatti never told her about the account. 
""I felt very betrayed and stupid,"" Daniels said. ""Michael had been lying and stealing from me."" 
Avenatti, 50, has pleaded not guilty to wire fraud and identity theft. He has portrayed the dispute as a disagreement over legal fees that has no place in criminal court. 
Avenatti's work for Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, helped propel him to fame in 2018, before a slew of criminal charges the following year ended his law practice.
Daniels is known for receiving $130,000 of hush money from Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to keep quiet before the 2016 presidential election about a sexual liaison she claimed to have once had with Trump, which Trump denies. 
Avenatti, a brash lawyer who is representing himself, cross-examined Daniels for about 10 minutes on Thursday before the jury was dismissed for the day. Cross-examination was expected to resume on Friday.
Daniels described herself as a writer, director and actress now producing a television show that investigates paranormal activity titled ""Spooky Babes."" She wore a maroon cardigan sweater over a black dress.
Avenatti briefly asked Daniels about her claims she ""has the ability to see and speak to dead people"" on Thursday. He is expected to use Daniels' interest in ghosts to portray her testimony as unreliable. 
""You've also claimed that you have the ability to speak to a haunted doll named Susan?"" Avenatti said. 
""Susan speaks to everyone on the show. She's a character on 'Spooky Babes,'"" Daniels replied. ""She has her own Instagram."" 
'HE LIED TO ME ALMOST EVERY DAY'
Prosecutors displayed dozens of text messages between Avenatti and Daniels after a third advance payment under her book contract was due in October 2018.
In response to messages asking why she had not received the money, Avenatti said he would send the publishing company a letter demanding that it pay Daniels. 
In February 2019, after Daniels learned the company had paid Avenatti, she sent him a screenshot of the payment records, the documents showed. 
""They had sent my payment on time, no question, and he lied to me almost every day for five months,"" she testified.

Avenatti was hit with dozens of criminal charges in March and April 2019 for allegedly cheating Daniels, defrauding several other clients and trying to extort up to $25 million from  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE), among other charges. 
He is appealing his conviction and 2-1/2-year prison sentence in the Nike case. A trial over the other alleged client frauds, in which Avenatti also represented himself, ended in a mistrial. The remaining charges have yet to be tried.

BEIJING (Reuters) - The Beijing Winter Olympics kick off in a week, putting sports at centre-stage following preparations that have been clouded by diplomatic boycotts and the COVID-19 pandemic that has forced the Games into a tightly sealed bubble.
Beijing will become the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Games, and some venues from 2008 will be re-used, including the Bird's Nest stadium, where the opening ceremony will again be overseen by famed Chinese director Zhang Yimou.
Almost everything else is different.
Where the 2008 Summer Games dazzled in what was a rising China's arrival on the world stage, the Winter Olympics will be staged by a country that has grown far wealthier, more powerful and, under President Xi Jinping, more authoritarian and increasingly at odds with the West.
In the COVID-19 era, China has isolated itself with a zero-tolerance policy, cancelling nearly all international flights, meaning Olympic athletes and others must fly directly into a Games bubble on charters. 
As in 2008, the Olympics have again cast a spotlight on China's human rights record, which critics say has worsened since then, leading Washington to call Beijing's treatment of Uyghur Muslims genocide and prompting a diplomatic boycott from the United States and other countries.
China rejects allegations of abuse and has repeatedly lashed out against the politicisation of the Games.
""The 2008 Olympics were a powerful source of soft power for China as it aspired toward global influence. In the past year, China's reputation has dipped significantly in the western world,"" said Rana Mitter, a professor of Chinese history and politics at Oxford University.
""The Chinese Communist Party will be hoping that the Winter Olympics 2022 can do something to reverse this position.""
However, the Games are set to kick off amid rising geopolitical tension, with troops mounted at the Ukraine border by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is expected to be in Beijing, as is U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.
A DIFFERENT TIME
On the streets of Beijing, the summer carnival buzz of 2008 has been replaced by resignation over restrictions imposed to head off the spread of COVID-19 from recent small clusters, including the more transmissable Omicron variant.
There is also disappointment among would-be spectators unable to buy tickets because none will be sold to the public. Instead, events will be attended by what are expected to be sparse, curated crowds subject to strict COVID-19 controls.
The Games will take place inside a ""closed loop"" that is much tighter than at last summer's Tokyo Games and will be tested by Omicron, which is running rampant in many western countries that are winter sports powers.
Some delegations, worried about information security, have warned members to bring burner phones.
Athletes and rights groups have also warned about risks of speaking out on politically sensitive topics while in China.
The scandal involving Chinese tennis star and former Olympian Peng Shuai, who accused a retired senior politician of sexually assaulting her and then disappeared for several weeks, added fuel to criticism of China's hosting of the event.
While Peng later said her social media post was misunderstood, the Women's Tennis Association, concerned for her well-being, suspended tournaments in China.
One U.S. Olympian told Reuters that she would not be speaking out on human rights because she believed doing so would put her safety at risk. 
""I think China has shown - with Peng Shuai most recently - that they are willing to go to really extreme measures to silence any sort of rhetoric that they find displeasing,"" she said, declining to be named given the sensitivity of the matter.
A Chinese official said recently that behaviour by athletes that violates the Olympic spirit or Chinese rules could be subject to punishment, although the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has made it clear that athletes are free to express their opinions in press conferences and interviews within the bubble, but not in competition or medal ceremonies.
SAFE CHOICE
Beijing was awarded the right in 2015 to host the 2022 Winter Games after several bid candidates dropped out, including favourite Oslo, leaving just the Chinese capital and Almaty, Kazakhstan. Despite little winter sports tradition and even less snow, the IOC selected Beijing as the safe choice.
China rewarded that confidence with efficient preparation despite concerns about the environmental impact of massive snowmaking. It has delivered on cleaning Beijing's notoriously smog-prone skies and planted vast numbers of trees.

Unlike Tokyo's Summer Games, delayed a year by COVID-19, there has never been much doubt that the Beijing Games would take place - no matter what.
""I feel like the 2008 Olympic Games was very grand, it was a spectacular show to the world,"" said Ye Wenxiaoyu, a 20-year-old Games volunteer. ""This year's Winter Olympics will be very simple and very low-carbon - but of course, this will not affect how wonderful it will be.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A study by the RAND Corporation think-tank released on Thursday faulted the U.S. military for ""considerable weaknesses"" and inconsistencies in its review of allegations of civilian casualties, and the Pentagon announced a broad review.
The U.S. military is under intense scrutiny over its procedures to guard against civilian casualties following a high-profile, mistaken drone strike in Kabul on Aug. 29 that killed 10 civilians, including seven children. 
Not only did the U.S. military botch the targeting but, in the strike's initial aftermath, the Pentagon's assessment concluded that it killed Islamic State militants preparing a bombing attack against U.S. troops.
The independent RAND study, which was required by congressional legislation, concluded systemic weaknesses at the Department of Defense (DoD) were causing it to fall short of its duties on civilian casualties.
""DoD is not adequately organized, trained, or equipped to fulfill its current responsibilities for addressing civilian harm,"" the report concluded.
In conflicts, the U.S. military often has limited access to targeted areas before or after strikes, relying on intelligence gathered remotely from sources like drone surveillance and satellite imagery. 
RAND found the U.S. military sometimes compounds this problem by failing to adequately talk to people from outside the U.S. government or armed forces who might have access to information on the ground. 
However, a 2018 Joint Staff review found that 58% of civilian casualties identified between 2015 and 2017 came from external sources, RAND said.
""We found that DoD's current approach to assessing, investigating, and responding to civilian harm has considerable weaknesses in key areas and is inconsistent across theaters,"" the report found. 
The report also noted that investigating civilian casualties often falls to junior personnel ""who do not receive formal training."" 
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin issued a memorandum on Thursday asking for the creation of a plan on civilian harm ""mitigation and response"" in the coming months and the creation of civilian protection center of excellence later this year.
A senior U.S. defense official, briefing reporters on Austin's decision, said incorporating information from sources outside the U.S. government and U.S. military would be key to the reforms.

""We tend to rely heavily on what is in our own data findings, and I think we need to build a system and also an expectation that other sources of information ... are built into this and have credibility,"" the official said.
""That's not something that we do consistently well, and that's something that we intend to change.""

MOSCOW/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russia said on Thursday it was clear the United States was not willing to address its main security concerns in their standoff over Ukraine, but both sides kept the door open to further dialogue.
The United States and NATO submitted written responses on Wednesday to Russia's demands for a redrawing of post-Cold War security arrangements in Europe since it massed troops near Ukraine, prompting Western fears of an invasion and new U.S. pledges of defense support.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow needed time for review and would not rush to conclusions, but that U.S. and NATO statements describing Russia's main demands as unacceptable did not leave much room for optimism. 
""Based on what our (U.S. and NATO) colleagues said yesterday, it's absolutely clear that on the main categories outlined in those draft documents ... we cannot say that our thoughts have been taken into account or that a willingness has been shown to take our concerns into account,"" Peskov said. ""But we won't rush with our assessments.""
The nuanced Kremlin reaction showed Russia was not rejecting the U.S. and NATO responses out of hand or closing the door to diplomacy. Washington says it and its allies hope Russia will study their responses and come back to the negotiating table. 
""We are unified, unified in our preference for diplomacy. But we are also unified in our resolve that if Moscow rejects our offer of dialogue, the costs must be swift and severe,"" U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland told reporters.
Russia's foreign ministry said the best way to reduce tensions was for NATO to remove forces from eastern Europe, but also sought to quash fears of an invasion. U.S. officials say President Vladimir Putin has not yet decided whether to invade.
""We have already repeatedly stated that our country does not intend to attack anyone,"" said Alexei Zaitsev, a Russian foreign ministry spokesman. ""We consider even the thought of a war between our people to be unacceptable.""
FRAGILE DIPLOMACY
With weeks of careful dialogue yet to reach a breakthrough, U.S. President Joe Biden repeated in a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that Washington and its allies stand ready to respond decisively if Russia invades the former Soviet state, the White House said. 
Biden said the U.S. ""is exploring additional macroeconomic support to help Ukraine's economy amidst pressure resulting from Russia's military build-up,"" the White House said in a statement. Zelenskiy wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that they agreed on ""joint actions for the future"" and discussed possibilities for financial support. A group of U.S. senators have been meeting to draft legislation that would increase defense aid to Kyiv. 
Russia's security demands, presented in December, include an end to further NATO enlargement, barring Ukraine from ever joining and pulling back the alliance's forces and weaponry from eastern European countries that joined after the Cold War.
The U.S. and NATO responses were not made public, but both had already rejected those demands while expressing willingness to engage on issues such as arms control, confidence-building measures and limits on the size and scope of military exercises.
China told the United States it wants all parties involved in Ukraine to remain calm ""and refrain from doing things that agitate tensions and hype up the crisis.""
Washington had its own message https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/uss-blinken-holds-talks-with-chinas-wang-ukraine-situation-2022-01-27 for Beijing, Nuland said.
""We are calling on Beijing to use its influence with Moscow to urge diplomacy, because if there is a conflict in the Ukraine it is not going to be good for China either,"" she said.
With China-Russia relations possibly at their warmest in history, Washington cannot expect Chinese backing for its position in the standoff, policy experts said.
Western countries have warned of economic sanctions on Russia if it invades Ukraine, building on measures imposed since 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea and Russian-backed separatists began fighting the Kyiv government's forces in eastern Ukraine.
But there are differences between the United States and its European Union allies, who rely on Russia for around a third of its gas supplies. Washington is consulting with Germany to ensure a divisive Russia-Germany pipeline project does not go ahead if Russia invades Ukraine. 
""(We) continue to have very strong and clear conversations with our German allies, and I want to be clear with you today, if Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another Nord Stream 2 https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-nordstream-idUKKBN2JY1SF?enowpopup will not move forward,"" Nuland said.
The U.S. has sought to assure the EU it will help them find alternative gas sources if Russia cuts them off, but global supplies are short.
A day after Ukrainian, Russian, German and French diplomats discussed the conflict in eastern Ukraine and agreed to more talks, Russia's foreign minister said there was hope of starting serious dialogue with the U.S., but only on secondary issues.
The United States has requested that the United Nations Security Council meet publicly on Monday to discuss the threat posed by Russia's build-up near Ukraine, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations said.
Putin, who has not spoken publicly on the crisis for weeks, has warned of an unspecified ""military-technical response"" - something defence analysts say could relate to missile deployments - if Russia's demands are ignored.

A senior Russian foreign ministry official said a nuclear missile crisis between Moscow and Washington was unavoidable without measures to ensure restraint and predictability.
Biden has said he will not send U.S. or allied troops to fight Russia in Ukraine but NATO has said it is putting forces on standby and reinforcing eastern Europe with more ships and fighter jets.

BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States on Thursday called on China to use its influence with Russia to urge a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine crisis https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-sees-some-room-dialogue-after-us-security-response-2022-01-27, but policy experts doubted Beijing would back Washington in the standoff.
China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke by phone with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Beijing said it wanted all sides to remain calm and ""refrain from doing things that agitate tensions and hype up the crisis.""
Blinken stressed that tensions should be reduced and warned of the security and economic risks from any Russian aggression, the State Department said.
U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said U.S. messages to Beijing had been very clear. 
""We are calling on Beijing to use its influence with Moscow to urge diplomacy, because if there is a conflict in the Ukraine it is not going to be good for China either,"" Nuland said at a regular State Department news conference. ""There will be a significant impact on the global economy. There will be a significant impact in the energy sphere."" 
China's U.N. ambassador Zhang Jun said a ""time-honored Olympic Truce"" for the Beijing Winter Games that begin on Feb. 4 would start from Jan. 28. 
""Let's take this opportunity to promote peace, solidarity, cooperation, and other common values shared by all humanity, to make our world a better place,"" Zhang tweeted. 
Russia has been building up its forces on Ukraine's borders for months and has demanded NATO pull troops and weapons from eastern Europe and bar Ukraine, a former Soviet state, from ever joining the U.S.-led military alliance.
NATO allies reject this but say they are ready to discuss arms control and confidence-building measures.
Daniel Russel, the senior U.S. diplomat for Asia under former President Barack Obama, said that while China could not be happy about the possibility of an invasion of Ukraine on the eve of the Olympics, ""Wang Yi chose to defend Russia's 'legitimate security concerns' rather than offer any support to Blinken.""
Bonnie Glaser of the German Marshall Fund of the United States said Beijing could act as a spoiler to any attempts by the United States and its allies to impose costs on Russia.
""It is unlikely that the U.S. can get China on board over Ukraine. Beijing won't endorse use of force, but it is sympathetic with Russian views of NATO. And this is not just about the Olympics,"" Glaser said.
If the United States and the European Union imposed sanctions on Russia, ""China is likely to take steps to mitigate their impact,"" she said.
NATO EXPANSION
Wang, apparently referring to NATO's expansion in eastern Europe, told Blinken that one country's security could not be at the expense of others and regional security could not be guaranteed by strengthening or even expanding military blocs, his ministry said.
The United States has urged Ukraine and Russia to return to a set of pacts to end a separatist war by Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine. But steps set out in the so-called Minsk II agreement remain unimplemented, with Russia's insistence that it is not a party to the conflict and therefore not bound by its terms being a major blockage.
Rand Corporation analyst Derek Grossman said China's version of the call with Blinken said Wang had highlighted Minsk, even though Russia had never abided by it.
""I don't see much room for U.S.-China cooperation here, unfortunately ... The U.S. would have to close the door to future NATO expansion for China to get on board, and Secretary Blinken has already stated that this is a non-starter.""
'MISTAKES'
Wang said the new Minsk agreement was ""a fundamental political document recognized by all parties and should be effectively implemented."" China will support efforts made in line with the ""direction and spirit of the agreement,"" he said.
China strengthened ties with Russia as tension between Beijing and Washington has mounted over issues from trade to human rights, Taiwan and China's extensive maritime claims.
Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to visit China next week for the Winter Olympics.
Russian troops invaded Georgia in August 2008 while Putin was in China taking in the opening ceremonies of Beijing's Summer Olympics. The crisis took some Western countries by surprise.
Wang underscored the cool state of Beijing's ties with Washington, saying that the United States ""continues to make mistakes in its words and deeds on China, causing new shocks to the relationship"".

""The top priority at the moment is that the U.S. should stop interfering with the Beijing Winter Olympics, stop playing with fire on the Taiwan issue, and stop creating various anti-China cliques,"" he said.
The United States, Canada, Australia and Britain have said they will not send any state officials to the Games because of China's human rights record. China denies rights abuses and had rejected what it calls the politicization of sport.

Here is a look at some potential contenders.
KETANJI BROWN JACKSON
Biden appointed Jackson, 51, to the influential U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Washington last year, a move that put her in contention for a potential Supreme Court nomination. Jackson previously served as a Washington-based U.S. district court judge for eight years, having been appointed by Democratic former President Barack Obama in 2013. Obama also considered her for a vacant Supreme Court position in 2016. She had a varied career before becoming a judge, including a stint as a federal public defender.
Jackson is well-connected in the Washington legal community and won three Republican votes when confirmed by the Senate on a vote of 53-44 to her current position. She was born in Miami and attended Harvard University, graduating from the law school in 1996.
LEONDRA KRUGER
Kruger, 45, has served as a justice on the California Supreme Court since 2014, when she was appointed by Democratic former Governor Jerry Brown. She straddles the ideological middle of the left-leaning state court - moderately liberal on civil cases, more conservative on criminal matters, according to legal observers.
Well-respected within the legal community by both conservatives and liberals, Kruger argued 12 cases at the U.S. Supreme Court when working in the Office of the Solicitor General representing the federal government under presidents of both parties.
J. MICHELLE CHILDS
A favorite of influential U.S. congressman Jim Clyburn, the third-ranking House of Representatives Democrat, Childs is a federal district court judge based in South Carolina who Biden has nominated to a position on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Childs, 55, was appointed to the district court by Obama in 2010.
CANDACE JACKSON-AKIWUMI
A longtime former lawyer for low-income defendants, Jackson-Akiwumi, born in 1979, was nominated by Biden to the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and confirmed by the Senate last year on a 54-40 vote. She served for 10 years as a staff attorney in the Federal Defender Program in Illinois.
EUNICE LEE
Another former defense lawyer for people who cannot afford a lawyer, Lee, born in 1970, was nominated by Biden to serve on the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and was confirmed by the Senate on a 50-47 vote last year. Lee served for 21 years as a lawyer in New York representing convicted defendants on appeal.

SHERRILYN IFILL
A prominent civil rights lawyer, Ifill, 59, heads the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which was founded by Thurgood Marshall, who later served as the first Black Supreme Court justice. Earlier in her career Ifill spent 20 years as a law professor at the University of Maryland School of Law.

(Reuters) - A New York City ethics panel has agreed that Mayor Eric Adams can hire his brother as a senior security adviser, but only at $1 per year and with no power over department personnel to avoid the appearance of favoritism.
The decision by the New York City Conflicts of Interest Board, made public on Thursday, seeks to put an end to an uproar that erupted in America's largest city after Adams initially sought to hire his younger brother Bernard as a deputy police commissioner for a yearly salary of $240,000.
The mayor's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.
The panel said that while a city charter prohibits public servants from seeking advantages for members of their family, it would grant Adams a waiver to hire his brother because the job of ""senior security adviser"" would be essentially unpaid and carry no authority within the New York City Police Department.
A similar waiver was granted to Adams' predecessor, Bill de Blasio, who appointed his wife to head the board of directors for a not-for-profit philanthropic organization. 
Adams, a 61-year-old former New York City police officer who took office on Jan. 1, faced accusations of nepotism after announcing the appointment of his brother to a high-paid job in his administration.

The mayor first responded by reassigning Bernard Adams, 51, to be security adviser, earning $210,000 yearly and said he would seek guidance from the ethics board.
Adams, a Democrat, was elected in November after pledging to tackle violent crime.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. border officials are preparing for as many as 9,000 border arrests per day by the spring, according to two Department of Homeland Security officials, which would be significantly larger than last year's peak and could cause a headache for the Democratic administration ahead of midterm elections.
The number is a ""worst-case scenario,"" said one of the officials, both of whom requested anonymity to discuss internal planning. 
The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden grappled with a record-breaking 1.7 million border arrests last fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30. In July 2021 - the peak of last year's rise - daily migrant arrests averaged about 6,500, according to government statistics.
The nearly unprecedented https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-IMMIGRATION/BORDER/byvrjobmjve number of arrests, which included many repeat crossers, caused backups of unaccompanied children in crowded border patrol stations and fueled Republican criticism of the Democratic president's approach to border security. Biden's predecessor, Republican President Donald Trump, made cracking down on immigration a central plank of his presidency.
The rise in migration has happened despite the Biden administration keeping in place a Trump-era order that allows U.S. authorities to rapidly expel most migrants caught at the border during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Republicans are expected to make the border a major campaign theme in the run-up to November midterm elections that will decide control of the U.S. Congress.
A U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) spokesperson said the agency ""stands ready to address any potential increase in migrant encounters,"" while at the same time ""managing a fair and orderly immigration system.""
Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden's top immigration official, fielded criticism from individual border patrol agents during a visit on Wednesday to Yuma, Arizona, according to four current and former agents and an audio recording posted online by the conservative website Townhall.
Some agents have grown frustrated with Biden's approach to enforcement and say it has hurt morale.

DHS spokesperson Marsha Espinosa said in statement that Mayorkas ""welcomes candor during these conversations, and appreciates and respects the opinions of each member of the CBP workforce.""
In Yuma, Reuters witnessed hundreds of migrants walking through a gap in the border barrier and turning themselves in to ask for asylum over the weekend. The migrants said they were from Venezuela, Cuba, and other Latin American countries, as well as farther away places.

(Reuters) - The Michigan teenager charged with first-degree murder in the deadliest U.S. school shooting of 2021 will assert an insanity defense, his lawyers wrote in a court notice filed Thursday. 
Prosecutors say they intend to rebut the defense by Ethan Crumbley, a 15-year-old sophomore at a high school in Oxford, Michigan, who is charged with first-degree murder in the Nov. 30 shooting spree that killed four students. 
Crumbley is being held without bond in an adult jail in Oakland County, although isolated from other inmates. Six other students and a teacher were also wounded in the shooting. 
Crumbley's lawyers, Paulette Michel Loftin and Amy Hopp, notified an Oakland County court that he ""intends to assert the defense of insanity at the time of the alleged defense."" 
Prosecuting attorney Karen D. McDonald wrote in a separate court notice: ""Please take notice that if Defendant should successfully assert the defense of insanity, the prosecution gives notice of intent to rebut this claimed defense."" 
Also charged in the killings are his parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, who prosecutors say gave him a semi-automatic handgun as an early Christmas present and then ignored signs that he was planning a shooting at the school.
The parents, who have pleaded not guilty, are being held in the same county jail as their son in lieu of $500,000 bail each on charges of involuntary manslaughter.
In a new lawsuit filed Thursday in Oakland County, the parents of one of the students killed joined with others whose children had witnessed the shooting in alleging negligence by school officials and Crumbley's parents.

Crumbley ""exhibited some concerning, strange and bizarre behavior which should have alerted his parents, as well as other people who had extensive contact with him, that he was suffering from significant psychiatric problems,"" the lawsuit says.
A representative for the school, Oxford High School, and a lawyer for Crumbley's parents were not immediately reachable for comment.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -An activist ally of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny told Reuters on Thursday she had fled Russia to avoid jail, while two of his top aides said they had received letters with threats to themselves and their families.
Violetta Grudina, 32, who was barred from standing for election last year in the Arctic port city of Murmansk, said she fled with her 11-year-old son and her dog in December. She declined to reveal her location and said only she was in Europe. 
""In principle I was prepared to stay in Russia and go to jail... (But) I had to think of my son and to leave to ensure him a safe future,"" Grudina said by phone. 
She declined to say exactly how she had managed to get out of Russia while being barred from leaving town, but said it was extremely uncomfortable, took several days, and involved transport by car, plane, bus and on foot.
With the nearby border closed to her because of coronavirus restrictions, she only had one road out of Murmansk towards St Petersburg when she left in the night and she really worried they would be stopped, she said. 
She joined numerous opposition figures in leaving Russia over the last year during a crackdown that intensified after Navalny was jailed after recovering from being poisoned with a nerve agent.
Navalny's nationwide political network has since been dismantled and banned as extremist. Navalny is in jail. He and some of his closest allies have been added to an official list of ""terrorists and extremists"".
Navalny's team said on Thursday that two of those aides now living outside Russia, Ivan Zhdanov and Leonid Volkov, had received anonymous letters saying: ""We know where you live. We don't want you and your families to feel safe, we want you to remember this as you go about your work.""
Volkov said on Instagram that the ""letter from the Motherland"" had been delivered to his home address.
""We received these letters at the same time that we were included in the 'list of extremists and terrorists', and this doesn't look like a coincidence: we know what methods Putin uses to fight those he considers 'terrorists', don't we? But we will not change anything in our work.""
BARRED FROM BALLOT
Grudina planned to run for a seat on the Murmansk city council last September as the crackdown gathered steam. 
But after being barred from the race, she said she had fallen foul of a spectacular intimidation campaign that saw her office shot at. At one point, she said she was put in a hospital for COVID-19 treatment she did not want or need.

The Kremlin has declined to comment on Grudina's allegations. It denies targeting opposition politicians and says people are only taken to court if they break the law. 
The local city and governor's offices did not reply to requests for comment about Grudina's allegations at the time.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Protesters against COVID-19 measures who liken themselves to Jews under Nazi persecution are stoking global anti-Semitism, the Israeli government said in a report marking International Holocaust Remembrance Day.
Such Holocaust tropes have become ""widespread"" and, along with violent demonstrations linked to Israel's May war in Gaza, were main factors behind physical or online attacks on Jews in Europe and North America last year, said the 152-page report by the Diaspora Affairs Ministry.
Several U.S. and British politicians nL1N2U51L1 have in recent months apologised after suggesting vaccine or lockdown policies recalled Hitler's regime. 
Some demonstrators against pandemic curbs have worn yellow stars like those the Nazis forced on European Jews. 
Such displays showed factual knowledge of the genocide was eroding, the report said, adding that some COVID-19 agitators have been ""consuming and disseminating anti-Semitic conspiracy theories that Jews are responsible for the crisis and are using it for oppression, global domination, economic gain, etc"".
Expanding on the findings, Diaspora Affairs Minister Nachman Shai said Holocaust distortion or trivialisation is itself anti-Semitic and can sometimes lead to actual endangerment of Jews. 
""There are people so fraught with hate who can, when faced with such imagery, be tipped over into action,"" he told Reuters. 
The Combat Antisemitism Movement (CAM), a U.S.-based non-profit, said that in 2020 and 2021 it had found 63.7 million engagements - participation, sharing or ""liking"" - during online discussions linking the pandemic to the Holocaust.
Yad Vashem, Israel's main Holocaust memorial, has urged world leaders to come out against such discourse - a call apparently heeded by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who on Monday said the yellow star protests were ""reprehensible"". 
""COVID brought Holocaust trivialisation to a summit,"" said Yad Vashem chairman Dani Dayan. ""Things like that, sometimes done by politicians, by public figures, are despicable and Yad Vashem is very clear in demanding those persons retract."" 

Former Israeli Chief Rabbi Israel Meir Lau, whose parents and brother were among the six million Jews killed by the Nazis and who himself survived a concentration camp as a child, had a more personal appeal during a Reuters interview.
""Please leave the word 'Holocaust' for the Holocaust - and nothing but it,"" he said.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -Russia is likely to remain on a diplomatic track with Kyiv and the West for at least two weeks but will continue efforts to destabilise Ukraine, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Thursday.
Russia has massed troops near Ukraine's border but says it does not plan to invade its neighbour.
Speaking after Russia held security talks in Paris on Wednesday with diplomats from Ukraine, France and Germany, Kuleba told a news briefing in Copenhagen: ""Nothing has changed, this is the bad news.""
""The good news is that advisers agreed to meet in Berlin in two weeks, which means that Russia for the next two weeks is likely to remain on the diplomatic track,"" he said following a meeting with Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod.
The so-called ""Normandy"" talks in Paris were seen as a step towards defusing broader tensions in a separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine. 
""Unfortunately, the biggest demand that Russia has is that Ukraine engages directly in talks with Russian proxies in Donetsk and Luhansk instead of negotiating with Russia. This will not happen, this is a matter of principle,"" Kuleba said.
Donetsk and Luhansk are self-proclaimed republics in the Donbass in eastern Ukraine. 
Kuleba said Ukraine was preparing itself for all scenarios, but that Russia's main strategy now was to destabilise Ukraine, including by using hybrid warfare tactics such as cyber attacks and disinformation campaigns.
""We understand that a military operation is something they keep in the pocket, it's not something they put ahead of other options,"" he said.
Russia says the crisis is being driven by NATO and U.S. actions and is demanding security guarantees from the West, including a promise by NATO never to admit Ukraine. 
On Wednesday, the U.S. repeated in a written response https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-urges-de-escalation-over-ukraine-offers-russia-diplomatic-path-2022-01-27 to Russia's demands its commitment to upholding NATO's ""open-door"" policy while offering a ""principled and pragmatic evaluation"" of the Kremlin's concerns.

Kuleba said he had seen the part of the response which relates to Ukraine and had no objections.
""I must commend the openness of the Biden administration to consulting with us before they speak with the Russians,"" he said, adding that any deals made without the Ukraine would not be accepted.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO allies are putting forces on standby https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/nato-sends-ships-jets-eastern-europe-ukraine-crisis-2022-01-24 and sending reinforcements to eastern Europe in response to Russia's buildup of more than 100,000 troops on Ukraine's borders. 
Here are some of the dilemmas about NATO's next steps. 
WILL NATO COME TO UKRAINE'S DEFENCE?
Not militarily. Ukraine is not a member of NATO and the alliance is not treaty-bound to defend it. U.S. President Joe Biden https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-says-putting-us-troops-ground-ukraine-is-not-table-2021-12-08 has said he will not send American or allied troops to fight Russia in Ukraine.
However, Kyiv is a close partner and was promised eventual membership of the alliance at a NATO summit in 2008. 
For the moment, the 30-member North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is working with Ukraine to modernise its armed forces. Canada operates a training programme in Ukraine, while Denmark is also stepping up efforts to bring Ukraine's military up to NATO standards. The alliance has also said it will help Ukraine defend against cyber attacks https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-offers-ukraine-support-needed-recover-cyberattack-2022-01-14 and is providing secure communications equipment for military command. 
WHAT ABOUT ARMING UKRAINE?
The United States, Britain and the Baltic states are sending weapons to Ukraine, including anti-tank missiles, small arms and boats. Turkey has sold drones to Ukraine that the Ukrainian military has used in eastern Ukraine against Russian-backed separatists. 
However, Germany is against sending arms to Ukraine. Berlin has instead promised a complete field hospital and the necessary training for Ukrainian troops to operate it, worth about $6 million. 
SO WHY IS NATO PUTTING FORCES ON STANDBY?
The alliance https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/best-supporting-actor-nato-secondary-role-if-russia-invades-ukraine-2022-01-18 is concerned about a potential spillover from any conflict between Russia and Ukraine, particularly in the Black Sea region, where Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, and in the Baltic Sea.
The U.S. Department of Defense has put about 8,500 American troops on heightened alert. Denmark is sending a frigate to the Baltic Sea and four F-16 warplanes to Lithuania. Spain has sent a minesweeper and a frigate to join NATO naval forces in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. 
Madrid is also considering sending fighter jets to Bulgaria, while the Netherlands has also offered two F-35 warplanes to Bulgaria from April. 
France may send troops to Romania under NATO command. 
WHY ARE ALLIES NOT MOVING MORE QUICKLY?
Russia says it has no intention of invading Ukraine.
NATO, which is both a political and military organisation, has offered more talks with Moscow in the format of the NATO-Russia Council in Brussels to find a solution.
Moreover, as an alliance of 30 countries with different priorities, decisions are taken collectively and it can take time to drum up the necessary troops for joint missions.
NATO allies are discussing whether to increase the number of troops rotating through eastern Europe. They will focus on the issue when allied defence ministers meet for a scheduled meeting in Brussels in mid-February.
NATO has four multinational battalion-size battlegroups, or some 4,000 soldiers, led by Canada, Germany, Britain and the United States in Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Poland.
The troops serve as a ""trip wire"" for NATO's 40,000-strong response force to come in quickly and bring more U.S. troops and weapons from across the Atlantic. 
The biggest decisions may not come until June, when NATO leaders are due to meet for a summit in Madrid. They are expected to agree a new master plan, called a Strategic Concept, in part to cement NATO's focus on deterring Russia.
WHAT IS NATO LIKELY TO DO IN THE BLACK SEA?
Bulgaria's government has said it is ready to stand up a 1,000-strong force in the country, under Bulgarian command and in close cooperation with NATO, possibly with some soldiers from other allied countries. 
It could be formed by April or May. 
The Western alliance has a multinational land force of up to 4,000 troops in Romania. The United States also has soldiers stationed at separate bases in Romania and in Bulgaria.

Romania could see a bigger NATO presence, after France offered more troops. Romania is in talks with the United States over increasing troop numbers on its soil.
Although operational since 2017, the multinational force in Romania remains only a land command, without immediate air, maritime or special forces.

SAN JOSE, Calif. (Reuters) -Gun owners in San Jose, California, would be required to carry insurance coverage for their weapons and pay an annual ""harm reduction"" fee under a newly approved city ordinance believed to be the first of its kind in the United States. 
The measure, backed on an 8-3 vote on Tuesday night by the City Council for the state's third most populous municipality, brought an immediate court challenge from national gun rights advocates.
The bill is subject to a final ""reading"" by the council next month, a step considered largely perfunctory, before it becomes law. Once passed, it would take effect in August.
Even before Tuesday's approval, the ordinance was singled out by gun rights proponents as a new flashpoint in the national debate between advocates for tougher firearms regulation and those for the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
The measure would require city residents owning guns to obtain special liability insurance covering losses and damages stemming from negligent or accidental use of their weapons.
City gun owners would also have to pay a small annual fee earmarked for evidence-based ""harm-reduction"" programs aimed at reducing gun violence, suicide, domestic abuse and other firearm-related risks, the city said in a statement explaining the bill.
""We are seeing an epidemic of violence and harm from the use of guns in cities throughout the country, and San Jose is no exception,"" Mayor Sam Liccardo told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. ""We are tired of waiting for Congress to act.""
San Jose, in the heart of California's Silicon Valley south of San Francisco, is the first U.S. municipality to adopt such an ordinance, he said. Opponents said they feared the measure could set a precedent for other cities.
The vote to approve the measure was immediately condemned by gun rights groups as infringing Second Amendment rights.
The Colorado-based National Association of Gun Rights and its legal arm said on Wednesday it had filed suit in federal court in San Jose seeking to block the measure's enforcement as an unconstitutional tax on gun ownership.
""To tax a constitutional right is absolutely preposterous and places an undue burden on law-abiding gun owners,"" association President Dudley Brown said in a statement.
The California Rifle & Pistol Association said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that it was preparing a legal challenge, calling the ordinance an unconstitutional measure that criminals would ignore.
The bill's supporters cited a 2021 study finding that San Jose taxpayers subsidize private gun ownership by $151 annually per gun-owning household - or $40 million a year total - through costs of police and emergency response to firearm-related violence.
""The Second Amendment absolutely protects the rights of Americans to own and possess guns, but it doesn't require that taxpayers subsidize that right,"" Liccardo said.

According to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, some 36,000 Americans or more die by firearms every year, or about 100 a day. 
The United States leads high-income countries in gun violence, accounting for 9% of all firearm homicides globally even with 4% of the world's population, while also possessing more civilian-owned guns - 393 million - than any comparable nation, the Giffords Law Center said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Most fans at an ice hockey game devote their attention to the whizzing puck and crunching body checks. 
Rick Ragan fixates on the frozen white surface on which the action takes place. 
""I'm watching how the ice is getting cut up, how much snow is getting made. I'm taking the temperature of the ice as the game is going on,"" he said. 
It is that discerning eye for ice that landed the 48-year-old Minnesota native his job as chief ice maker for the main ice hockey venue at the 2022 Winter Olympics, the Wukesong Arena, which also hosted basketball during the 2008 Summer Games. 
Ice hockey was first played on frozen lakes and ponds, but the making of artificial rinks has grown into a science. 
""Can anybody make ice? Honestly, yes - you go throw a hose on a frozen floor, you're going to make ice. But it's doing those little things that's going to make it the best ice,"" Ragan said. 
Those things include understanding how different minerals affect the ""hardness"" of the water, and making adjustments for different sports. 
For example, ice for figure skating needs to be relatively soft to cushion the falls, Ragan said, while for speed skating, it needs to be harder. Ice hockey played at the Paralympics requires thicker ice. 
""Every sport likes it a little different ... so it's a lot of differences working with the refrigeration systems in each building to get the floor warmer or colder,"" said Ragan, who also worked on the ice at the 2018 Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. 
Ice-making can take several days - it took just over a week at Wukesong - requiring the repeated flooding of the rink to create layer after layer. 
""For this event, we built ice to 1 cm, painted it white, put a few more coats of water on that, painted all the hockey markings, built more ice. At about 1.75 cm we put in all the logos, then finally built the ice to 4 cm,"" Ragan said. 
""For the Olympics, we put the lines and logos a bit higher so they would look really good on TV,"" he said. 
The process requires patience, Ragan said. The thinner the individual layers, the harder and more durable the ice. 
""It might be 80 to 90 floods before we get to a sheet of ice we are comfortable with. If you rush it, it will not be good,"" said Ragan, who took leave from his full-time job as an electrician in Florida to come to Beijing to make ice. 
 BEST  (NYSE:BEST) GAMES EVER?
Ragan is one of 61 foreign experts, along with fellow chief ice maker Don Moffat, working behind the scenes at the Beijing Olympics, from construction to game operations. 
When the two arrived for a three-week trial run in October, they were able to skip Beijing's usual three-week COVID-19 quarantine, instead boarding a bus surrounded by police trucks carrying what Ragan estimates were 100 officers as they drove down a highway that had been blocked off from traffic. 
The two scoped out the two hockey venues, analysing every factor that could affect the ice, from refrigeration systems to estimated crowd numbers. Beijing 2022, which is not selling tickets to the public, has not said how many spectators will be allowed in venues. 
Ragan said Chinese members of the ice-making team peppered Moffat and himself with questions. 
""They all work in arenas around China so they have a hunger to learn,"" he said. 

Eagerness was also palpable in meetings with officials, where the message that these must be ""the best Games ever"" was repeated, according to Ragan. 
""That's something we didn't really hear too much in Pyeongchang,"" he said.

WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - The United States said on Wednesday it had set out a diplomatic path to address sweeping Russian demands in eastern Europe, as Moscow held security talks with Western countries and intensified its military build-up near Ukraine with new drills. 
In a written response to Russia's demands delivered in person by its ambassador in Moscow, the U.S. repeated its commitment to upholding NATO's ""open-door"" policy while offering a ""principled and pragmatic evaluation"" of the Kremlin's concerns, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.
Blinken spoke to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi about Ukraine on Wednesday, highlighting the global security and economic risks that could stem from further Russian aggression, the State Department said.
""Secretary Blinken ... conveyed that de-escalation and diplomacy are the responsible way forward,"" department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement. 
Russia has demanded NATO pull back troops and weapons from eastern Europe and bar its neighbour Ukraine, a former Soviet state, from ever joining. Washington and its NATO allies reject that position but say they are ready to discuss other topics such as arms control and confidence-building measures. 
""Putting things in writing is ... a good way to make sure we're as precise as possible, and the Russians understand our positions, our ideas, as clearly as possible. Right now, the document is with them and the ball is in their court,"" Blinken told reporters.
Whether President Vladimir Putin is prepared to accept Washington and its allies' agenda will determine the next phase of the crisis, in which Moscow has massed around 100,000 troops near the border with Ukraine while denying it plans to invade.
NATO says it is putting forces on standby and reinforcing eastern Europe with more ships and fighter jets, while the U.S., Britain and others are providing weapons to help Ukraine defend against Russia's much larger army.
Asked how much time Russia would need to study NATO's response, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko told Interfax news agency: ""We will read it. Study it. The partners studied our project for almost a month and a half.""
DIALOGUE
In Paris, diplomats from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany held more than eight hours of talks on ending a separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, part of the wider crisis between Moscow and Kyiv that risks becoming a full-scale war.
The so-called ""Normandy"" talks were a good signal from Russia and a step toward defusing broader tensions, though major differences remained with further talks planned in Berlin in two weeks, a French official said. 
Western-Russian differences were on full display on Tuesday with U.S. President Joe Biden saying he would consider imposing sanctions personally on Putin if he invades Ukraine, part of an attempt by Washington to convince Moscow that any new action against Ukraine would bring massive costs. 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said personal sanctions on Putin would be ""politically destructive"", adding that Russia's top leaders were legally barred from holding assets, property and bank accounts abroad. 
Putin's personal wealth is a sensitive topic in Russia. According to his most recent official disclosure, he earned just shy of 10 million roubles ($126,175) in 2020. 
Peskov has previously said that imposing sanctions on Putin would amount to a severing of diplomatic relations. 
MILITARY MANOEUVRES, ENERGY PRECAUTIONS
Russia staged new military drills on land and on the Black Sea on Wednesday and moved more paratroopers and fighter jets to Belarus, north of Ukraine, for what it describes as joint exercises there next month. 
Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Moscow had not yet massed sufficient forces for a large-scale offensive, but that did not mean it could not do so later. Blinken said Americans in Ukraine should consider leaving. 
A day after the U.S. delivered Javelin anti-tank missiles, launchers and other hardware to Ukraine, Germany came under criticism for saying it would supply Kyiv with 5,000 military helmets while stopping short of providing weapons.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko told Bild newspaper the German helmets were a joke. ""What kind of support will Germany send next?"" he asked. ""Pillows?""
The spat highlights the complicated task the U.S. faces in trying to build agreement with European allies, who maintain strong business relations with Russia and rely heavily on it for energy, on a strong sanctions package if Moscow attacks.
Top Italian business leaders, including UniCredit bank, went ahead with a video conference with Putin on Wednesday despite a call from their government not to take part. Ukraine was not discussed, the Italian organiser said. 
U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Wednesday the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany ""will not move forward"" if Russia invades Ukraine, though he did not elaborate on whether Germany had taken the same position. 
Washington worries Nord Stream 2 would increase Europe's reliance on Russia for gas.
U.S. officials say they are in talks with major energy-producing countries and companies worldwide over a potential diversion of supplies to Europe if Russia invades Ukraine. 

When asked about reports that industry had little or no capacity to provide the required supplies, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Wednesday the United States faced logistical challenges, especially around moving natural gas. 
""That's part of our discussions with a lot of companies and countries,"" Psaki said. ""But again, these conversations are ongoing and we don't intend to fail.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer has authored pivotal rulings bolstering abortion rights and safeguarding a landmark healthcare law while questioning the death penalty during 27 years as a liberal on a bench often dominated by conservatives.
Breyer, who U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday said would retire https://www.reuters.com/world/us/liberal-us-supreme-court-justice-stephen-breyer-retire-media-reports-2022-01-26 at the end of the court's current term, will leave a legacy as a moderating influence and a pragmatist on a court that has moved rightward during his tenure and currently has a commanding 6-3 conservative majority. At age 83, Breyer is the oldest of the current justices on the top U.S. judicial body.
He was appointed to the lifetime job in 1994 by Democratic President Bill Clinton. Only conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, who joined the court in 1991, has served longer among its current members. Breyer's retirement will not alter the court's ideological balance but will give Democratic President Joe Biden the chance to name a liberal replacement young enough to serve for decades.
In a speech last year, Breyer expressed faith in the court as an institution and defended it against accusations that its rightward shift had rendered it more politicized. Breyer noted among other things that the justices had turned away former President Donald Trump's efforts, based on false claims of widespread voting fraud, to overturn his 2020 election loss.
""These considerations convince me that it is wrong to think of the court as another political institution,"" Breyer said.
The court's conservatives have become increasingly bold during its current nine-month term, with rulings due by the end of June that could gut abortion rights and widen gun rights.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, called Breyer a ""model jurist"" who ""embodies the best qualities and highest ideals of American justice: knowledge, wisdom, fairness, humility, restraint."" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, a Democrat, praised Breyer as ""a trusted voice on the bench with a first-rate legal mind."" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) added, ""He has always been a scholar and a gentleman whose record on the Supreme Court is solidly in the liberal camp.""
As a member of the court's liberal wing, Breyer helped advance LGBT rights including joining the landmark 2015 decision legalizing gay marriage nationwide and the 2020 decision protecting gay and transgender employees from workplace discrimination. 
Breyer authored two high-profile rulings defending abortion rights. In one of them, the court in 2016, on a 5-3 vote, struck down a Republican-backed Texas law that sought to impose restrictions on clinics and doctors who perform abortions, provisions that had caused some clinics to close. The other one, a 5-4 decision in 2020, struck down a Republican-backed Louisiana law with similar physician restrictions.
Breyer last year authored a ruling rejecting a Republican bid to invalidate the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement that has helped millions of Americans obtain healthcare coverage. The 7-2 ruling preserved the law, dubbed Obamacare, for the third time since its 2010 enactment. 
Breyer also wrote a ruling last year in a major free speech case that sided with a cheerleader who had been punished by her high school for a profanity-laced social media post. 
'CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT'
In 2015, Breyer questioned capital punishment's constitutionality. In a 41-page dissent joined by fellow liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Breyer wrote that ""the death penalty, in and of itself, now likely constitutes a legally prohibited cruel and unusual punishment"" under the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment.
Breyer said innocent people have been put the death, capital punishment has been marred by racial discrimination and politics, its use varies wildly from place to place, there have been excessively long delays between sentencing and execution and it has been imposed arbitrarily.
Breyer dissented in major victories for the court's conservatives such as the 2000 ruling that halted ballot recounts in Florida, effectively handing the U.S. presidency to Republican George W. Bush over Democrat Al Gore after a disputed election.
He pursued compromises when possible. 
Breyer was the swing vote when the court in 2005 ruled on a pair of cases questioning whether religious displays on public property violated the Constitution's First Amendment, which bars governmental endorsement of religion. Breyer was the only justice in the majority in both. The justices allowed a large monument of the biblical Ten Commandments on the grounds of the Texas Capitol but found that framed copies of the Ten Commandments could not be displayed inside two Kentucky courthouses.
Questioned last year during a session with school students about U.S. political fractures and polarization, Breyer said he remains ""basically optimistic https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-justice-breyer-touts-compromise-democracy-adherence-precedent-2021-05-28."" For all of its flaws, Breyer said, American democracy is, on balance, ""better than the alternatives.""
Breyer replaced liberal Justice Harry Blackmun on the court, securing Senate confirmation on an 87-9 vote. Breyer previously had been appointed in 1980 by Democratic President Jimmy Carter to the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Breyer was born in San Francisco on Aug. 15, 1938. He graduated from Stanford University in 1959 and two years later earned a degree from the University of Oxford. He graduated in 1964 from Harvard Law School, where he later served as a professor and lecturer.

He got his first taste of the Supreme Court as a clerk for Justice Arthur Goldberg. After a stint in the Justice Department's antitrust division, he worked under his former professor Archibald Cox, special prosecutor in the Watergate scandal that led President Richard Nixon to resign in 1974. Breyer also served as an aide to Massachusetts Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy.
Breyer married Joanna Hare, the British-born daughter of Lord John Blakenham, a former Cabinet minister and member of Britain's House of Lords. They had three children.

SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korea’s flurry of new missile tests, including what it calls “hypersonic” https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkorea-tests-hypersonic-missiles-global-race-new-rockets-2022-01-11 weapons, has underscored the importance of the country’s missile engineers and scientists, a group that is high profile within his government but opaque to outsiders. 
Analysts say Kim Jong Un appears to be taking steps to institutionalize the missile forces, signalling his likely intent to make them a long-term, operational part of his military plans. https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkorea-warns-it-may-rethink-moratorium-nuclear-missile-tests-2022-01-19 Here's what we know – and what we don’t – about these key personnel.
THE SCIENTISTS
Very little is known about the names and positions of the mid-level and working-level scientists and technicians involved in missile research and development.  
Analysts say these individuals appear to have guaranteed job security because of the resources and effort expended to educate and train them, and they are sequestered to special districts so they are neither a defection risk nor a political or social nuisance to the regime.  
“Unlike economic cadres or even military commanders, this is a population that is not easily replaced,” said Michael Madden, a North Korea leadership expert at the Washington-based Stimson Center.
Many of them attend Kim Jong Un National Defense University, a training ground for North Korean defense-related science and technology specialists that has reportedly added a college focused on “hypersonic missile technology.” 
The scientists and engineers often appear split into competing teams designing similar types of weapons, allowing them to go down multiple routes to see which technology is the most promising, said Ken Gause, director of the International Affairs Group at CNA, a non-profit research and analysis organisation based in Arlington, Virginia.
A 2018 study by the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) found North Korean scientists had worked with researchers in other countries to co-write at least 100 published articles that had identifiable significance for dual-use technology, weapons of mass destruction, or other military purposes. 
THE OFFICIALS
Kim Jong Un relies on three top people https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-trio-exclusive-idUSKBN18L302 to lead the secretive country’s rapidly accelerating missile programme. 
They include Ri Pyong Chol, a former top air force general; Kim Jong Sik, a veteran rocket scientist; and Jang Chang Ha, the head of a weapons development and procurement centre. 
A fourth official - Pak Jong Chon, the chief of the General Staff - has also assumed a higher-profile role in the Military Industry Department (MID), which is responsible for production of strategic weapons, Gause said.
""We have seen a lot of changes in the military industry arena in the last few years,"" Gause said.
Pak oversaw many recent tests in the absence of Kim Jong Un, who did not attend any missile launches in 2021, before observing one of the hypersonic missile launches in January.
Last year also saw the appointment of Yu Jim to lead the MID. Yu was previously a representative of North Korea’s primary state arms dealer in Iran, Madden said.
THE ORGANISATIONS
The Academy of National Defense Science (NADS), also known as the Second Academy of Natural Sciences (SANS), oversees North Korea's missile development. 
Madden said the state of a weapon's development can often be divined from who is reported to have attended a test. 
An event where the only personnel are from NADS/SANS means the system is still in the research and development phase, for example. If an event combines NADS and the 2nd Economic Committee, that often means that the system is moving from development to production and manufacturing.  
Finally, if the military’s General Staff Department (GSD) personnel attend a test, such as the recent train mobile missile, this usually indicates that the system is finished and will be deployed.  
There are initial signals that as North Korea completes its missile and nuclear arsenal, it may fold more elements of its Strategic Forces back under GSD, signalling it has moved to an operational role, Madden added.
FOREIGN ASSISTANCE
North Korea’s missile programme has roots in assistance it received from the Soviet Union, and later Russia, analysts say, and the boosters involved in propelling the latest hypersonic warheads are similar to Soviet designs. 
There is debate over how much that assistance has continued since the 1990s.
According to the latest sanctions https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-imposes-sanctions-north-koreans-russian-after-missile-tests-2022-01-12 designations by the United States, North Koreans linked to the NADS in China and Russia continue to procure materials and technical information for North Korea’s WMD and missile programmes, aided by at least one Russian telecommunications company and a Russian national. 

Markus Schiller, a Europe-based missile expert, has argued that North Korea’s success in testing suggests it has had external support.
Schiller notes, however, that under Kim Jong Un, North Korean missiles failed more often than in the past, suggesting that the younger Kim was testing more homegrown designs than his predecessors.

870,"<span>Jan 26, 2022 07:26PM ET</span>","COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -The BA.2 subvariant of the Omicron coronavirus variant, which is dominant in Denmark, appears more contagious than the more common BA.1 sub-lineage, Danish Health Minister Magnus Heunicke said on Wednesday in a national address. 
""There is no evidence that the BA.2 variant causes more disease, but it must be more contagious,"" Heunicke told a news conference.
The BA.1 lineage currently accounts for 98% of all cases globally but in Denmark has been pushed aside by BA.2, which became the dominant strain in the second week of January. 
The UK Health Security Agency has designated BA.2 a variant under investigation, saying it could have a growth advantage.
Preliminary calculations suggest BA.2 could be 1.5 times more infectious than BA.1, Denmark's top infectious disease authority, Statens Serum Institut (SSI), said in a note on Wednesday. 
However, an initial analysis by the institute showed no difference in the risk of hospitalisation for BA.2 compared to BA.1.
""There is some indication that it is more contagious, especially for the unvaccinated, but that it can also infect people who have been vaccinated to a greater extent,"" SSI's technical director Tyra Grove Krause said at the briefing.
This could mean the peak of Denmark's epidemic will extend a bit further into February than previously forecast, Krause said.

BA.2 cases have also been registered in Britain, Sweden and Norway, but to a much lesser extent than in Denmark. 
Denmark on Wednesday announced plans to scrap the last of its COVID-19 restrictions by Feb 1, the latest country in Europe to do so despite record high daily infection numbers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Andrew on Wednesday asked for a U.S. jury trial as he again denied Virginia Giuffre's accusations that he sexually abused her more than two decades ago when she was 17.
Giuffre, 38, sued the Duke of York last August, alleging he battered her while the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was trafficking her.
In a filing with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Andrew, 61, admitted to meeting Epstein in or around 1999, but denied Giuffre's claim that he ""committed sexual assault and battery"" upon her.
David Boies, a lawyer for Giuffre, said in a statement that Andrew was trying to ""blame the victim."" 
""We look forward to confronting Prince Andrew with his denials and attempts to blame Ms. Giuffre for her own abuse,"" Boies said.
Andrew's ties to Epstein, who killed himself in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges, have undermined his reputation with the public and standing in Britain's Royal Family.
Earlier this month, the family removed Andrew's military links and military patronages, and said the second son of Queen Elizabeth would no longer be known as ""His Royal Highness.""
Andrew's filing was an ""answer,"" a common document in U.S. litigation in which defendants deny or say they lack enough information to comment on plaintiffs' substantive accusations.
The prince's lawyers had previously called Giuffre's lawsuit ""baseless"" and accused her of seeking another payday.
Giuffre received $500,000 in a 2009 civil settlement with Epstein. 
U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan has said a trial could begin between September and December 2022.
If Giuffre won at trial, Andrew could owe her damages. She has asked for an unspecified amount. 
Andrew has not been criminally charged, and no criminal charges can be brought in Giuffre's civil lawsuit.

Kaplan this month denied Andrew's earlier request to dismiss Giuffre's lawsuit, which the prince said he was shielded from under the 2009 Epstein settlement.
Andrew renewed that argument in Wednesday's filing, and also said Giuffre lacks legal standing to sue because she lives in Australia.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior U.S. senator on Wednesday called on major automakers and the Transportation Department to take action to address an ""alarming"" rise in carjackings in some major cities.
Senate Judiciary chair Dick Durbin, a Democrat, asked the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents nearly all major automakers, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to develop ""uniform standards for swift law enforcement access to vehicle location tracking data in carjacking incidents.""
Durbin said accessing vehicle tracking information from cars that are stolen from owners ""can take law enforcement hours or even weeks.""
A number of U.S. cities including New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and Washington have reported big jumps in carjackings in recent years, including many involving teenagers and thefts at gunpoint.
CNN reported this week that Chicago had more than 1,800 carjackings in 2021, up about 30% over 2020 and more than five times the number in 2014, while CBS reported carjackings in Philadelphia have almost tripled since 2019 and Washington had carjackings jump by about 20% in 2021, the Washington Post reported.
Buttigieg's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Alliance for Automotive Innovation spokesman Don Stewart said the group would continue to work with Durbin ""on this important issue. We’ve had good conversations with stakeholders in Illinois and elsewhere on this topic and those will continue.”

Last month, U.S. Representative Mary Gay Scanlon was robbed of her automobile at gunpoint in a Philadelphia park.
Scanlon, a Democrat who represents Pennsylvania's 5th Congressional District, was unharmed in the mid-afternoon carjacking which occurred following a meeting of elected officials, city police said.

The Senate voted 53-44 in June last year to confirm Jackson as a member of the U.S. Court of the Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
She was part of a D.C. Circuit three-judge panel that ruled in December against Republican former President Donald Trump's bid to prevent White House records from being handed over to the House of Representatives committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by a mob of his supporters. The Supreme Court on Jan. 20 declined to block that decision. 
Jackson also was part of a three-judge panel that declined last August to block the Biden administration's COVID-19 pandemic-related residential eviction moratorium, a decision that was later overturned by the Supreme Court.
Jackson previously won Senate confirmation in 2013 after Democratic former President Barack Obama nominated her as a Washington-based federal district judge. In her eight years in that role, she handled a number of high-profile cases including one in which she ruled that Trump's one-time chief White House lawyer, Donald McGahn, had to comply with a congressional subpoena for testimony about potential Trump obstruction of a special counsel investigation.
""The primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that Presidents are not kings,"" Jackson wrote. 
The ruling was appealed and, after Biden took office, a settlement was reached. McGahn testified behind closed doors. 
Biden has pledged to appoint a Black woman to the Supreme Court. It has had only two Black justices, both men: Clarence Thomas, appointed in 1991 and still serving, and Thurgood Marshall, who retired in 1991 and died in 1993. 
During her April 2021 confirmation hearing for her current job, Jackson said her background, both personal and professional, would ""bring value"" to the bench, though she rejected suggestions by Republican senators that race could affect her rulings.
""I've experienced life in perhaps a different way than some of my colleagues because of who I am,"" Jackson said.
Three Republican senators joined Biden's fellow Democrats in voting to confirm Jackson.
Jackson would become the sixth woman ever to serve on the Supreme Court, joining current members Amy Coney Barrett, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, the retired Sandra Day O'Connor and the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
As a judge, Jackson in 2019 blocked Trump's plan to expedite removal of certain immigrants and in 2018 ruled against his administration's proposal to make it easier to fire federal employees - decisions later reversed by the appellate court on which she now serves.
'PROFESSIONAL VAGABOND'
Biden has sought to bring more women and minorities and a broader range of backgrounds to a federal judiciary dominated by jurists who had been corporate lawyers or prosecutors.
Jackson was raised in Miami and attended Harvard University, where she once shared a scene in a drama class with future Hollywood star Matt Damon, before graduating from Harvard Law School in 1996.
Jackson in 2017 described herself as a ""professional vagabond"" earlier in her legal career, moving from job to job as she sought a work-life balance while raising a family. She and her husband, a surgeon, have two daughters.
She worked from 2005 to 2007 as a court-appointed lawyer paid by the government to represent criminal defendants who could not afford counsel. Among her clients was Khi Ali Gul, an Afghan detainee at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The United States sent him back to Afghanistan in 2014 when she was no longer involved in the case.
Jackson worked from 2002 to 2004 for Kenneth Feinberg, the lawyer known for overseeing compensation programs including one for victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.
Jackson in 2020 paid tribute to Breyer during a virtual conference in which they both participated, saying he ""opened doors of opportunities"" not just through his judicial decisions but also by hiring a diverse group of law clerks.
""As a descendant of slaves,"" Jackson added, ""let me just say that, Justice (Breyer), your thoughtfulness in that regard has made a world of difference.""
Republican former House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, whose brother-in-law is her husband's twin brother, is among Jackson's fans.

""Now our politics may differ,"" Ryan said at her 2013 Senate confirmation hearing, ""but my praise for Ketanji's intellect, for her character, for her integrity, it is unequivocal."" 
(In 2nd paragraph below subhead, corrects year Jackson graduated from law school to 1996, not 1992)

(Reuters) - Before she turned to law and became one of the youngest justices ever appointed to the California Supreme Court, Leondra Kruger had journalism in her blood. 
Kruger, considered a potential U.S. Supreme Court nominee for President Joe Biden to replace the retiring Justice Stephen Breyer https://www.reuters.com/world/us/liberal-us-supreme-court-justice-stephen-breyer-retire-media-reports-2022-01-26, was editor-in-chief of her high school's newspaper. Later, at Harvard University, she wrote for the daily student paper, the Crimson. While attending Yale Law School, she became editor-in-chief of the Yale Law Journal. 
The reputation she gained as a young journalist for being thoughtful and careful has followed her to the judiciary, where the 45-year-old jurist has become known for her incremental approach to deciding cases. 
Her moderate approach might help her win confirmation in a U.S. Senate evenly split between Democrats and Republicans if Biden chooses her to replace Breyer. Kruger would make history as the first Black woman to serve on the top U.S. judicial body.
""I see her as cautious in her use of judicial power,"" said David Ettinger, a Los Angeles attorney who is an expert on the California Supreme Court. ""I think she's concerned about digging into the details of legal issues, rather than letting ideological predilections determine the outcome of the case.""
Biden has promised to appoint a Black woman to the Supreme Court. It has had only two Black justices, both men: Clarence Thomas, appointed in 1991 and still serving, and Thurgood Marshall, who retired in 1991 and died in 1993. If confirmed, Kruger also would become the sixth woman ever to serve on the Supreme Court. 
Kruger previously worked at the U.S. Justice Department under presidents of both parties, arguing 12 cases before the Supreme Court.
Democratic former California Governor Jerry Brown named Kruger to the top court in the most populous U.S. state in 2014 when she was age 38. Kruger's former colleagues, both Democrat and Republican, praised the move. Paul Clement, who served as U.S. solicitor general under Republican former President George W. Bush, said at the time, ""She combines an understated and easygoing manner with a keen legal mind and unquestioned integrity.""
MODERATE VOICE
Observers of the liberal-leaning, seven-member California high court said, while its rulings are largely unanimous, Kruger probably straddles its ideological middle - moderately liberal on civil cases, more conservative on criminal matters. 
During seven years on the California Supreme Court, Kruger has participated in a number of other important cases. 
In 2018, Kruger authored https://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/archive/S223698.PDF a 4-3 ruling that upheld a law requiring people arrested for suspected felonies to provide DNA specimens, even before charges are filed. The dissenting justices warned of a ""biological dragnet"" that was not ""carefully calibrated to identify felony offenders.""
Kruger's ruling was narrow. Evoking the principle of ""judicial restraint,"" she emphasized the seriousness of the crime at issue in that specific case - arson - and left open the possibility of other challenges in different circumstances. 
In 2019, Kruger joined a unanimous ruling that struck down https://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/2019/s257302.html a Democratic-backed state law targeting Republican former President Donald Trump that sought to prevent him from appearing as a candidate on California's presidential primary ballot because he did not disclose his personal income tax returns. 
""My approach reflects the fact that we operate in a system of precedent,"" Kruger told the Los Angeles Times in 2018. ""I aim to perform my job in a way that enhances the predictability and stability of the law and public confidence and trust in the work of the courts.""
In 2019, Kruger wrote a unanimous ruling that upheld a white supremacist's convictions, including for murder, but overturned https://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/archive/S148462.PDF the death sentence because the prosecution had invited the jury to weigh the man's racist beliefs in determining whether to impose the death penalty. 
In the case of Scott Peterson, who was convicted of murdering his wife Laci and unborn son during a 2004 trial that drew outsized media coverage, Kruger in 2020 wrote a unanimous ruling affirming his conviction but overturning https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crime-peterson/top-california-court-overturns-death-penalty-of-scott-peterson-who-murdered-pregnant-wife-idUSKBN25K2F7 his death penalty due to errors in jury selection. 
Growing up in the Los Angeles area, Kruger attended Polytechnic, a private high school in Pasadena. A former schoolmate who edited her work on the school newspaper called Kruger ""cool and calm"" in an article published in 2020. 

She ""could be funny and gossipy with friends, but she chose her words with great care, which made you listen more closely,"" wrote https://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/2020/10/27/leondra-kruger-jim-ho-supreme-court-high-school-memories/ideas/connecting-california Joe Mathews in Zocalo Public Square, a Los Angeles-based publication. 
Kruger's mother, who moved to the United States from Jamaica, and father, the son of Eastern European Jewish immigrants, were both pediatricians. She is married to Brian Hauck, also a lawyer in San Francisco. The couple has two young children.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department has filed criminal charges against a man for allegedly selling the gun that another man later used to take hostages at a synagogue in Colleyville, Texas.
Henry “Michael” Williams, 32, is charged in a complaint with being a felon in possession of a firearm. He made his initial appearance before a federal judge on Wednesday, and the government is seeking to have him detained pending trial at a hearing on Jan. 31.
On Jan. 15, British-born gunman Malik Faisal Akram took four people hostage at Congregation Beth Israel, including its rabbi, Charlie Cytron-Walker, after they had invited him inside for tea during a worship service.
He brandished a gun and held them hostage for 10 hours. The standoff ended in gunfire, with all four hostages released unharmed and the suspect dead.
During the standoff, Akram demanded to speak with a Jewish leader in New York, and also asked FBI negotiators to release Aafia Siddiqui, who is serving an 86-year sentence for terrorism offenses at a federal facility in nearby Fort Worth, Texas.
The Justice Department said on Wednesday that Williams has a prior conviction for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and attempted possession of a controlled substance.
He is accused of selling Akram a semi-automatic Taurus G2C pistol on Jan. 13. The handgun was recovered by federal agents two days later at the scene of the hostage crisis.
According to the complaint, agents were able to track Williams down through cellphone records. 
He told them he recalled meeting a man with a British accent, but could not recall the man's name.
In a subsequent interview with law enforcement, he further confirmed brokering a gun sale with Akram, and said Akram told him the gun would be used for ""intimidation"" to recover money from someone who had an outstanding debt with him.

Williams told the agents he sold Akram the gun for $150.
""During the custodial interview with Williams on January 24, 2022, Williams stated to the interviewing agents that he knew he was not allowed to be in possession of a firearm and that he knew conducting the sale of the gun to Akram was illegal,"" the complaint says.

PARIS (Reuters) - The French government said this week it was closing down an activist-run media outlet and a Muslim website deemed at odds with ""national values"", the latest in a series of steps that rights groups and lawyers say infringe on democratic freedoms.
Following a violent protest against the extreme right in Nantes, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said he would shut down ""Nantes Révoltée"", a local media platform, which had relayed information about the protest.
Days earlier, he had announced plans to close the website ""La Voie Droite"", which publishes Islamic religious content.
The government has been making increasing use of powers to shut down organisations or groups. In the last two years, there have been 12 such shutdowns, an uptick from seven between 2016 and 2019, according to French public records.
Before dissolving an association, the Ministry of Interior informs the concerned party, which has 15 days to reply with its counter-arguments. Then, once the decree is published, the organisation can take the case to the Council of State, an administrative court.
To date, Nante Révoltée says it has not received any communication from the Ministry of Interior regarding its closure.
Of the organisations shut by decree since January 2020, seven are Muslim-related, including associations to run mosques, a humanitarian organisation and anti-Islamophobia groups, the records show. Three far-right groups have been closed.
Announcing the plan to close ""Nantes Révoltée"" to MPs in the French parliament on Tuesday, Darmanin described it as an ""ultra-left"" group that had repeatedly called for violence against the state and the police in the run-up to the weekend protest, at which three people were arrested, shop windows were broken and fights broke out.
Raphael Kempf, a lawyer for Nantes Révoltée, said that a website sharing information on an event could not be held responsible for what happens there.
""We are seeing a government that is using this legal tool to attack voices that criticise them,"" says Kempf, adding that the government now has enhanced powers under 2021 legislation that makes inciting violence grounds for dissolution. Previously the groups had to themselves be armed or violent.
CRITICAL VOICES
The 2021 legislation was introduced in response to violent attacks that France has seen in recent years, including the beheading of schoolteacher Samuel Paty in 2020 and the 2015 attacks on Paris that killed 130 people.
But some lawyers and campaign groups say the authorities are overreaching to muzzle critical voices and target anyone practising a form of Islam not approved by the state.
During a TV interview on Sunday, Darmanin announced the Islamic website ""La Voie Droite"" would be closed using the 2021 legislation for ""content inciting for hatred and calling for jihad"".
La Voie Droite denied publishing such content, saying in a statement that ""when we encourage Muslims to respect the texts, it is opposed to any type of threat or legitimation of violence"".
The French Interior Ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
In another step that has alarmed some rights groups, the French government has ramped up censorship of content on the internet deemed to be terrorist-related or justifying violence under a 2014 law. Officials say that is necessary to stem violent attacks.

Noémie Levain, a lawyer with digital rights organisation La Quadrature du Net, said these powers were open to abuse.
""The decision-making process is opaque,"" she said. ""[The police] can designate something Muslim as problematic even if it is not violent, they can do the same with something activist that is calling to protest.""

There were more than 8 million new cases, 32% higher than the previous week, while fatalities throughout the region also increased by 37%, with 18,000 new deaths caused by COVID-19.
The United States continues to have the highest number of new infections, although cases decreased by nearly 1 million over the last week, the regional health agency said. 
Mexico's southern states have seen new infections triple and Brazil has seen new cases surge 193% over the last seven days, PAHO said in weekly briefing.
Children in the Americas are facing the worst educational crisis ever seen in the region, with millions of children yet to return to classes, according to PAHO, which recommended that countries try to get them safely back to school to protect their social, mental and physical wellbeing.
It urged parents to get their children vaccinated.

Many countries have already authorized and are safely administering COVID vaccines to adolescents, PAHO said.
Last week, the WHO’s expert group on immunization authorized the COVID vaccine developed by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) for children aged 5 to 12 years, offering a roadmap for countries to roll out vaccines for them, the regional agency said.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said that with the extra supplies, its staff and volunteers are stepping up deliveries of drinking water and setting up shelters across the country's many islands.
""This disaster has shaken the people of Tonga like nothing we have seen in our lifetime,"" Sione Taumoefolau, secretary general of Tonga Red Cross, said in a statement. ""The tsunami has wiped out homes and villages, but we are already rebuilding amid the ashes."" 
The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), said the United States is providing an additional $2.5 million in humanitarian assistance and the guided-missile destroyer USS Sampson, part of a multinational effort, arrived this week to support the efforts in Tonga.
The Australian government said on Wednesday it will provide an additional A$2 million ($1.43 million) in humanitarian funding to Tonga, bringing Australia's commitment to date to $3 million.
It also said that Australia is widening its support, including through the restoration of power and communications, and the storage and delivery of relief supplies. 
An Australian warship arrived to coronavirus-free Tonga on Wednesday evening, delivering aid without human contact after about two dozen cases of COVID-19 have been recorded among the crew. 
""The ship is undertaking an entirely contactless delivery of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief supplies,"" Austarlia's Foreign Minister Marise Payne, Defence Minister Peter Dutton and Minister for International Development and the Pacific Zed Seselja said in a joint statement.
Tonga's Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Broadcasting radio cited Tonga's Health Minister  Saia  (NASDAQ:SAIA) Piukala as saying that 29 positive cases had been reported onboard of the HMAS Adelaide, but all the positive personnel were asymptomatic.
""Australians from the ship will unload their cargoes and sail from port,"" Piukala said. 
The United Nations, Red Cross and other relief agencies on the ground in Tonga have warned that a COVID-19 outbreak in the island would be catastrophic at this time.
""There is an urgent need for people to have access to safe water sources in the days and weeks to come,"" Taumoefolau said. 

The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano eruption triggered a tsunami that destroyed villages and resorts and knocked out communications for the nation of about 105,000 people. Three people have been reported killed, authorities said.

DAKAR (Reuters) - Earlier this month, West African countries slapped tough economic sanctions on Mali to punish coup leaders seeking to extend their hold on power, and to halt a run of military takeovers that have beset the region since 2020.
Burkina Faso's military did not get the message. On Monday, two weeks after the 15-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) announced the sanctions, the Burkinabe army arrested President Roch Kabore and seized power https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/burkina-faso-president-kabore-detained-military-camp-sources-tell-reuters-2022-01-24.
As the international community condemned West Africa's fourth coup in 18 months, crowds in the capital Ouagadougou cheered https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/burkina-faso-crowd-celebrates-west-africas-latest-coup-2022-01-25 the Burkinabe army - a contrast to anti-coup protests that erupted when the military briefly seized power in 2015.
The reaction echoed scenes in Mali and Guinea, whose coup leaders received warm welcomes at home.
West African nations and international allies have struggled to mount an effective response, as populations lose faith in governments many see as manipulating the democratic process and unable to alleviate poverty or repel Islamist militant violence.
The problems pre-date recent coups. Unlike its vocal opposition to military takeovers, ECOWAS remained silent as sitting presidents maintained their grip on power by extending terms under what critics call ""constitutional coups"".
""Today, ECOWAS is not a credible institution to people,"" said Abdoulaye Barry, a Burkinabe researcher at the United Nations' University for Peace.
""As long as they are not going to offer adequate responses to the governance deficit, coups are going to multiply.""
An ECOWAS spokesperson was not available to comment on its track record.
Other countries, including France and European allies, have maintained a military presence in the region, and partner local armed forces to fight groups like al Qaeda and Islamic State, meaning military support continues despite criticism of coups.
France in particular has deployed thousands of troops to West Africa's Sahel region over the past decade, but security has progressively deteriorated, fuelling anti-French sentiment.
OPENING FOR RUSSIA?
The sanctions and international condemnations have arguably bolstered coup leaders' standing at home.
Mali's military-led transitional government, which took power in an August 2020 coup, went back on a commitment to hold elections next month. Instead, it proposed to rule for another four years.
ECOWAS' sanctions included locking Mali out of regional financial markets and closing its borders, potentially devastating blows for the impoverished landlocked country.
Although the pain caused by rising food prices and shortages could yet turn people against the authorities, forcing the junta to the negotiating table, for now sanctions appear to be having the opposite effect.
Protests against the sanctions, which even some critics of the junta criticise as draconian, drew tens of thousands into the streets. People held signs that read: ""Down with ECOWAS"" and ""Down with France"".
Coup leaders have found new allies. As tensions with France rose, Mali's interim government struck a deal with Russia to send in military trainers https://www.reuters.com/world/mali-denies-deployment-russian-mercenaries-says-only-trainers-present-2021-12-25.
France and its Western allies say many of these trainers are mercenaries from a private military contractor under European Union sanctions. Malian authorities deny this.
""Coalitions outside the traditional U.N. structures are emerging and staking a claim to security and economic partnerships in Africa,"" a West African diplomat said, citing Russia, China, Turkey and the Gulf States.
On Tuesday, Alexander Ivanov, the official representative of Russian military trainers in Central African Republic, issued a statement on the situation in Burkina Faso.
""I believe that if Russian instructors are invited to train the Burkina Faso army, they will be able to do so effectively,"" Ivanov said.
The new Burkinabe authorities have not commented on any potential Russian deployment. At the pro-coup rally on Tuesday, some in the crowd held Russian flags.
Alliances closer to home may also undermine attempts to punish military takeovers.
When ECOWAS ordered member states to close borders with Mali, Guinea said it would not comply, allowing continued access to the port of Conakry. The junta in Burkina Faso, which also borders Mali, has not yet said if it will do the same.
ROOT CAUSES
ECOWAS, founded in 1975 to promote economic integration in post-colonial West Africa, can still inflict pain through sanctions.
Nearly 30% of Mali's trade is with ECOWAS member states, according to U.N. data, and food prices are starting to rise in the capital Bamako, residents say. 
But diplomats and analysts said the influence of ECOWAS and foreign powers traditionally active in the region has been hampered by eroding credibility.
Some traced that back to 2015, when the bloc came close to banning presidential third terms after Burkina Faso's veteran leader Blaise Compaore was ousted the previous year in an uprising sparked by his efforts to extend his time in office.
Such a move would have been a first for an African regional body, but it never happened. 
ECOWAS was silent in 2020 as the presidents of Guinea and Ivory Coast won third terms after altering constitutions that barred them from running again.
""ECOWAS needs to address the root causes of the recent coups ... including the situations where governments manipulate the constitutions to remain in power,"" said Said Djinnit, the former commissioner for peace and security at the African Union and top U.N. diplomat in West Africa.

Anger over Guinean President Alpha Conde's third term was one of the reasons the military cited when it overthrew him last September.
Guinea's ruling junta has promised to oversee a transition back to democracy but has declined to set a date for elections. ECOWAS has imposed targeted sanctions against junta members and their families.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) -Thousands rallied against the mistreatment of Indigenous people across Australia on Wednesday as citizenship ceremonies took place to mark the country's national day intended to celebrate the birth of modern Australia. 
The Jan. 26 public holiday marks the date the British fleet sailed into Sydney Harbour in 1788 to start a penal colony, viewing the land as unoccupied despite encountering settlements.
But for many Indigenous Australians, who trace their lineage on the continent back 50,000 years, it is ""Invasion Day"".
Many protesters at rallies across cities dressed in black to mourn the day, with some carrying the Aboriginal flag and ""change the date"" signs. Some protests were organised online amidst concerns of surging COVID-19 cases. 
A monument depicting Captain James Cook, who arrived in the Pacific 252 years ago triggering British colonisation of the region, was doused in red paint overnight in Melbourne. 
Speaking at the national flag-raising and citizenship ceremony in Australia's capital, Canberra, Prime Minister Scott Morrison honoured the traditional custodians of the country.
""We recognise Indigenous peoples right across our land from the Torres Strait Islander people in the north, to the people in Tasmania, to the people across the Nullarbor in Perth and the Larrakia people in the Top End,"" Morrison said.
""Like the country itself, Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are diverse, they're unique and they connect us through time.""
While the Australian Day remains contentious, this week's poll by the market research company Roy Morgan showed nearly two-thirds of Australians say that Jan. 26 should be considered ""Australia Day"". The rest say it should be ""Invasion Day.""
Australia's 700,000 or so Indigenous people track near the bottom of its 25 million citizens in almost every economic and social indicator. Living often in remote communities, they also have been at greater risk from COVID. 
Most of the 200 or so Aboriginal communities spread across Western Australia are closed to tourists and travellers. 
The main Aboriginal health body of Central Australia, a vast outback region in the Northern Territory centred on the town of Alice Springs, called on Tuesday for a ""complete lockdown"" of the area to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

The Northern Territory, home to about 247,000 people, recorded 492 new cases on Wednesday, bringing the total number of active cases to 3,208, with 84 people in hospitals. 
Australia on Wednesday recorded at least 87 deaths from the virus, the highest number of COVID deaths in a day since the start of the pandemic, as the highly-infections Omicron variant tore through the country.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday rejected opposition calls to resign for attending lockdown parties but accepted that a rule that ministers should lose their jobs if they had knowlingly misled parliament applied to him.
Johnson, who in 2019 won the biggest Conservative majority in more than 30 years, is braced for the publication of an official investigation into claims that there were multiple boozy Downing Street parties https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/lockdown-party-allegations-facing-uk-pm-johnson-2022-01-13 during lockdowns. He told parliament no rules were broken.
It was not immediately clear when the results of that investigation by Cabinet Office official Sue Gray would be published, especially as police have opened their own investigation. 
Asked by the opposition Labour Party Keir Starmer leader if the ministerial code, which says that ministers who had knowingly misled parliament should offer to resign, applied to him Johnson said: ""Of course.""
""If he'd misled parliament, he must resign,"" Starmer told parliament. ""Will you now resign?""
""No,"" Johnson replied. 
He said he could not speak about investigations into the alleged parties. Johnson said his government was focused on driving economic growth and leading the Western response to the Ukraine crisis. 
Johnson has given a variety of explanations about the parties: first he said no rules had been broken but then he apologised to the British people for the apparent hypocrisy of such gatherings. 
He has denied an allegation he was warned that a ""bring your own booze"" lockdown gathering on May 20, 2020, which he says he thought was a work event, was inappropriate.
 ITV  (LON:ITV) reported on Monday that Johnson and his now wife Carrie had attended a surprise party of up to 30 people for his birthday in the Cabinet Room at Downing Street in June 2020, when indoor gatherings were banned.
PARTY CULTURE 
British police on Tuesday said they had opened their own investigation into lockdown events at Downing Street, upping the pressure on Johnson.
Some of his lawmakers have already demanded he resign but to trigger a leadership challenge, 54 of the 359 Conservative MPs in parliament must write letters of no confidence to the chairman of the party's 1922 Committee.
The number of letters submitted is kept secret until the threshhold of 54 is reached.
British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, tipped as a possible future prime minister if Johnson is toppled, said Downing Street had not yet been given the findings of the Gray report but that it would come out very soon.
Asked about the claims that Johnson and his staff had partied at the heart of the British state while ordinary people were banned from even bidding farewell to their dying relatives in person, Truss said some of the reports were concerning.

""There clearly needs to be a change in culture,"" Truss told the BBC. ""We need to get the results of the report, we need to look at the results and fix the issues there are.""
Asked if she had leadership ambitions, Truss said Johnson, 57, had done a great job as prime minister by delivering Brexit and responding to the COVID pandemic. Truss said she was 100% supportive of Johnson.

Asked if he would step down, Johnson replied: ""No.""

""I don't deny it, and for all sorts of reasons, many people may want me out of the way, but the reason why he (Starmer) wants me out of the way is because he knows this government can be trusted to deliver,"" he said to cheers from his Conservative lawmakers.

Mexico is one of the world's most dangerous countries for journalists, and some 145 have been killed between 2000-2021, according to Article 19, an advocacy group.
Mexican journalist networks voted to stage the gatherings, which will coincide with online protest campaigns.
""It is matter of urgency that state and federal authorities prevent attacks, protect journalists when they are victims, and investigate crimes committed against the press with due diligence,"" Article 19 said in a statement.
Maldonado's murder in the northern border city of Tijuana, where she worked for many years, followed the killings of two other Mexican journalists this month.

Lopez Obrador, who has been criticized for not doing more to protect reporters, said his government would investigate and ""clear up this crime to prevent further murders of journalists"". 
Critics say Lopez Obrador has failed to deliver on pledges to reduce violence, combat deeply entrenched organized crime, or reduce impunity. The president says crime and violence are the products of chronic corruption and inequality.

LONDON (Reuters) - John Lennon's son Julian is auctioning off pieces of memorabilia relating to the Beatles, including three guitars given to him by his father and handwritten notes about the 1968 song ""Hey Jude"" - but not physically. 
Instead, the auction is a sale of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), a type of digital asset. Each winning bidder will be able to claim ownership of a digital file described as an ""audio/visual collectible"" in which Julian Lennon narrates a ""specific heartfelt memory"".
""I feel incredibly lucky to live in a day and age where innovation allows me to share such personal pieces of my Lennon family history,"" said Julian Lennon, who is a singer-songwriter, writer and artist.
""Through this NFT collection, I'm able to grant exclusive access to special items that I cherish and carry on the legacy of my father in a new way.""
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) use blockchain to record who owns a digital file, such as an image, video or text.
Although NFTs are sometimes sold alongside physical items, as a sort of digital certificate of authenticity, owning an NFT does not confer ownership of the underlying item - rather, it can be thought of as a kind of digital bragging rights. 
Such sales have nevertheless exploded in popularity, with NFT artworks selling for millions of dollars.
In this case, the buyers of the Beatles NFTs will not receive a guitar or physical piece of paper. What they will get is a unit of blockchain data recording that their crypto wallets own an NFT linked to a digital file showing the item.
So for the ""Hey Jude"" notes, which show Paul McCartney's doodles and drawings, the buyer will receive an NFT of an image of the object ""brought to life in an even more personal way through Julian Lennon's exclusive audio narration"", the auction website says.
Bids on this NFT were at $50,000 as of Tuesday afternoon.
""It really made me learn to love Dad again because I just saw him the way I remembered him back in the day when I was a kid and when I was with him around those years,"" said Julian in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday. 
""So it was very special to me.""
The sale also includes an NFT representing an image of an Afghan coat that John Lennon wore on the set of the 1967 film ""Magical Mystery Tour"" and an NFT of an image of a black cape he wore in the 1965 film ""Help!"". Bids on these were last at $8,000 and $6,000 respectively.
Surging interest in crypto assets has led traditional auction houses such as Christie's into NFT sales. The Lennon auction is run by Julien's Auctions and YellowHeart NFT and closes on Feb. 7. 
Bids can be placed online or at a physical auction in Beverly Hills. Payments are allowed in various cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, ether and dogecoin. 

An unspecified portion of the proceeds will be donated to the White Feather Foundation, which Julian Lennon said in a Tweet would ""offset"" the carbon emissions linked to the auction via a carbon removal marketplace called Nori.
The blockchain technology used for NFTs and cryptocurrencies has been criticized for their large carbon footprints.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia held military drills on Wednesday and deployed more forces and fighter jets to Belarus for exercises next month as officials prepared to sit down for four-way talks in Paris on the conflict in east Ukraine.
The Kremlin's point man on Ukraine was due to meet officials from France, Germany and Ukraine for ""Normandy format"" talks in Paris against the backdrop of a Russian military buildup near Ukraine that has sparked fears of an invasion.
Russia insists it does not plan to invade, but the West has threatened severe economic penalties if that does happen. U.S. President Joe Biden said on Tuesday he would consider personal sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin and Britain said on Wednesday it would not rule out doing the same.
The Normandy talks to end the war in eastern Ukraine between Kyiv and Russia-backed separatists have met for years without real progress, but Wednesday's talks may be seen as a positive sign of diplomacy taking place despite the soaring tensions. 
The confrontation over Ukraine triggered a sell-off on Russian markets this week and the rouble was down again on Wednesday.
Interfax news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying it deployed a paratrooper unit to Belarus on Wednesday, a day after moving in artillery forces and marines ahead of joint exercises next month. It said Russia was also moving Su-35 fighter jets to Belarus for the ""Allied Resolve"" exercises.
The buildup of Russian forces in Belarus, north of Ukraine, creates a new front for a possible attack.
Separately, Russian artillery forces in the southern Rostov region that borders Ukraine were set to practice firing later on Wednesday as part of a combat readiness inspection of the Southern Military District, the Defence Ministry said. 
In the far north, Russian warships entered the Barents Sea to practice protecting a major shipping lane in the Arctic, the Northern Fleet said. Moscow announced sweeping naval exercises last week. 

A spokesman for Dmitry Kozak, the Kremlin's representative on Ukraine, said the talks in Paris would start at 1100 GMT with a news briefing expected after 1400.
Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskiy, said Ukraine ruled out talking directly to the Russian-backed separatists.

Although the numbers for Beijing's outbreak since Jan. 15 are lower than elsewhere in the world, the city has ordered targeted lockdowns for tens of thousands of people and tested a few million residents to block infection. 
The restrictions, in line with a national effort to curb virus flare-ups as soon as possible, take on extra urgency as China has vowed to safely host the Winter Games and prevent major outbreaks during the Lunar New Year travel season. 
Tuesday's 14 cases with confirmed symptoms in Beijing account for more than half of the 24 infections nationwide, data from the National Health Commission (NHC) showed. 
The capital has found a total of 55 local cases with symptoms since Jan. 15, the data shows. Beijing officials have blamed the Delta variant for most cases in the current outbreak, with a handful attributed to the highly transmissible Omicron.
In addition to Beijing, the provinces of Heilongjiang, Hebei, Liaoning, Henan and Guangdong as well as the northwestern region of Xinjiang all reported sporadic local cases with confirmed symptoms for Tuesday, NHC data showed. 
The eastern city of Hangzhou in Zhejiang province found one person infected with Omicron, state television said on Wednesday. His travel history showed he had not left the city since Jan. 14. 
In Horgos, a city in Xinjiang, two asymptomatic infected people were found to have caught the Omicron variant, state television said on Tuesday. The source of the virus was unclear as the two had not left the city in two weeks. 
At least seven provinces, regions and municipalities in China have found locally transmitted Omicron infections, while the total number of cases is unknown. 

With no new deaths on Tuesday, China's death toll in the pandemic stayed at 4,636.
By Jan. 25, mainland China had a total of 105,749 cases with confirmed symptoms, including both locals and arrivals from abroad.

Oleg Navalny, whose whereabouts are unknown, was last year held under house arrest between January and April and handed a one-year suspended sentence for violating safety regulations linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Those charges were filed after he took part in a Moscow rally against his brother Alexei's arrest.
The Federal Penitentiary Service will petition a Moscow court on Feb. 18 to sentence Oleg Navalny to jail time for failing to comply with restrictions imposed against him for violating safety regulations, his lawyer said on Wednesday.
The 38-year-old was released from prison in 2018 after serving three-and-a-half years for an embezzlement conviction that critics say was designed to pressure his brother and smother dissent.

Alexei Navalny was given a suspended sentence in the same case, converted into a prison term last year because of alleged parole violations. He says the charges against him are politically motivated.
An anti-corruption campaigner and high-profile critic of President Vladimir Putin for the past decade, he survived being poisoned with a nerve agent in 2020 and his political network was banned as ""extremist"" last year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. State Department is considering whether to authorize departures for American diplomats and their families in China who wish to leave due to the U.S. government's inability to prevent Chinese authorities from subjecting them to intrusive pandemic control measures, sources told Reuters.
Two sources familiar with the issue said the U.S. Embassy on Monday had sent the request to Washington for formal sign off, as China ramps up COVID-19 containment protocols ahead of the opening of the Beijing Winter Olympics in less than two weeks.
The sources, speaking to Reuters on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue, added that some embassy staff are upset the U.S. government has been unwilling or unable to exempt American officials from strict quarantine measures. 
The rules include possible forced admittance to COVID fever clinics and separation from children.
The State Department told Reuters in a statement on Tuesday the operating status at its embassy and consulates in China had not changed.
""Any change in operating status of this nature would be predicated solely on the health, safety, and security of our colleagues and their family members,"" a department spokesperson said.
In Beijing, a foreign ministry spokesman said China's anti-epidemic measures were scientific and conformed with diplomatic treaties.
Leaving China would increase the chances of getting infected, the spokesman, Zhao Lijian, told a daily news briefing.
One person said the U.S. Embassy conducted an internal survey showing that as many as 25% of staff and family members would choose to leave China as soon as possible.
Home quarantine for diplomats should be a baseline requirement, and admission to Chinese fever clinics and hospitals should be voluntary, the person said, adding that the U.S. government should have imposed retaliatory measures for such requirements but failed to do so. 
A second person said embassy leadership had failed to get appropriate assurances from China on the treatment of U.S. diplomats throughout the pandemic.
In the early months of the pandemic, the U.S. government evacuated some 1,300 U.S. diplomats and family members from China, and the two governments remained at an impasse for months over testing and quarantine procedures for officials.
China requires foreign diplomats to abide by pandemic control rules like quarantines and testing on arrival, although some foreign envoys have not had to enter government-designated quarantine hotels.
China has quickly stepped up measures to block the further spread of COVID as the Feb. 4 opening of the Beijing Winter Olympics approaches, though flare-ups of the virus have persisted throughout the city. 
One Beijing district on Tuesday was set to begin a new round of tests among its roughly 2 million residents.

China's nationalist Global Times tabloid called the State Department's consideration of the policy a ""dirty trick"" intended to disrupt China's hosting of the Olympics. 
The United States has led several allied and partner countries in a diplomatic boycott of the Games due to what it says is the Chinese government's ongoing genocide toward Uyghurs and other Muslim groups in its western region of Xinjiang.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's security chief said on Wednesday that his government would strengthen laws against espionage as part of extra national security legislation now being drafted.
Secretary for Security Chris Tang told the city's legislature that Hong Kong's existing laws against spying, contained in the British-era Official Secrets Ordinance, could not reflect the ""importance"" of the crime.
""We will reflect the importance of spies in the legislation,"" said Tang, the city's former top policeman.
The government is drafting legislation to cover a range of security crimes to meet its obligations under Article 23 of the Basic Law - its mini-constitution following its 1997 handover from British colonial rule.
Article 23 says Hong Kong must enact laws ""on its own"" against crimes including treason, secession, theft of state secrets and activities by foreign political groups. 
The city government's last attempt to pass those laws, in 2003, triggered street protests by Hong Kong people who saw the legislation as a threat to the city's special freedoms.
Some diplomats, legal scholars and activists say the Article 23 legislation will significantly extend the scope and reach of a national security law that Beijing imposed on Hong Kong in 2020.
Tang said the existing ordinance was too limited when it came to provisions including giving information useful to an enemy.
""We feel that the definitions are not enough for us to combat all manner of espionage activities,"" he said.
As well as espionage, Tang said the legislation would outline specific crimes of treason, sedition, theft of state secrets as well as forbidding activities by foreign political groups inside Hong Kong and ties between such groups and local organisations.
The drafting is expected to be completed in the next few months and to be introduced after the city's new leader takes office in July, government officials have said.

Critics say the national security law has put freedoms at risk with tough bail provisions and expanded police powers under a legal regime that punishes subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
Hong Kong and Chinese officials say the law was vital to ensure stability after the Asian financial hub was rocked by sometimes-violent pro-democracy protests for much of 2019, and say prosecutions are not political.

(Reuters) - San Francisco city leaders pledged to step up policing in Asian-American communities on Tuesday after statistics showed that 60 hate crimes were committed against Asians in the city during 2021, up from only nine the year before.
San Francisco is the latest major U.S. city to have marked a sharp upswing in hate crimes against Asian Americans in the past year. New York City police said in December that 129 such incidents had been reported in 2021, compared with 28 in 2020.
San Francisco's police chief, William Scott, told a news conference that he had already ordered increased officer presence and patrols in Chinatown despite staffing shortages he blamed on the COVID-19 pandemic.
""If anybody thinks San Francisco is an easy place to come in and terrorize our Asian communities, you are sadly mistaken. And you will be held accountable. You will be arrested and you will be charged,"" Scott said. 
Scott and Mayor London Breed sought to reassure residents of the city's large Asian-American community ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year, which begins on Feb. 1 and will be celebrated in San Francisco with a parade on Feb. 19.
""This is an extraordinary community and I am heartbroken, I'm frustrated, I'm embarrassed, I'm angry about the violence that has continued to impact many of the people who are part of our Asian community but especially our seniors,"" Breed said.
Scott said that more than 30 of the hate crimes had been linked to a single individual who was arrested last August. 

The police chief did not name that suspect but appeared to be referring to Derik Barreto, 36, who was charged on Aug. 16 with smashing the windows of more than two dozen Chinese-owned businesses as he rode through the city on a scooter.
San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin faces a recall election in June, targeted by activists who accuse him of being soft on crime.

WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden said on Tuesday he would consider personal sanctions on President Vladimir Putin if Russia invades Ukraine, as Western leaders stepped up military preparations and made plans to shield Europe from a potential energy supply shock. 
The rare sanctions threat came as NATO places forces on standby https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/nato-sends-ships-jets-eastern-europe-ukraine-crisis-2022-01-24 and reinforces eastern Europe with more ships and fighter jets in response to Russia's troop build-up near its border with Ukraine. 
Russia denies planning an attack and says the crisis is being driven by NATO and U.S. actions. It is demanding security guarantees from the West, including a promise by NATO never to admit Ukraine. Moscow sees the former Soviet republic as a buffer between Russia and NATO countries.
Following multiple rounds of U.S.-Russia talks https://www.reuters.com/world/top-diplomats-us-russia-meet-geneva-soaring-ukraine-tensions-2022-01-21 over Ukraine that failed to reach a breakthrough, Biden, who has long warned Moscow of economic consequences, upped the ante on Tuesday by saying Putin could personally face sanctions. 
If Russia were to move into Ukraine with the estimated 100,000 soldiers it has massed near the border, Biden said it would be the ""largest invasion since World War Two"" and would ""change the world."" 
Speaking to reporters, Biden was asked if he would see himself imposing sanctions on Putin directly if Russia invaded Ukraine. ""Yes,"" he responded. ""I would see that.""
Direct U.S. sanctions on foreign leaders are rare but not unprecedented. Others who have faced sanctions include Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro, Syria's Bashar al-Assad and Libya's Muammer Gaddafi. 
On Tuesday, a U.S. plane carrying military equipment and munitions landed in Kyiv, the third installment of a $200 million package to shore up Ukraine's defenses. 
The Pentagon has put on alert https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-puts-8500-troops-alert-deploy-amid-ukraine-tensions-2022-01-24 about 8,500 U.S. troops in Europe and the United States to be ready to deploy to NATO's eastern flank if needed. 
Russia said it was watching with great concern https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kremlin-says-watching-us-actions-over-ukraine-with-great-concern-2022-01-25 and accused Washington of fuelling tensions over Ukraine, repeating its line that the crisis was being driven by U.S. and NATO actions rather than by its own build-up of forces near the Ukrainian border. 
Biden said on Tuesday he may deploy U.S. troops in the nearer term but ruled out sending unilateral U.S. forces to Ukraine, which is not a NATO member.
""There is not going to be any American forces moving into Ukraine,"" he said.
So far, NATO has about 4,000 troops in multinational battalions in Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland, backed by tanks, air defenses and intelligence and surveillance units.
As Western leaders appeal for unity, differences have emerged among European nations over how best to respond. Putin is due to meet https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-meeting-with-italy-business-elite-go-ahead-despite-ukraine-2022-01-25 Wednesday with the heads of some of the biggest companies in Italy, Russia's fifth biggest trading partner, despite the rising tensions. 
""It is absolutely vital that... the West is united now, because it is our unity now that will be much more effective in deterring any Russian aggression,"" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, adding Britain was discussing with the United States the possibility of banning Russia from the SWIFT global payments system.
French President Emmanuel Macron said he would seek clarification over Russia's intentions in a phone call with Putin set for Friday. Political advisers from Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France are due to meet in Paris on Wednesday.

With fears of a new Russian military assault high after its invasion of Crimea in 2014, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged his compatriots on Tuesday to stay calm and said work was underway to bring about a meeting between him and the leaders of Russia, Germany and France. 
""There are no rose-colored glasses, no childish illusions, everything is not simple. ... But there is hope,"" Zelenskiy said in a televised address. ""Protect your body from viruses, your brain from lies, your heart from panic.""
Ukraine is committed to seeking a diplomatic solution to the current tension with Russia, its ambassador to Japan, Sergiy Korsunsky, said on Wednesday, adding that he saw little chance of all-out war, although there might be smaller conflicts.
Korsunsky warned an attack on a country with more than a dozen nuclear reactors would bring about a devastating regional impact on Europe.
""I believe that full-scale war is very, very, very difficult to expect, but we may see more localised conflict,"" Korsunsky told a news conference in the Japanese capital Tokyo.
""If we come to military terms, let me tell you, we are very much ready, our army is very well prepared.""
In Washington, senior Biden administration officials said the United States was in talks with major energy-producing countries and companies around the world over a potential diversion of supplies to Europe https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-talks-with-energy-producers-supply-europe-if-russia-invades-ukraine-2022-01-25 if Russia invades Ukraine.
The EU depends on Russia for around a third of its gas supplies. Any interruptions to its Russian imports would exacerbate an existing energy crisis https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/could-more-lng-supplies-get-europe-event-crisis-2022-01-25 caused by shortages.
""We've... been working to identify additional volumes of non-Russian natural gas from North Africa and the Middle East, Asia, and the United States,"" White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters.
""We're in discussion with major natural gas producers around the globe to understand their capacity and willingness to temporarily surge natural gas output and to allocate these volumes to European buyers,"" she said. 

Psaki and other officials did not name specific countries or companies but said they included a broad range of suppliers, including sellers of liquefied natural gas (LNG). 
An escalated conflict would likely further increase energy costs for many countries, keeping headline inflation rates elevated for longer, said Gita Gopinath, first deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund.

""If war is going to happen, that will be the first ever in the history of mankind, war against a country which has on its territory 15 nuclear reactors, which has 30,000 km of gas and oil pipelines, full with gas and oil,"" said Korsunsky.
""If all these infrastructure is destroyed, there is no more Ukraine. But this is just one consequence. There is no more central Europe and probably western Europe would be affected, too."" 
An accident at the Chernobyl reactor, located in what is now Ukraine, spewed tonnes of nuclear waste into the atmosphere in 1986, spreading radioactivity across swathes of the continent and causing a spike in cancers in the more immediate region.
Russia's Ambassador to Australia, Alexey Pavlovsky, said on Wednesday that Russia did not plan to invade Ukraine.
""We don't intend to invade at all,"" Pavlovsky told Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio.

""Our troops on the border...These troops are not a threat, they are a warning. A warning to Ukraine’s rulers not to attempt any reckless military adventure,"" he said.

Rivera, Mora, and the third police officer, a rookie, responded to a 911 call in Harlem by a woman who said she was having a fight with one of her sons.
Shortly after police arrived on the scene, Rivera and Mora were fired upon in a narrow hallway by the woman's adult son. The rookie officer then shot the suspect McNeil.

MIAMI (Reuters) -Rescue crews searched late into the night on Tuesday for 39 people reported missing in the Atlantic off Florida by a man found clinging to a boat that capsized in what the U.S. Coast Guard called a suspected human smuggling attempt gone awry.
The survivor told authorities that he had left the Bahamas' Bimini islands, about 50 miles (80 km) east of Miami, in a boat with 39 other people on Saturday night, the Coast Guard said in a statement posted online.
According to the survivor, the group's vessel capsized on Sunday morning when it hit rough weather about 45 miles (72.4 km) east of Fort Pierce Inlet, off Florida's Atlantic coast about midway between Miami and Cape Canaveral, but no one was wearing a life jacket, the Coast Guard said. 
The accident coincided with a small-craft advisory posted in that area, with steady winds clocked at up to 23 miles (37 km) per hour and 9-foot (3-meter) seas, according to the Coast Guard.
A good Samaritan found the man perched on the mostly submerged hull of the overturned boat on Tuesday morning and rescued him before alerting the Coast Guard, which dispatched rescue vessels and aircraft to look for more victims.
The survivor was taken to hospital for treatment of dehydration and sun exposure.
Through Tuesday, Coast Guard cutter crews, helicopter teams, search planes and a U.S. Navy air crew criss-crossed an area spanning more than 1,300 square miles (3,367 square km), about the size of Rhode Island, between Bimini and Fort Pierce Inlet, the statement said.
""Air and surface crews will continue searching throughout the night,"" the Coast Guard's Miami-based southeastern district office said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) late on Tuesday.
The agency said in an earlier Twitter message that the incident was under investigation as ""a suspected human smuggling venture."" However, the nationalities of those who were aboard the vessel has yet to be determined, a Coast Guard spokesperson, Petty Officer Jose Hernandez, said.
It came on the heels of another ill-fated migrant crossing attempt that ended with 32 people rescued from a capsized vessel last Friday, west of Bimini, which has become frequent transit point for sea-going smugglers, Hernandez said.
Incidents of overturned or interdicted vessels crowded with people, many of them Haitians or Cubans seeking to reach the United States, are not uncommon in the waters off Florida.
In May of 2021, 12 Cuban migrants perished and eight were rescued after their boat flipped over off Key West, Florida. 
At least 557 Cuban migrants in all have been picked up at sea by the Coast Guard since October, in addition to nearly 7,400 Cubans interdicted during the previous five years, according to the agency. 

Vessel crossings of Haitian migrants have likewise grown more frequent as the Caribbean island nation deals with economic and political crises, as well as gang-related kidnappings. The Coast Guard said it had intercepted at least 159 Haitian nationals this fiscal year.
Last week, 90 people were repatriated to the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, following rescue and interdiction of three illegal voyages across the Mona Passage near Puerto Rico.

Prosecutors in Cancun's home state of Quintana Roo on the Caribbean coast said the two 34-year-old men killed had records in Canada that included crimes of drug and arms trafficking, and that their assailants followed them for several days.
The victims were part of a group of 10 tourists who had traveled to Quintana Roo on the Yucatan Peninsula to spend their vacations at the five-star Hotel Xcaret. 
Oscar Montes, the attorney general of Quintana Roo, told a news conference that investigations showed that debts arising from criminal activities in which the victims were involved were likely behind the attack on the men.
Carlos Joaquin, governor of Quintana Roo, said the crime was orchestrated in Canada. ""The violent acts have no relation with the state ... These debts are linked to international criminal groups,"" he said, speaking in an interview with local news outlet Milenio. 
Authorities have arrested two people identified only as Christian 'R' and Nhu 'T'.
Christian 'R' was the Mexican hitman initially hired to kill the victims but another unidentified criminal traveled to Cancun when the first attempt failed due to the hotel security system, prosecutors said.
Nhu 'T' is linked to the planning of the crime as video footage showed she entered the hotel as a tourist and exchanged information with the prime suspect minutes before the killings.
A third person, a woman who was in a relationship with one of the victims, was wounded in the shooting and is still recovering in a hospital, state prosecutors said.
Authorities are still investigating who organized and financed the crimes.
Separately, state authorities said the bar manager of Mamita's Beach Club was shot dead on Tuesday. The governor of Quintana Roo said investigators did not believe the attacks were linked.

""We are waiting for the result of the investigations and collaborating with authorities to clarify what happened,"" the bar said in a statement.
The two suspects of the crime fled the scene and local police confirmed on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) they are looking for the perpetrators.

The signings follow a meeting between President Joko Widodo and Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on the Indonesian island of Bintan as part of their annual leaders' retreat.
The issue of extradition has long been a frustration for Indonesia because of concerns about the difficulty of bringing some fugitives accused of embezzling large sums during the Asian financial crisis to justice.
""The extradition treaty will enhance cooperation and combating crime and send a clear, positive signal to investors,"" Prime Minister Lee said at the signing ceremony. 
Under the extradition agreement, people who had committed 31 types of crime will be liable to be extradited and it will apply to offences committed up to 18 years ago, a statement from Indonesia's investment and maritime affairs ministry said.
The agreement would also mean that people would not be able to escape justice by changing their citizenship, it said. 
""Therefore, the implementation of the criminal extradition agreement will create a deterrence effect for felonies in Indonesia and Singapore,"" the statement said.
In 2007, Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Prime Minister Lee oversaw the signing of an extradition treaty and defence cooperation agreement, but it was never ratified by Indonesia's parliament.
Indonesia has set up a new so-called ""BLBI"" task force that is going after https://www.reuters.com/article/indonesia-debt-idUSL3N2NM1FH $8 billion of bailout funds given to bank owners and borrowers after the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s that was never repaid.
The Indonesian ministry's statement also said the extradition agreement should help ""effectively reach"" those implicated by the BLBI investigation.
Lalola Easter Kaban of Indonesia Corruption Watch, a non-governmental organisation, welcomed the development saying it would help in the hunt for corruption suspects who might have fled to Singapore seeking to maintain ""impunity"" from law enforcement agencies.

The other agreements signed between the countries included one giving Indonesia more control of airspace over the Riau and Natuna islands, areas close to both countries, and a defence agreement.
Indonesia will delegate to Singapore the provision of air navigation services in portions of the airspace for 25 years, which can be extended by mutual consent, a Singapore foreign ministry statement said. Singapore sees the airspace as important for effective operations and growth of Changi airport, one of the world's busiest before the COVID-19 pandemic.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear a bid to bar Harvard University and the University of North Carolina from considering race in undergraduate admissions in a case that imperils affirmative action policies widely used to increase the number of Black and Hispanic students on American campuses.
The justices agreed to hear appeals by a group called Students for Fair Admissions, founded by anti-affirmative action activist Edward Blum, of lower court rulings that upheld the programs used by the two prestigious universities to foster a diverse student population. The cases give the court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, a chance to end such policies.
The lawsuits accused the universities of discriminating against applicants on the basis of race in violation of federal law or the U.S. Constitution. Blum's group accused Harvard of discriminating against Asian American applicants. It accused UNC of discriminating against white and Asian American applicants.
The universities have said they use race as only one factor in a host of individualized evaluations for admission without quotas, and that curbing the consideration of race would result in a significant drop in the number of Black, Hispanic and other underrepresented students on campus. 
U.S. conservatives long have opposed affirmative action programs used in such areas as hiring and student admissions to address past discrimination against minorities.
The case represents another signal of an assertiveness among the conservative justices who hold a 6-3 majority, demonstrating a willingness to rule on the most divisive issues. The justices are already set to rule by the end of June in blockbuster challenges to abortion rights and gun control. 
Affirmative action has withstood Supreme Court scrutiny for decades, including in a 2016 ruling https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-affirmativeaction-idINKCN0ZA08C involving a white student, backed by Blum, who challenged a University of Texas policy, though the justices have narrowed its application. 
The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2020 ruled that Harvard's consideration of race was not ""impermissibly extensive"" and was ""meaningful"" because it prevented the racial diversity of its undergraduate student body from plummeting. A federal judge in 2019 also ruled in favor of the Ivy League school.
Harvard University President Lawrence Bacow said the Supreme Court's decision to hear the case ""puts at risk 40 years of legal precedent granting colleges and universities the freedom and flexibility to create diverse campus communities.""
""Considering race as one factor among many in admissions decisions produces a more diverse student body which strengthens the learning environment for all,"" Bacow said, adding: ""Harvard does not discriminate.""
The justices took up the UNC dispute even though a lower federal appeals court had yet to complete its review of that case. A federal judge in 2021 found that minority students ""by virtue of our Nation's struggle with racial inequality"" are less likely to be admitted on criteria that ""ignore"" the racial barriers they face.
""As the trial court held, our process is consistent with long-standing Supreme Court precedent and allows for an evaluation of each student in a deliberate and thoughtful way,"" said Beth Keith, UNC's associate vice chancellor for university communications. 
'NEW DISCRIMINATION'
Blum praised the Supreme Court's decision to hear the matter.
""In a multi-racial, multi-ethnic nation like ours, the college admissions bar cannot be raised for some races and ethnic groups but lowered for others. Our nation cannot remedy past discrimination and racial preferences with new discrimination and different racial preferences,"" Blum said.
Blum's group sued Harvard in 2014, accusing it of violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars discrimination based on race, color or national origin under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. Harvard is a private university founded in 1636 and located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It receives federal funds.
The group also sued UNC in 2014, accusing it of impermissibly using race as the main factor in admissions in violation of the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law. UNC, located in Chapel Hill and chartered in 1789, is North Carolina's flagship public university. 
The Supreme Court first upheld affirmative action in college admissions in a landmark 1978 ruling in a case called Regents of the University of California v. Bakke that held that race could be considered as a factor but racial quotas could not be used. 
Blum's group asked the Supreme Court to overturn a 2003 Supreme Court ruling in a case called Grutter v. Bollinger involving the University of Michigan Law School that held that colleges could consider race as one factor in the admissions process because of the compelling interest of creating a diverse student body. 
The Supreme Court's conservative majority has widened since it ruled 5-4 in favor of the University of Texas in 2016, with now-retired conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy joining four liberal justices. The addition of three justices appointed by Trump moved the court rightward. 

President Joe Biden's administration has backed Harvard after his predecessor Donald Trump supported Blum's lawsuit. 
The case is expected to be heard during the court's next term, which begins in October and ends in June 2023.

TAOS, N.M. (Reuters) -National Guard members in New Mexico have begun substitute teaching and the governor said she would do the same in a bid to keep students in classrooms during a COVID-19 surge.
Parents and public workers are volunteering in schools across the country to address teacher shortages. Michelle Lujan Grisham, New Mexico's Democratic governor, went further in asking https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/new-mexico-asks-national-guard-teach-covid-shuts-schools-2022-01-20 National Guard members to volunteer as substitutes.
Over 60 New Mexico schools have switched to remote learning since winter break. But, according to a legislative report, online learning has proved disastrous for students in a state already ranked among the lowest for education.
Since Lujan Grisham put out the call for Guard and state employee volunteers last week, 59 people have been cleared to teach following background checks and online training, the state education department said. 
Lujan Grisham has also completed the process and will announce her plans this week, spokeswoman Nora Sackett said in an email.
New Mexico Republicans called her move to teach a ""publicity stunt"" and said she allowed the teacher shortage to happen.
""This is an act of desperation,"" state Republican party Executive Director Kim Skaggs said in a statement.
Schools across New Mexico had more than 1,000 unfilled teaching positions in October 2021, nearly double a year earlier, according to a New Mexico State University study. 
The pandemic exacerbated teacher resignations as socioeconomic conditions worsened for students in one of the poorest U.S. states, researchers found.
To stem the teacher exodus, the governor has requested funds for an up to 7% increase in wages.
Education unions have supported the governor's substitute teacher plan, with the proviso it is an emergency measure and not a long-term fix.
""It's a big idea to try to address a crisis,"" National Education Association New Mexico President Mary Parr-Sanchez said.

In neighboring Texas parents stepped in to keep in-person classes going as teachers stayed home with COVID-19.
""It's unpredictable, we don't know what day is going to have however many people out,"" said Marisela Maddox, one of about half a dozen parent volunteers at Austin Jewish Academy.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd fueled opioid addiction in New York state, a jury found on Thursday, a setback for a company still facing thousands of other opioid-related lawsuits around the United States.
The verdict, which followed a nearly six-month New York state court trial in a case brought by the state and two of its counties, does not include damages, which will be determined later. The jury deliberated more than eight days before reaching a verdict. 
Teva shares, which had been trading higher, fell more than 7 percentage points in New York following the decision. In afternoon trading they were down 40 cents, or 4.7%, at $8.03.
New York Attorney General Letitia James called the outcome ""a significant day"" for the state and for ""every family and community torn apart by opioids."" Jayne Conroy and Hunter Shkolnik, who represent Suffolk and Nassau counties respectively, also hailed it as a ""massive victory.""
In a statement, the company said: ""Teva Pharmaceuticals strongly disagrees with today's outcome and will prepare for a swift appeal as well as continue to pursue a mistrial."" It said the state and counties presented ""no evidence of medically unnecessary prescriptions, suspicious or diverted orders.""
New York and the counties had accused the Israel-based drugmaker of engaging in misleading marketing practices that fueled opioid addiction in the state, including by pushing drugs for off-label use.
They focused on Actiq and Fentora, cancer pain drugs made by Cephalon Inc, a company Teva bought in 2011, as well as generic opioids sold by Teva.
ONE OF 3,300 LAWSUITS
The New York lawsuit is one of more than 3,300 filed by state, local and Native American tribal governments across the country accusing drugmakers of minimizing the addictiveness of opioid pain medications, and distributors and pharmacies of ignoring red flags that they were being diverted into illegal channels. 
The judge in the case is still considering a request Teva made for a mistrial after a lawyer for the state cited an inaccurate statistic about opioid prescriptions in his closing argument. If the verdict stands, it could put pressure on Teva to reach a nationwide settlement with other states and local governments over opioid claims. 
The evidence at trial included a parody video made for a Cephalon sales meeting in 2006 in which the villain, Dr. Evil from the ""Austin Powers"" films, talks about promoting the drugs for non-cancer pain, and another video, based on a courtroom scene in the film ""A Few Good Men,"" in which a Cephalon employee tells a lawyer played by Tom Cruise that he ""can't handle the truth"" about what sales representatives need to do to meet quotas.
Teva at trial attributed a surge in opioid prescriptions to a change in medical standards of care emphasizing pain treatment beginning in the 1990s.
It also said that its opioid sales complied with federal and New York state regulations. The jury found the state partly to blame, assigning it 10% responsibility.
U.S. officials have said that by 2019, the health crisis had led to nearly 500,000 opioid overdose deaths over two decades. More than 100,000 people died from drug overdoses during the 12-month period ending April 2021, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a report https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-drug-overdose-deaths-top-100000-annually-cdc-2021-11-17 in November, a record driven in large part by deaths from opioids like fentanyl. 
Other defendants in the case settled before or during trial - major pharmacies https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-pharmacies-strike-first-deals-with-counties-over-opioids-2021-07-13, distributors https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/drug-distributors-pay-up-11-bln-settle-new-york-opioid-case-2021-07-20 McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp and  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH), and drugmakers Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jj-reaches-230-mln-opioid-settlement-with-new-york-state-2021-06-26, Endo International (NASDAQ:ENDP) Plc https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/drugmaker-endo-settles-opioid-claims-by-new-york-counties-50-mln-2021-09-10 and  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV) https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jury-hear-final-arguments-ny-opioid-case-against-drugmakers-2021-12-08. AbbVie's settlement, for $200 million, came at the very end of the trial, on the day of closing arguments.
The settlement with J&J and the distributors was part of a nationwide deal https://www.reuters.com/world/us/drug-companies-say-enough-us-states-join-26-bln-opioid-settlement-proceed-2021-09-04 worth up to $26 billion. Teva did not take part in that deal.

Teva previously prevailed in a similar case when a California judge on Nov. 2 ruled https://www.reuters.com/world/us/california-judge-rules-drugmakers-major-opioid-lawsuit-2021-11-02 that it and other drugmakers were not liable in a lawsuit brought by several counties in the state.
OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma filed for bankruptcy in 2019 and had hoped to resolve a flood of lawsuits over the painkiller through a deal in which the company's former owners, members of the Sackler family, would pay $4.5 billion in exchange for immunity from future lawsuits. However, a federal judge on Dec. 17 scrapped https://www.reuters.com/business/judge-tosses-deal-shielding-purdues-sackler-family-opioid-claims-2021-12-17 the deal, a decision the company was expected to appeal.

(Reuters) - Thich Nhat Hanh, the Zen Buddhist monk, poet and peace activist who in the 1960s came to prominence as an opponent of the Vietnam War, died on Saturday aged 95 surrounded by his followers in the temple where his spiritual journey began.
""The International Plum Village Community of Engaged Buddhism announces that our beloved teacher Thich Nhat Hanh passed away peacefully at Tu Hieu Temple in Hue, Vietnam, at 00:00hrs on 22nd January, 2022, at the age of 95,"" said his official Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account.
His week-long funeral will be held at the temple in a quiet and peaceful manner, according to his followers. 
""Thich Nhat Hanh will be remembered as arguably one of the most influential and prominent religious leaders in the world,"" Chargé d'Affaires Marie C. Damour of the U.S. Mission to Vietnam said in a statement. 
""Through his teachings and literary work, his legacy will remain for generations to come,"" she said, adding that his teachings, in particular on bringing mindfulness into daily life, have enriched the lives of innumerable Americans.
In a body of works and public appearances spanning decades, Thich Nhat Hanh spoke in gentle yet powerful tones of the need to ""walk as if you are kissing the earth with your feet"".
He suffered a stroke in 2014 which left him unable to speak and returned to Vietnam to live out his final days in the central city of Hue, the ancient capital and his place of birth, after spending much of his adult life in exile.
As a pioneer of Buddhism in the West, he formed the ""Plum Village"" monastery in France and spoke regularly on the practice of mindfulness - identifying and distancing oneself from certain thoughts without judgement - to the corporate world and his international followers.
""You learn how to suffer. If you know how to suffer, you suffer much, much less. And then you know how to make good use of suffering to create joy and happiness,"" he said in a 2013 lecture.
""The art of happiness and the art of suffering always go together"".
Born Nguyen Xuan Bao in 1926, Thich Nhat Hanh was ordained as a monk as modern Vietnam's founding revolutionary Ho Chi Minh led efforts to liberate the Southeast Asian country from its French colonial rulers.
Thich Nhat Hanh, who spoke seven languages, studied at Princeton Theological Seminary and taught at Columbia University in the United States in the early 1960s. He returned to Vietnam in 1963 to join a growing Buddhist opposition to the U.S.-Vietnam War, demonstrated by self-immolation protests by several monks. 
""I saw communists and anti-communists killing and destroying each other because each side believed they had a monopoly on the truth,"" he wrote in 1975. 
""My voice was drowned out by the bombs, mortars and shouting"".
""Venerable Thich Nhat Hanh lived a truly meaningful life. I have no doubt the best way we can pay tribute to him is to continue his work to promote peace in the world,"" the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, said on Twitter.
'LIKE A PINE TREE'
Towards the height of the Vietnam War in the 1960s he met civil rights leader Martin Luther King, whom he persuaded to speak out against the conflict.
King called Thich Nhat Hanh ""an apostle of peace and non-violence"" and nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize.
""I do not personally know of anyone more worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize than this gentle Buddhist monk from Vietnam,"" King wrote in his nomination letter. 
While in the United States to meet King a year earlier, the South Vietnamese government banned Thich Nhat Hanh from returning home.
Fellow monk Haenim Sunim, who once acted as Thich Nhat Hanh's translator during a trip to South Korea, said the Zen master was calm, attentive and loving.
""He was like a large pine tree, allowing many people to rest under his branches with his wonderful teaching of mindfulness and compassion,"" Haemin Sunim told Reuters.
""He was one of the most amazing people I have ever met.""
Thich Nhat Hanh's works and promotion of the idea of mindfulness and meditation have enjoyed a renewed popularity as the world reels from the effects of a coronavirus pandemic that has killed over a million people and upended daily life. 

""Hope is important, because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear,"" Thich Nhat Hanh wrote. ""If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. 
""If you can refrain from hoping, you can bring yourself entirely into the present moment and discover the joy that is already here.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, a frequent critic of President Joe Biden, said on Tuesday that he is seeing ""encouraging"" signs from the administration about its approach to deterring further Russian aggression towards Ukraine.
McConnell said Biden now appears to be adopting the right approach to Ukraine following a weekend meeting with his security team at Camp David. McConnell last week said Biden had ""telegraphed passivity and weakness"" on the issue. 
""What I've been hearing since then is encouraging, that they're prepared to take steps before an incursion, not afterwards,"" McConnell said at a news conference in Frankfort, Kentucky. 
""It appears to me the administration is moving in the right direction,"" he added.
Russia has massed an estimated 100,000 troops near Ukraine's border, raising alarm in the West that Moscow is preparing for a new military assault after its invasion of Crimea in 2014.
NATO said Monday it was putting troops on standby and reinforcing eastern Europe with more ships and fighter planes. The United States has also said that about 8,500 U.S. troops have been put on heightened alert and could deploy to the region.
McConnell urged the immediate deployment of NATO troops to Poland, Romania and the Baltic states, as well as the shipment of anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine.

The Kentucky Republican is among party members who advocate a tough line against Russian President Vladimir Putin, at a time when conservative commentators like Fox News host Tucker Carlson have questioned the need for the United States to take sides. 
""My office is now getting calls from folks who say they watch Tucker Carlson and are upset that we're not siding with Russia in its threats to invade Ukraine, and who want me to support Russia's 'reasonable' positions,"" Democratic U.S. Representative Tom Malinowski tweeted on Monday.

SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korea fired two cruise missiles into the sea off its east coast on Tuesday, South Korea's military said, amid rising tension over a recent series of weapons tests. 
South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff did not specify the missiles' range or trajectory, but said it was conducting an analysis together with U.S. authorities.
The launch was North Korea's fifth of the year, following tests of a tactical guided missile https://www.reuters.com/article/northkorea-missiles-idINL1N2TX006, two ""hypersonic missiles https://www.reuters.com/article/northkorea-missiles-idINL1N2TX006"" capable of high speed and manoeuvring after lift-off, and a railway-borne missile system https://www.reuters.com/article/northkorea-missiles-idINL1N2TX006.
Tension has been growing, with leader Kim Jong Un vowing last week to bolster the military and warning he could lift a self-imposed moratorium on testing atomic bombs and long-range missiles.
A spokesperson the U.S. State Department said the United States was aware of the latest launch reports and was assessing them with South Korea and Japan. The official offered no details but reiterated that Washington remained open to dialogue with Pyongyang.
""Broadly speaking, as we have said our goal remains the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. We remain prepared to engage in serious and sustained diplomacy without preconditions to make tangible progress.""
At the same time, the spokesperson said, the United States would continue efforts in coordination with the international community to prevent the advancement of North Korea's weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs.
North Korea has not launched intercontinental ballistic missiles or nuclear weapons since 2017, but began testing a slew of shorter-range missiles after denuclearisation talks stalled following a failed summit with the United States in 2019.
The flurry of recent tests sparked a U.S. push for fresh U.N. sanctions, followed by heated reaction from Pyongyang. 
The U.N. Security Council bans North Korea from any launches using ballistic technology, but not cruise missiles. China and Russia have recently called for removing a ban on Pyongyang's exports of statues, seafood and textiles, and raising a refined oil imports cap.
South Korea's Unification Minister Lee In-young, in charge of cross-border ties, urged North Korea to return to talks, not escalate further. 
""While thoroughly preparing for additional tests, we'd like to emphasise again that dialogue and cooperation is the only way to peace,"" he told a meeting with foreign diplomats based in Seoul. 
Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno did not confirm the latest test but said Tokyo would work with neighbours to gather and analyse necessary information. 
North Korea has said it is open to talks, but only if the United States and its allies drop ""hostile policy"" measures such as sanctions and military drills.

Lee Sang-min, a military expert at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses, said the recent missile volleys could be aimed at building geopolitical tensions and perhaps pushing the United States to come up with a new strategy toward Kim. 
""Cruise missiles are slower than ballistic missiles and so are regarded as less of a threat, but they hit targets with high precision, something North Korea would continue to develop,"" Lee said.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland has enhanced its military readiness as international tensions rise over Russia's military build-up near Ukraine.
Finland, which is not a member of NATO and has a long border and a difficult history with Russia, has provided no details of how its military readiness has changed. 
""Readiness (of the Finnish Defence Forces) has been enhanced due to the fact that the situation in nearby areas has become more unstable,"" said Colonel Petteri Kajanmaa, head of the warfare department at the Finnish National Defence University, referring to the Baltic Sea region.
Kajanmaa, who was speaking on behalf of the armed forces, said instability in the Baltic Sea region stemmed from the unpredictability of Russia.
""They (the Russians) have expressed their goals clearly but we do not know what actions they are ready to take,"" he said.
Russia has massed tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine but denies planning to attack its neighbour. NATO has responded by deploying about 4,000 troops in multinational battalions in the Baltics and Poland and is considering adding more. 
Kajanmaa declined to specify what actions Finland was taking but said that enhancing readiness usually meant collecting more intelligence, briefing the state leadership more often and moving resources such as planes and ships to new locations.
""That way they can monitor more efficiently and have a shorter reaction time,"" Kajanmaa said.
The Finnish Defence Forces were also making themselves visible by openly saying where they were training, he said.
Finland's armed forces on Monday announced extensive drills to take place in Helsinki and the region around the capital this week and next.
Finland is not a target of any military threat but the defence forces still need to be prepared for any potential action, Kajanmaa said. 
""The more military action there is, even if it was just innocent movement, the higher the risk that something happens, someone overreacts or misunderstands and we need to be ready for all that,"" he said.
The Finnish Security and Intelligence Service has said it has seen an increase in foreign intelligence activities targeting Finland.

""One topic which is the subject of increased interest is Finland's relationship with the military alliance NATO,"" Deputy Director Teemu Turunen told Reuters and added the topic is especially interesting to Russian intelligence.
Finland cooperates with NATO but is not a member of the Western military alliance and is not negotiating to join it -- a position outlined by Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto to Reuters two weeks ago. That message was repeated last week by Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov accused Washington of fuelling tensions over Ukraine - repeating Moscow's line that the crisis is being driven by U.S. and NATO actions rather than by its own build-up of tens of thousands of troops near the Ukrainian border.
Western states accuse Russia of planning a new attack on Ukraine, which it invaded in 2014. Moscow denies any such plan but says it could take unspecified military action unless demands are met, including a NATO promise never to admit Kyiv.
NATO said on Monday it was putting forces on standby and reinforcing eastern Europe with more ships and fighter jets. Russia denounced the moves as Western ""hysteria"".
Peskov said President Vladimir Putin would talk this week to his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron, who is also planning to speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

Russia is awaiting a written U.S. response this week to its list of security demands it has presented, some of which Washington has dismissed as non-starters.
Peskov said the U.S. troop alert did not affect negotiations because the current phase of talks had been completed.

The Aboriginal flag has been recognised as an official flag of Australia since 1995, flown from government buildings and embraced by sporting clubs.
After a deal negotiated with its creator, indigenous artist Harold Thomas, the flag can be used on sports shirts, sporting grounds, websites and in artworks without permission or payment of a fee, the government said on the eve of the Australia Day national holiday.
Writing in the Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday, Thomas said he first made the black, yellow and red flag to lead a demonstration in 1971, and it had become a symbol of indigenous unity and pride.
""The flag represents the timeless history of our land and our people’s time on it,"" he said in a statement.
The government has paid $20 million to Thomas and to extinguish licences held by a small number of companies which have stirred controversy since 2018 by demanding payment for the flag's reproduction.
A parliamentary inquiry in 2020 said the licence holder had demanded payment from health organisations and sporting clubs, which could lead to communities stopping using the flag to avoid legal action.
Prominent Aboriginal Australians including former Olympian Nova Peris led a ""Free the Flag"" campaign.
Minister for Indigenous Australians Ken Wyatt said the flag had become an enduring symbol for Aboriginal people.
""Over the last 50 years we made Harold Thomas' artwork our own - we marched under the Aboriginal flag, stood behind it, and flew it high as a point of pride,"" he said in a statement.
""Now that the Commonwealth holds the copyright, it belongs to everyone, and no one can take it away.""
Australia Day celebrations, marked with a national public holiday on Jan. 26, have become controversial because the date is seen by indigenous Australians as marking the invasion of their land by Britain.

It is the date a British fleet sailed into Sydney Harbour in 1788 to start a penal colony, viewing the land as unoccupied despite encountering settlements.
There has been debate over whether to move the national holiday to another date.

YAOUNDE (Reuters) - At least eight people died and 38 were injured in a stampede when fans stormed a stadium hosting an Africa Cup of Nations soccer match in Cameroon's capital on Monday, the government said.
Images shared on social media, which Reuters could not immediately authenticate, showed a panicked crowd trying to squeeze through a narrow entrance gate at the newly built Olembe stadium in Yaounde that was hosting a round of 16 game between Cameroon and Comoros. 
One video showed dozens of fans scrambling over the stadium fence as a police officer walked by.
The stampede comes as a heavy blow for the tournament, which had grown in excitement on the pitch in recent days thanks to some match upsets but which was under scrutiny for a lack of readiness beforehand.
COVID-19 and insecurity caused by a separatist insurgency also complicated preparations.
Work on the 60,000-seat Olembe Stadium continued right up to the start of Africa's top soccer tournament, prompting the Confederation of African Football (CAF), the continent's soccer governing body, to hold an emergency meeting to discuss cancelling the competition altogether. [KBN2JZ0TJ]
""CAF is currently investigating the situation and trying to get more details on what transpired. We are in constant communication with Cameroon government and the Local Organising Committee,"" it said in a statement.

High school teacher Vanessa Tchouanzi had come to see the match on Monday night with her friend, Veronique, who was also a teacher. Tchouanzi was barely able to get her words out as she recounted her experience over the phone to Reuters. 
At the entrance to the stadium, crowds were still milling about just moments before the start of the game. Some were waiting to take COVID-19 tests. 
As Tchouanzi tried to enter the stadium, ticket collectors became overwhelmed by a rush of people trying to get into the ground before kick-off. 
""They shoved the gate and people started coming in in droves. The police were there, but the mass of people was stronger,"" Tchouanzi said. 
Tchouanzi and Veronique were knocked to the ground. Squeezed by the rush, Tchouanzi lost consciousness before someone pulled her up and away from the crowd. 
A few minutes later, Tchouanzi found Veronique on the ground, unresponsive with a weak pulse. She was rushed to hospital but died soon after.
""She couldn't take the shock, the weight of all those people,"" Tchouanzi said through a flood of tears.
The government did not give any information on the cause of the crush or whether fans were allowed into the stadium without tickets. It is not clear why the match went ahead after the disaster. 

Following a low turnout in the first round games at brand new stadiums, Cameroon authorities have thrown open stadium gates, organised mass transport and given out free tickets to lure fans.
Cameroon beat 10-man Comoros Islands 2-1 to advance to the quarter-finals.

WINDSOR, England (Reuters) - Celebrations this year marking Queen Elizabeth's seven-decade reign will mask a less happy reality for the world's pre-eminent royal family: the British monarchy is being questioned in ways that were unthinkable for most of the last 70 years.
From the U.S. sex abuse court case https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/what-we-know-about-virginia-giuffres-lawsuit-against-britains-prince-andrew-2022-01-04 facing son Prince Andrew to her grandson Prince Harry and his wife's allegations of racism https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-royals-meghan-int-idUSKBN2B003I in the royal household, rarely has the family of 95-year-old Elizabeth, who became queen on Feb. 6, 1952, faced such scrutiny and damaging headlines.
Such is the depth of respect for the queen that while she lives, the institution that goes back nearly 1,000 years looks safe. What comes next is less certain.
""The monarchy and the queen are synonymous for most people,"" Graham (NYSE:GHM) Smith, chief executive of anti-monarchy group Republic, which has stepped up its campaigning, told Reuters.
""Once we're past the end of the queen's reign, all bets are off as to where public opinion is going to go.""
He said while only an act of parliament would be needed to end the monarchy, it was highly likely there would have to be a referendum first.
The monarchy's fortunes have ebbed and flowed since her ancestor Norman King William I's 1066 conquest of England, but only during the decade that followed the execution of King Charles I in 1649 has Britain been a republic.
During Elizabeth's reign, lows came in the 1990s amid the failings of three of her children's marriages and the 1997 death of Princess Diana, first wife of heir Prince Charles.
Highs included the public outpourings of support at previous jubilees, the 2011 royal marriage of Elizabeth's grandson - and future king - Prince William, and the birth of royal children.
Buckingham Palace said the four days of celebrations in June to mark Elizabeth's platinum jubilee will allow ""national moments of reflection on the queen's 70 years of service"".
A spokesman declined to comment on questions about the monarchy's long-term future.
ROYAL EXTINCTION?
Supporters see the queen as a stabilising factor, and cite economic benefits the monarchy brings Britain through tourism. Opponents argue the institution is a bastion of undeserved privilege, partially funded by taxpayers and undermined by some members' behaviour.
Andrew, 61, reputed by media to be Elizabeth's favourite of her four children, was stripped https://www.reuters.com/world/us/prince-andrews-legal-team-decline-comment-us-court-decision-2022-01-13 of his royal patronages and military titles this month as he fights allegations of sex abuse in a U.S. lawsuit.
""For the monarchy it is an extinction-level event. You can't spend a thousand years telling everyone you're special and then everyone discovers, in real time, in a court case, that you are really not,"" columnist Camilla Long wrote in the Sunday Times newspaper.
Meanwhile, Prince Harry, once the Windsors' most popular member, and his American wife Meghan gave up their royal duties to move to Los Angeles from where they have delivered some barbed attacks on the family and Buckingham Palace.
Charles has come under scrutiny after Michael Fawcett, his right-hand man and close confidant for decades, quit https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-prince-charless-right-hand-man-quits-charity-role-after-honours-report-2021-11-12 his job running one of the heir's main charities amid allegations he had offered honours in return for donations.
Fawcett has not commented publicly on the allegations.
""Whether (these scandals) are enough in themselves to make enough people in Britain think that as a result we should have no monarchy, I would doubt,"" said royal biographer Penny Junor.
OPINION SHIFTING?
Polls suggest a comfortable majority believe the monarchy should remain, with 83% holding a positive view of Elizabeth, according to one survey in December. But there are worrying signs for the royals.
Last November Barbados ditched https://www.reuters.com/world/prince-charles-travels-barbados-celebrate-creation-republic-2021-11-29 the queen as head of state, Charles is much less popular and support among younger people appears to be waning, with polls suggesting a majority under 30 favour getting rid of the monarchy.
""I don't think it holds much importance any more,"" said student Margaux Butler, 20, in Windsor, where the queen now spends most of her time.
""I despise that idea (of Charles being king). I don't mind the royal family in general but I think he's a bit controversial and I think a lot of younger people feel the same.""
However, ending the monarchy will take more than apathy towards Charles or damning tabloid headlines about Andrew or Harry. Indeed, those same papers now rarely run negative articles about Charles, his wife Camilla, William and his wife Kate, all of whom suffered intense criticism in the past.
For some Britons, scandals embroiling Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the tumult of Donald Trump's U.S. presidency also make having an elected head of state a less attractive proposition.
The establishment too remains firmly behind the royals.
There is no sign the ruling Conservative Party would countenance an end to the monarchy, while the main opposition Labour Party suffered a 2019 election drubbing partly because of its former leader's perceived lack of patriotism.
Johnson last year remarked, after the death of Prince Philip, how Elizabeth's husband of 73 years had helped his wife steer ""the monarchy so that it remains an institution indisputably vital to the balance and happiness of our national life.""
The royals themselves are also conscious of how they must adapt to a changing world.

While politicians suffered the ""brutal"" repudiation by the public at the ballot box, ""for us, a royal family, however, the message is often harder to read,"" Elizabeth, who has never given an interview during her reign, said in a 1997 speech.
""I have done my best ... to interpret it correctly through the years of our marriage and of my reign as your queen. And we shall, as a family, try together to do so in the future.""

908,"<span>Jan 25, 2022 06:51AM ET</span>","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and a handful of his allies were added on Tuesday to an official list of ""terrorists and extremists"", the latest in a series of moves by Russian authorities to stamp out their opposition to President Vladimir Putin.
News agencies reported separately that the federal prison service had demanded that Navalny's brother Oleg be given a real jail term in place of a one-year suspended sentence handed to him last year.
Navalny, an anti-corruption campaigner and a thorn in Putin's side for the past decade, survived being poisoned with a nerve agent in 2020 and was jailed last year on parole violations related to an earlier fraud case he says was trumped up. His political network was banned as ""extremist"" last year.
The ""terrorist"" listing by the state financial monitoring service means Navalny and the members of his team are subject to limits on bank transactions and need to seek approval every time they want to use their accounts.
Navalny's chief of staff Leonid Volkov said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB): ""I'm proud to work in our fine team of 'extremists and terrorists'. By devaluing the meaning of words and turning their meaning inside out, the Kremlin is digging a deeper hole for itself. It's doing all it can to make those who still believe Putin stop believing him.""
Lyubov Sobol, one of the faces of Navalny's popular YouTube channel, told Ekho Moskvy radio that Putin was declaring anyone he didn't like to be a terrorist.

Sobol was added to the list on Tuesday, and Volkov earlier this month. Both are among a group of Navalny's leading allies who have fled Russia to avoid arrest.
Navalny's brother Oleg was given a one-year suspended sentence last August. He was among a group of people accused of inciting people to break COVID-19 restrictions by attending unauthorised protests in January 2021.

The measures, already in force in 16 prefectures, will take effect in a further 18 including the western prefectures of Kyoto and Osaka and remain in place until the middle of next month.
Nationwide cases rose above 60,000 for the first time since the pandemic began, a tally by broadcaster Fuji TV showed on Tuesday, with the capital, Tokyo, posting 12,813 new cases while the region of Osaka reported 8,612, both records.
Economy minister Daishiro Yamagiwa told reporters the central government agreed to impose tougher counter-measures in 18 more regions in response to an increase of infections and hospital admissions driven by Omicron. A panel of health experts signed off on the plan earlier in the day.
The curbs will run from Thursday until Feb. 20, empowering regional governors to ask restaurants and bars to shorten their business hours and to stop serving alcohol. 
The stricter measures come as the government is shifting its approach to handling the soaring number of cases.
The health ministry announced late on Monday it will allow doctors to diagnose those who have had close contact with a COVID-19 patient and who show symptoms as being infected without the need for a test, if deemed necessary by local governments.
The new policy will enable patients to get prompt treatment, said Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno.
""We're presenting a policy to expand the options available to patients,"" he said.
Managing COVID-19 without laboratory test confirmations is similar to how doctors fight influenza in areas where ""the community burden is high"", said Kazuaki Jindai, a physician and researcher at Tohoku University.
""The important thing is that some people will get sick eventually and we need to have a good monitoring system to make sure that they are safe. Not only by providing them hospitalization but also access to new oral medications.""

Kyle Tattle, president of the Japanese arm of U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co INC., told reporters the company was working to provide its COVID-19 oral pill, molnupiravir, as soon as possible.
The government would also weigh scientific data in considering shorter quarantines for people who have had close contact with COVID-19 patients, Kishida told a parliamentary debate.

Hun Sen, the ASEAN chair, said he would talk to military chief Min Aung Hlaing by video on Wednesday, noting that since their Jan. 7 meeting in Myanmar https://reut.rs/3ngcp4w, ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi had been sentenced to four years' detention and military aircraft had been deployed in operations.
Min Aung Hlaing led a coup in Myanmar last year and ASEAN made a surprise move in barring https://reut.rs/3n0roOZ his junta from key meetings over its failure to honour a five-point ASEAN ""consensus"" that included ceasing hostilities and allowing dialogue.
""He (Hun Sen) said that he had invited HE (His Excellency) Min Aung Hlaing to attend the ASEAN summit if there was progress in the implementation of the five points agreed unanimously,"" said a statement on Hun Sen's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, summarising a call with Malaysian Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob. 
""But if not, he must send a non-political representative to ASEAN meetings.""
As new chair of ASEAN, Cambodia has indicated it wants to engage not isolate the junta, but Hun Sen has been pressed by several ASEAN leaders, including those of Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore, not to give way on the agreement, which is backed by the United Nations and United States. 
The overthrow of Suu Kyi's elected government in Myanmar has been a setback for ASEAN and its efforts to present itself as a credible and integrated bloc. 
Hun Sen's Myanmar https://reut.rs/3ngcp4w visit caused concern within the group that it could suggest ASEAN recognition of the generals, who have overseen a bloody crackdown on pro-democracy forces.
Fissures have been exposed over the Myanmar issue and Hun Sen last week took a swipe at Malaysia's foreign minister, calling him arrogant https://reut.rs/3FYOddn for voicing concern about him meeting the junta chief. 

The ASEAN consensus includes halting offensives and granting full access to a special ASEAN envoy to all parties in the conflict. 
Malaysian leader Ismail Sabri told Hun Sen there was an urgent need to de-escalate the Myanmar situation and release Suu Kyi and all political prisoners, according to a foreign ministry statement.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The operator of Japan's crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant said this month that two storage tanks had leaked about four tonnes of coolant solution used to create an ice wall that prevented groundwater from seeping in.
The operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co Holdings (Tepco), said the leak had no impact on the wall or the environment, however.
But the incident highlights its struggle to clean up the plant nearly 11 years after a massive earthquake and tsunami set off meltdowns in the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.
It also comes just as the utility is readying to build a tunnel to the sea to release more than 1 million tonnes of irradiated water from the site, after treatment, in an effort set to start around the spring of 2023.
WHY AN ICE (NYSE:ICE) WALL?
In operation since 2016, the ice wall, as the structure is called, is really more like a barrier of frozen soil. Built by Kajima Corp, it cost 34.5 billion yen ($303 million) in public funds.
The ice wall is meant to keep contaminated water within the plant while keeping out groundwater, which becomes radioactive on seeping into the basements of the crippled reactors and coming in contact with highly radioactive debris there.
That has interfered with clean-up work, forcing Tepco to pump out the water for storage in huge tanks at an annual cost of about 100 billion yen. 
Now space is running out, as nearly 1.3 million tonnes of such water has accumulated, or enough to fill about 500 swimming pools of Olympic size. 
HOW DOES IT WORK?
Coolant pumped into freeze tubes reduces temperatures to about -30 degrees C (-22 Fahrenheit) in about 1,500 tubes filled with brine located at a depth of 30 meters (98.43 ft) along a perimeter of 1.5 km (1 mile) around the plant. 
This in turn freezes the surrounding groundwater into a contiguous wall of frozen soil, and the coolant is recirculated.
LEAKS AND PROBLEMS
The latest leak appears to have been caused by a warping of joints in metal pipes, despite a lack of visible cracks, a TEPCO spokesperson said. The system is operating after the defective parts were replaced. 
The last of roughly eight leaks since the wall became operative was in 2019, probably because of metal fatigue from vibrations caused by construction vehicles.
The spokesperson was unable to immediately confirm the cause of earlier leaks, but said similar reasons were likely.
In Nov 2021, Tepco said it was launching remedial work after testing showed a partial melting of the ice wall.
The coolant in Sunday's leak was a solution of calcium chloride, used in concrete mixes to hasten setting and in food to firm it. 
WATER RELEASE - AND THE TUNNEL
In December, Tepco said it aimed to build an underwater tunnel to release the water into the sea, in the latest stage of a plan to discharge about 1 million tonnes after treatment and dilution, at a point about 1 km (0.6 miles) offshore.
The treated water is to be pumped from tanks for release at a depth of 12 metres (40 ft), with construction set to start this year.
The water will be processed to remove all radioactive contamination, except tritium, which will be diluted to a seventh of the World Health Organization (WHO) standards for drinking water. The release is set to start around spring 2023.
Though nuclear plants worldwide routinely discharge water with tritium in it, the plan has stirred concern from neighbours China and South Korea, worried over food safety.
Also alarmed are farmers and fishermen nearby who worry it could hit prices after years of struggle to rebuild. 
LAWSUIT
Separately, a lawsuit set to be filed on Thursday against Tepco says a group of six men and women developed thyroid cancer due to radiation exposure from the disaster, the Mainichi daily said. 

In a statement, the utility said it would respond after the filing and hearings.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) warned on Monday that it was dangerous to assume the Omicron variant would herald the end of COVID-19's acutest phase, exhorting nations to stay focused to beat the pandemic.
""It’s dangerous to assume that Omicron will be the last variant and that we are in the end game,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a WHO executive board meeting of the two-year pandemic that has killed nearly 6 million people.
""On the contrary, globally the conditions are ideal for more variants to emerge.""
Though Omicron has sent total cases soaring to nearly 350 million, its less lethal impact and the increasing prevalence of vaccines has led to optimism in some parts that the worst of the pandemic may have passed. 
Tedros, the WHO's first African head who is running unopposed for a second term, urged discipline and unity in combatting the coronavirus. 
""The COVID-19 pandemic is now entering its third year and we are at a critical juncture,"" he told a news conference earlier. ""We must work together to bring the acute phase of this pandemic to an end. We cannot let it continue to drag on, lurching between panic and neglect.""
GERMANY BIGGEST DONOR
Countries must maximise strategies and tools already available, such as testing and inoculation, for the global health emergency to end this year, he said. 
Tedros' bid for a second term received a boost when the WHO shelved a decision on his native Ethiopia's request to investigate accusations of links to rebel forces.

He told board members he was seeking an overhaul of the agency's funding model, with Germany now the largest donor, supplanting Washington which had accused the WHO of pro-China bias under former President Donald Trump's administration.
The United States is resisting a financing proposal that would make the U.N. health body more independent, raising doubts about the Biden administration's long-term support.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States on Sunday ordered the departure of family members of staff at its embassy in Ukraine, citing the continuing threat of military action from Russia.
The U.S. State Department also authorized the voluntary departure of U.S. government employees and said Americans should consider departing immediately.
""We have been in consultation with the Ukrainian government about this step and are coordinating with Allied and partner embassies in Kyiv as they determine their posture,"" the U.S. Embassy said.
Russia has massed troops near the border with Ukraine prompting tensions with Western powers. Moscow has insisted it has no plans to invade.
The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv warned in a statement that ""military action by Russia could come at any time and the United States government will not be in a position to evacuate American citizens in such a contingency, so U.S. citizens currently present in Ukraine should plan accordingly."" 
The State Department also said it was authorizing the ""voluntary departure of U.S. direct hire employees."" 
The New York Times reported late Sunday that President Joe Biden was considering deploying several thousand U.S. troops to NATO allies in Eastern Europe and the Baltics. 
The Pentagon declined to comment on the New York Times report but noted that Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) on Friday said, ""we're going to make sure that we have options ready to reassure our allies, particularly on -- on NATO's Eastern Flank.""
""If there's another incursion and if they need that reassurance, if they need the capabilities to be bolstered, we're going to do that and we're going to make sure that we're -- that we're ready to do that,” Kirby said.

OUAGADOUGOU (Reuters) - Burkina Faso's army said on Monday it had ousted President Roch Kabore, suspended the constitution, dissolved the government and the national assembly, and closed the country's borders.
The announcement cited the deterioration of the security situation and what the army described as Kabore's inability to unite the West African nation and effectively respond to challenges, which include an Islamist insurgency.
Signed by Lieutenant Colonel Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba and read by another officer on state television, the announcement said the takeover had been carried out without violence and that those detained were at a secure location.
The statement was made in the name of a previously unheard-of entity, the Patriotic Movement for Safeguard and Restoration, or MPSR, its French-language acronym.
""MPSR, which includes all sections of the army, has decided to end President Kabore's post today,"" it said.
Kabore's whereabouts were unknown on Monday, with conflicting accounts of his situation.
Army putsches have toppled governments over the past 18 months in Mali and Guinea. The military also took over in Chad last year after President Idriss Deby died fighting rebels on the battlefield in the country's north.
Landlocked Burkina Faso, one of West Africa's poorest countries despite being a gold producer, has experienced numerous coups since independence from France in 1960.
The MPSR said it would propose a calendar for a return to constitutional order ""within a reasonable time frame, after consultations with various sections of the nation.""
The U.S. State Department on Monday said it was aware of reports that Kabore had been detained by the military and called for his release. It added that it was ""too soon"" to officially characterize developments in the West African country, when asked if Washington was undertaking a coup assessment.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres ""strongly condemns any attempted takeover of government by the force of arms"" in Burkina Faso and calls on the coup leaders to lay down their weapons, a U.N. spokesman said after the army statement.
The broadcast came after two days of confusion and fear in Ouagadougou, the capital, where shooting erupted at army camps on Sunday, with soldiers demanding more resources for their fight against Islamist militants.
Several hundred residents gathered in Ouagadougou's central Place de la Nation to show their support for the coup.
""We are really happy. We have been out for two days to support the army,"" said Ibrahim Zare. ""We are behind them.""
Intense gunfire was heard in the area around Kabore's residence overnight.
Earlier, Kabore's party said he had survived an assassination attempt, but gave no details. It also said his personal residence had been sacked.
POPULAR SUPPORT
Several armoured vehicles belonging to the presidential fleet could be seen near Kabore's residence on Monday, riddled with bullets. One was spattered with blood.
Security sources gave conflicting accounts of Kabore's situation, with some saying he was being detained by the coup organisers and others saying forces loyal to him had taken him to a secure location. Reuters could not independently verify his circumstances.
Islamist militants control swathes of Burkina Faso's territory and have forced residents in some areas to abide by their harsh version of Islamic law, while the military's struggle to quell the insurgency has drained scarce national resources.
Kabore had faced waves of protests in recent months amid frustration over killings of civilians and soldiers by militants, some of whom have links to Islamic State and al Qaeda.
Ouagadougou resident Eli Sawagogo said the coup had not come as a surprise to him.
""It was expected because the country has been in this situation for six years without a real solution to this terrorism,"" he said. ""If a coup is the solution, then it is welcome.""

Corinne Dufka, West Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said Kabore's government had shown itself unable to tackle a range of problems.
""The coup, and apparent support for it, lays bare the inadequacies of Kabore's government to address deep-seated problems with corruption, governance and civilian protection, which were all made exponentially worse by the armed Islamist threat,"" she said.

(Reuters) -NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, designed to give the world an unprecedented glimpse of infant galaxies in the early stages of the universe, arrived at its gravitational parking spot in orbit around the sun on Monday, nearly a million miles from Earth.
With a final five-minute, course-correcting thrust of its onboard rocket, Webb reached its destination at a position of gravitational equilibrium known as the second Sun-Earth Lagrange point, or L2, arriving one month after launch, NASA officials said.
The thruster was activated by mission control engineers at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, with radio signals confirming Webb was successfully ""inserted"" into its desired orbital loop around L2.
From there, Webb will follow a special ""halo"" path that keeps it in constant alignment with Earth but out of its shadow, as the planet and telescope circle the sun in tandem. The prescribed L2 orbit within the larger solar orbit thus enables uninterrupted radio contact, while bathing Webb's solar-power array in non-stop sunlight.
By comparison, Webb's 30-year-old predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope, orbits the Earth from 340 miles (547 km) away, passing in and out of the planet's shadow every 90 minutes.
The combined pull of the sun and Earth at L2 - a point of near gravitational stability first deduced by 18-century mathematician Joseph-Louis Legrange - will minimize the telescope's drift in space. 
But ground teams will need to fire Webb's thruster briefly again about once every three weeks to keep it on track, Keith Parrish, the observatory's commissioning manager from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, told reporters on Monday.
Mission engineers are preparing next to fine-tune the telescope's primary mirror - an array of 18 hexagonal segments of gold-coated beryllium metal measuring 21 feet, 4 inches (6.5 meters) across, far larger than Hubble's main mirror.
Its size and design - operating mainly in the infrared spectrum - will allow Webb to peer through clouds of gas and dust and observe objects at greater distances, thus farther back in time, than Hubble or any other telescope. 
These features are expected to usher in a revolution in astronomy, giving a first view of infant galaxies dating to just 100 million years after the Big Bang, the theoretical flashpoint that set the expansion of the known universe in motion an estimated 13.8 billion years ago. 
Webb's instruments also make it ideal to search for signs of potentially life-supporting atmospheres around scores of newly documented exoplanets - celestial bodies orbiting distant stars - and to observe worlds much closer to home, such as Mars and Saturn's icy moon Titan. 
NEXT STEPS
It will take several more months of work to ready the telescope for its astronomical debut. 
The 18 segments of its principal mirror, which had been folded together to fit inside the cargo bay of the rocket that carried the telescope to space, were unfurled with the rest of its structural components during a two-week period following Webb's launch on Dec. 25. 
Those segments were recently detached from fasteners and edged away from their original launch position. They now must be precisely aligned - to within one-ten-thousandth the thickness of a human hair - to form a single, unbroken light-collecting surface.
Ground teams will also start activating Webb's various imaging and spectrographic instruments to be used in the three-month mirror alignment. This will be followed by two months spent calibrating the instruments themselves.
Mirror alignment will begin by aiming the telescope at a rather ordinary, isolated star, dubbed HD-84406, located in the Ursa Major, or ""Big Dipper,"" constellation but too faint to be seen from Earth with the naked eye. 
Engineers will then gradually tune Webb's mirror segments to ""stack"" 18 separate reflections of the star into a single, focused image, Lee Feinberg, Webb's optical telescope element manager at Goddard, said during Monday's NASA teleconference.
Alignment is expected to start next week when the telescope, whose infrared design makes it super-sensitive to heat, has cooled down enough in space to work properly - a temperature of about 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit (-240 Celsius).
If all goes smoothly, Webb should be ready to begin making scientific observations by summer. 
Sometime in June, NASA expects to make public its ""early release observations,"" a 'greatest hits' collection of initial images used to demonstrate proper functioning of Webb's instruments during its commissioning phase.

Webb's most ambitious work, including plans to train its mirror on objects farthest from Earth, will take a bit longer to conduct.
The telescope is an international collaboration led by NASA in partnership with the European and Canadian space agencies.  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC) was the primary contractor.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Fans are free to wear, ""Where is Peng Shuai?"" shirts at the Australian Open but they must not become ""disruptive"", Tennis Australia chief Craig Tiley told Reuters on Tuesday amid criticism of the Grand Slam organisers' earlier stance on the issue.
In response to a video posted on social media on Saturday of security officials instructing fans to remove shirts with the slogan on them, the governing body said the Melbourne Park tournament does not allow political statements.
Martina Navratilova described that reaction as ""cowardly"" and said Australian Open organisers were giving in to China and placing sponsorship money ahead of human rights concerns.
""Unfortunately I think there's a lot of miscommunication and lack of understanding on it, because it's not just a one line response,"" Tiley told Reuters by telephone.
""Someone wearing a T-shirt saying something is not going to have any impact on the safety. But when they start getting together as a group, as a mob, and start being disruptive, in any way or form, that's a different thing.
""If they're coming in to do what everyone else is doing -- to enjoy the tennis -- and if they've got a T-shirt on that says, 'Where is Peng Shuai?', that's fine.""
Peng's situation became a matter of concern in November when the former women's number one doubles player alleged that a former Chinese vice premier, Zhang Gaoli, had sexually assaulted her in the past. After that post, she was absent from public view for nearly three weeks.
Last month Peng said she had never accused anyone of sexually assaulting her, and that a social media post she had made had been misunderstood. 
Zhang has not commented on the matter.
Referring to the Peng shirts at Melbourne Park, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said on Monday that ""such behaviour is unpopular and will not succeed"".
Tiley said the steps taken by security staff last weekend was based on suspicions over ""the motive and intent of the person coming in"".
""If they are coming on site to specifically disrupt the comfort and the safety of our fans, then we don't welcome them,"" Tiley said. 
""It doesn't really matter what they say but if they're bringing a banner on site that's got poles that they're going to put up and they're going to cover people's ability to watch the tennis, then they're going to need to remove it. 
""If they continue to be persistent, they will be removed from the site but if someone wants to wear a T-shirt, supporting Peng Shuai and that's fine or doing other things, that's fine.""
On Monday, Peng supporters in Australia said they were planning to hand out 1,000 'Where is Peng Shuai?' T-shirts at Melbourne Park this week after raising more than A$10,000 on a GoFundMe page.
The Women's Tennis Association has suspended tournaments https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/wta-suspends-tournaments-china-over-peng-shuai-situation-2021-12-01 in China due to its concerns over Peng's safety and Tiley said Tennis Australia backed their stance.

""Right at the beginning when Peng Shuai's whereabouts was not known we worked closely with the WTA to utilize our resources in the region, to support the WTA,"" he said.
""We were concerned about Peng Shuai's well-being from the beginning and wanted to make sure she was okay. Obviously since that time, she's now made some statements, but we also support the WTA's position on it.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -New York City Mayor Eric Adams on Monday announced a plan to end gun violence in a city reeling from the fatal shooting of a police officer and a spate of violent crimes, as he promised to increase police officers in New York's most violence-plagued communities.
Adams, a former police captain, said the plan would deliver on his November election campaign pledge by deploying more officers, stemming the flow of guns into the city, and appointing anti-gun violence coordinators in every city agency.
""We are turning our pain into purpose,"" he said at a news conference following a series of highly publicized, lethal crimes in the city since he was sworn in on Jan. 1.
Two police officers were shot https://www.reuters.com/world/us/two-new-york-city-police-officers-shot-harlem-are-critical-condition-2022-01-22 in Harlem on Friday while responding to a domestic violence call, leaving one dead and the other in critical condition. Two other officers were shot in separate incidents last week in other parts of the city.
As in many U.S. cities, murders and gun violence have surged over the past two years in New York. Experts say the trend partly reflects the social disruption from the pandemic and its effect of reducing the number of police officers on duty.
The city counted 488 murders last year, up 5.6% over 2020 following a 47% jump a year earlier, the biggest year-to-year percentage increase ever recorded in the country's most populous city. That spike ended a fairly steady decline in murders since 1990, when the number peaked at 2,245.
Shootings doubled from 2019 to 1,532 in 2020, and increased 2% in 2021, according to city statistics.
The ""Blueprint to End Gun Violence"" will within three weeks put more police officers on patrol in 30 of the city's 77 precincts where 80% of the city's violence occurs, Adams said. The officers, identifiable as New York Police Department employees, will have body-worn cameras and ""enhanced"" training and oversight.
Travelers (NYSE:TRV) into New York City will be screened for illegal guns with facial recognition technology at new ""spot checks"" at various entry points.
City authorities confiscate illicit firearms on a regular basis, with 6,000 removed in 2021, but new guns enter the city at a faster rate, according to Adams. 
""We have become the dumping ground,"" he said.
Adams encouraged prosecutors to ""triage gun cases"" to ensure they are the first cases brought to court, and urged lawmakers to reduce the number of guns that a person must traffic before they can be charged with a felony.

A former Brooklyn borough president, the Democrat won https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/democrat-eric-adams-wins-new-york-city-mayoral-election-2021-11-03 election on a platform that promised to improve public safety through investment in more aggressive policing.
Adams' stance clashed with the ""defund the police"" rallying cry heard at protests against racism and police brutality since 2020. But it echoed https://www.reuters.com/world/us/democratic-cries-defund-police-fade-us-mayoral-races-crime-surges-2021-10-29 calls for tougher policing from Democratic mayoral candidates countrywide in 2021, who feared being painted as soft on crime by Republican opponents.
