""There were some early reports that as many as 70 could be dead in the factory. One is too many, but we thank God that the number is turning out to be far, far fewer,"" company spokesperson Bob Ferguson told Reuters. 
Governor Andy Beshear had previously said at least 80 people in his state were confirmed dead after a string of powerful tornadoes ripped through the region on Friday night. Beshear said the toll was eventually going to exceed 100. It was unclear how many factory workers Beshear was counting in his estimate.
Crews on Sunday evening who were digging through the rubble were still treating it as a rescue effort and have not moved to a recovery effort, Ferguson said. 
""We are still hopeful that of the eight who are still unaccounted for, we may be able to locate some of them,"" he said.

Mayfield Consumer Products describes itself as a local, family-owned maker of candles, wax and home fragrance goods. 
Mayfield, a community of about 10,000 residents in Graves County, was transformed by the tornado into a landscape cluttered with damaged and demolished buildings, strewn debris, trees uprooted and stripped bare, twisted road signs and sagging utility lines.

CHAMPHAI, India (Reuters) -The former boxer said he and his comrades were perched on a hillside near the town of Mindat, in Myanmar's northwest, and preparing to ambush a patrol of soldiers when the troops opened fire and a bullet smashed into his forearm.
""I tried to run but I got shot again in the upper arm,"" Za Latt Thwey, who requested that he be identified by the name he uses as a boxer, told Reuters near a safe house in India's Mizoram state, which borders Myanmar.
An Indian orthopaedic surgeon's note said the 25-year-old had suffered a gunshot wound and an X-ray showed where his bone had been shattered.
That skirmish in mid-May was part of what seven people involved in the rebellion, including five fighters, said was a growing popular resistance to Myanmar's military in Chin state.
Their accounts include previously unreported details of how the rebellion there began and expanded.
As in other parts of the country, civilians enraged by the military coup in February and subsequent crackdown on protesters are taking up arms. The junta appears to be worried about the threat they pose in Chin.
In the last few weeks, the military, known as the Tatmadaw, has sent reinforcements to Chin, which had been largely peaceful for years, and launched a major offensive against rebels, according to some analysts and rights groups.
More than a dozen so-called Chinland Defence Force (CDF) opposition groups have sprung up in the state, according to three of the sources, who described an expanding network of fighters whose knowledge of local terrain is a major advantage.
They said the groups had established supply chains, food stockpiles and weapon depots and linked up with a long-established ethnic group called the Chin National Front (CNF) to train in combat and better coordinate operations.
The military has said all resistance forces and the shadow government are ""terrorists"".
CNF spokesman Salai Htet Ni told Reuters the group had helped train Chin youth and protesters in basic guerrilla warfare after the military coup.
""Our unity and public support is our strength,"" said a 32-year-old fighter from Chin's capital Hakha.
Reuters was not able to independently verify some claims made by the sources about the strength of the rebellion and scale of the Tatmadaw's response.
Myanmar's military spokesperson and the Ministry of Information did not respond to requests for comment on the growing resistance in Chin or the armed forces' deployments.
The Tatmadaw's response to resistance in Chin and elsewhere has prompted warnings from the United Nations and United States that the brutal clampdown on Rohingya Muslims in neighbouring Rakhine state in 2017 risked being repeated.
More than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims fled Rakhine that year and refugees accused the military of mass killings and rape. UN investigators said the military had carried out the atrocities with ""genocidal intent"".
Myanmar authorities said they were battling an insurgency and deny carrying out systematic atrocities.
The military has not released details of overall battlefield losses since the February coup.
NOODLES AND SHOTGUNS
Before he took up arms, the fighter from Hakha said he was a postgraduate student of history who joined widespread public demonstrations against the February coup.
Like the four other fighters Reuters interviewed in Mizoram, he said his decision to join the resistance was triggered by the military's suppression of peaceful protests that demanded civilian rule be restored.
Local monitoring group the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) says junta forces have killed more than 1,300 people and detained thousands in a bid to crush opposition to the coup.
The military has outlawed AAPP, saying it is biased and uses exaggerated data. The AAPP has not responded to that accusation.
Groups of young protesters in Hakha began stockpiling food including rice, oil and noodles and medical supplies in multiple locations in the jungle surrounding the township of around 50,000 people, two of the fighters said.
In April, some CDF groups met in Camp Victoria, the CNF's headquarters, to coordinate armed resistance against the Tatmadaw, according to the fighter from Hakha.
The CNF, which has a military wing, has become pivotal to the resistance, providing training and other support to several CDF groups across the state, said two fighters and a senior leader of the National Unity Government (NUG).
The NUG, effectively a shadow government, comprises pro-democracy groups and remnants of the ousted civilian administration. It has held talks with foreign officials, including from the United States.
In the early months of the resistance, nearly 2,000 volunteers from Hakha were sent to Camp Victoria for combat training under the CNF, the two fighters said, a level of coordination not previously reported.
NEW KIND OF CRISIS
By May, three of the CDF fighters said they were taking on the Tatmadaw in several parts of Chin, a 36,000 square kilometre province with nine major townships.
Outside Mindat, Za Latt Thwey said he was among the guerrillas, some trained by the CNF, who targeted Tatmadaw patrols.
In cellphone footage taken by fighters, and shown to Reuters by Za Latt Thwey, small groups of young men could be seen perched on wooded hillsides firing homemade guns and automatic rifles. Reuters could not independently verify the footage.
Financial support for the rebels in Mindat has mostly come from the Chin diaspora and the NUG, said an ousted Chin lawmaker, who declined to be named.
Through multiple routes, including from India, the lawmaker said food, clothes, medicine and equipment were reaching the rebels each month.
Weapons and explosives were the hardest to procure, according to the lawmaker, the NUG leader and three of the fighters.
The CDF Hakha, with some 2,000 volunteers, is run by a 21-member council that oversees command stations, smaller camps and supporting units, two of the rebels said.
Across Chin violence has escalated in the last four months as the Tatmadaw clashes with a rising number of rebel groups, according to analysis from the Chin Human Rights Organisation (CHRO).
""We have never had this kind of crisis before in Chin,"" said CHRO's Salai Za Uk Ling.
Once a thriving settlement of some 10,000 people, the hilltop town of Thantlang is now virtually deserted, surrounded by soldiers who set alight more than 500 buildings since early September, according to two former residents and the CHRO.
The U.S. State Department singled out events in Chin, and Thantlang in particular, in a statement last month urging the military to end the violence.
Pa Hein, 55, who said he was among the last people to leave the town in late September, told Reuters by telephone that he saw Tatmadaw troops ransack shops and set buildings on fire.
The Myanmar military has denied the accusations, and blamed insurgents for instigating fighting in Thantlang and burning homes.
SEEKING TREATMENT
After the first police defectors trickled into India's Mizoram state in early March, followed by Myanmar lawmakers and thousands of others seeking shelter, the mountainous border province has become a buffer zone for Chin guerrillas.
The Indian government did not respond to a request for comment.
Mizoram authorities estimate around 12,900 people have crossed over from Myanmar, including 30 ousted state and federal lawmakers, according to a senior Mizoram police official who declined to be named.
Some of the lawmakers and leaders have been helping the resistance, and as fighting intensifies they are seeking to unify and support the rebels.
The NUG wants to bring all armed resistance groups under a single command with the assistance of the CNF, said the Chin lawmaker and senior NUG leader.
CNF's Salai Htet Ni said the group and the NUG had agreed to work together, with the CNF ""taking a leadership role in Chin State's defence and military warfare.""
After he was shot, Za Latt Thwey said he tried for months to find a safe route to the Myanmar city of Mandalay, but eventually deemed the journey too risky.

In early November, he collected money from family and friends and undertook a five-day journey, mostly by motorcycle, to cross into India.
""I can't box anymore,"" Za Latt Thwey said. ""But I need my arm to be fixed so that I can continue my normal life, so that I can farm.""

RAVANUSA, Italy (Reuters) -Rescuers plan to work through the night in the Sicilian town of Ravanusa to try to find survivors of a suspected gas explosion that killed at least three people.
Two people were found alive under the rubble and six were missing, authorities said on Sunday.
""We have two great friends still under there, we are praying to God that they pull them out okay,"" local resident Lillo Cavallaro told Reuters.
In the explosion late on Saturday, four houses collapsed and another three were damaged, authorities said, adding the blast was likely triggered by a gas leak from the town's pipes, although an investigation was underway to ascertain the cause.
Gas grid operator Italgas expressed its sorrow and condolences to people in Ravanusa. It said its emergency service had received no reports of gas leaks last week. 
""The Ravanusa distribution network was fully inspected in both 2020 and 2021,"" said the company, adding that there were no construction sites on the section of pipeline affected.
Local residents in the town of 11,000 people watched on Sunday as firefighters and civil-protection rescuers tried to locate survivors.

""It is a small town and everyone knows each other,"" said 69 year-old pensioner Arcangelo D'Angelo, adding he knew the missing people. ""What we are living through here is an unimaginable drama and we have no words.""
Ravanusa is near the southwestern Sicilian city of Agrigento, which is famous for its Greek temples.

4,"<span>Dec 12, 2021 01:40PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - After a string of powerful tornados struck the U.S. Midwest https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/devastated-kentucky-tornado-survivors-pick-through-debris-shelter-with-relatives-2021-12-12 and killed more than 100 people this weekend, attention has turned to the warning systems in place and why the movements of the fast-moving storms are so difficult to predict.
A tornado is a narrow, violently rotating column of air that extends from a thunderstorm to the ground, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. About 1,200 tornadoes hit the United States yearly.
Unlike hurricanes https://www.noaa.gov/explainers/hurricane-forecasting which can be seen gathering strength days in advance, a tornado watch https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/tornadoes/forecasting lasts for four to six hours over a certain area when favorable conditions develop for tornadoes. 
Hurricanes usually have diameters measured in hundreds of miles and can last for days or weeks. Scientists can usually predict a hurricane's path three to five days in advance. Tornadoes usually form in a span of a few minutes, are normally a few hundred feet wide, and last for a few minutes.
Tornado watches https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/tornadoes, which are not the same as tornado warnings, are typically issued hours in advance by meteorologists watching the weather 24/7 across the United States and cover parts of a state or several states. They indicate that weather conditions are ideal for a tornado to form, but do not necessarily result in a tornado.
Meteorologists in local offices of the National Weather Service issue a tornado warning when a tornado is either reported by spotters or indicated by radar https://www.weather.gov/safety/tornado-ww and there is a serious threat to lives and properties in its path. The average lead time for tornado warnings is eight to 18 minutes https://weather.com/storms/tornado/news/2021-04-05-tornado-warning-nws-accuracy, according to Weather.com.
Many towns use public warning sirens https://www.weather.gov/unr/Warning_Systems to warn of tornadoes, but rural areas and smaller towns do not have them. Most local radio and television stations broadcast the warnings, as do many smart phone apps and the Wireless Emergency Alerts provided by FEMA that come from cell towers in the vicinity of tornadoes and flash floods.
The genesis of the tornado outbreak over the weekend was a series of overnight thunderstorms, including a super cell storm that formed in northeast Arkansas. That storm moved from Arkansas and Missouri and into Tennessee and Kentucky.
This time was deadlier because the tornados hit at night.

""People rely on a visual confirmation to go into shelter. But at night, you know, you don't have that,"" said Jeff Masters, a meteorologist for Yale Climate Connections.
Masters added that the mile-wide size of the biggest cell was another factor for the widespread destruction. ""That means there's really no place to hide. It's so large and so powerful that even if you're in shelter, you're at danger of losing your life.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) -President Vladimir Putin has lamented the collapse of the Soviet Union three decades ago as the demise of what he called ""historical Russia"" and said the economic crisis that followed was so bad he was forced to moonlight as a taxi driver. 
Putin's comments, released by state TV on Sunday, are likely to further fuel speculation about his foreign policy intentions among critics, who accuse him of planning to recreate the Soviet Union and of contemplating an attack on Ukraine, a notion the Kremlin has dismissed as fear-mongering.
""It was a disintegration of historical Russia under the name of the Soviet Union,"" Putin said of the 1991 breakup, in comments aired on Sunday as part of a documentary film called ""Russia. New History"", the RIA state news agency reported.
""We turned into a completely different country. And what had been built up over 1,000 years was largely lost,"" said Putin, saying 25 million Russian people in newly independent countries suddenly found themselves cut off from Russia, part of what he called ""a major humanitarian tragedy"". 
Putin also described for the first time how he was affected personally by the tough economic times that followed the Soviet collapse, when Russia suffered double-digit inflation. 
""Sometimes (I) had to moonlight and drive a taxi. It is unpleasant to talk about this but, unfortunately, this also took place,"" the president said.
Putin, who served in the Soviet-era KGB, has previously called the collapse of the Soviet Union, which was ruled from Moscow, as the ""greatest geopolitical catastrophe"" of the 20th century, but his new comments show how he viewed it specifically as a setback for Russian power. 
Ukraine was one of 15 Soviet republics and Putin used a lengthy article published on the Kremlin website this year to set out why he believed Russia's southern neighbour and its people were an integral part of Russian history and culture. This view is rejected by Kyiv as a politically motivated and over-simplified version of history.
The West has accused Russia of massing tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine in preparation for a possible attack as soon as January. The Group of Seven wealthy democracies warned Moscow on Sunday of massive consequences and severe costs if it attacked Ukraine. 

The Kremlin has said Russia has no plans to launch a fresh attack on Ukraine and that the West appears to have convinced itself of Moscow's aggressive intentions based on what it calls false Western media stories.
Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014 and has backed separatists who took control of a swath of eastern Ukraine that same year and who continue to fight Ukrainian government forces.

DUBAI (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates is walking a diplomatic high wire between superpower ally Washington, new friend Israel and old adversary Iran as it seeks to avoid a costly regional conflict that could torpedo its trade and tourism ambitions.
Abu Dhabi hosts Israel's prime minister this week and will receive a U.S. delegation seeking to warn companies in the UAE about compliance with sanctions on Iran over its nuclear activities. The Gulf state also dispatched a senior official to Tehran last week in a bid to mend ties and contain tensions.
The whirl of diplomacy marks a shift in foreign policy approach for the UAE, which is retreating from military adventurism after having waded into a series of damaging conflicts over the past decade, from Yemen to Libya, according to Emirati officials, analysts and regional diplomats. 
""We need to avoid a major conflict that will embroil the United States or indeed the countries in the region,"" senior UAE official Anwar Gargash told a U.S.-based think-tank on Thursday. ""Our interest is to try and avoid it at all costs.""
The United States and Israel have recently increased rhetorical pressure on Iran about possible economic or military consequences should efforts to salvage a 2015 nuclear pact fail.
World powers are trying to bring both Washington and Tehran back into full compliance with the pact, which then-President Donald Trump quit in 2018. He re-imposed sanctions, prompting Tehran to gradually violate the nuclear limits of the 2015 deal.
Abu Dhabi, which forged ties with Israel last year, shares U.S. and Israeli concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions along with its missiles programme and regional proxies. But it is trying to balance curtailing Iran with protecting its economic interests as a tourism and commercial hub post COVID-19 in the face of increasing economic competition in the region.
""It is time to de-escalate, not escalate. If Israel is in this mood, we are not going to share it,"" said UAE political analyst Abdulkhaleq Abdulla.
Gargash, diplomatic adviser to the UAE president, told the Arab Gulf States Institute that neither the region nor Washington want another conflict like Iraq or Afghanistan.
Iran rejects Western suspicions that it is seeking atomic weapons, saying its nuclear activities are for civilian energy purposes. It says it abided by the terms of the 2015 deal in good faith, and wants all sanctions imposed by the United States after Trump abandoned the deal to be lifted. 
AMERICA IS 'ABSOLUTE PRIORITY' 
The UAE and Saudi Arabia, while pressing global powers to address Iran's missile programme and regional behaviour, are wary of a repeat of 2019 attacks on tankers in Gulf waters and on Saudi oil facilities that forced the kingdom to temporarily shut down more than half its crude output.
The UAE ""needs to hedge as best as it can to offset Iranian punitive actions, but there can be no doubt that its relationship with the U.S. is absolute priority,"" said Neil Quilliam, associate fellow at Chatham House.
Gulf nations rely heavily on the United States for security but there is deepening uncertainty over the U.S. regional role. Israel has broached setting up joint defences with Gulf states following normalisation of ties with the UAE and Bahrain.
The UAE signed a $23 billion deal at the tail end of the Trump presidency to buy American-made F-35 fighter jets, drones and other defence equipment. But the sales progress has since slowed amid U.S. concerns over UAE ties with China, a major Emirati trade partner.
Gargash said the UAE had recently halted work on Chinese facilities at an Emirati port after Washington voiced concern that they had military purposes.
The UAE, Gargash said, wants to find a ""common economic denominator"" to improve ties with Iran, Turkey and Syria, even as Abu Dhabi builds on relations forged with Israel.
In a sign Washington is cranking up economic pressure on Iran, Treasury official Andrea Gacki is due to visit the UAE as part of a delegation on Monday for what the State Department said were discussions with private sector firms and financial institutions that ""facilitate non-compliant Iranian commerce"".
The UAE, long one of Iran's main links to the outside world with business ties stretching back a century, saw its exports with Iran shrink from $14 billion in 2017 to $7 billion in 2019 according to World Bank data. Flows have started to recover.

Analyst Abdulla said there was no appetite in the UAE for further economic penalties on Iran.
""We have done our job and done our share of compliance in the past five, six years,"" he added. ""But enough is enough. Nobody is in the mood in Abu Dhabi to go for more sanctions. That is very clear.""

LIVERPOOL, England (Reuters) -Russia faces massive consequences and severe costs if President Vladimir Putin attacks Ukraine, the Group of Seven warned in a statement on Sunday.
U.S. intelligence assesses that Russia could be planning a multi-front offensive on Ukraine as early as next year, involving up to 175,000 troops.
The Kremlin denies it plans to invade and says the West is gripped by Russophobia. Moscow says the expansion of NATO threatens Russia and has contravened assurances given to it as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
At a meeting in the northern English city of Liverpool, the G7 delegates said they were united in their condemnation of Russia's military build-up near Ukraine and they called on Moscow to de-escalate.
""Russia should be in no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have massive consequences and severe cost in response,"" said the statement, which confirmed a draft version first reported by Reuters. 
""We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.""
A statement released by the Russian Embassy in London on Saturday evening, before the joint G7 document was reported, said that Britain's frequent use of the phrase ""Russian aggression"" during the Liverpool meeting was misleading and designed to create a cause for the G7 to rally round.
""Russia has made numerous offers to NATO on ways to decrease tensions. The G7 forum could be an opportunity to discuss them, but so far we hear nothing but aggressive slogans,"" the embassy statement said.
'RED LINE'
For Moscow, the growing NATO embrace of a neighbouring former Soviet republic - and what it sees as the nightmare possibility of alliance missiles in Ukraine targeted against Russia - is a ""red line"" it will not allow to be crossed.
Putin has demanded legally binding security guarantees that NATO will not expand further east or place its weapons close to Russian territory; Washington has repeatedly said no country can veto Ukraine's NATO hopes.
In 2014 Russia seized the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine, prompting the West to impose sanctions on Russia. 
The Kremlin on Sunday said that Putin told U.S. President Joe Biden that Russian troops posed no threat and that Moscow was being demonised for moving troops around its own territory. Putin and Biden have agreed to hold more talks, Moscow said.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there were very serious conceptual differences between Russia and the United States on Moscow's ""red lines"".
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia could not exert its sphere of influence over Ukraine.
""That's what Russia is purporting to assert and if we let that go with impunity, then the entire system that provides for stability, prevents war from breaking out, is in danger,"" he told NBC News in a post-summit interview on Sunday.
The G7 comprises Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, as well as a representative from the European Union.

""We call on Russia to de-escalate, pursue diplomatic channels and abide by its international commitments on transparency of military activities,"" the G7 said.
""We reconfirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy Format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk Agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine.""

Moise was murdered in a late-night raid on his home by a group of armed men that included former Colombian soldiers. Haitian authorities have arrested 45 people but have not yet charged anyone with the crime.

(Reuters) - A creeping barrage of U.S. sanctions on top Central American officials has made China an attractive partner for governments resisting Washington's push to tackle corruption and democratic backsliding in the region, officials and analysts say.
The trend was thrust into focus this week when Nicaragua re-established ties with Beijing, severing a longstanding relationship with U.S. ally Taiwan, which relies heavily on diplomatic recognition from small countries.
Other countries in the region are also courting China. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele ratified his country's new economic cooperation accord with China earlier this year after Washington put close aides of his on a corruption blacklist.
Bukele, who this week accused Washington of demanding ""absolute submission or bust"", in May celebrated that China had made $500 million public investments ""without conditions.""
Nicaragua's decision to embrace China followed a slew of sanctions against aides to President Daniel Ortega following his re-election for a fourth consecutive term in a campaign steeped in the arrests of leading opposition figures.
While Nicaragua's case is ""unique"" in Central America due to its increasingly authoritarian bent, the international isolation of Ortega played a role in his switch to China, according to a senior U.S. official, who noted:
""As the sanctions tighten, they look for other avenues and economic partners, there is an element of that.""
U.S. pressure on Central American officials ranges from visa revocations to Treasury sanctions, effectively cutting them off from the global banking system. For El Salvador, Washington is also readying criminal charges against two senior Bukele allies.
Beijing offers respite from U.S. pressure, a strategy that has previously thrown economic lifelines to leaders isolated from the West elsewhere in the region, including Venezuela, said R. Evan Ellis, a professor at the U.S. Army War College.
""China, in pursuing its strategic economic interests, is sustaining authoritarian populists in power, leading to a region which is ever less democratic,"" said Ellis, an expert on China's engagement with Latin America.
'DEBT DIPLOMACY'
Seeking to rebuff Chinese advances in the region, U.S officials have cast Beijing as an unreliable partner for nations desperate for investment to ratchet up faltering economies. 
Pointing to China's investments across the globe that the United States terms ""debt diplomacy"", U.S. officials allege Beijing leaves poorer nations swamped with debts. 
Beijing, which refutes such claims, says it deals with allies as an equal partner and does not meddle in their domestic affairs - an enticing prospect for leaders in a region where the United States has historically wielded vast influence.
In private though, Guatemalan business leaders, for example, fret that U.S. pursuit of political elites for graft will drive government officials towards more forgiving allies.
Still, Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei, who was not invited to a U.S. summit on democracy this week, traveled to Washington anyway and pledged his loyalty to Taiwan. 
In Honduras too, the incoming government of President-elect Xiomara Castro has committed to Taipei for now, and close relations with Washington, despite openly toying with a switch to Beijing during her election campaign.
The United States has welcomed that, with the senior U.S. official saying Washington is willing to provide a ""surge"" in aid to help Castro https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/honduras-next-government-maintain-taiwan-ties-now-transition-team-says-2021-12-10 meet her priority of alleviating Honduras' dire economic situation.

""I suspect the price Honduras will be trying to extract from its Taiwanese patrons not to flip just went up significantly,"" said Ellis at the U.S. Army War College, pointing to Nicaragua.

CANBERRA/PARIS (Reuters) -The French territory of New Caledonia voted against independence in a referendum on Sunday, provisional results showed, amid a big drop in turnout due to a boycott of the vote by the independence movement.
The indigenous Kanak population, who largely favour independence, had called for non-participation in the referendum because they are in a 12-month mourning period following a September surge in coronavirus infections.
Provisional results published by French authorities showed support for a ""no"" to independence was at 96.5%, while turnout stood at 43.9%. Sunday's vote, the third and final ballot on the issue, follows two previous polls in 2018 and 2020 in which the ""no"" vote got 57% and 53% respectively. 
""The Caledonians have chosen to remain French. They decided that freely,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said in a televised address.
""We can't ignore that the electorate remained deeply divided over the years. (...) A period of transition is now starting,"" he added.
New Caledonia's congress president, Roch Wamytan, a pro-independence leader, said he regretted the French government had rejected their call to postpone the third referendum to September 2022 out of respect for local mourning customs. 
""This referendum, for us, is not the third referendum. We consider that there are only two legitimate referendums. 2018 and 2020. This referendum is the referendum of the French state, not ours,"" he said on Franceinfo radio. 
Analysts fear a ""no"" vote will anger independence supporters, creating instability.
""The worst of scenarios? A ""no"" vote which bans independence, but whose legitimacy is rejected by the Kanaks via a massive abstention rate motivated by Paris's refusal to postpone the vote,"" François Heisbourg, an analyst for the IISS think-tank said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
One of five island territories spanning the Indo-Pacific held by France, New Caledonia is the centrepiece of Macron's plan to increase its influence in the Pacific.

Sunday's vote is the third prescribed by a deal hammered out a decade after talks on the island's future began in 1988, and which called for a series of independence referendums.
Fighting erupted in the 1980s in the nickel-rich territory, 1,200 km (750 miles) east of Australia and 20,000 km (12,000 miles) from France, between supporters of independence and those who wanted to stay French.

LIVERPOOL, England (Reuters) -While Russian President Vladimir Putin keeps the West guessing over Ukraine, it was the might of Chinese President Xi Jinping that garnered the long-term strategic focus when the diplomats from the Group of Seven richest democracies met this weekend.
The United States and its other G7 allies are searching for a coherent response to Xi's growing assertiveness after China’s spectacular economic and military rise over the past 40 years.
Putin was the immediate tactical focus at talks in the English city of Liverpool between U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his counterparts. There was support for President Joe Biden's attempt to support Ukraine and deter Putin with a clear warning of severe economic sanctions.
""There’s a huge amount of convergence about what will unfortunately be necessary if Russia makes that very bad choice,"" a senior U.S. State Department official said. 
The West is concerned that Russia might be preparing to attack Ukraine. The Kremlin denies it plans to invade Ukraine but has demanded legally binding security guarantees that NATO will not expand further east. 
Concerns were raised about alleged Russian disinformation campaigns but there was no clear agreement on, for example, whether or not to slap penalties on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, according to sources with knowledge of the discussions.
Russia was included in what became the G8 in 1997 but was suspended in 2014 after annexing Crimea from Ukraine. Moscow says the G7 - the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan - is making aggressive accusations.
If Putin, 69, was the short-term concern, Xi's China was the strategic puzzle on everyone's lips.
There were ""very, very intense discussions especially on China,"" said one official who attended the talks. 
'ANTI-CHINA CLUB'? 
The re-emergence of China as a leading global power is considered to be one of the most significant geopolitical events of recent times, alongside the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union that ended the Cold War.
China in 1979 had an economy that was smaller than Italy’s, but after opening to foreign investment and introducing market reforms, it has become the world’s second-largest economy and is a global leader in a range of new technologies.
Founded in 1975 as a forum for the West's richest nations to discuss crises such as the OPEC oil embargo, the G7 scolded both China and Russia after a summit meeting in Cornwall in June.
China, which has never been a G7 member, retorted in June following that meeting that ""small"" groups no longer ruled the world.
""It’s tremendous that there’s such a focus on the Indo-Pacific here,"" said a second State Department official.
The first State Department official said that foreign ministers discussed the situation in Hong Kong, the Xinjiang region and the importance of peace in the Taiwan straits.
The need to support Lithuania was also discussed. China downgraded its diplomatic ties with the Baltic state and suspended consular services after the Taiwanese Representative Office in Lithuania opened on Nov. 18.
""We have been clear at this meeting this weekend that we are concerned about the coercive economic policies of China,"" British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told reporters. 
The G7 wants to act together over Beijing but without seeming to be an anti-China club. 
Western officials point out that the G7 combined still packs a powerful punch: it has about $40 trillion in economic clout and includes three of the world's five official nuclear powers.
There was serious discussion about G7 coordinated action to counter China over disinformation and to support countries snared in what critics cast as China's global debt-trap web, officials said.
Canada joined Australia, Britain and the United States in a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics in Beijing on Wednesday. China has said https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/china-says-australia-britain-us-pay-price-wrong-acts-2021-12-09 those countries will pay a price for their snub.

At the G7, Japan and Germany were still undecided and Italy was skeptical about the boycott.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis, in his first comments on the tensions between the West and Russia over Ukraine, called on Sunday for serious international dialogue to resolve tensions and urged both sides to avoid an armed conflict.
He said he was praying for ""dear Ukraine, for all its churches and religious communities and for all of its people, so that tensions there are resolved through a serious international dialogue and not with weapons"".
""Weapons are not the path to take. May this Christmas bring peace to Ukraine,"" the pope told thousands of people in St. Peter's Square for his noon blessing and address.
Ukraine is predominantly Orthodox Christian, with Catholics of either the Latin Rite or Byzantine rite making up about 10%percent of the population in the former Soviet republic.
U.S. President Joe Biden said on Saturday he had told Russian President Vladimir Putin that Russia would pay ""a terrible price"" and face devastating economic consequences if it invaded Ukraine.

Ukraine has accused Russia of massing tens of thousands of troops in preparation for a possible large-scale military offensive. 
Russia denies planning any attack and accuses Ukraine and the United States of destabilising behaviour, and has said it needs security guarantees for its own protection.

The Kremlin said Putin and Biden had agreed to hold more talks during a video call on Dec. 7 which focused on East-West relations, which have sunk to their lowest level since the end of the Cold War and are currently strained by the Russian troop build-up near Ukraine. 
Biden used that video call to warn Putin that the West would impose ""strong economic and other measures"" on Russia if it invades Ukraine, while Putin has demanded guarantees that NATO will not expand farther eastward.
In a video released on state TV, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Putin had no particular grounds for optimism after speaking to Biden because of continued, and very serious differences between Russia and the United States over Moscow's so-called 'red lines' which it does not want the West to cross. 
Apart from further NATO expansion eastwards, Russia has said it does not want certain offensive weapons deployed in countries that border it, such as Ukraine. 
Putin on Dec. 7 told Biden that Russian troops were on Russian territory and did not pose a threat to anyone, Peskov said.
""The current...tensions and so on are being created to further demonise Russia and cast it as a potential aggressor,"" Peskov added.
However, he said the two leaders had agreed to hold another round of talks, maybe by video link, a format the two presidents liked. 
""(We will) definitely see each other, I would really want that to happen,"" Putin told Biden, according to a short video released on state TV channel Rossiya 1.

The Kremlin said it was too early to say when the two leaders could meet in person.
The video call between Biden and Putin soothed investors' nerves and helped the rouble to regain some ground after a sell-off driven by another wave of fears about new Western sanctions against Moscow.

MAYFIELD, Ky. (Reuters) -On the day before Thanksgiving, Mayfield Consumer Products in western Kentucky posted photos online showing smiling employees lining up at a buffet table ready to enjoy a special pre-holiday meal together in the factory canteen.
On Friday night, the candle-making plant where workers had celebrated two weeks earlier lay in ruins, flattened by a devastating tornado during a late shift as more than 100 employees toiled inside. The next morning, 40 of them had been rescued; many of the rest were missing. 
The tragedy came as Mayfield Consumer Products, which describes itself as a local, family-owned maker of candles, wax and home fragrance goods, was seeking to expand its workforce, recently advertising job openings on its website and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
Search-and-rescue teams on Saturday combed through the debris of the tornado-ravaged factory on the west side of Mayfield, a picturesque town near the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers in the far southwestern corner of Kentucky.
Mayfield, a community of about 10,000 residents in Graves County, was transformed by the tornado into a landscape cluttered with damaged and demolished buildings, strewn debris, trees uprooted and stripped bare, twisted road signs and sagging utility lines.
Among those said to be unaccounted for at the wrecked factory was an employee identified by family as Jill Monroe, 52, who was last heard from at 9:30 p.m., around the time the storm struck, according to her daughter, Paige Tingle.
Reached through Facebook on Saturday, Tingle told Reuters she had driven four hours to the factory site in the hopes of finding her mother, whose fate remains unknown.
""We don't know what to think. We are extremely nervous. We don’t know how to feel, we are just trying to find her,"" Tingle said. ""It’s a disaster here. My thoughts go out to everyone.""
One employee who survived the collapse live streamed a video from inside where she was trapped, her legs pinned under the rubble.
""I'm really scared,"" Kyanna Parsons-Perez can be heard saying in a live video she shared on Facebook while she waited to be rescued. The screams and prayers of other workers, some in Spanish, pierce the almost complete darkness of the collapsed factory.
""I didn't think I was going to make it,"" Parsons-Perez said in another video she shared after her rescue on Saturday, her birthday. ""My legs, I couldn't move them and I was just freaking out,"" she said, calling the experience the scariest of her life. 
In an interview that aired earlier in the day on NBC's ""Today"" show, Parsons-Perez said among those who rushed to the aid of trapped workers were a group of inmates from the nearby Graves County jail. ""They could have used that moment to try to run away or anything, but they did not. They were there, helping us,"" she said.
Her account of inmates assisting in rescue efforts could not be immediately verified, but Graves County Jail https://www.facebook.com/gravescountyjailandrccenter said in a Facebook post it had ""a few inmates working at the candle factory,"" and that it had lost one staff member. 
A warning had been issued in Mayfield ahead of the deadly tornadoes, both through the local TV station and the town's siren, U.S. Representative James Comer, whose district includes Mayfield, told CNN in an interview. 
He added the workers at the candle factory sheltered where they were supposed to and more people had evacuated to safety than previously thought. 
""I don’t think the death loss there is going to be as high as we first feared,"" Comer said. 
There were no immediate casualty estimates available for the factory or the surrounding community, one of the hardest-hit areas of a storm that carved a 200-mile-long path of destruction through several counties on Friday night. But Governor Andy Beshear estimated at least 100 people had perished in Kentucky as a whole.

About 110 people were believed to have been inside the candle-making plant when it was leveled by the twister, with 40 people rescued as of Saturday afternoon, Beshear told reporters at a news conference.
The Graves County coroner earlier told CNN that 40 people remained unaccounted for at the factory.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration will seek to bolster economic and security cooperation with Southeast Asia through a visit to the region next week by its top diplomat, as it works to forge a united front against China in the Indo-Pacific.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken is due in the Indonesian capital Jakarta on Monday and will also visit Malaysia and Thailand on his first Southeast Asia trip since President Joe Biden took office in January.
Southeast Asia has become a strategic battleground between the United States and China, the world's two largest economies. China claims most of the South China Sea, the vital trade route that links the region, and has turned up military and political pressure on self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing considers its own.
Blinken will pursue Biden's aim of elevating engagement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to ""unprecedented"" levels, focusing on strengthening regional security infrastructure in the face of China's ""bullying"" and discussing the president's vision for an Indo-Pacific economic framework, the top U.S. diplomat for Asia, Daniel Kritenbrink, told reporters ahead of the trip.
The Biden administration sees Southeast Asia as vital to its efforts to push back against China's growing power, but the lack of a formal structure for economic engagement since former President Donald Trump quit a regional trade deal in 2017 has limited its ability to exert influence, while Beijing's only grows.
    The administration has yet to spell out what exactly Biden's envisaged economic framework will entail, although Kritenbrink said it would focus on trade facilitation, the digital economy, supply chain resiliency, infrastructure, clean energy, and worker standards.
Analysts and diplomats said Blinken would likely seek to woo countries by dangling the prospect of hosting U.S. firms relocating production from China as part of efforts to secure sensitive supply chains and of development finance. But there was no sign of a willingness to offer the increased access to the U.S. market the region craves.
""There is a burden of proof on this administration to deliver an economic strategy that shows our allies and partners that we are committed to long-term economic engagement in the region,"" said Matthew Goodman, a regional economics expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.
""What's been rolled out so far has promise in that regard, but it needs to be fleshed out.""
An Asian diplomat said the Biden administration had shown itself serious in its desire to step up engagement with Southeast Asia through a series of senior-level visits this year, Biden's participation in regional summits, and long-standing security cooperation.
""But they don't have a response to China on the economy,"" he said. ""The Chinese are ahead of the game by 20 years. The U.S. needs to do something to help less-developed Southeast Asian countries. Sending aircraft carriers is not enough.""
Senior Biden administration figures, including Indo-Pacific policymaker Kurt Campbell, are acutely aware of the need to compete more effectively economically in the region with China, but any move to rejoin the trade deal Trump quit would be politically fraught given pledges to rebuild a domestic economy critics say is threatened by such mechanisms.
Biden's plan could still be enticing, despite its limitations, Goodman said. 

""If you’re Vietnam, or you’re Indonesia, or Thailand, you want to make a play for being the place where Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) could relocate its assembly capability,"" he said.
""So there's a lot in there that is interesting to these countries, but there's a lot more detail that needs to be provided before they are going to be persuaded.""

OSLO (Reuters) -People in positions of power in Russia are actively promoting the idea of war, and conflict with Ukraine is now distinctly possible, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dmitry Muratov said on Friday.
Receiving his award at Oslo City Hall, Muratov said it was common in Russia to think that politicians who avoided bloodshed were weak, while threatening war was ""the duty of true patriots"".
Muratov, editor-in-chief of Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, won the 2021 award jointly with Maria Ressa of the Philippines, co-founder of news site Rappler, in recognition of their fight for freedom of expression.
""The powerful actively promote the idea of war,"" he said. ""Moreover, in (the) heads of some crazy geopoliticians, a war between Russia and Ukraine is not something impossible any longer.""
U.S. officials have said Russia could soon invade Ukraine following a build-up of troops near the Ukrainian border. Moscow has denied it is planning an invasion.
Muratov also said journalism in Russia was going ""through a dark valley"", with over a hundred journalists, media outlets, human rights defenders and non-governmental organisations having been branded as foreign agents.
""In Russia, this means 'enemies of the people',"" Muratov said, dedicating his prize to all investigative journalists, and to colleagues at Novaya Gazeta killed because of their work.
Muratov's co-laureate Ressa reiterated her call for reform of social media platforms. 
""Our greatest need today is to transform that hate and violence, the toxic sludge that's coursing through our information ecosystem, prioritised by American internet companies that make more money by spreading that hate and triggering the worst in us,"" she said.
""For the US, reform or revoke section 230, the law that treats social media platforms like utilities.""
Ressa and Muratov are the first journalists to receive the Nobel prize since Germany's Carl von Ossietzky won the 1935 award for revealing the Nazis' secret rearmament programme.
Ressa noted in her speech that Von Ossietzky was never able to collect his award as he was held in a concentration camp and died in custody.

""By giving this to journalists today, the Nobel committee is signalling a similar historical moment, another existential point for democracy,"" she said.

The embassy announced the creation of an action group tasked with investigating, identifying and apprehending the smugglers involved in organizing a trailer, crammed with more than 160 people, which overturned on Thursday in the Mexican state of Chiapas. At least 55 migrants, most from Guatemala, were killed and dozens others were injured. 
The United States, Mexico, Guatemala, Ecuador, Honduras, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic would support the efforts, though coordination was open to all regional countries, the embassy said. 
""We have a shared commitment to apply the full weight of the law against those who are responsible, in addition to working in a coordinated manner to combat human trafficking and smuggling in all its manifestations,"" the embassy said in a statement. 
Thousands of migrants fleeing poverty and violence in Central America have traveled through Mexico to reach the U.S. border in recent years. They often face perilous conditions, including transport in crammed trucks organized by smugglers, known as ""coyotes,"" in dangerous conditions.

PUEBLA, Mexico (Reuters) - Some migrants advancing through Mexico vowed on Saturday to press onward towards the United States following a deadly accident in the south of the country that killed dozens of people, mostly from Guatemala. 
At least 55 people were killed and dozens more were injured when a truck packed with migrants flipped over in the state of Chiapas on Thursday.
People spilled from the truck carrying an estimated 166 travelers after it crashed on a curve outside the city of Tuxtla Gutierrez, causing one of the worst death tolls of migrants in Mexico during the past decade. 
The incident comes as the Mexican government tries to stem the number of migrants crossing the territory on their way north toward the U.S. border. 
News of the deadly incident rattled migrants who had made their way to the central state of Puebla, many of them families with children. Still, some said they were determined to push forward to the United States or other cities in Mexico despite the risks of the dangerous journey, which can include relying on people smugglers known as ""coyotes."" 
""I believe that for everything we have done, it is worth moving forward,"" said Lety, a Honduran migrant walking in a large group of fellow migrants on Friday. 
""I encourage all of us who are here to continue and support each other and unite together and I am very sorry for what has happened to others,"" she added. ""It hurts me a lot because we are human beings and we feel.""
In recent days, dozens of migrants were sent from the southern border city Tapachula to Puebla as Mexican migration authorities attempted to dismantle an improvised camp and head off potential caravans of migrants walking north.
The Mexican government previously promised migrants humanitarian visas and transportation to other cities. 
Carmen Morales, a 27-year-old from Guatemala who was making her way to Mexico City on Saturday, said she had no choice but to keep going toward the United States.
""God save the people who died, they are already in another place, but we have to feed the family,"" Morales said. 

""We have to keep trying anyway to go to the United States,"" she said, adding that she was scared of the risky journey but had nothing to return to in Guatemala. 
Officials condemned the Chiapas incident https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/guatemala-seeks-aid-smuggler-crackdown-after-mexico-migrant-deaths-2021-12-11 as the danger of human-trafficking at the hands of coyotes, who often put migrants in perilous situations, including overcrowded trucks, on the journey to reach the U.S. border.

WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden on Saturday said he told Russian President Vladimir Putin that Russia would pay ""a terrible price"" and face devastating economic consequences if it invaded Ukraine.
Biden told reporters the possibility of sending U.S. ground combat troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion was ""never on the table,"" although the United States and NATO would be required to send in more forces to eastern flank NATO countries to beef up their defenses.
""I made it absolutely clear to President Putin ... that if he moves on Ukraine, the economic consequences for his economy are going to be devastating, devastating,"" he said after remarks about the deadly tornadoes that hit the United States on Friday.
Biden, who spoke with Putin by telephone for two hours last week, said he had made clear to the Russian leader that Russia's standing in the world would change ""markedly"" in the event of an incursion into Ukraine.
Biden spent the weekend at his home in Wilmington.
Foreign ministers from the Group of Seven richest democracies on Saturday sent a similar message to Moscow after a meeting in Liverpool, warning of dire consequences for any incursion and urging Moscow to return to the negotiating table.
G7 finance ministers are meeting virtually on Monday to review economic concerns, including inflation, but will also touch on potential sanctions against Russia if it moves against Ukraine, officials said.
Ukraine has accused Russia of massing tens of thousands of troops in preparation for a possible large-scale military offensive. 

Russia denies planning any attack and accuses Ukraine and the United States of destabilising behaviour, and has said it needs security guarantees for its own protection.
Biden last week promised Central European NATO members more military support amid growing concern over the buildup, which countries near Russia's border worry could result in a similar outcome as Russia's 2014 annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine, Lithuania's presidential adviser said.

RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) -Palestinians held municipal elections in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Saturday in a rare democratic exercise and amid rising anger with President Mahmoud Abbas after he cancelled planned legislative and presidential votes earlier this year. 
More than 400,000 Palestinians were eligible to cast ballots for representatives in 154 village councils in the West Bank, where Abbas' Palestinian Authority has limited self-rule. Municipal votes are typically held every four or five years.
Municipal elections are not being held in Gaza, whose Islamist rulers Hamas are boycotting the vote amid a rift with Abbas' Fatah party. The 86-year-old president postponed municipal votes in major West Bank cities, such as Ramallah, that could have been seen as a referendum on Abbas' rule. 
""These elections cannot be an alternative to legislative elections,"" said Ahmad Issa, 23, outside a polling station in the West Bank village of Bir Nabala, adding that a legislative vote could offer ""a horizon for the youth"" and lead to reforms.
In the village of Beit Kahil, women and men lined up outside a polling station, some in facemasks to protect against COVID-19. Once inside, they placed voting papers in envelopes and dropped them into ballot boxes, dipping their fingers in ink as they left in a move to prevent people voting twice.
Abbas, whose support has sagged in opinion polls, drew widespread anger in April when he cancelled https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinians-politics-election-idUSKBN189066 legislative and presidential elections scheduled for the summer, citing Israeli curbs on Palestinian voting in East Jerusalem. 
Abbas' rivals, including Hamas, accused him of using the Jerusalem voting dispute as an excuse to cancel elections that polls showed he and his party would lose to the Islamist group. Abbas, who has ruled by decree for over a decade, denies this. 
A spokesman for Hamas, which boycotted previous municipal elections in 2012 and 2017, said the group ""refuses to participate in partial elections that are tailored to Fatah, and conducted by the Palestinian Authority,"" calling on Abbas to reschedule the cancelled summer votes.
Hamas has enjoyed a surge in popularity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since fighting an 11-day war with Israel in May. The group won student council elections this year at several top West Bank universities, an important barometer of support.

The Palestinians seek statehood in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, territory Israel captured in a 1967 war. Israel annexed East Jerusalem in a move not recognised internationally, and peace talks between the two sides broke down in 2014.
Hamas won the Palestinians' last legislative election in 2006. That victory laid the ground for a political rupture. Hamas seized Gaza after fighting a short civil war there with Fatah in 2007 and has ruled the coastal enclave ever since.

Johnson has found himself facing criticism on a number of fronts in recent weeks from the funding of the refurbishment of his Downing Street flat to a claim he intervened to ensure pets were evacuated from Kabul during the chaotic Western withdrawal in August. 
The most damaging has been reports that a party was held at Downing Street during a 2020 Christmas lockdown when such festivities were banned, with a video emerging this week which showed staff laughing and joking about it.
The Opinium poll for the Observer newspaper found support for the Conservatives, who have held solid leads in polls since winning a landslide victory in a 2019 election, had fallen four points to 32%, while backing for the opposition Labour Party rose to 41%, its biggest lead since 2014.
Johnson's personal ratings were also at their lowest point since the election, with his approval rating at -35%, down 14 points from two weeks ago. The poll also showed that 57% of voters thought he should resign, up from 48% two weeks ago.
There has been growing talk of dissatisfaction with Johnson's leadership among Conservative lawmakers according to political commentators, and it is expected dozens will vote next week against his plan for new measures to combat the spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
""The findings of our latest poll are certainly dramatic, with a devastating fall in both support for the Conservatives and approval for the prime minister,"" said Adam Drummond, Head of Political Polling at Opinium.

He cautioned that Johnson was the ""king of comebacks"" who had recovered from difficult polling situations before. 
""However, unless the Conservatives can turn these numbers around quickly, backbenchers might start asking if the party is over for the prime minister,"" he said.

Evan Neumann, 49, was indicted on Friday on 14 criminal counts stemming from the deadly Capitol siege by supporters of then-President Donald Trump, expanding on charges originally contained in a criminal complaint filed against Neumann in March.
Neumann, of Mill Valley, California, near San Francisco, was seen in video footage donning a gas mask while standing near police in front of barricades set up at the base of the West Front of the Capitol Building, prosecutors said in a statement.
According to documents filed in the case, Neumann later removes his gas mask and shouts at the police, ""I'm willing to die, are you?"" before he physically assaults several officers and rushes into them using a barricade as a battering ram.
Neumann, who has yet to make a court appearance in the case, fled from the United States on Feb. 16 and ""is currently believed to be in Belarus,"" the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia said in a statement.
According to an account published by news outlet the Daily Beast, Neumann was featured last month in a Belarusian state television special titled ""Goodbye, America,"" recounting his journey to the former Soviet republic and its capital, Minsk.
He said on the program that he was seeking political asylum in Belarus because the United States, in his opinion, is no longer a country of law and order, the Daily Beast reported.
Neumann is one of more than 220 individuals charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement during the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, which disrupted a joint session of Congress meeting to formally certify the November 2020 presidential election victory of Democrat Joe Biden over Trump, the Republican incumbent.
Neumann is believed to be the only international fugitive charged in connection with the Capitol riot.

The siege followed a rally near the White House earlier that day in which Trump exhorted supporters to march on the Capitol during a speech in which he repeated false claims that the election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud. 
Four people died the day of the riot, and one Capitol police officer died the next day of injuries sustained while defending Congress. Hundreds of police were injured during the multi-hour melee and four officers have since taken their own lives.

LIVERPOOL, England (Reuters) -The Group of Seven richest democracies on Saturday sought to dissuade Russia from invading Ukraine, putting on a united front to warn of dire consequences for any incursion and urging Moscow to return to the negotiating table.
Led by British foreign minister Liz Truss, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the European Union and foreign ministers from France, Italy, Germany, Japan and Canada met in the northern English city of Liverpool.
The G7 meeting comes as the West frets over China's military and economic ambitions, the possibility that talks to prevent Iran pursuing a path to nuclear weapons could fail, and as Russia masses troops on the Ukrainian border. 
A senior U.S. State Department official described the day's talks as ""intense"" and said there was still a diplomatic path to de-escalate the tensions with Russia.
""If they (Russia) choose not to pursue that path, there will be massive consequences and severe costs in response, and the G7 is absolutely united in that,"" she said. ""“The kinds of costs that we are talking about are designed to be implemented very very fast.""
Addressing the opening session of the talks, British foreign minister Liz Truss had urged the G7 to speak with one voice. 
""We need to defend ourselves against the growing threats from hostile actors and we need to come together strongly to stand up to aggressors who are seeking to limit the bounds of freedom and democracy,"" said at the start of the meeting.
Ukraine is at the centre of a crisis in East-West relations as it accuses Russia of massing tens of thousands of troops in preparation for a possible large-scale military offensive.
Russia denies planning any attack and accuses Ukraine and the United States of destabilising behaviour, and has said it needs security guarantees for its own protection.
""We need to take every action to return to dialogue,"" German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters. Germany takes over the rotating G7 leadership from Britain next year.
Washington is sending its top diplomat for Europe, Assistant Secretary Karen Donfried, to Ukraine and Russia on December 13-15 to meet with senior government officials.
""Assistant Secretary Donfried will emphasize that we can make diplomatic progress on ending the conflict in the Donbass through implementation of the Minsk agreements in support of the Normandy Format,"" the U.S. State Department said in a statement.
COME TOGETHER
Ministers arrived at the Museum of Liverpool to a brass band playing Christmas carols, before starting behind-closed-doors meetings covering development finance, geopolitics and security. Later they left to take in the city's musical heritage over dinner at an exhibition telling the story of The Beatles. 
Britain is calling for G7 members to be more strident in their defence of what it calls ""the free world"", and discussions focused on Russia, China and Iran throughout the day. A statement on the outcomes from the talks is due Sunday. 

The United States, Britain, France and Germany met late into Friday night to discuss the way forward on Iran, following the resumption of talks in Vienna on reviving a 2015 nuclear deal. 
Sunday's statement is expected to include a joint call for Iran to moderate its nuclear programme and grasp the opportunity to revive a multilateral agreement under which Iran limits its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.

LIVERPOOL, England (Reuters) -Germany's foreign minister warned on Saturday that time was running out to find a way to revive a 2015 nuclear deal between world powers and Iran, speaking after meetings with her counterparts from G7 countries.
Talks have resumed in Vienna to try to revive the nuclear pact, with both sides trying to gauge the prospects of success after the latest exchanges in the stop-start negotiations.
""Time is running out,"" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters in Liverpool, England where G7 foreign ministers are meeting.
""It has shown in the last days that we do not have any progress.""
Baerbock said Iran had resumed the talks with a position that set the negotiations back six months. The current round of talks in Vienna follow a pause of five months after the election of a hardline anti-Westerner as Iran's president, Ebrahim Raisi.
Earlier, U.S. officials said Secretary of State Antony Blinken had held a ""productive"" meeting with counterparts from Britain, Germany and France on Friday, discussing the way forward for the Iran talks.
A senior State Department official said there was an ""intense"" conversation among the G7 countries, which were united in their position on the nuclear talks. ""The statement will also be strong on the importance of getting Iran back to the table and that it is possible to conclude a deal but that the time is shrinking, so we're united in that,"" the official, briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity, said.
The official added that U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley was heading back to Vienna for talks.
Iranian officials have previously said they were sticking to their tough stance.
Under the original nuclear deal, abandoned in 2018 by then-President Donald Trump, Iran limited its nuclear programme in return for relief from U.S., European Union and U.N. sanctions. The West fears the programme would be used to develop weapons, something Tehran denies.
Raisi said on Saturday that Tehran was serious in its nuclear talks in Vienna, the official IRNA news agency reported.

The indirect U.S.-Iranian talks, in which diplomats from France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China shuttle between them because Tehran refuses direct contact with Washington, aim to get both sides to resume full compliance with the accord.

A European source, speaking on condition of anonymity, suggested on Friday that Iran had agreed to continue talks from
where they left off in June. Iranian officials denied this.
Under the original deal that then-U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018, Iran limited its nuclear programme in return for relief from U.S., European Union and U.N. sanctions.

But Iran's top negotiator said on Saturday that several issues remained unresolved in the Vienna talks.
""Several points of difference have remained which require decision-making at the high-level and these are still on the table unresolved,"" Ali Bagheri Kani told state-run Press TV.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - (This December 10 story was refiled to fix repetition of paragraph 9) 
The U.S. House of Representatives committee probing the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot said on Friday it had issued six more subpoenas demanding information from witnesses, including some top aides from former President Donald Trump's White House.
The House of Representatives Select Committee issued subpoenas to Brian Jack, who was Trump's White House political director; Max Miller, a former special assistant to Trump now running for a House seat in Ohio with Trump's endorsement; and Bobby Peede, former director of the White House advance staff, which prepared events for Trump's arrival.
The committee said Peede and Miller met with Trump in a private dining room at the White House to discuss Trump's rally on Jan. 6 - the day his supporters marched on the Capitol - and that Jack reportedly reached out to several members of Congress on Trump's behalf to invite them to speak at the rally.
House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy later hired Jack to lead his congressional political operation.
""Some of the witnesses we subpoenaed today apparently worked to stage the rallies on Jan. 5th and 6th, and some appeared to have had direct communication with the former President regarding the rally at the Ellipse directly preceding the attack on the U.S. Capitol,"" Representative Bennie Thompson, the committee's chairman, said in a statement.
The committee also issued subpoenas to Bryan Lewis, a former executive at Fox News who the committee said obtained a permit for a rally outside the Capitol; Ed Martin, whom the committee described as an organizer of Trump's ""Stop the Steal"" movement falsely claiming Trump did not lose the election, and Kim Fletcher, who runs a pro-Trump organization called Moms for America that organized a rally near the Capitol on Jan. 5.
The individuals sent the subpoenas could not be reached for comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS
The committee has issued more than 50 subpoenas and heard from more than 275 witnesses in its investigation of the attack by supporters of the Republican ex-president as Congress met to formally certify his November 2020 presidential election defeat by Democrat Joe Biden.
Four people died the day of the riot, and one Capitol police officer died the next day of injuries sustained while defending Congress. Hundreds of police were injured during the multi-hour onslaught, and four officers have since taken their own lives.

The panel has begun contempt of Congress https://www.reuters.com/world/us/whats-stake-trump-allies-facing-contempt-congress-2021-10-14 proceedings against three Trump supporters for failure to comply with its subpoenas - former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon, and Jeffrey Clark, a former Trump Justice Department official.

PARIS (Reuters) - The conservative candidate who has emerged as Emmanuel Macron's most serious challenger for next year's presidential election kicked off her campaign on Saturday by announcing she would resist German calls for a federal European superstate. 
Valerie Pecresse, who has described herself as ""1/3 Thatcher, 2/3 Merkel"", was the surprise winner of the leadership contest of the conservative Les Republicains party last weekend, and has since got a big bounce in opinion polls.
In her first campaign rally as the candidate of a party that traces its roots to Charles de Gaulle, Pecresse said she wanted the EU to preserve the independence of nation states and not become a federal superstate, like the United States.
Historically, French conservatives have been in favour of European integration in the economic field, such as creating the euro or the single market, but have resisted attempts to shift decision-making to the EU level on sensitive sovereign issues such as foreign policy and defence. 
""I hear some of our German partners suggest that the European Union should evolve into a federal state,"" she said. ""Politely, but firmly, I will say ""no"","" she added.
The agreement forming Germany's new governing coalition under Chancellor Olaf Scholz says the EU should aim to move toward a ""federal European state"" after a constitutional convention within the EU.
Pecresse also said she did not want France to be what she called a vassal of the United States, did not want to see another country exit the EU as Britain did and would work with Scholz despite his left-wing majority.
""I would work with him because Germany is a key ally. But for me, friendship doesn't come without frankness,"" she said. 
At the rally in central Paris, Michel Barnier, the EU's former Brexit negotiator who lost his bid to be the party leader, said he agreed with Pecresse on Europe.
""We never were federalists, we're in favour of a community of nations. Nations need to be respected in Europe. We need nations to fight nationalism,"" Barnier told Reuters.

Pecresse, who heads the greater Paris region and was a minister in Nicolas Sarkozy's last conservative government, was cheered by a poll this week that showed she would beat Macron by a 52-48 margin if she reached the presidential run-off in April.
The poll was the first to project Macron losing the April 24 second round since Pecresse won the centre-right ticket on Saturday. She is vying with far-right contenders Marine Le Pen and Eric Zemmour for a place in the second round, however. Macron has yet to officially declare his candidacy.

FARMINGTON, N.M. (Reuters) - Dozens of U.S. Navy medics have deployed to New Mexico to treat a Delta variant-fueled surge in COVID-19 patients as part of a military operation to treat virus hotspots across Western and Midwest states.
New Mexico is suffering one of the highest levels of new coronavirus infections in the country, its hospitals reaching record capacity levels.
Nearly 50 Navy medics are treating COVID-19 patients at the San Juan Regional Medical Center in Farmington, northwest New Mexico, where critical care patient numbers have been over 200% of capacity for weeks.
""I'm not seeing lots of vaccinated people, we're seeing the population that is unvaccinated with a very aggressive form of COVID running through it,"" said Navy Lieutenant Commander Charles Volk, a pulmonary intensivist, as he sat in the hospital's intensive care unit.
The group is one of 20 military teams set to be deployed to struggling hospitals in at least seven states including Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Michigan and Minnesota, according to Army Staff Sergeant Evan Ruchotzke and a U.S. Army statement.
Navy nurse Kennedy Garcia, working in her fourth COVID ICU hospital ward, said her team received a warm welcome from the Farmington hospital's tired staff.
Garcia has lost four members of her family to COVID-19, including her grandmother. She urged Americans to get vaccinated.
""A vaccine is quick but the picture of your intubated grandmother isn't. A lot of people have had to see that picture; it doesn't go away,"" she said.
New Mexico was a vaccination forerunner, leading all states with its rate of fully vaccinated residents earlier in the year. But immunity levels are now waning.

Patient Larry Goff, 61, caught the virus along with his pregnant daughter. She was hospitalized last week and lost her baby. At first a vaccine skeptic, Goff got his shots six months ago. 
""I was one of the ones that held out for a long time but I'm glad I finally broke down to do it and I would do it again,"" he said from his hospital bed as he struggled to breathe.

GASHENA, Ethiopia (Reuters) - In a roadside village shattered by one of Africa's bloodiest current conflicts, a donkey and its young, turbaned master tiptoe past an unexploded shell rusting by the blasted remnants of a tank, its turret and tracks tossed sideways.
Ethiopian soldiers said the tank's crew had been fighting for Tigray, the rebellious northern region battling the central government. In June, Tigrayan fighters invaded the neighbouring regions of Afar and Amhara, pushing so far south that by the end of November they were fighting near a town just 190 kilometres (118 miles) from Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa.
Now the tables have turned.
A government offensive has driven Tigrayan forces back on multiple fronts. Locals are returning to homes scarred not just by intensive fighting but by what they say are atrocities committed by Tigrayan fighters - a charge the rebels deny. 
Just outside the mountainous Amhara town of Gashena, around 150km east of Lake Tana, the source of the Blue Nile, a Reuters reporting team saw evidence of a fierce battle fought within the last week. 
Abandoned zig-zag trenches sliced the red-orange sandy soil parallel to the road. The shattered tank lay on the edge of a village nestling in a grove of eucalyptus trees decapitated by heavy gunfire or air-bursting shells. 
Government soldiers and Amhara special forces described an ongoing battle to remove small pockets of Tigrayan fighters.
""There is hand-to-hand conflict about 6 kilometres away,"" said an Amhara militiaman in the town. ""But you are safe here. It's just small groups.""
As he spoke, an emplacement of mobile field guns in the greenery close by fired off repeated volleys. 
LOOTING AND KILLING
Gashena mayor Molla Tsega told Reuters that the town, captured by Tigrayan forces in July, was now back in government hands. He said schools and medical clinics had been looted and destroyed, and that Tigrayan forces had killed at least 53 civilians.
Tigrayan fighters had also raped several women, he said. ""The war has had an intolerable effect on the poor people here.""
Reuters could not independently verify the accusations, but they fit a pattern of attacks reported elsewhere in Amhara by human rights organisations.
Tigrayan forces summarily executed dozens of civilians in two towns they controlled in Amhara between Aug. 31 and Sept. 9, a report released on Friday by New York-based Human Rights Watch said.
Reuters was unable to reach Tigrayan forces for comment. Getachew Reda, spokesman for the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), the party that controls most of Tigray, has previously denied targeting civilians in areas under its control.
The TPLF has said that Tigrayan forces entered Amhara to break a de facto government aid blockade on Tigray and free western Tigray - a contested area - from Amhara control.
The government has denied United Nations accusations it was blocking food aid to the famine-hit region.
Daniel Bekele, head of the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission, said reports by villagers of abuses in Amhara, including killings, rapes and destruction of property were widespread and credible. 
They mirrored, he said, similar crimes committed by both sides earlier in the conflict, when fighting was taking place in Tigray.
""It seems to be a cycle of revenge attacks on poor communities,"" Bekele said in an interview in Addis Ababa.
A joint investigation released last month by the United Nations and Bekele's commission concluded that all sides had committed violations that may amount to war crimes. 
ABIY TO THE FRONT
The new offensive against Tigrayan forces came after Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed went to lead military operations himself, addressing citizens wearing a combat uniform and surrounded by soldiers. 
""We will continue [liberating] the remaining areas ... nothing will stop us. The enemy will be destroyed,"" he said this week. 
The offensive recaptured many towns this month, the prime minister's office said, pushing Tigrayan forces back more than 180 km.
Debretsion Gebremichael, the TPLF president, has described the withdrawal as a ""territorial adjustment"" that was part of a broader plan to secure Tigray. 
""Pulling out was a must,"" he said in a video posted online this week, citing foreign intervention by unnamed powers as one reason why the military was making gains. ""The enemy is getting stronger; we also have to be strong and intensify our struggle."" 
Several government soldiers near Gashena told Reuters they had been reinforced by a huge influx of new troops, and airstrikes and drones had hit Tigrayan positions. Ethiopia has bought drones from Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. 
A Reuters team spotted four destroyed tanks and two blown-up armoured anti-aircraft trucks.

Neither side has released casualty figures, but soldiers reported heavy losses on both sides. Reuters saw six ambulances speeding from Gashena towards the rear lines in five hours.
""Now our priority is to liberate ourselves,"" Gizachew Muleneh, spokesman for the Amhara region, told Reuters. Tigray's forces would be pursued, he said. ""We will not stop our offensive until we have eliminated them.""

While most Libyan and foreign figures involved in the process have continued to publicly call for the election to go ahead on schedule, politicians, analysts and diplomats all say in private that this would be very hard to achieve. 
Significant delays could increase the risk of derailing the wider peace process in Libya, though a disputed election conducted without clear agreement on rules or eligible candidates also poses immediate dangers to stability. 
""Given the sensitivities of this stage and the political and security circumstances surrounding it, the commission is keen to exhaust all means of litigation to ensure its decisions comply with issued judgements,"" the commission said in a statement. 
Less than two weeks before the vote, there would be almost no time remaining for the final list of candidates from the 98 who registered to campaign across Libya, giving a huge advantage to those who are already well known. 
Disputes over fundamental rules governing the election have continued throughout the process, including over the voting timetable, the eligibility of major candidates and the eventual powers of the next president and parliament. 
Without any commonly accepted legal framework, it was not clear how far rules would be based on the U.N.-backed roadmap that originally demanded the election or on a law issued by the parliament speaker in September but rejected by other factions.
The process of ruling on the eligibility of candidates has laid bare major vulnerabilities in the process. The commission initially ruled out 25 candidates and set a period of about two weeks for judicial appeals. 
Rival factions have accused each other of intimidating or bribing judicial and administrative officials to sway the final list of candidates. 
With armed groups controlling the ground across Libya, any election conducted without strong international monitoring would be open to accusations of fraud. 

The electoral commission said it was in communication with the Supreme Judicial Council and with a parliamentary committee and would adopt procedures based on those conversations before moving forward with the electoral process. 
Some factions have warned that a delay to the vote could prompt them to pull out of the wider political process.

China seized control of Tibet after its troops entered the region in 1950 in what it calls a ""peaceful liberation"". Tibet has since become one of the most restricted areas in the country. Critics, led by exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, say Beijing's rule amounts to ""cultural genocide"". 
Two activists unfurled a banner over the entry to the building reading, ""No Beijing 2022,"" while five students got inside the building and held a sit-in protest.
""Despite mounting international criticism of the IOC and China, the Chinese regime's human rights abuses in Tibet, East Turkestan, and Hong Kong continue unabated,"" said Tenzing Dhokhar, Campaigns Director of TYAE, one of the protesters.
""By collaborating with China, the IOC is making itself an accomplice of the Chinese Communist Party's crimes, which will be sports-washed by the Beijing Olympics.""
Police started removing the campaigners after three hours of protests. Organisers and a Reuters eyewitness described the protest as peaceful, but the IOC said one of its security guards was injured.
""The IOC always listens to all concerns that are directly related to the Olympic Games. We have engaged multiple times with peaceful protesters and explained our position, but we will not engage with violent protesters who used force to enter the IOC building and injured a security guard by doing so,"" the IOC said in a statement.
The organisation has previously said it is a force for good and cannot have any influence over sovereign states. 

Chinese authorities have been accused of facilitating forced labour by detaining around a million Uyghurs and other primarily Muslim minorities in camps since 2016.
China denies wrongdoing, saying it has set up vocational training centres to combat extremism.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden urged Americans to get vaccinated against COVID-19, vowed to combat inflation and joked about his lack of cooking skills during his first late-night TV appearance on NBC's ""Tonight Show"" on Friday.
Biden, 79, told host Jimmy Fallon that he and first lady Jill Biden had convinced the White House staff to let them make their own breakfast at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
""We come from middle-class backgrounds ... We're not used to people waiting on us,"" he said. ""We can make our own eggs or pour a bowl of ...""
""You make your own eggs?"" Fallon interrupted Biden.
""Well, I don't. Jill does,"" the president chuckled, adding that when she was young, his daughter once told an interviewer: ""My daddy can't do much. He can boil water and make 'pasghetti'.""
It was a rare interview for Biden, who has faced criticism for failing to meet with reporters for more regular news conferences or interviews.
Biden has held just six solo and three joint news conferences since taking office, compared to 35 solo news conferences and one joint event held by former President Donald Trump in his final year in office, according to the American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/statistics/data/presidential-news-conferences at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Asked how seriously he took approval ratings after watching his own drop steadily over the past year, Biden quipped: ""Well, not anymore.""
He said it was his job to address Americans' anxiety about the pandemic and inflation. ""No one should feel sorry for me,"" he said.
Biden said he hoped both COVID and inflation would be ""under control"" by this time next year, and urged millions of Americans who have not gotten vaccinated to do their part to curb the spread of the pandemic. 

""The bottom line is, the way to avoid this virus is to get two shots and then get the booster shot,"" he said. ""It will make a gigantic difference ... it's patriotic to get it done.""
Biden said it would be tough to win congressional passage of his $1.75 trillion social and climate spending bill with no Republican support and even some Democrats not fully on board. He said he still hoped it could pass this year and vowed to ""keep at it"" until it passed.

PARIS (Reuters) - France announced on Friday that it will soon open to the public the most highly classified parts of its national archives about the Algerian war of independence, shedding light on some of the darkest chapters in France's 20th century history.
Between 1954 and 1962, France waged a war against an independence movement in its then colony. Hundreds of thousands of Algerians were killed, and French forces and their proxies used torture against opponents, according to historians.
""We need to have the courage to look the historical truth in the face,"" French Culture Minister Roselyne Bachelot said when she made the announcement about opening up the archive.
The fighting in Algeria convulsed France and prompted a failed coup attempt against then-President Charles de Gaulle to stop him from ending French rule. Almost 60 years after it ended, the conflict is still a highly sensitive and divisive topic in France. 
Declassifying the archives is an important step toward a better understanding of the war, according to Benjamin Stora, a leading French historian of Algeria.
""You can know which people were under surveillance, followed, arrested,"" Stora told Reuters. ""It's the whole chain leading up to repressive measures that can be unveiled.""
He added that the archives might make sense of certain deaths that to this day remain unexplained.

Algeria lived under French rule for 132 years until it won the independence war in 1962.
The announcement took place two days after a trip to Algiers by French Foreign Minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian. He held talks with Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune aimed at reviving dialogue between the two sides, after ties deteriorated sharply.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia (Reuters) - Serb lawmakers voted on Friday to start work on pulling their autonomous Serb Republic out of Bosnia's armed forces, judiciary and tax system, in a non-binding motion meant to pave the way for secession from Bosnia.
The three institutions represent key pillars of joint security, rule of law and the economic system in Bosnia, which was divided into two autonomous regions - the Serb Republic and the Federation dominated by Croats and Bosniaks - after its 1992-1995 war.
The vote in the Serb region's parliament amounted to a non-binding agreement that fell short of a final decision to quit the institutions - a move which would have need the support of the region's upper house. 
Serb opposition groups, who criticised the motions as early campaigning ahead of next year's general election, left the session before the vote took place.
But they amounted to a strong statement of intent from Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik, who has long complained about state institutions such as the judiciary and prosecutors, saying they were established based on decisions by international peace envoys and were not enshrined in the constitution. 
""This is the moment of conquering the freedom for Republika Srpska,"" Dodik told the parliament. ""Bosnia is an experiment ... I don't believe it can survive because it does not have an internal capacity to survive.""
His SNSD party and its allies, which dominate the 83-seat regional parliament, supported the conclusions on withdrawing from the institutions with 48 votes.
The motion said the regional government should now draft new laws on the military, tax system and judiciary over the next six months, to replace the state laws.
Bosnia's constitution was adapted after the war through rulings imposed by envoys and agreements by the two regions.
Dodik , who currently serves as the Serb member of Bosnia's tripartite inter-ethnic presidency, wants to roll back on all reforms made after the war and return the 1995 constitution under which the state was represented by basic institutions only while all powers had belonged to the regions.
Opposition leaders warned the moves may lead the Serb Republic into a new war.
""I think the path you have chosen is dangerous for Republika Srpska and we cannot follow you,"" said Mirko Sarovic, the head of the largest opposition Serb Democratic Party (SDS). 
In a joint statement, the embassies of the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy as well as the European Union delegation said the parliament's motion was ""a further escalatory step"". 

""Members of the governing coalition in the RS (Republika Srpska) must be aware that continuing this dead end path of challenging the Dayton framework is damaging the economic prospects of the entity, threatening the stability of the country and the entire region and jeopardising Bosnia's future with the EU,"" the ambassadors said in a joint statement. 
They were referring to the 1995 Dayton peace accords that ended the Bosnian war.

GENEVA (Reuters) -The United Nations' human rights office is finalising its assessment of the situation in China's Xinjiang region, where Uyghurs are alleged to have been unlawfully detained, mistreated and forced to work, a spokesperson said on Friday.
Rupert Colville said the office of U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet hoped to publish its report in the coming weeks and that there had been ""no concrete progress"" in long-running talks with Chinese officials on a proposed visit.
Earlier on Friday, an unofficial British-based tribunal of lawyers and campaigners said Chinese President Xi Jinping bore primary responsibility for what it said was genocide, crimes against humanity and torture of Uyghurs and members of other minorities in the Xinjiang region. China dismissed the tribunal, which has no powers of sanction or enforcement, as a ""farce"".
""The Uyghurs tribunal has brought to light more information that is deeply disturbing in relation to the treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang,"" Colville told a U.N. briefing in Geneva. 
""We have of course similarly identified patterns of arbitrary detention and ill-treatment in institutions, coercive labour practices and erosion of social and cultural rights in general,"" he said.
'MANIPULATION'
China's mission to the U.N. in Geneva, in a statement issued on Saturday, said it had frequently extended an invitation to Bachelet for a ""friendly visit"".
""However, this visit shall in no way become the so-called 'investigation' under the presumption of guilt,"" it said.
If her office were only interested in ""political manipulation of anti-China forces in the U.S. and the West"" then this would cast serious doubt on its impartiality, it added.

In June, Bachelet publicly suggested a timeline for a visit this year. She has been negotiating the terms of such a visit since Sept. 2018, when allegations first emerged that some one million Uyghurs had been detained in mass camps.
Her findings need to be shared with the Beijing government before they could be made public, Colville said, adding he hoped that would in be a matter of weeks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden highlighted Senator Bob Dole's concerns about U.S. democracy in a tribute on Friday to the former Republican presidential candidate, a World War II veteran Biden called a hero.
Dole, who died on Sunday at age 98, was heralded at a service at the Washington National Cathedral attended by Biden and his wife Jill, Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff, former President Bill Clinton, former Vice President Mike Pence, Republican and Democratic leaders from the U.S. House and Senate, as well as actor Tom Hanks.
Biden, who served with Dole in the Senate for many years, laid his hand on the casket before and after his speech, and clasped the hand of Dole's widow, former Senator Elizabeth Dole.
""Bob Dole was a man of his word. He loved his country, which he served his whole life,"" Biden said in his remarks, adding that Dole was a ""proud Republican"" who valued compromise and a ""willingness to see the other side.""
But, Biden said, ""in his final days, Bob made it clear he's deeply concerned about the threat to American democracy. Not from foreign nations, but from the divisions tearing us apart from within. And this soldier reminded us, and I quote, 'Too many of us have sacrificed too much in defending freedom from foreign adversaries to allow our democracy to crumble.'""
Dole was a supporter of former President Donald Trump but did not share his false contention that the 2020 election Biden won was marred by massive fraud.
Biden told NBC's ""Tonight Show"" host Jimmy Fallon that Dole asked him on his deathbed to deliver the eulogy at his funeral.
""We disagreed, but we were friends,"" Biden said during his first late-night TV appearance since taking office. He said such bipartisan relationships had become ""awful hard"" given the QAnon conspiracy and extreme elements in the Republican Party.
The funeral took place after Dole's body lay in state https://www.reuters.com/world/us/former-us-senator-presidential-candidate-bob-dole-lie-state-capitol-2021-12-09 in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol beginning on Thursday, a tribute similar to those afforded U.S. presidents upon their death.
Dole had been diagnosed https://www.reuters.com/world/us/former-us-senator-presidential-candidate-bob-dole-dies-age-98-statement-2021-12-05 with lung cancer earlier this year.
Dole represented his home state of Kansas for a combined 36 years in the House of Representatives and the Senate, including stints as Republican Senate majority leader and chair of the Republican National Committee. 
Dole was awarded two Purple Hearts from the U.S. military during World War Two for wounds suffered in combat.
He sought the presidency three times and was his party's nominee in 1996, when he lost to Clinton. He was also President Gerald Ford's running mate in the 1976 election won by Democrat Jimmy Carter.

Dole is survived by his wife and by his daughter, Robin.
Dole, known for referring to himself in the third person, made a classic American journey from the poverty of the Great Depression of the 1930s, through World War Two battlefields to the corridors of power.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donors agreed on Friday to transfer $280 million from a frozen, trust fund to the World Food Program (WFP) and UNICEF to support nutrition and health in Afghanistan, the World Bank said as it seeks to help a country facing famine and economic freefall.
The World Bank-administered Afghan Reconstruction Trust Fund will this year give $180 million to WFP to scale up food security and nutrition operations and $100 million to UNICEF to provide essential health services, the bank said in a statement.
The money would aim to support food security and health programs in Afghanistan as it sinks into a severe economic and humanitarian crisis that accelerated in August when the Taliban overran the country as the Western-backed government collapsed and the last U.S. troops withdrew.
The United States and other donors cut off financial aid on which Afghanistan became dependent during 20 years of war and more than $9 billion of the country's hard currency assets were frozen.
The United Nations is warning that nearly 23 million people – about 55% of the population – are facing extreme levels of hunger, with nearly 9 million at risk of famine as winter takes hold in the impoverished, landlocked country. 
Using reconstruction trust fund money and channeling it through the WFP and UNICEF, both part of the U.N. family, appears to be a way to get funding into the country for basic needs in a manner that does not necessarily implicate U.S. sanctions against the Taliban.
""This decision is the first step to repurpose funds in the ARTF portfolio to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan at this critical time,"" the bank said, saying the agencies had presence on the ground to deliver services directly to Afghans in line ""with their own policies and procedures.""
""These ARTF funds will enable UNICEF to provide 12.5 million people with basic and essential health services and vaccinate 1 million people, while WFP will be able to provide 2.7 million people with food assistance and nearly 840,000 mothers and children with nutrition assistance,"" it added.
Earlier on Friday, Reuters reported exclusively that the donors were expected to approve the $280 million transfer. On Dec. 1, Reuters reported that the World Bank board had backed transferring the ARTF funds to the two agencies. 
In its statement, the bank said it would ""continue to work with ARTF donors to unlock additional ARTF funds to support the Afghan people.""

Laurel Miller, a former acting U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, criticized the decision to tap the ARTF for strictly humanitarian aid, saying money should come from other sources and the $1.5 billion fund should be used for a major initiative to halt the collapse of state institutions whose workers have not been paid for months.
""We're talking about a collapse of public services that serve the Afghan people,"" said Miller, who oversees the Asia program of the International Crisis Group, a think tank. ""That’s not about helping the Taliban. That’s about helping Afghans who need a functioning state. They need more than food aid.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Prosecutors in Ghislaine Maxwell's sex abuse trial rested their case on Friday after a fourth woman testified that the British socialite set her up for a sexual encounter with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein when she was a teenager.
Maxwell, 59, will now have an opportunity to mount a defense in the trial, which is moving faster than initially expected. An attorney for Maxwell said on Friday the defense anticipated its case would last no more than four days, and more likely two or three. Proceedings will resume on Dec. 16.
The daughter of late British media baron Robert Maxwell has pleaded not guilty to eight counts of sex trafficking and other charges. Her lawyers have argued that she is being scapegoated for Epstein's alleged crimes. 
The investor killed himself in a Manhattan jail cell at the age of 66 in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex crimes charges. 
On Friday, a woman named Annie Farmer testified that Maxwell touched her breasts while giving her a massage during a visit to Epstein's New Mexico ranch in 1996, when Farmer was 16. She said Epstein crawled into bed and pressed his body against hers during the trip. 
""I just need to get through this,"" Annie Farmer, now 42, recalled thinking to herself when Epstein entered her bed. 
Farmer said she had met Epstein several months earlier during a trip to New York to visit her sister Maria, who worked for Epstein. The three went to the movies, where Epstein held her hand and caressed her, Farmer said. 
That left her wary about traveling to New Mexico to visit Epstein, who she believed would help finance her college education. But she said learning that Maxwell - an Epstein employee who was also in a romantic relationship with him in the 1990s - would be present at the ranch assuaged her concerns. 
She said she never saw Epstein or Maxwell again after the New Mexico trip.

Jurors previously heard from three women who said Maxwell groomed them for abuse by Epstein, including two who said they were 14 when they began having sexual encounters with them. One of those women, Jane, said Maxwell often participated in those encounters. 
Another, known as Carolyn, said Maxwell once touched her breasts and buttocks while Carolyn was nude and preparing to massage Epstein.

TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico (Reuters) -Most of the 55 people killed and the dozens who were injured when a truck packed with migrants flipped over in southern Mexico on Thursday were Guatemalans, authorities said on Friday, as survivors recounted the horror of the accident.
People spilled from the truck carrying an estimated 166 travelers after it crashed on a curve outside the city of Tuxtla Gutierrez in the state of Chiapas, causing one of the worst death tolls of migrants in Mexico in the past decade.
""We were traveling all squeezed together, there was no space, most of us were standing,"" Esvin Miguel Chipel, a 19-year-old Guatemalan survivor, said from the Tuxtla Gutierrez hospital where he was receiving treatment for his injuries.
The government said state prosecutors had opened a murder investigation into the incident, which officials in Chiapas said had claimed the lives of 55 people, including a 16-year-old girl, and injured dozens more.
The attorney general's office said preliminary findings showed nearly all the victims were Guatemalans. Chiapas officials said three people from the Dominican Republic, a Honduran, a Mexican and an Ecuadorean were among the injured.
Video footage showed bodies strewn on the ground after the overturned truck slammed to a halt by a highway footbridge. A few local residents reported seeing migrants fleeing the scene, while other survivors sat in stunned silence or struggled to get up.
An unidentified Guatemalan man interviewed at the crash site said that when the truck driver tried to negotiate the bend, the weight of people inside caused the vehicle to flip.
""The trailer couldn't handle the weight of people,"" he said.
In hospitals, doctors tended to shaken-up survivors of the crash who had broken bones, and suffered cuts and bruises.
Emerson (NYSE:EMR) Morales, 23, from Guatemala's Quiche region, sat slumped on a hospital cot at the Red Cross in Tuxtla Gutierrez with dark red scratches and bruising visible on his shoulder.
He had also hurt his hip and neck and could not find the 17-year-old cousin he had set off with for the United States.
""I feel bad,"" he said. ""My main worry right now is for him.""
THE AMERICAN DREAM
The head of Mexico's National Guard, Luis Rodriguez, said at a government news conference that the driver of the truck fled the scene and that the migrants on board told authorities they had entered Chiapas a few days before the accident took place.
Many stayed in the town of San Cristobal de las Casas in so-called safe houses run by people smugglers before boarding the truck on Thursday afternoon, Rodriguez said.
The truck was due to take the migrants as far as the central city of Puebla before they moved on, the government said.
Each month, thousands of migrants fleeing poverty and violence in Central America travel through Mexico to reach the U.S. border. They often cram inside large trucks organized by smugglers in dangerous conditions.
Political leaders expressed consternation at the death toll, and urged migrants not to undertake the journey.
""Human smugglers disregard human life for their own profit. Please don't risk your lives to migrate irregularly,"" Ken Salazar, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Many migrants fall prey to criminal gangs en route. In January, 19 people, mostly migrants, were massacred with suspected police involvement in northern Mexico.
Record numbers of people have been arrested on the U.S.-Mexico border this year as migrants seek to capitalize on President Joe Biden's pledge to pursue more humane immigration policies than his hardline predecessor, Donald Trump.

Many survivors of the accident, including Ciriaco Rodriguez, a Guatemalan who fractured his arm, said they got into the trailer to make a new life for themselves in the United States.
""More than anything it was to get to the American Dream,"" Rodriguez told Reuters.

VIENNA (Reuters) -World powers and Iran were locked in talks on reviving their nuclear deal on Friday, with a European source saying they were working from texts discussed five months ago and Iranian officials saying they were sticking to a tough stance from last week.
The talks resumed on Thursday with the United States and Israel - which is not a party to the 2015 deal - piling rhetorical pressure on Tehran about the possible economic or military consequences if diplomacy fails.
Iran's top negotiator, Ali Bagheri Kani, said Tehran was standing firm on the position it laid out last week, when the talks broke off with European and U.S. officials accusing Iran of making new demands and of reneging on compromises worked out earlier this year.
Asked whether new draft proposals that Iran had put forward last week were being discussed, Bagheri Kani told Reuters: ""Yes, the drafts we proposed last week are being discussed now in meetings with other parties.""
Bagheri said last week that ""all the issues that had been drafted during the previous negotiations until June can be negotiated"". 
""Iran backs result-oriented talks and we are determined to reach a deal that guarantees our nation's interests,"" Bagheri told reporters in Vienna. 
A European source, speaking on condition of anonymity, appeared to suggest that Iran had agreed to continue talks from where they left off in June. This would be put to the test in the next couple of days, the source said, but made no mention of Iran's new proposals. Iranian officials denied it.
Under the original deal that then-President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018, Iran limited its nuclear programme in return for relief from U.S., European Union and U.N. sanctions. The 
West fears the programme would be used to develop weapons, something Tehran denies.
The indirect U.S.-Iranian talks, in which diplomats from France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China shuttle between them because Tehran refuses direct contact with Washington, aim to get both sides to resume full compliance with the accord. 
A year after Trump's reimposition of sanctions on Iran, Tehran began to gradually violate nuclear limits of the agreement. Iran wants all sanctions to be lifted.
""Iran's seriousness is obvious. See who has cancelled other meetings and is in Vienna and who is not,"" Bagheri Kani said. 
His comments suggested he was alluding to the United States' chief negotiator Rob Malley, who is not expected to arrive in Vienna until the weekend.

However, a senior European Union official said on Friday the talks are moving forward and that various big matters were still open for a deal on a final text.
The talks resumed last week after a five-month hiatus caused by the June election of hardline cleric Ebrahim Raisi as Iran's president.

KYIV (Reuters) -Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday said he did not exclude holding a referendum on the future status of war-torn eastern Ukraine and the Crimea peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. 
Zelenskiy did not give detail on how and when a referendum could be held, but said it was one of the options to revive a stalled peace process in eastern Ukraine and end a standoff with neighbouring Russia. 
Ukraine has scrambled to shore up support from Western allies in recent weeks, accusing Russia of massing tens of thousands of troops near its borders in preparation for a possible large scale military offensive. 
Relations between Kyiv and Moscow collapsed after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and Moscow-backed forces seized territory in eastern Ukraine that Kyiv wants back. Kyiv says some 14,000 people have been killed in fighting since then.
""I do not rule out a referendum on Donbass in general,"" Zelenskiy told the 1+1 television channel. ""It might be about Donbass, it might be about Crimea, it might be about ending the war in general,"" he said. ""So it may be that someone, this or that country can offer us certain conditions.""
Zelenskiy has welcomed U.S. President Joe Biden taking a ""personal role"" in trying to end the war in eastern Ukraine. Zelenskiy said Biden had conveyed Russian reassurances that Moscow would not cause an escalation.
Zelenskiy also said he would not rule out direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
Russia demanded on Friday that NATO rescind a 2008 commitment to Ukraine and Georgia that they would one day become members and said the alliance should promise not to deploy weapons in countries bordering Russia that could threaten its security.
Russia denies planning any attack on Ukraine but accuses Kyiv and Washington of destabilising behaviour, and has said it needs security guarantees for its own protection.

Ukraine has dismissed Moscow's demands for security guarantees as illegitimate and Zelenskiy said Biden had not tried to force concessions on him. 
""We didn't talk about any compromises,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday left in place a ban on most abortions in Texas but allowed a legal challenge to proceed, with the fate of the Republican-backed measure that allows private citizens to enforce it still hanging in the balance.
The justices in an 8-1 ruling lifted a block on lower court proceedings and permitted a lawsuit by abortion providers, which may pave the way for a federal judge to block the nation's toughest abortion law at least in part. The conservative-majority court on Sept. 1 declined to halt the law on the day it took effect. It also dismissed on Friday a separate challenge by President Joe Biden's administration.
The law bans abortions at around six weeks, a point when many women do not yet realize they are pregnant, with no exception for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. 
The Supreme Court has yet to decide another major abortion case https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-consider-rolling-back-abortion-rights-2021-12-01 from Mississippi that could lead to the overturning of the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized the procedure nationwide. Mississippi's law, blocked by lower courts, bans abortions at 15 weeks of pregnancy. The conservative justices during arguments on Dec. 1 indicated https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-consider-rolling-back-abortion-rights-2021-12-01 sympathy toward Mississippi's law and potential support for overturning Roe. 
Abortion providers and Biden's administration had asked the Supreme Court to block the Texas law while the litigation continues, but the justices opted to leave it in place for now.
Friday's ruling did not directly address the broader questions raised in the Mississippi case and the court's decision not to block the Texas law was another signal that its majority may be inclined to curb abortion rights.
The Texas law enables private citizens to sue anyone who performs or assists a woman in getting an abortion after embryo cardiac activity is detected. Individual citizens can be awarded a minimum of $10,000 for successful lawsuits. Biden's administration has called this a ""bounty."" 
""It's stunning that the Supreme Court has essentially said that federal courts cannot stop this bounty-hunter scheme enacted to blatantly deny Texans their constitutional right to abortion. The court has abandoned its duty to ensure that states do not defy its decisions,"" said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which challenged the law on behalf of abortion provider Whole Woman's Health.
The Justice Department said in a statement it would pursue its challenge in lower courts ""to protect the rights of women and uphold the Constitution.""
The office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican who defended the law, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
WAVE OF STATE LAWS
The measure is one of a series of restrictive abortion laws passed by Republicans at the state level in recent years.
""We celebrate that the Texas Heartbeat Act will remain in effect, saving the lives of unborn children and protecting mothers while litigation continues in lower courts,"" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, a group opposing abortion.
The ruling authored by conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch stated that a narrow lawsuit is allowed under a 1908 Supreme Court precedent that said state laws can be challenged in federal court by suing state officials. 
Texas had sought to exploit a loophole in the 1908 ruling by saying no state officials could enforce the law. The Supreme Court said challengers could pursue their case by naming state licensing officials including members of the Texas Medical Board and the Texas Board of Nursing as defendants. 
The lone dissenter, conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, said he would have tossed the lawsuit.
Abortion rights advocates said being able to sue only the licensing officials may not provide a pathway to fully block the law. A five-justice majority ruled that neither state court clerks nor the Texas attorney general could be sued as Whole Woman's Health sought. Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts and the court's three liberals disagreed, saying those officials should be considered proper defendants. 
The case now returns to U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman. Separately, a state court judge ruled on Thursday that the law violates the Texas constitution https://www.reuters.com/world/us/judge-rules-citizen-enforcement-texas-abortion-law-unconstitutional-2021-12-10 with its private-enforcement mechanism.
Roberts criticized the law as specifically designed to ""nullify"" the Supreme Court's precedents on abortion, effectively denying women a constitutional right. 
""The nature of the federal right infringed does not matter; it is the role of the Supreme Court in our constitutional system that is at stake,"" Roberts wrote.

Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor blasted the court for failing to ""put an end to this madness"" and warning that other states could try to copy the Texas enforcement mechanism.
""The court thus betrays not only the citizens of Texas but also our constitutional system of government,"" Sotomayor added in an opinion joined by the other two liberal justices.

The publicist knocked on the door and offered to help.
The visitor, Trevian Kutti, gave her name but didn’t say she worked for West, a longtime billionaire friend of Trump. She said she was sent by a “high-profile individual,” whom she didn’t identify, to give Freeman an urgent message: confess to Trump’s voter-fraud allegations, or people would come to her home in 48 hours, and she’d go to jail.
Freeman refused. This story of how an associate of a music mogul pressured a 62-year-old temporary election worker at the center of a Trump conspiracy theory is based on previously unreported police recordings and reports, legal filings, and Freeman’s first media interview since she was dragged into Trump’s attempt to reverse his election loss.
Kutti did not respond to requests for comment. Her biography for her work at the Women’s Global Initiative, a business networking group, identifies her as a member of “the Young Black Leadership Council under President Donald Trump.” It notes that in September 2018, she “was secured as publicist to Kanye West” and “now serves as West’s Director of Operations.”
When Kutti knocked on Freeman's door on Jan. 4, Freeman called 911. By then, Freeman said, she was wary of strangers.
Starting on Dec. 3, Trump and his campaign repeatedly accused Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, of illegally counting phony mail-in ballots after pulling them from mysterious suitcases while working on Election Day at Atlanta’s State Farm Arena. In fact, the “suitcases” were standard ballot containers, and the votes were properly counted, county and state officials quickly confirmed, refuting the fraud claims.
But Trump and his allies continued to accuse Freeman and Moss of election-rigging. The allegations inspired hundreds of threats and harassing messages against them and their family members.
By the time Kutti arrived, Freeman needed help but was cautious and wouldn’t open the door because of the threats, according to Freeman and a police report.
So Freeman asked a neighbor to come over and talk with Kutti, who was with an unidentified male. Like Freeman, Kutti and the other visitor were Black. Kutti told the neighbor that Freeman was in danger and that she’d been sent to provide assistance. Freeman said she was open to meeting them. She asked Cobb County Police to send an officer to keep watch so she could step outside, according to a recording of her 911 call.
“They’re saying that I need help,” Freeman told the dispatcher, referring to the people at her door, “that it’s just a matter of time that they are going to come out for me and my family.” 
An officer arrived and spoke with Kutti, who described herself as a “crisis manager,” according to the police incident report.
Kutti repeated that Freeman “was in danger” and had “48 hours” before “unknown subjects” turned up at her home, the report said. At the officer’s suggestion, the women agreed to meet at a police station. The officer’s report did not identify the man accompanying Kutti.
'YOU’RE A LOOSE END'
Inside the station, Kutti and Freeman met in a corner, according to footage from a body camera worn by an officer present at the meeting. Reuters obtained the video through a public-records request.
“I cannot say what specifically will take place,” Kutti is heard telling Freeman in the recording. “I just know that it will disrupt your freedom,"" she said, ""and the freedom of one or more of your family members.”
“You are a loose end for a party that needs to tidy up,” Kutti continued. She added that “federal people” were involved, without offering specifics.
According to Freeman, Kutti told her that she was going to put a man named “Harrison Ford” on speakerphone. (Freeman said the man on the phone wasn’t the actor by the same name.) Kutti said the man had “authoritative powers to get you protection,” the bodycam footage shows.
At that point, Kutti can be heard asking the officer to give them privacy. The body camera did not capture a clear recording of the conversation that followed after the officer moved away from the two women.
Kutti and the man on the speakerphone, over the next hour, tried to get Freeman to implicate herself in committing voter fraud on Election Day. Kutti offered legal assistance in exchange, Freeman said.
“If you don't tell everything,” Freeman recalled Kutti saying, “you're going to jail.” 
Growing suspicious, Freeman said she jumped up from her chair and told Kutti: “The devil is a liar,” before calling for an officer.
Later at home, Freeman said, she Googled Kutti’s name and discovered she was a Trump supporter.
Police say they did not investigate the incident further.
West, who changed his name in October to “Ye,” did not respond to requests for comment sent through another publicist who represents him.
Reuters could not independently confirm whether Kutti still works for West, or in what capacity.
Media reports have cited her association with the rapper since 2018, when she ceased working with R. Kelly, an R&B singer who was convicted in September of racketeering and sex-trafficking charges. Kutti's biography says she is the founder of Trevian Worldwide, a media and entertainment advisory firm with offices in four cities. Among her clients, she says, are boxer Terence Crawford and Queen Rania Al Abdullah of Jordan.
The meeting took place two months after West ended a failed bid for the White House that drew media attention when several publications revealed that allies and supporters of Trump were working on the ground to advance West’s campaign. Some Democrats said they regarded West’s presidential bid as a ruse to siphon off Black votes from Democrat Joe Biden. Groups assisting the rapper’s campaign denied that charge.

On Jan. 5, the day after Freeman's meeting with Kutti, an agent from the Federal Bureau of Investigation called Freeman and urged her to leave her home of 20 years because it wasn’t safe, Freeman said.
The following day, Jan. 6, Kutti’s prediction that people would descend on Freeman’s home in 48 hours proved correct, according to a defamation lawsuit Freeman and Moss filed last week against a far-right news site. Freeman, the lawsuit said, left hours before a mob of angry Trump supporters surrounded her home, shouting through bullhorns.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced mounting pressure on Friday after his Conservatives lost their poll lead over Labour and it was revealed that his communications chief attended a festive gathering in Downing Street during a lockdown last year.
Johnson, who won a landslide victory in a 2019 election, has faced a barrage of criticism since a video emerged showing his staff laughing and joking about a Downing Street party during a 2020 Christmas lockdown when such festivities were banned.
Downing Street had denied a party took place. Johnson said he was furious about the impression the video gave that there was one rule for those at the heart of British power and another for the people.
""The biggest Labour lead we have found since January and suggests the ongoing rows over the Downing Street party are cutting through, and are damaging the Government's support,"" YouGov's Head of European Political and Social Research, Anthony Wells, told Reuters. ""What remains to be seen though is whether there is lasting damage.""
Johnson told parliament on Wednesday that he had been assured COVID rules were not broken and that there had been no party. He has asked Britain's most senior civil servant, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, to investigate. 
But broadcasters  ITV  (LON:ITV) and the BBC reported that Johnson's most senior communications adviser, Jack Doyle, had made a speech and handed out awards as part of a joke ceremony at an alleged party on Dec. 18 last year. 
Johnson's spokesman said the prime minister had full confidence in Doyle. Doyle, who at the time of the alleged party was deputy director of communications, did not respond to a request for comment.
Johnson, 57, has faced criticism in recent months over his handling of a sleaze scandal, the awarding of lucrative COVID contracts, the refurbishment of his Downing Street flat and a claim he intervened to ensure pets were evacuated from Kabul during the chaotic Western withdrawal in August.
Opposition parties have accused him of lying and being unfit for office, and some have called on him to resign.
As he grappled with the furore, his Conservative Party lost its poll lead over the opposition Labour Party and dozens of his own lawmakers prepared to rebel over new COVID rules. 
A YouGov poll for The Times newspaper showed Johnson's Conservatives had dropped 3 percentage points from Dec. 2 to 33% of the vote while Labour rose 4 percentage points to 37%. 
Three quarters of people believe that there was a Christmas party in which coronavirus rules were broken and 68% of those polled believe Johnson was not telling the truth when he denied it, The Times said. 
A separate YouGov poll said Johnson's popularity has fallen to its lowest level since he took office.
A Survation poll of 1,178 people carried out on Wednesday and Thursday put Labour on 40% of the vote, up 1 percentage point, and Johnson's Conservatives down 2 to 34%. 
At the time of the Downing Street gathering, people across Britain were banned from meeting close family or friends for a traditional Christmas celebration - and even from bidding farewell to dying relatives. Nearly 146,000 people have died from COVID in the United Kingdom.
Johnson imposed new COVID restrictions on England on Wednesday, angering the libertarian wing of his party. 

Dozens of Conservative lawmakers are planning to oppose the new rules in a vote in parliament next week. 
""I expect a record number of Conservative MPs to vote against these latest restrictions,"" said John Redwood (NYSE:RWT), a Conservative lawmaker.

CHAMPHAI, India (Reuters) - The former boxer said he and his comrades were perched on a hillside near the town of Mindat, in Myanmar's northwest, and preparing to ambush a patrol of soldiers when the troops opened fire and a bullet smashed into his forearm.
""I tried to run but I got shot again in the upper arm,"" Za Latt Thwey, who requested that he be identified by the name he uses as a boxer, told Reuters near a safe house in India's Mizoram state, which borders Myanmar.
An Indian orthopaedic surgeon's note said the 25-year-old had suffered a gunshot wound and an X-ray showed where his bone had been shattered.
That skirmish in mid-May was part of what seven people involved in the rebellion, including five fighters, said was a growing popular resistance to Myanmar's military in Chin state.
Their accounts include previously unreported details of how the rebellion there began and expanded.
As in other parts of the country, civilians enraged by the military coup in February and subsequent crackdown on protesters are taking up arms. The junta appears to be worried about the threat they pose in Chin.
In the last few weeks, the military, known as the Tatmadaw, has sent reinforcements to Chin, which had been largely peaceful for years, and launched a major offensive against rebels, according to some analysts and rights groups.
More than a dozen so-called Chinland Defence Force (CDF) opposition groups have sprung up in the state, according to three of the sources, who described an expanding network of fighters whose knowledge of local terrain is a major advantage.
They said the groups had established supply chains, food stockpiles and weapon depots and linked up with a long-established ethnic group called the Chin National Front (CNF) to train in combat and better coordinate operations.
The military has said all resistance forces and the shadow government are ""terrorists"".
CNF spokesman Salai Htet Ni told Reuters the group had helped train Chin youth and protesters in basic guerrilla warfare after the military coup.
""Our unity and public support is our strength,"" said a 32-year-old fighter from Chin's capital Hakha.
Reuters was not able to independently verify some claims made by the sources about the strength of the rebellion and scale of the Tatmadaw's response.
Myanmar's military spokesperson and the Ministry of Information did not respond to requests for comment on the growing resistance in Chin or the armed forces' deployments.
The Tatmadaw's response to resistance in Chin and elsewhere has prompted warnings from the United Nations and United States that the brutal clampdown on Rohingya Muslims in neighbouring Rakhine state in 2017 risked being repeated.
More than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims fled Rakhine that year and refugees accused the military of mass killings and rape. UN investigators said the military had carried out the atrocities with ""genocidal intent"".
Myanmar authorities said they were battling an insurgency and deny carrying out systematic atrocities.
The military has not released details of overall battlefield losses since the February coup.
NOODLES AND SHOTGUNS
Before he took up arms, the fighter from Hakha said he was a postgraduate student of history who joined widespread public demonstrations against the February coup.
Like the four other fighters Reuters interviewed in Mizoram, he said his decision to join the resistance was triggered by the military's suppression of peaceful protests that demanded civilian rule be restored.
Local monitoring group the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) says junta forces have killed more than 1,300 people and detained thousands in a bid to crush opposition to the coup.
The military has outlawed AAPP, saying it is biased and uses exaggerated data. The AAPP has not responded to that accusation.
Groups of young protesters in Hakha began stockpiling food including rice, oil and noodles and medical supplies in multiple locations in the jungle surrounding the township of around 50,000 people, two of the fighters said.
In April, some CDF groups met in Camp Victoria, the CNF's headquarters, to coordinate armed resistance against the Tatmadaw, according to the fighter from Hakha.
The CNF, which has a military wing, has become pivotal to the resistance, providing training and other support to several CDF groups across the state, said two fighters and a senior leader of the National Unity Government (NUG).
The NUG, effectively a shadow government, comprises pro-democracy groups and remnants of the ousted civilian administration. It has held talks with foreign officials, including from the United States.
In the early months of the resistance, nearly 2,000 volunteers from Hakha were sent to Camp Victoria for combat training under the CNF, the two fighters said, a level of coordination not previously reported.
NEW KIND OF CRISIS
By May, three of the CDF fighters said they were taking on the Tatmadaw in several parts of Chin, a 36,000 square kilometre province with nine major townships.
Outside Mindat, Za Latt Thwey said he was among the guerrillas, some trained by the CNF, who targeted Tatmadaw patrols.
In cellphone footage taken by fighters, and shown to Reuters by Za Latt Thwey, small groups of young men could be seen perched on wooded hillsides firing homemade guns and automatic rifles. Reuters could not independently verify the footage.
Financial support for the rebels in Mindat has mostly come from the Chin diaspora and the NUG, said an ousted Chin lawmaker, who declined to be named.
Through multiple routes, including from India, the lawmaker said food, clothes, medicine and equipment were reaching the rebels each month.
Weapons and explosives were the hardest to procure, according to the lawmaker, the NUG leader and three of the fighters.
The CDF Hakha, with some 2,000 volunteers, is run by a 21-member council that oversees command stations, smaller camps and supporting units, two of the rebels said.
Across Chin violence has escalated in the last four months as the Tatmadaw clashes with a rising number of rebel groups, according to analysis from the Chin Human Rights Organisation (CHRO).
""We have never had this kind of crisis before in Chin,"" said CHRO's Salai Za Uk Ling.
Once a thriving settlement of some 10,000 people, the hilltop town of Thantlang is now virtually deserted, surrounded by soldiers who set alight more than 500 buildings since early September, according to two former residents and the CHRO.
The U.S. State Department singled out events in Chin, and Thantlang in particular, in a statement last month urging the military to end the violence.
Pa Hein, 55, who said he was among the last people to leave the town in late September, told Reuters by telephone that he saw Tatmadaw troops ransack shops and set buildings on fire.
The Myanmar military has denied the accusations, and blamed insurgents for instigating fighting in Thantlang and burning homes.
SEEKING TREATMENT
After the first police defectors trickled into India's Mizoram state in early March, followed by Myanmar lawmakers and thousands of others seeking shelter, the mountainous border province has become a buffer zone for Chin guerrillas.
The Indian government did not respond to a request for comment.
Mizoram authorities estimate around 12,900 people have crossed over from Myanmar, including 30 ousted state and federal lawmakers, according to a senior Mizoram police official who declined to be named.
Some of the lawmakers and leaders have been helping the resistance, and as fighting intensifies they are seeking to unify and support the rebels.
The NUG wants to bring all armed resistance groups under a single command with the assistance of the CNF, said the Chin lawmaker and senior NUG leader.
CNF's Salai Htet Ni said the group and the NUG had agreed to work together, with the CNF ""taking a leadership role in Chin State's defence and military warfare.""
After he was shot, Za Latt Thwey said he tried for months to find a safe route to the Myanmar city of Mandalay, but eventually deemed the journey too risky.

In early November, he collected money from family and friends and undertook a five-day journey, mostly by motorcycle, to cross into India.
""I can't box anymore,"" Za Latt Thwey said. ""But I need my arm to be fixed so that I can continue my normal life, so that I can farm.""

61,"<span>Dec 10, 2021 12:52PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - New limits on abortion rights are being pursued in the United States and other countries.
Here is a look at global abortion statistics and some of the world's strictest abortion laws based on information from the U.N. World Health Organization as well as from the Guttmacher Institute research group and the Center for Reproductive Rights legal advocacy group, both of which support abortion rights.
- Approximately 73 million abortions occur worldwide annually, with 61% of all unintended pregnancies and 29% of all pregnancies ending in abortion, according to the World Health Organization. It said about 45% of all abortions are unsafe, of which 97% occur in developing countries. A WHO fact sheet said, ""Unsafe abortion is a leading - but preventable - cause of maternal deaths and morbidities.""
- There are about two dozen countries where abortion is prohibited altogether, a list that includes Egypt, Iraq, the Philippines, Laos, Senegal, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Haiti and the Dominican Republic, according to the Guttmacher Institute. About three dozen other countries allow it only to save the life of the mother, a list that includes Nigeria, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, Ireland, Iran, Afghanistan and Myanmar, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Around 40% of women of reproductive age live in places where abortion access is illegal or limited. 
- In the United States, a series of restrictive Republican-backed laws have been passed at the state level, with the conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court considering overturning a 1973 precedent that legalized the procedure nationwide in a case involving a Mississippi abortion ban - blocked by lower courts - beginning at 15 weeks of pregnancy. The court on Friday allowed a legal challenge brought by abortion providers to proceed against a Texas law that went into effect in September that bans the procedure at about six weeks of pregnancy.
- Poland in January put into effect a constitutional court decision prohibiting abortions performed due to fetal defects, banning the most common of the few legal grounds for terminating a pregnancy in the largely Catholic country.
- El Salvador has some of the world's strictest abortion laws, with the procedure banned without exception since 1998. More than 180 women who experienced obstetric emergencies were prosecuted for abortion or aggravated homicide in the past 20 years.
- Women in Malta are denied access to abortion, even if their lives are at risk. It is the only EU member state that completely prohibits the procedure. Women face up to three years in jail.
- Senegal prohibits abortion but its code of medical ethics allows it if three doctors agree it is needed to save a woman's life. A 2014 study showed the rules force women to seek clandestine abortions and, as a last resort, kill their own infants.

- In the United Arab Emirates, abortion is illegal except if the pregnancy endangers the woman's life or there is evidence the baby will not survive. Women could face up to one year in prison and a hefty fine. Women who seek hospital treatment for a miscarriage may be accused of attempted abortion.
- Anti-abortion laws in the Philippines derive from its time as a colony of Spain. Abortion has been prohibited for more than a century. About 1,000 Filipino women die each year from complications. Spain is among more than 50 countries that have liberalized abortion laws over the past quarter century.

LONDON (Reuters) - WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on Friday moved a step closer to facing criminal charges in the United States for one of the biggest ever leaks of classified information after Washington won an appeal over his extradition in an English court.
U.S. authorities accuse Australian-born Assange, 50, of 18 counts relating to WikiLeaks’ release of vast troves of confidential U.S. military records and diplomatic cables which they said had put lives in danger.
Assange's supporters cast him as an anti-establishment hero who has been persecuted by the United States for exposing U.S. wrongdoing and double-dealing across the world from Afghanistan and Iraq to Washington. 
At the Royal Courts of Justice in London, the United States won an appeal against a ruling by a London District Judge that Assange should not be extradited because he was likely to commit suicide in a U.S. prison.
Judge Timothy Holroyde said he was satisfied with a package of assurances given by the United States about the conditions of Assange's detention, including a pledge not to hold him in a so-called ""ADX"" maximum security prison in Colorado and that he could be transferred to Australia to serve his sentence if convicted.
Further hurdles remain before Assange could be sent to the United States after an odyssey which has taken him from teenage hacker in Melbourne to years holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London and then incarcerated in a maximum-security prison. 
The legal wrangling will go to the Supreme Court, the United Kingdom's final court of appeal.
""It is highly disturbing that a U.K. court has overturned a decision not to extradite Julian Assange, accepting vague assurances by the United States government,"" Assange's lawyer, Barry Pollack, said. ""Mr. Assange will seek review of this decision by the U.K. Supreme Court.""
Supporters of Assange gathered outside of the court after the ruling, chanting ""free Julian Assange"" and “no extradition”. They tied hundreds of yellow ribbons to the court’s gates and held up placards saying ""journalism is not a crime"".
Judge Holroyde said the case must now be remitted to Westminster Magistrates’ Court with the direction judges send it to Home Secretary Priti Patel to decide whether or not Assange should be extradited.
HELICOPTER ATTACK 
Assange, who denies any wrongdoing, started out as a teenage hacker with the nickname Mendax - a classical Latin word for “liar” - but a few decades later would expose some of the United States's darkest secrets. 
WikiLeaks came to prominence when it published a U.S. military video in 2010 showing a 2007 attack by Apache (NASDAQ:APA) helicopters in Baghdad that killed a dozen people, including two Reuters news staff. 
It then released thousands of secret classified files and diplomatic cables that laid bare often highly critical U.S. appraisals of world leaders from Russian President Vladimir Putin to members of the Saudi royal family.
Assange jumped bail and was offered refuge in 2012 by Ecuador’s then-president Rafael Correa. He spent seven years holed up at the embassy in London while British police spent millions of dollars watching for any sign that he would emerge.
After relations with Ecuador soured, Assange, with white hair and a long beard, was dragged out by British police. 
The U.S. Justice Department said Assange was charged with conspiring with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to gain access to a government computer as part of a 2010 leak by WikiLeaks of hundreds of thousands of U.S. military reports about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and American diplomatic communications. 
U.S. prosecutors and Western security officials regard Assange as a reckless and dangerous enemy of the state whose actions imperilled the lives of sources named in the leaked material.

His admirers have hailed Assange as a hero for exposing what they describe as abuse of power by modern states and for championing free speech. 
""This is a travesty of justice,"" said Amnesty International’s Europe Director Nils Muižnieks, who said the U.S. indictment posed ""a grave threat to press freedom both in the United States and abroad"".

OSLO (Reuters) -People in positions of power in Russia are actively promoting the idea of war, and conflict with Ukraine is now distinctly possible, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dmitry Muratov said on Friday.
Receiving his award at Oslo City Hall, Muratov said it was common in Russia to think that politicians who avoided bloodshed were weak, while threatening war was ""the duty of true patriots"".
Muratov, editor-in-chief of Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, won the 2021 award jointly with Maria Ressa of the Philippines, co-founder of news site Rappler, in recognition of their fight for freedom of expression.
""The powerful actively promote the idea of war,"" he said. ""Moreover, in (the) heads of some crazy geopoliticians, a war between Russia and Ukraine is not something impossible any longer.""
U.S. officials have said Russia could soon invade Ukraine following a build-up of troops near the Ukrainian border. Moscow has denied it is planning an invasion.
Muratov also said journalism in Russia was going ""through a dark valley"", with over a hundred journalists, media outlets, human rights defenders and non-governmental organisations having been branded as foreign agents.
""In Russia, this means 'enemies of the people',"" Muratov said, dedicating his prize to all investigative journalists, and to colleagues at Novaya Gazeta killed because of their work.
Muratov's co-laureate Ressa reiterated her call for reform of social media platforms. 
""Our greatest need today is to transform that hate and violence, the toxic sludge that's coursing through our information ecosystem, prioritised by American internet companies that make more money by spreading that hate and triggering the worst in us,"" she said.
""For the US, reform or revoke section 230, the law that treats social media platforms like utilities.""
Ressa and Muratov are the first journalists to receive the Nobel prize since Germany's Carl von Ossietzky won the 1935 award for revealing the Nazis' secret rearmament programme.
Ressa noted in her speech that Von Ossietzky was never able to collect his award as he was held in a concentration camp and died in custody.

""By giving this to journalists today, the Nobel committee is signalling a similar historical moment, another existential point for democracy,"" she said.

PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron and Germany's new Chancellor Olaf Scholz played down differences on Friday over reform of EU budget rules and the place of nuclear in green investment financing, pledging to keep the Franco-German axis strong.
The trip to meet Macron in Paris was Scholz's first foreign visit since he became German leader on Wednesday, ending 16 years of rule by Angela Merkel. Diplomats say the change presents Macron with an opportunity to seize a more senior role in the Franco-German relationship. 
""During the last four years I have worked with Angela Merkel on all these subjects ... I know that we will continue together, dear Olaf, this close collaboration,"" Macron told Scholz at a joint news conference.
The more reserved Scholz, whose three-party coalition has pledged to further strengthen European integration, said they had talked about how to work together to make Europe stronger.
Arriving at the Elysee palace, the new chancellor was greeted with a fistbump by Macron, who then accompanied him up the steps, patting him on the back. 
The French president had developed a friendly relationship with Merkel, who broke with German tradition by backing unprecedented joint European Union efforts to raise debt during the COVID-19 pandemic.
But the two remained at odds over some key issues, including Germany's gas imports from Russia, defence, and relationships with big political and economic competitors including China.
The size of Germany's economy, the biggest in the 27-nation EU, gives any German chancellor outsized influence. 
But Macron, who said Merkel had ""taught much"" to the ""impetuous president"" he was at the start, will try to use France's six-month presidency of the EU, which starts on Jan. 1, to advance his priorities while Scholz is finding his feet.
With fiscal discipline often a point of dispute between Paris and Berlin, and Macron seeking Germany's support for his plans to overhaul EU budget rules, Scholz - formerly Merkel's finance minister - was cautious on Friday.
""AMBITIOUS""
""I am confident that we can solve the problems ahead of us together and that we can continue to enable the growth that we fostered with the recovery fund - and that at the same time we can ensure solid finances,"" he said, referring to the 750 billion euros the EU will use to support the pandemic recovery.
""It is possible to achieve both at the same time - they are not opposites. We have promised to use the flexibility that the (EU's) Stability and Growth Pact offers.""
While the two leaders were united in offering verbal support to Ukraine over Russia's troop build-up, other point of divergence emerged, including on nuclear energy. 
Macron wants to build new nuclear reactors in France, while Germany's plans to phase them out are well established. The new German coalition agreement makes no mention of the issue, however, which Paris believes leaves room for compromise. 
Asked on Friday about differences between Germany and France over whether nuclear power should be labelled sustainable, which France wants, Scholz skirted the question. 
""It is very clear that each country pursues its own strategy to fight man-made climate change. What unites us is that we recognise that responsibility and are ambitious,"" he said.

""Germany has decided that it will bank on an expansion of renewable energy.""
French diplomats appear optimistic about the outlook for ties with Germany under Scholz, citing ""strategic sovereignty"" in the coalition deal that took him to power, which they say echoes Macron's push for European ""strategic autonomy"".

NAIROBI (Reuters) -Veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga launched his fifth bid for Kenya's presidency on Friday, this time with the support of his former foe President Uhuru Kenyatta.
Voters are due to go to the polls next August but Kenyatta will not be on the ballot due to a constitutional term limit of two, five-year terms.
Odinga praised Kenyatta for initiating the dialogue that united them four years ago after a bitter dispute following the 2017 vote.
""It takes a seasoned statesman to shake the hand of his rival,"" he told tens of thousands of supporters gathered at Nairobi's main sports stadium.
Dressed in the orange and blue colors of Odinga's Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party, the supporters sang and danced at the rally. Some waved party and national flags.
In Odinga's last three runs for office in 2007, 2013, he led his supporters to protest at the outcomes or challenge them in court, saying his victories were stolen. Deadly clashes followed the 2007 and 2017 votes.
But he made peace with Kenyatta in early 2018, effectively sidelining Kenyatta's deputy William Ruto, who has been vocal about his own presidential ambitions.
Several ministers and other senior officials attended the campaign launch. The vice chair of Kenyatta's Jubilee party also addressed the crowd, underscoring the president's support.
Odinga outlined a plan for improving socioeconomic welfare and said he would fight poverty.
Ruto, who quit Jubilee and is running on a new party called United Democratic Alliance (UDA), belongs to a different ethnic group in the Rift Valley.
Odinga and Ruto have already been battling it out on the campaign trail, especially in central Kenya, where Kenyatta's ethnic Kikuyu votes are up for grabs.
Ruto fought alongside Odinga in 2007, when police crackdowns on protesters and clashes that turned into ethnic attacks killed more than 1,000 people in post-election violence, eventually prompting a new constitution to devolve power. Ruto teamed up with Kenyatta in 2013. 
Odinga has secured the support of many of the central region's business tycoons and ministers. Ruto has the backing of most of the region's elected representatives.
Odinga has been touting his long experience in national leadership, including a stint as prime minister. He has also promised to stamp out widespread graft, give a monthly stipend of 6,000 shillings ($53) to the unemployed, and unite Kenya's ethnic groups. 

Ruto has also pledged to focus on the poor if elected.

ATLANTA (Reuters) - Death threats from angry Trump supporters forced Georgia election worker Ruby Freeman, a 62-year-old grandmother, to flee her home of 20 years. Some messages called for her hanging; one urged people to “hunt” her. Freeman showed hundreds of menacing messages to police and called 911 three times.
But a year after Donald Trump and his allies falsely accused Freeman - along with her daughter and co-worker Wandrea “Shaye” Moss - of election fraud, the threats have not been investigated by local police or state authorities, according to a Reuters review of Georgia law enforcement records. Federal agents have monitored some of the threats, but made no arrests.
Offering the first detailed account of their ordeal, the two women told Reuters about threats of lynching and racial slurs, along with alarming visits by strangers to the homes of Freeman and her mother. The intimidation began last December, a month after the 2020 election, when the Trump campaign released surveillance video they falsely claimed showed the two women, who are Black, opening “suitcases” full of phony ballots to rig the vote count in predominantly Black Fulton County, which includes part of Atlanta.
With no one arrested for threatening them, and no police security detail, the women said their lives were thrown into chaos. Freeman told Reuters she moved from house to house out of fear for her safety. Moss, 37, avoided leaving her home except for work and said she remains wracked with anxiety and depression. Moss’s teenage son - also targeted by threats and racist messages - started failing in school.
Their alarm peaked in January, Freeman said, when a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent told her a suspected Jan. 6 Capitol rioter had been arrested and found in possession of a list of names of people to be executed. Freeman and her daughter were on it, she said. The FBI declined to comment on the incident. 
Freeman showed hundreds of threatening emails and text messages to police in Cobb County, where she lives, according to police reports reviewed by Reuters. She visited the Fulton County police station on Dec. 4, 2020, and told officers about the threats. While she was there, her phone buzzed nonstop with menacing calls, and an unidentified officer answered more than 20 of them, according to Freeman. In response to Freeman’s at-times panicked emergency calls to 911, Cobb County officers went to her home, according to a Reuters review of the call recordings. But police officials did not open investigations into the threats she faced, according to police records.
Among the uninvited visitors to Freeman’s home was a prominent Black supporter of Trump, Trevian Kutti, who said she came to offer help. A publicist for hip-hop artist and Trump supporter Kanye West, Kutti warned Freeman that she’d be arrested soon on voting fraud charges and sought to pressure her into confessing in exchange for help, Freeman said. (West has since changed his name to “Ye.”) 
Freeman said she ended the conversation. The episode made her wonder who she could trust. She concluded: “Nobody.”
Parts of Freeman’s account of the meeting are corroborated by police recordings reviewed by Reuters. Kutti did not respond to requests for comment. 
The family’s ordeal is an extreme example of a much broader paralysis in U.S. law enforcement as election workers faced an unprecedented wave of terroristic threats https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-election-threats this year. In addition to the several hundred threats described by Moss and Freeman, Reuters has documented more than 850 threats and harassing messages to election administrators, including about 100 that legal experts say could be prosecuted under federal law. Almost no one has been held accountable. https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-election-threats-law-enforcement
“There has to be charges brought against those threatening and encouraging the threatening of election workers,” said Matt Masterson, a Republican who ran election security at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security between 2018 to 2020. “I don't see a way out of this without real accountability being brought to bear.”
A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to requests for comment.
Reuters reported https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-election-threats-georgia on the mother and daughter’s experience last week through public records and interviews with their associates. The next day, the two women filed a defamation lawsuit https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/two-georgia-election-workers-sue-far-right-website-over-false-fraud-allegations-2021-12-02 against The Gateway Pundit, a far-right news site that published a series of false stories https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-election-threats-gatewaypundit accusing them of election fraud. The Gateway Pundit declined to comment.
For this story, the two women agreed to be interviewed on the condition that the reporters not take photos, publish audio recordings of the meeting or disclose where it took place. Both Moss and Freeman have changed their appearances since their photographs were widely circulated after the election; Reuters agreed not to describe how they look now.
After the threats started last December, the women grew desperate for help. Freeman said she spoke with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI). The bureau’s response was to show her how to make her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page private, she said. The GBI told Reuters that Georgia law only allows the bureau to investigate if asked by police or another governing official, which it said none did in the case of Freeman and Moss.
Freeman also spoke with the FBI. On Jan. 5, an agent recommended she leave her home for her own safety, she said. The FBI also advised her to change her phone number. The FBI had been monitoring threats to election workers and contacted Freeman after discovering messages targeting her, a former federal official told Reuters.
At the time, far-right users on Parler, a social media platform, were calling for her execution. “She will go missing very soon,” one post said. Another said she would be “suicided with 2 bullets to the back of the head.” One urged fellow Trump supporters to “hunt her down.” Yet another said: “Time for Ruby to die for what she believed in.”
Parler did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.
Making violent threats is a felony crime in Georgia when done with the “purpose of terrorizing another.” Federal law criminalizes threats explicit enough to put a reasonable person in fear of bodily harm or death.
Police in Cobb County did not respond to requests for comment on why the force did not investigate the hundreds of threats reported by Freeman. Fulton County police said it did not investigate because the two women did not make an official incident report to police. In addition to Freeman telling Fulton County police about the threats, her supervisor at the elections office asked the department for a security detail for the two women. County government officials denied the request, saying the threats against them did not rise to the level of crimes.
Law enforcement has been more aggressive in pursuing people who threatened high-profile politicians. Police have arrested at least 12 people, almost all of them Trump supporters, who have threatened members of the U.S. Congress since the 2020 election. Last month, a New York man was arrested just days after allegedly making a death threat against Congressman Andrew Garbarino, a New York Republican who voted for an infrastructure bill that has been a priority of Democratic President Joe Biden.
Threats against election workers should be taken just as seriously, said Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, who told Reuters she is pressuring the U.S Department of Justice (DOJ) to act. “This is an escalating problem,” said Klobuchar. “Law enforcement has to start looking at these cases for what they are, which is a very threat to our democracy.”
The DOJ said it “is fully committed to ensuring that all reported incidents of threats of violence to election workers and officials are carefully assessed for threat mitigation. That includes victim outreach and FBI intervention, and when a matter does rise to the level of a criminal threat, vigorously investigating the matter with all our criminal tools and aggressively prosecuting the matter where appropriate.”
While the people threatening Freeman and Moss got little scrutiny, the election workers were investigated over Trump’s false fraud allegations against them. Freeman said she met with investigators from the FBI, the GBI, and officials from the Georgia secretary of state’s office to answer questions about her work on Election Day. “They were trying to figure out if we actually did steal ballots,” she said.
On Dec. 4, a day after Trump’s allies publicly accused the women of fraud, then-Attorney General Bill Barr asked Byung J. ""BJay"" Pak, the U.S. attorney in Atlanta at the time, to look into the allegations, according to two former federal officials with direct knowledge of the matter. It wasn’t because Barr suspected the women committed fraud, they said. State officials had already debunked Trump’s claims. Rather, Barr wanted to be fully apprised so he could respond to Trump’s inquiries, they added.
After that previously unreported discussion, FBI agents spoke with Freeman and examined the surveillance video and other evidence, concluding there was no fraud, the officials said. By the time Barr stepped down on Dec. 23, he was confident there was no wrongdoing, the former officials said. But Trump kept up pressure on the DOJ, one of the sources said. Trump also continued to accuse Moss and Freeman of fraud.
The FBI would not confirm or deny whether it is investigating threats against the mother and daughter. Nationwide, just one person has been arrested and charged with a federal crime involving threats to election officials related to the 2020 presidential contest, a woman accused last December of threatening an election official in Michigan. That case is ongoing; the accused has pleaded not guilty.
In a statement, the FBI said it works with other agencies “to identify and stop any potential threats to public safety” and “investigate any and all federal violations to the fullest."" After Reuters reported the ongoing harassment of election officials and their families in June, the DOJ announced a task force that month to investigate threats to election workers. 
A department spokesperson said the task force has “criminal investigations open across the country.” The task force has yet to announce any arrests.
COLLATERAL DAMAGE
Moss recalled the first time she saw the onslaught of threats, in early December 2020. Shocked at the often violent and racist messages, she said she was “just stuck and standing there for a while.”
“And the first thing I thought about was my son,” Moss said.
The 14-year-old high school freshman was using her old cell phone, with a number she had since college. He needed the device to connect to the Internet for virtual learning during the coronavirus pandemic, the only way he could get online. Moss earned a modest $36,000 annually. She said she couldn’t afford WiFi.
As threats inundated her son’s phone, he couldn’t concentrate. His grades slipped. Strangers battered him with threatening and racist voicemails and texts. 
One, she said, told him: “Be glad it’s 2020 and not 1920. You would be hanging along with your mother.”
One threat shook her deeply. It said she had a “cute little boy,” which she took as a veiled threat to his life.
Her only child was reluctant to tell her about the threats he received. “He’s always tried to be my protector,” said the single mother.
Instead, he started shutting down the phone to stop receiving the threats, cutting off his only avenue to virtual learning. Moss didn’t discover what he had been doing until May. By then he had failed all of his classes, she said, and had to attend summer school. When he returned for the next school year, the talented football player couldn’t join the team. He had to focus on his grades.
Before she became a target of Trump’s supporters, Moss said she enjoyed being the outgoing face of the Fulton County elections office, getting filmed for training videos and answering calls from voters. She tucked her business card into the envelope of every voter registration application she mailed out. When voters called for help, she enjoyed talking to them.
Today, when her office phone rings, she’s afraid to answer and tries to avoid giving her name. She rarely leaves her cubicle. Aside from commuting, she avoids going out in public. She says she’s lost the energy to cook, clean or walk the dog. 
Her son helps out. When she’s overwhelmed by stress, he brings her medicine and water. 
“I can’t enjoy anything,” she said in a soft voice. “I just really have lost myself.”
A WARNING FROM THE FBI
Like her daughter, Freeman was targeted with hundreds of threats and racial slurs immediately after Trump’s team publicly accused her of fraud on Dec. 3, 2020.
Over the next month, strangers showed up at Freeman's home, sometimes banging on her door, according to Freeman and police reports reviewed by Reuters.
When Kutti - the Kanye West publicist and Trump supporter - paid her a visit, a wary Freeman called police and arranged to meet and talk with Kutti at the Cobb County police station. Kutti told an officer that Freeman “was in danger” and had “48 hours” to speak with her before “unknown subjects” turned up at her home, according to a police report.
The next day, Jan. 5, an FBI agent called Freeman and urged her to leave her longtime home because it wasn’t safe, Freeman said.
“What do you mean, leave?” she recalls telling the agent. She says she made quick arrangements to stay at a friend’s place.
The following day, on Jan. 6 - the day of the U.S. Capitol riots - Kutti’s prediction that people would descend on Freeman’s home in 48 hours proved correct. Freeman fled hours before a mob of angry Trump supporters surrounded her home, shouting through bullhorns, according to the lawsuit Freeman and Moss filed last week against the Gateway Pundit. Reuters was unable to independently corroborate that incident.
Freeman left her friend’s home two weeks later, after finding out about the arrested Capitol rioter who had Freeman and her daughter’s names on a list. Her hosts grew worried for their own safety, she said, so she packed up and got in her car the next morning. She stayed in three different locations over the next six weeks, she said.
By March, she returned home. She altered her appearance. But her life had been upended, she said.
Some friends no longer spoke with her, out of fear, she said. Her 12-year-old clothing and accessories business, LaRuby's Unique Treasures, has lost most of its customers, she said. Freeman traveled around to sell her goods at events, often at churches or sororities, Moss said. Regular clients didn’t know how to contact her after she changed her phone number at the recommendation of the FBI, and shuttered her social media accounts.

She now feels safer, she said. Eleven cameras and three motion sensors have been installed around her home. But the experience - life on the run, her daughter’s fears, her grandson’s school struggles - has taken a toll on her family. 
“All because of this?” she said, referring to Trump’s false claims of mysterious suitcases stuffed with ballots. “That's not right.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ghislaine Maxwell's criminal trial in Manhattan federal court was scheduled to resume on Friday, after proceedings were adjourned on Thursday because one lawyer in the case fell ill. 
The adjournment followed emotional testimony earlier in the week from two women who said they were teenagers when Maxwell set them up for abuse by the late financier Jeffrey Epstein.
Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and other crimes for allegedly recruiting and grooming girls for Epstein.
Here are five key moments from this week's testimony: 
- Kate, 44, recalled being 17 when she met Maxwell, who struck her as ""everything that I wanted to be."" She said Maxwell encouraged her to give Epstein massages, which Kate said escalated into sexual activity. After one encounter, Kate said Maxwell told her she was a ""good girl."" 
""I always felt like she was talking like she was younger than me, which was odd,"" Kate said.
Kate added that Maxwell told her Epstein needed to have sex three times a day. ""Everything was fun and everything was silly."" 
- Without the jury present, Maxwell lawyer Laura Menninger said prosecutors had told her that Jane - a woman who testified last week that Maxwell groomed her for abuse - called her brother and told him about what she said.
Menninger, who had cross-examined Jane, said Jane had told her brother that Menninger was ""an expletive that rhymes with front."" Maxwell's lawyers have aggressively questioned the credibility of their client's accusers.
Prosecutors scrapped their plan to call Jane's brother to the witness stand.
- Prosecutors showed jurors more than a dozen photographs to illustrate the intimacy of the relationship between Maxwell and Epstein in the 1990s. Two of them showed Maxwell rubbing Epstein's bare foot while it pressed against her chest.
- Carolyn, now in her mid-30s, testified that Maxwell fondled her in 2002 and said she had ""a good body for Mr. Epstein and his friends."" Carolyn said she told Maxwell about her troubled childhood, including being molested by her grandfather when she was 4, and disclosed to Maxwell that she was 14. 

""Money will not ever fix what that woman has done to me,"" Carolyn said, sobbing. 
- Shawn, a man who dated Carolyn when they were teenagers in Florida, testified that he drove Carolyn and other girls to Epstein's house to give Epstein massages. He said she would be paid in $100 bills for the massages.

72,"<span>Dec 10, 2021 05:20AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING/LONDON (Reuters) - An unofficial tribunal of lawyers and campaigners said Chinese President Xi Jinping bore primary responsibility for what it said was genocide, crimes against humanity and torture of Uyghurs and members of other minorities in the Xinjiang region.
China dismissed the tribunal, which is headed by British lawyer Geoffrey Nice and has no powers of sanction or enforcement, as a ""farce"" being used by its enemies to spread lies.
""The People's Republic of China (PRC) has committed genocide, crimes against humanity and torture against Uyghur, Kazakh and other ethnic minority citizens in the north west region of China known as Xinjiang,"" the British-based Uyghur Tribunal said on Thursday.
""The Tribunal is satisfied that President Xi Jinping ... and other very senior officials in the PRC and CCP (Chinese Communist Party) bear primary responsibility for acts that have occurred in Xinjiang.""
The World Uyghur Congress (WUC), which represents the interests of the mostly Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang and around the world, asked Nice in 2020 to set up an independent tribunal to investigate accusations of abuse in Xinjiang.
Some foreign lawmakers and parliaments, as well as the U.S. secretaries of state in both the Biden and Trump administrations, have labelled the treatment of Uyghurs as genocide.
But China vehemently denies that. 
In a statement on Thursday, its foreign ministry dismissed the WUC as a separatist organization under the control and funding of anti-China forces in the United States and the West.
""This so-called court has no legal credentials nor any credibility,"" a ministry spokesperson said, describing the testimony given as false and the final judgment as a ""political farce performed by a few clowns"".
""Lies cannot conceal the truth, cannot deceive the international community nor stop the historic course of ... Xinjiang's stability, development and prosperity,"" the ministry spokesperson said of the Uyghur tribunal.
U.N. experts and rights groups estimate more than a million people, mainly Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minorities, have been detained in recent years in a vast system of camps in Xinjiang.
China initially denied the camps existed but later said they were vocational centres and designed to combat extremism. In late 2019, China said all people in the camps had ""graduated"".
The Munich-based WUC welcomed the tribunal's judgment.
The Chinese embassy in London said the tribunal was a tool of China's enemies who were spreading lies.

It is ""nothing but a political tool used by a few anti-China and separatist elements to deceive and mislead the public,"" an embassy spokesman said.
""Anyone with conscience and reason will not be deceived or fooled,"" the spokesman said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Ghislaine Maxwell's criminal trial was adjourned for the day on Thursday morning after one of the lawyers took ill, with jurors expected to hear soon from a fourth woman accusing the British socialite of setting her up for sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein.
U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan said she had no reason to believe the illness was related to COVID-19. Maxwell's trial had been in its ninth day. 
A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office said the trial was scheduled to resume on Friday, but that an update would follow.
The delay came after a FedEx (NYSE:FDX) employee testified about invoices issued in 2002 associated with an Epstein account for packages that were sent to a woman who testified under the name Carolyn who said Epstein abused her frequently starting when she was 14.
Carolyn, whose assertions underpin the sex trafficking charges against Maxwell, told jurors on Tuesday that she received a FedEx package from Epstein containing lingerie.
The indictment said Maxwell and other Epstein employees also gave her gifts.
Carolyn said Epstein's abuse came after she had been introduced to him by Virginia Giuffre, who asked if she ""wanted to go make money.""
Giuffre is one of Epstein's and Maxwell's most prominent accusers. She is not among the four alleged victims in Maxwell's indictment, and is not expected to testify.
Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and other crimes for allegedly recruiting and grooming girls for Epstein.
She could face up to 70 years in prison if convicted on six counts at her trial plus additional time if convicted on two perjury counts that will be tried later.
Prosecutors are nearing the end of presenting their case. They had been expected to rest by the end of this week. 
Lawyers for Maxwell will then have an opportunity to mount a defense. Maxwell is not required to testify, and would likely face days of intense questioning from prosecutors if she did.
Carolyn and two other alleged victims have given jurors emotional, often explicit descriptions of how Maxwell encouraged them to give Epstein massages that escalated into sexual encounters.
According to the indictment, Maxwell gave the fourth victim, identified as Minor Victim-2, an unsolicited massage while the woman was topless, and encouraged her to massage Epstein.
Lawyers for Maxwell have argued that she is being scapegoated for Epstein's alleged conduct.
Epstein killed himself in August 2019 at age 66 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges.

Nathan ruled on Wednesday that any sexual contact Minor Victim-2 had with Epstein at the time was not illegal, citing New Mexico law at the time.
The judge previously issued a similar ruling about another alleged victim, Kate, who testified that she was 17 when she was first abused by Epstein. Nathan said Kate was old enough to consent to her alleged sexual encounters.

TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico (Reuters) -Fifty-four mostly Central Americans were killed on Thursday when the truck they were in flipped over in southern Mexico, in one of the worst accidents involving migrants who risk their lives to reach the United States.
The trailer broke open, spilling out people, when the truck crashed on a sharp curve outside the city of Tuxtla Gutierrez in the state of Chiapas, according to video footage of the aftermath and civil protection authorities.
Chiapas Governor Rutilio Escandon said 49 people died at the scene, and five more while receiving medical attention.
""It took a bend, and because of the weight of us people inside, we all went with it,"" said a shocked-looking Guatemalan man sitting at the scene in footage broadcast on social media.
""The trailer couldn't handle the weight of people.""
More than 100 people were inside the trailer, authorities said. Several dozen were injured and taken to hospitals in Chiapas, which borders Guatemala. Dozens of Guatemalan migrants were named in lists of the injured published on social media.
A Reuters witness heard cries and sobs among survivors as emergency personnel rushed to the site of where the overturned truck shuddered to a halt by a highway footbridge.
Reuters images showed a white trailer on its side, with injured people splayed out on tarps on the ground. There were also rows of what appeared to be bodies wrapped in white cloth.
A video of the scene streamed on social media showed a woman holding a child wailing in her lap, both covered in blood. Another video showed a man curled up in pain inside the destroyed trailer, hardly moving as helpers pulled out bodies.
Men, women and children were among the dead, the Chiapas state government said, and President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) expressed his sorrow at the ""very painful"" incident.
'NOT THE  BEST  (NYSE:BEST) WAY'
Migrants fleeing poverty and violence in Central America typically trek through Mexico to reach the U.S. border, and sometimes cram into large trucks organized by smugglers in extremely dangerous conditions.
""This shows us that irregular migration is not the best way,"" Kevin Lopez, a spokesman for Guatemala's presidency, told Milenio television after the accident.
He did not know how many Guatemalan victims there were. 
El Salvador's foreign minister, Alexandra Hill, said her government was working to see if Salvadorans had died.
Mexico offered lodging and humanitarian visas to the survivors, and Chiapas Governor Escandon said those responsible for the accident would be held to account.
Officials in Mexico routinely come across migrants packed into trailers, including 600 people https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/migrants-12-countries-among-600-found-two-trucks-mexico-2021-11-20 found hidden in the back of two trucks in eastern Mexico last month.
The journey north from Mexico's border with Guatemala is perilous and expensive, and many migrants fall prey to criminal gangs en route. In January, 19 people, mostly migrants, were massacred with suspected police involvement in northern Mexico.
Record numbers of people have been arrested on the U.S.-Mexico border this year as migrants seek to capitalize on President Joe Biden's pledge to pursue more humane immigration policies than his hardline predecessor, Donald Trump.
Mexican authorities in Chiapas have attempted to persuade migrants to not form caravans to walk thousands of miles to the U.S. border, and have begun transporting people from the southern city of Tapachula to other regions of the country.
The Biden administration has also urged migrants not to leave their homelands for the United States, and this week saw the restart of a policy initiated under Trump https://www.reuters.com/world/us/first-migrants-sent-mexico-us-under-reboot-trump-era-scheme-2021-12-08 to send asylum seekers back to Mexico to await their court hearings.

Some critics argue that tougher policies push migrants into the hands of the human smugglers, putting their lives at risk.
""(Authorities) generate smuggled migration that generates billions of dollars in profits,"" said migrant activist Ruben Figueroa.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -Actor Jussie Smollett, one-time star of the TV drama ""Empire,"" was found guilty on Thursday of staging a hate crime against himself in what prosecutors said was a bid to gain sympathy and boost his career.
Prosecutors said Smollett, who is Black and gay, lied to police when he told them that he was accosted on a dark Chicago street by two masked strangers in January 2019.
The actor faces a maximum sentence of three years in prison for each count when he is sentenced, although he could be given probation.
The Cook County Circuit Court jury, which deliberated for nine hours, found Smollett, 39, guilty of five of the six felony disorderly conduct counts he faced, one for each time he was accused of lying to police. 
Describing Smollett's account of what happened as ""ridiculous,"" special prosecutor Dan Webb told reporters following the verdict that ""Mr. Smollett would not have lost this case as he did today unless the jury found that he lied to them.”
Smollett's lead defense attorney, Nenye Uche, said that his client was ""an innocent man"" who was confident he would see the guilty verdicts overturned on appeal.
""I don't for one second believe that justice was done today,"" Uche said outside court, adding that the defense was facing an uphill battle because ""Jussie was already tried and convicted in the media.""
Smollett left the courthouse without speaking to reporters and surrounded by an entourage.
Smollett claimed the attackers threw a noose around his neck and poured chemicals on him while yelling racist and homophobic slurs and expressions of support for former President Donald Trump.
Police arrested the actor a month later, saying that he paid two brothers $3,500 to stage the attack in an effort to raise his show-business profile. He eventually pleaded not guilty to six counts of felony disorderly conduct. 
The two brothers, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, testified that Smollett paid them to participate in a hoax and instructed them how to attack him. During the trial, the actor took the stand and disputed their accounts. 
An attorney for the Osundairo brothers, Gloria Rodriguez, told reporters after the verdict that for Smollett the verdict meant it was ""time to cut the act, time to come clean.""
Legal experts said Smollett would probably not spend significant time behind bars. 
""While it's certainly possible that he could receive a sentence involving prison time, the much more likely scenario is that he would receive probation with some amount of community service,"" former Cook County Prosecutor Eryk Wachnik told Reuters. 
Cook County Judge James Linn did not set a date for sentencing, but scheduled a presentencing hearing for Jan. 27. 
Smollett's acting career declined after the incident. He lost his role as a singer-songwriter in the final season of ""Empire,"" a Fox television hip-hop drama that ended a five-year run in 2020.
His case took an unexpected turn in spring 2019 when the Cook County state's attorney's office dropped a 16-count indictment against him in exchange for Smollett forfeiting his $10,000 bond without admitting wrongdoing.

The dismissal drew criticism from then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the city's police superintendent, who called the reversal a miscarriage of justice. 
In 2019, Webb recommended charging Smollett again and a grand jury returned an indictment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. appeals court on Thursday rejected a request by former President Donald Trump to withhold records from the House of Representatives probe of the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, saying he had provided ""no basis"" for his request.
""Former President Trump has provided no basis for this court to override President Biden's judgment,"" a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit wrote. 
President Joe Biden had previously determined that the records, which belong to the executive branch, should not be subject to executive privilege and that turning them over to Congress was in the best interest of the nation.
""Both branches agree that there is a unique legislative need for these documents and that they are directly relevant to the Committee’s inquiry into an attack on the legislative branch and its constitutional role in the peaceful transfer of power,"" the court said.
The ruling marks yet another blow to the Republican former president, who has waged an ongoing legal battle with the committee over access to documents and witnesses.
The House Select Committee investigating the riot has asked the National Archives, the U.S. agency housing Trump's White House records, to produce visitor logs, phone records and written communications between his advisers. 
The panel has said it needs the records to understand any role Trump may have played in fomenting the violence.
Trump has argued that the materials requested by the House committee were covered by the executive privilege legal doctrine that protects the confidentiality of some White House communications.
Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson, who heads the select committee, and its vice chair, Republican Liz Cheney, issued a statement applauding the court decision which they said respected the panel's interest in obtaining the records.
""We will get to the truth,"" they said.
Trump's lawyers have called the Democratic-led investigation politically motivated, and argue that the documents are protected.
This is now the second time a federal court has ruled against Trump in the matter.
U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan on Nov. 9 rejected Trump's arguments, saying he had not acknowledged the ""deference owed"" to Biden's determination that the committee could access the records. adding: ""Presidents are not kings, and Plaintiff is not President.""

The court on Thursday gave Trump 14 days to file an emergency request to the Supreme Court to appeal the ruling.
""Regardless of today’s decision by the appeals court, this case was always destined for the Supreme Court,"" Trump lawyer Liz Harrington tweeted.

BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) -China and Nicaragua re-established diplomatic ties on Friday after the Central American country broke relations with Chinese-claimed Taiwan, boosting Beijing in a part of the world long considered the United States' backyard and angering Washington.
China has increased military and political pressure on Taiwan to accept its sovereignty claims, drawing anger from the democratically ruled island, which has repeatedly said it would not be bullied and has the right to international participation.
China's Foreign Ministry, announcing the decision after meetings with Nicaragua's finance minister and two of President Daniel Ortega's sons in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin, said the country had made the ""correct choice"".
The break with Taiwan shrinks the island's dwindling pool of international allies and is a blow to the United States. 
It follows months of worsening ties between Ortega and Washington, and came on the day the U.S. State Department said it had applied sanctions on Nestor Moncada Lau, a national security adviser to Ortega, alleging he operates an import and customs fraud scheme to enrich members of Ortega's government.
The U.S. State Department said Nicaragua's decision did not reflect the will of the Nicaraguan people because its government was not freely elected.
""We do know, however, that this deprives Nicaragua's people of a steadfast partner in its democratic and economic growth,"" spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement. ""We encourage all countries that value democratic institutions, transparency, the rule of law, and promoting economic prosperity for their citizens to expand engagement with Taiwan.""
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Taiwan's allies - now only 14 countries - have stayed with Taipei only because of pressure from the United States and Taiwan's ""dollar diplomacy"", accusations Taipei denies.
Nicaragua's congress in 2019 accepted a $100 million loan from Taiwan, but Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said on Friday that money, designed for economic reconstruction, has never been paid because of ""procedural issues with allocation requirements"" by the bank, which it did not name.
China's Foreign Ministry, asked if China would give financial aid to Nicaragua, said the resumption in ties was a ""political decision, definitely not a bargaining chip"". 
'MARCH TOWARDS THE WORLD'
Taiwan's government said it was unbowed by Nicaragua's decision.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said the island would not bend to pressure or change the determination to uphold democracy and freedom and ""march towards the world"".
""The more successful Taiwan's democracy is, the stronger the international support, and the greater the pressure from the authoritarian camp,"" she said in Taipei.
A senior Taiwan official familiar with the matter told Reuters the timing was ""provocative"", coming during the Biden administration's Summit for Democracy, which Taiwan is attending, and a week before four referendums on the island, though they are on domestic issues like energy and pork imports.
At the now-defunct Nicaraguan embassy in Taipei, in a building in the leafy suburb of Tianmu, staff said the former ambassador was not in. Nicaragua's flag outside had been removed by the time a Reuters reporter arrived mid-morning.
Ortega first cut ties with Taiwan in 1985, but they were re-established with the island in 1990 under then-Nicaraguan President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.
One Taiwan-based diplomatic source, familiar with the region, said the move was not a surprise given Washington's lack of leverage with Ortega due to the sanctions, and that looking to China for aid and support was a natural course of action.
""It appears that Ortega had had enough,"" the source told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Attention will now turn to another Taiwan friend, Honduras.

Aides for the incoming president Xiomara Castro have said she would not establish ties with China, backtracking from Castro's earlier comments that she was open to starting formal relations with Beijing.
A second Taiwan-based diplomatic source told Reuters it was still a case of ""watch this space"" whether Honduras would ultimately go with Beijing.

""Silence is the loudest shout. We want our rights back. We want revolution. We express sadness for our fallen heroes,"" she said.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Surging interest in vaping among young New Zealanders may undermine a government crackdown on the tobacco industry and its aim to get people to kick the habit, healthcare and anti-tobacco experts said on Friday.
New Zealand plans to ban young people from ever buying cigarettes in their lifetime in one of the world's toughest crackdowns on the tobacco industry, arguing that other efforts to stamp out smoking were taking too long.
The new regulations, however, do not cover vaping, which it said was much less harmful than smoking and can help some people to quit smoking.
""It's fantastic having a generation that is smoke free but there is some concern around the messaging of using vaping to quit smoking, and that vaping is less harmful or without harm,"" said Letitia Harding, chief executive of the Asthma and Respiratory Foundation (ARFNZ), which campaigns on behalf of people with asthma and other respiratory conditions.
Vaping involves heating a liquid that contains nicotine in what is called an e-cigarette and turning it into a vapour that users inhale. Its long-term health impacts are largely unknown.
A nationwide survey of 19,000 secondary school students last month showed that more than quarter regularly vaped, while about 15% reported smoking regular, combustible cigarettes.
The findings showed a marked increase in vaping over the past two years ago.
The survey by ARFNZ and the Secondary Principals’ Association of NZ, an independent organisation representing head teachers, found young people are picking up high nicotine vapes without ever having smoked a cigarette, and quickly becoming addicted to nicotine.
""We absolutely have a problem of vaping and in 15 years we'll be trying to get these youth out of vapes,"" Harding said.
New Zealand was late in regulating vaping and is still relatively liberal, allowing up to 60 milligrams of nicotine per millimetre of liquid compared with the EU which has a 20 milligram cap.
Australia said in October that people would no longer be able to buy nicotine vaping products without a prescription.
""Ultimately, tobacco is one of the deadliest substances that people can take and vapes do not have the harms associated with them, and that's why we're taking a risk-proportionate approach to these choices,” Associate Health Minister Ayesha Verrall said on Thursday while announcing the smoking ban.
VAPING DEMAND
Only some 11.6% of New Zealanders over the age of 15 smoke cigarettes but a falling smoking rate has been closely linked with a rising vaping rate, with about 600 approved vaping retailers to meet the demand.
The World Health Organization said in July that the tobacco industry's sleek marketing is attracting youngsters to e-cigarettes, which can lead to tobacco addiction.
Large Tobacco firms were quick to switch to e-cigarettes that offer different flavours and create designs targeting a new generation of users.
Marlboro cigarette maker Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) now sells IQOS, a device that heats up but does not burn packages of ground-up tobacco, to create a nicotine-filled aerosol similar to that produced by e-cigarettes. 
British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) sells e-cigarettes under the Vuse brand, while Imperial Brands (OTC:IMBBY) markets Blu e-cigarettes.

Vaping can be effective for adults who want to quit but it is being targeted at young people, said Associate Professor Collin Tukuitonga, at the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Auckland.
""It's inevitable that people pick up vaping because access to tobacco is becoming really difficult. So there needs to be a planned and considered social media campaign on dangers of vaping,"" he said.

80,"<span>Dec 10, 2021 12:31AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -New Zealand plans to ban young people from ever buying cigarettes in their lifetime in one of the world's toughest crackdowns on the tobacco industry, arguing that other efforts to extinguish smoking were taking too long.
People aged 14 and under in 2027 will never be allowed to purchase cigarettes https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/how-will-new-zealands-lifetime-ban-cigarette-sales-work-2021-12-09 in the Pacific country of 5 million, part of proposals unveiled on Thursday that will also curb the number of retailers authorised to sell tobacco and cut nicotine levels in all products.
""We want to make sure young people never start smoking so we will make it an offence to sell or supply smoked tobacco products to new cohorts of youth,"" New Zealand Associate Minister of Health Ayesha Verrall said in a statement.
""If nothing changes, it would be decades till Maori smoking rates fall below 5%, and this government is not prepared to leave people behind.""
Currently, 11.6% of all New Zealanders aged over 15 smoke, a proportion that rises to 29% among indigenous Maori adults, according to government figures.
The government will consult with a Maori health task force in the coming months before introducing legislation into parliament in June next year, with the aim of making it law by the end of 2022. 
The restrictions would then be rolled out in stages from 2024, beginning with a sharp reduction in the number of authorised sellers, followed by reduced nicotine requirements in 2025 and the creation of the ""smoke-free"" generation from 2027.
The package of measures will make New Zealand's retail tobacco industry one of the most restricted in the world, just behind Bhutan where cigarette sales are banned outright. New Zealand's neighbour Australia was the first country in the world to mandate plain packaging of cigarettes in 2012.
The New Zealand government said while existing measures like plain packaging and levies on sales had slowed tobacco consumption, the tougher steps were necessary to achieve its goal of fewer than 5% of the population smoking daily by 2025. 
The new rules would halve the country's smoking rates in as few as 10 years from when they take effect, the government said.
NEW ZEALAND TEMPLATE 
Like New Zealand, the United Kingdom has set goals to go smoke-free by 2030 while Canada and Sweden have targets to bring down smoking prevalence to less than 5% of their populations.
""All these aggressive targets are being introduced, yet, to date, we have still to see any country implement a coherent strategy likely to achieve a tobacco end-game. New Zealand might be a template for just that,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Owen Bennett said.
However, he did not expect the legislation to have a near-term impact on tobacco groups.
""It will be minimal, in our view. New Zealand is a very small market,"" he said.
Smoking kills about 5,000 people a year in New Zealand, making it one of the country's top causes of preventable death. Four in five smokers started before age 18, the country's government said.
Vaping, often seen as a safer alternative to smoking and a useful aid to quitting, is also tightly regulated with sales only allowed to over 18s. 
BLACK MARKET COULD EMERGE
Health authorities welcomed the crackdown, while retailers and tobacco companies expressed concern about the impact on their businesses and warned of the emergence of a black market.
""We welcome the New Zealand government’s recognition that excessive excise increases disproportionately impact smokers on lower incomes,"" tobacco group Imperial Brands (OTC:IMBBY) said, adding it was concerned about proposals to reduce nicotine levels and eventually prohibit sales. 
""Prohibitions of any kind tend to play into the hands of criminal traders who peddle unregulated illicit products,"" it also said. 
Marlboro maker Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), which has previously said it would stop sales in the country if required by law, said it was reviewing the legislative proposal.
According to brokerage Citi, Dunhill maker  British American Tobacco  (NYSE:BTI) (BAT (LON:BATS)) is the market leader in New Zealand, with a 67% share by volume, while Imperial Brands, which sells JPS, Riverstone and Horizon cigarettes, accounts for 21%, generating about 1%-2% of its group earnings before taxes. 
BAT did not respond to requests for comment.
The government did not detail how the new rules would be policed or whether they would apply to visitors to the country.

""Cigarette smoking kills 14 New Zealanders every day and two out of three smokers will die as a result of smoking,"" said New Zealand Medical Association chair Alistair Humphrey in a statement.
However, the Dairy and Business Owners Group, a lobby group for local convenience stores, said while it supported a smoke-free country, the government's plan would destroy many businesses.

KYIV (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden assured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that Kyiv's bid to join the NATO military alliance was in its own hands, Zelenskiy's chief of staff said after the two leaders spoke on Thursday.
Biden and Zelenskiy had a call two days after Biden held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin to try to defuse a crisis over Russian troop movements near Ukraine's borders. 
Ukraine accuses Russia of massing tens of thousands of troops in preparation for a possible large scale military offensive, raising fears that a simmering conflict in Ukraine's eastern Donbass region could erupt into open war between the neighbours.
Russia denies planning any attack but accuses Ukraine and the United States of destabilising behaviour, and has sought security guarantees against NATO's eastward expansion. 
Ukraine rejects any such guarantees as illegitimate and has sought reassurances that no deals about its future would be decided without its involvement. 
""President Biden said very clearly ... that any negotiations, any decisions that concern Ukraine, cannot be taken without Ukraine,"" Zelenskiy chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, told the 1+1 TV channel. 
""President Biden said very clearly that the decision on Ukraine's accession to NATO is the decision of the Ukrainian people only, this is a sovereign and independent Ukrainian state,"" he said. ""And it depends on Ukraine and NATO members.""
In a call which Zelenskiy said lasted 1-1/2 hours, Ukraine's president also told Biden that he had ""clear proposals to unblock the peace process"" in eastern Ukraine and was ready to discuss them in various formats. 
The White House earlier had said Biden planned to convey support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity during the call.
Zelenskiy and Biden spoke as Russia kept up a barrage of hostile rhetoric towards Ukraine, accusing Kyiv of moving heavy artillery towards the frontline of fighting in the east and failing to engage in the peace process.
Ukraine's ties with Russia collapsed in 2014 after Russia's annexation of Crimea and Moscow-backed forces seized territory in eastern Ukraine that Kyiv wants back. Kyiv says some 14,000 people have been killed in fighting since then.

Zelenskiy has welcomed Biden's ""personal role"" in trying to attain peace in eastern Ukraine. 
Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba welcomed the Putin-Biden call as a step towards deterring Moscow from launching a new attack but urged allies to draw up a tough package of measures to warn Russia off any further military escalation.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A judge in Texas ruled on Thursday that a law prohibiting abortions after about six weeks violated the state's constitution because it allows private citizens to sue abortion providers.
State District Court Judge David Peeples was ruling on a contentious Texas law that bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat has been detected, usually after about six weeks and when many women do not yet realize they are pregnant.
Abortion providers signaled that despite the ruling, they are unlikely to resume the procedure until an expected ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court. The law, which went into effect in September, effectively bans nearly all abortions in Texas, America's second most-populous state.
Texas Right to Life, an anti-abortion group that backed the law, immediately filed an appeal against Thursday's ruling.
The law was designed to avoid normal means of legal challenge, because rather than making state officials responsible for enforcement, it instead gave private individuals anywhere the right to sue doctors and others who provide abortions after six weeks in Texas.
Peeples ruled that the law unconstitutionally gave legal standing to people not injured, and was an ""unlawful delegation of enforcement power to a private person.""
The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments about the Texas law last month and is expected to issue a ruling in coming weeks.

The nation's highest court this month also heard arguments about a restrictive Republican-backed Mississippi law that is seen as a direct challenge to the court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized the procedure nationwide.
In oral arguments on Dec. 1, conservative justices, who have a 6-3 majority on the court, signaled a willingness to dramatically curtail abortion rights in the United States. A ruling on the Mississippi law is expected by the summer.

Four students were killed in the Nov. 30 shooting at Oxford High School in suburban Oakland County, some 30 miles (48 km) northwest of Detroit. The suit faulted the school district's superintendent and school principal for assuring parents of the school's safety despite knowing of disturbing social media posts and an online ammunition search by the accused shooter.
Ethan Crumbley, a 15-year-old student, is being held without bail after being charged as an adult in the deadliest U.S. school shooting of 2021.
The 44-page lawsuit was filed in federal court on behalf of Riley Franz, 17, who was shot in the neck, and her sister Bella, 14, who was next to her at the time. Their parents, Jeffrey and Brandi Franz, also are plaintiffs in the lawsuit. 
Riley Franz was among the six students and a teacher seriously injured in the gunfire.
Crumbley's parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, were charged with involuntary manslaughter and are being held in lieu of $500,000 bail. They gave him the gun as an early Christmas present and are accused of then ignoring warning signs that he was planning a shooting at the school.
The lawsuit was filed against Oxford Community School District, superintendent Timothy Throne, principal Steven Wolf, dean of students Ryan Moore, two unnamed teachers and two unnamed school counselors. 
The district did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The lawsuit describes Riley as a 12th grade honor roll student preparing to enter college and Bella as a ninth grade athlete. 
""The horror of November 30, 2021 was entirely preventable,"" said the lawsuit, filed by Michigan personal injury attorney Geoffrey Fieger. ""Each and every defendant named herein created and increased the dangers then-existing at Oxford High School. The individually named Defendants are each responsible through their actions for making the student victims less safe.""
Among the accusations in the lawsuit were several detailing Ethan Crumbley's threats of violence on social media as well as his using his cellphone to search for ammunition.
The lawsuit said that even though Throne and Wolf reviewed social media posts and were aware of the ammunition search reported by a teacher prior to the shooting, they improperly reassured all parents by email and other correspondence that their children were safe at Oxford, the lawsuit said. Similarly, students were assured there was no threat, it said.

""Plaintiff minors were safer before defendant Throne took action and advised each and every student, including plaintiff minors, that there was no credible threat,"" the suit stated.
The lawsuit lists other actions by school employees including the failure to involve the campus safety officer in a meeting with Crumbley and his parents on the day of the shooting.

(Reuters) - Former reality television personality Josh Duggar was convicted by a jury in Arkansas on Thursday on federal charges relating to downloading and viewing photos and videos depicting the sexual abuse of children, the U.S. Justice Department said.
Duggar, known for the TLC reality TV show ""19 Kids and Counting"" that focused on his parents and their 19 children, was convicted on two criminal charges. Duggar, 33, tried to hide his actions by using a password-protected partition on the hard drive of a desktop computer he kept at his used car sales lot, prosecutors said.
The show was suspended in 2015 after news broke that Duggar had molested five girls including four of his sisters. He issued a statement at the time admitting to his actions and resigned his post at a conservative advocacy group, but did not face criminal charges relating to that matter.
""Today's verdict sends a message that we will track down and prosecute people who download and view child sexual abuse material, regardless of the lengths they go to conceal their conduct,"" Kenneth Polite, assistant attorney general at the Justice Department's Criminal Division, said in a statement.
Justin Gelfand, a lawyer for Duggar, said: ""We appreciate the jury's lengthy deliberations, we respect the jury's verdict, and we intend to appeal.""
A sentencing date for Duggar has not yet been set. He could face between five and 20 years in prison for receiving child sexual abuse materials, and he could face up to 20 for possessing the materials.

Law enforcement officials first detected his activities during an undercover investigation into online file-sharing activities and later searched the premises of his used car sales lot in November 2019. He was charged in April.
The show ""19 Kids and Counting"" delved into the religious values and beliefs of his parents, including their opposition to birth control, their preference to home-school their children and their strict rules about dating, which entailed chaperoning their daughters through a courtship and banning them from kissing until marriage.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday passed a sweeping government oversight bill aimed at reining in the powers of the presidency, but the measure faces little chance of passing the narrowly-divided Senate.
The ""Protecting Our Democracy Act"" would limit the president's pardon powers and strengthen oversight of other government functions, which supporters said were intended to address weaknesses that Republican former President Donald Trump exploited during his four years in office.
Republicans dismissed the bill, which passed in a nearly party-line 220-208 vote, as an attack on Trump.
The bill would ""address many of the vulnerabilities that the last four years exposed,"" Representative Adam Schiff, a co-sponsor of the bill, said at a news conference after its passage. He said that Trump's actions, including pardons of supporters, illustrated that ""the need for stronger guardrails is greater than ever.""

Republican Rick Crawford accused Democrats of living in the past, saying, ""The clear intent of this bill is to weaponize federal bureaucracy against Republican candidates.""
The bill will now head to the Senate, where it is not expected to surpass the chamber's 60-vote threshold to move forward.

""The government of the Republic of Nicaragua today breaks diplomatic relations with Taiwan and ceases to have any contact or official relationship,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement issued in Spanish and English.
""The People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government that represents all of China and Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Chinese territory,"" it added.
Chinese state media said government representatives from China and Nicaragua would hold talks in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin on Friday.
Taiwan responded quickly, expressing ""pain and regret"" at the decision, and saying that the Central American country's president, Daniel Ortega, had disregarded the friendship between the peoples of Taiwan and Nicaragua.
But Taiwan's government also expressed defiance.
""As a member of the international community, Taiwan has the right to exchange and develop diplomatic relations with other countries,"" its foreign ministry said. 
Taiwan will continue to promote ""pragmatic diplomacy"" to expand its international space, and strive to achieve Taiwan's ""due international status"".
China says Taiwan is one of its provinces with no right to the trappings of a state, and has stepped up pressure to win away Taiwan's remaining allies, especially in Central America and the Caribbean, with El Salvador and the Dominican Republic going over to Beijing in 2018, and Panama the year before. 
China's ambassador at the United Nations, Zhang Jun, congratulated Nicaragua.
""We highly commend the right decision made by the Government of Nicaragua, which is in line with the prevailing trend of the time and people's aspiration,"" he said in a tweet. ""The One-China principle is a consensus widely accepted by the international community and allows no challenge."" 
The break with Taiwan is a blow to the United States. It follows months of worsening ties between Ortega and Washington, and came on the day the U.S. State Department said it had slapped sanctions on Nestor Moncada Lau, a national security adviser to Ortega, alleging he operates an import and customs fraud scheme to enrich members of Ortega's government.
The White House and State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Last month U.S. President Joe Biden ripped into Ortega, calling Nicaragua's presidential election a ""pantomime"" as the former Marxist guerrilla and Cold War adversary of the United States won election for a fourth consecutive term. 
One Taiwan-based diplomatic source, familiar with the region, said the move was not a surprise given Washington's lack of leverage with Ortega due to the sanctions, and that looking to China for aid and support was a natural course of action.
""It appears that Ortega had had enough,"" the source told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
Nicaragua's move leaves Taiwan with just 14 formal diplomatic allies, most of them in Latin America and the Caribbean, plus a handful of small states.

It also follows threats by the incoming leaders of Honduras to break with Taipei. However, since the Honduran election last month, the team around incoming President Xiomara Castro has rowed back from that position somewhat.
Before Nicaragua, Taiwan lost two allies in quick succession in September of 2019, when the Solomon Islands and Kiribati went over to Beijing.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China is not worried about a ""domino effect"" of diplomatic boycotts of the Beijing Winter Olympics, it said on Thursday, after Australia, Britain and Canada joined the United States in deciding not to send officials to the Games.
The United States was the first to announce a boycott, saying on Monday its government officials would not attend the Feb. 4-20 Games because of China's human rights ""atrocities"" in the western region of Xinjiang.
""I don't see any need to be worried about any domino effect,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a daily news conference when asked about the chance of more boycotts.
""On the contrary, most countries in the world have expressed support for the Beijing Winter Olympics.""
The diplomatic boycotts by the United States and its allies follow a sharp deterioration in relations between Beijing and Washington that began under former U.S. President Donald Trump.
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has maintained pressure on China over various issues including human rights and China's maritime claims in the South China Sea.
Wang pointed out that the United Nations on Dec. 2 adopted a resolution, co-sponsored by more than 170 of 193 member states, for an ""Olympic Truce"" calling on states to rise above politics and unite in sports during the Beijing Games.
""Quite a few"" foreign leaders and members of royal families had registered to attend, he said.
Russian President Vladimir Putin is the only leader of a major country who has publicly accepted an invitation.
Wang said the United States and its allies would ""pay the price for their mistaken acts"" and they had ""used the Olympics platform for political manipulation"".
China said on Tuesday it would ""resolutely take countermeasures"" against the United States for its boycott but has not specified what they would be.
Wang also that China had no plans to invite officials from Britain and Canada to the Games anyway, and that their absence would have ""no impact"" on the success of the event.
Some experts said China does care about the boycotts, given the time and effort it had devoted to criticising the moves.
""China had hoped to use this global sporting mega-event to showcase its international standing and expand its influence. The boycotts have certainly dented this hope and resulted in a loss of 'face' for China,"" said Li Mingjiang, associate professor at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.
'STOP WRONGDOING'
Australia's prime minister, Scott Morrison, said earlier that its decision not to send officials was made because of its struggles to reopen diplomatic channels with China to discuss human rights in Xinjiang and Chinese moves to block Australian imports.
China has denied any wrongdoing in Xinjiang, home to the Uyghur Muslim minority, saying allegations of human right abuses were fabricated.
On Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation to ban imports from Xinjiang over concerns about forced labour, one of three measures backed overwhelmingly as Washington pushes back against Beijing's treatment of Uyghurs.
""China firmly opposes this,"" said Gao Feng, a spokesman at the Chinese commerce ministry, referring to the U.S. action.
""The United States should immediately stop its wrongdoing. We will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard China's legitimate rights and interests,"" Gao told a regular news conference.
The United States, he said, was practising unilateralism, protectionism and bullying China in the name of ""human rights"".
Gao warned that the U.S. stand would seriously hurt the interests of companies and consumers in the two countries, aggravate global supply chain tension and weigh on the global economic recovery.
The U.S. House backed the ""Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act"" by an overwhelming 428-1 margin. To become law, it must also pass the Senate and be signed by President Biden.
New Zealand has not said it is diplomatically boycotting the Games. But, when asked if he would support a boycott, Trade Minister Damien O’Connor said it was ""something we need to do as a nation"" and the country had been ""strong and independent"" on human rights and should ""continue to do that"".
Responding to O'Connor's remarks, Wang said he hoped all countries could be more united in the Olympic spirit and keep politics out of sports.

France will not follow the lead of other Western governments and boycott the Olympics but any human rights abuses in China must be condemned, its education minister said on Thursday.
The French foreign minister also said Paris should take a common stand with other European Union countries on any diplomatic boycott.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The New York City Council on Thursday passed a measure that would enable hundreds of thousands of non-citizen immigrants who are in the country legally to vote in municipal elections.
If the bill is signed into law by Mayor Bill de Blasio, New York would become the largest U.S. city to allow non-citizens to participate in elections.
It would enable more than 800,000 permanent U.S. residents, or green-card holders, and other legally documented non-citizens to take part in elections for city leaders, including the mayor. Non-citizen residents would not be allowed to vote in state or federal elections.
“I am proud to be voting on legislation that will give the right to vote to green card holders and people who are authorized to work in the United States of America,” Council Speaker Corey Johnson said before the vote. 
“Immigrants pay taxes,"" he said. ""They use city services. Their kids go to our public schools. They are part of our community, and they deserve a say in local government.”
The measure, which passed 33-to-14, just short of a veto-proof two-thirds majority, sparked an debate that was often emotional, with many members invoking their own immigrant family histories. Some said the bill's 30-day residency requirement was too short.
The 51-member body defeated an effort by the council's three Republican members and several Democrats to send the bill back to a committee to lengthen the residency requirement.
""Thirty days is not enough for someone to decide who’s going to represent the greatest city in the world,” said Council Member Paul Vallone, a Democrat who voted with Republicans.
Some members also questioned whether the bill would pass legal muster, asserting that the state constitution bestows voting rights to ""every citizen.""
Those concerns were shared by de Blasio, who cited misgivings over ""outstanding legal questions"" about the city's authority to enact such a measure. But he suggested on Wednesday that he would still sign the legislation.
""I respect the City Council,"" de Blasio told a reporter at a briefing. ""My assumption is I'm just going to respect whatever they do.""

A report last year by the mayor's office estimated that nearly 10% of the city's 8.8 million residents were green-card holders or other immigrants with legal status.
New York would join at least 14 U.S. cities, including San Francisco, already allow non-citizens to vote in their municipal elections.

(Reuters) - A computer scientist who has claimed to be the inventor of bitcoin largely prevailed on Monday in a Florida jury trial over whether the estate of a former business partner deserved half of a bitcoin cache worth now about $54 billion.
The Miami jury cleared Craig Wright on nearly all issues in the dispute, including that half of the 1.1 million bitcoin in dispute belonged to the family of Dave Kleiman, the former partner and computer forensics expert.
While concluding that Wright was not liable for fraud, jurors did award $100 million in intellectual property rights to W&K Information Defense Research LLC, a joint venture between the men. The trial began on Nov. 1.
""This has been a remarkable good outcome and I feel completely vindicated,"" Wright said in a video message. ""There are still more fights. We are going to make everything change: cryptocurrency to digital cash the way it's meant to be.""
According to court papers, the 1.1 million bitcoin had been mined by Satoshi Nakamoto, whose October 2008 white paper ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"" described a framework for what would become bitcoin.
Wright claimed in 2016 that he was Nakamoto, which was a pseudonym. The claim has been disputed.
Kleiman's family contended that he and Wright had been friends and business partners, but that Wright stole the bitcoin stemming from their relationship.
In a statement, lawyers for W&K and Kleiman's estate said they were ""immensely gratified"" that the jury awarded the $100 million in intellectual property rights, and help give the Kleimans ""their fair share of what Dave helped create.""

Dave Kleiman died in April 2013.
The Australia-born Wright, who later moved to London, in May sued https://www.reuters.com/technology/australias-wright-launches-lawsuit-over-57-bln-bitcoin-haul-2021-05-12 16 software developers to secure around 111,000 bitcoin now worth about $5.4 billion that he claimed he owns.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden gathered over 100 world leaders at a summit on Thursday and made a plea to bolster democracies around the world, calling safeguarding rights and freedoms in the face of rising authoritarianism the ""defining challenge"" of the current era.
In the opening speech for his virtual ""Summit for Democracy,"" a first-of-its-kind gathering intended to counter democratic backsliding worldwide, Biden said global freedoms were under threat from autocrats seeking to expand power, export influence and justify repression.
""We stand at an inflection point in our history, in my view. ...Will we allow the backward slide of rights and democracy to continue unchecked? Or will we together have a vision...and courage to once more lead the march of human progress and human freedom forward?,"" he said.
The conference is a test of Biden's assertion, announced in his first foreign policy address https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-diplomacy/america-is-back-biden-touts-muscular-foreign-policy-in-first-diplomatic-speech-idUSKBN2A501J in February, that he would return the United States to global leadership to face down authoritarian forces, after the country's global standing took a beating under predecessor Donald Trump.
“Democracy doesn’t happen by accident. And we have to renew it with each generation,"" he said. ""In my view, this is the defining challenge of our time.""
Biden did not point fingers at China and Russia, authoritarian-led nations Washington has been at odds with over a host of issues, but their leaders were notably absent from the guest list. 
The number of established democracies under threat is at a record high, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance said in November https://www.reuters.com/world/democracy-slipping-away-record-rate-intergovernmental-body-warns-2021-11-22, noting coups in Myanmar, Afghanistan and Mali, and in backsliding in Hungary, Brazil and India, among others. 
U.S. officials have promised a year of action will follow the two-day gathering of 111 world leaders, but preparations have been overshadowed by questions https://www.reuters.com/world/bidens-democracy-summit-problematic-invite-list-casts-shadow-impact-2021-11-07 over some invitees' democratic credentials. 
The White House said it was working with Congress to provide $424.4 million toward a new initiative to bolster democracy around the world, including support to independent news media.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told the summit her department was cracking down on money laundering, illicit finance and tax evasion. ""After all, the United States cannot be a credible voice for free and fair government abroad if at the same time, we allow the wealthy to break our laws with impunity,"" Yellen said.
This week's event coincides with questions about the strength of American democracy. The Democratic president is struggling to pass his agenda through a polarized Congress and after Republican Trump disputed the 2020 election result, leading to an assault on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters on Jan. 6. 
Republicans are expanding control https://www.reuters.com/world/us/georgia-republicans-purge-black-democrats-county-election-boards-2021-12-09 over election administration in multiple U.S. states, raising concerns the 2020 midterm elections will be corrupted. 
The White House on Thursday issued a statement https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SAP-on-H.R.-5314-Protecting-Our-Democracy-Act.pdf of support for legislation https://www.reuters.com/world/us/post-trump-us-democrats-offer-bill-rein-presidential-powers-2021-09-21 introduced by Democratic lawmakers that would put new limits on the use of presidential pardons and strengthen measures to prevent foreign election interference, among other measures intended to safeguard U.S. democracy.
The summit also included Taiwan, prompting anger https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/biden-administration-invites-taiwan-its-summit-democracy-2021-11-24 from China, which considers the democratically governed island part of its territory.
A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said the invitation of Taiwan showed the United States was only using democracy as ""cover and a tool for it to advance its geopolitical objectives, oppress other countries, divide the world and serve its own interests."" 
The White House dismissed the criticism. ""In the context of this summit we don't see this as ... being about any one specific country. We are really emphasizing at this summit that we are seeking to build democratic momentum,"" a senior administration official told reporters.
'LIP SERVICE'
Washington has used the run-up to the summit to announce sanctions against officials in Iran, Syria and Uganda https://www.reuters.com/world/us-imposes-sanctions-people-iran-syria-uganda-citing-rights-abuses-2021-12-07 it accuses of oppressing their populations, and against people it accused of being tied to corruption and criminal gangs https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-takes-aim-organized-crime-latest-sanctions-marking-democracy-summit-2021-12-08 in Kosovo and Central America. 
Further measures against foreign officials https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-imposes-sanctions-foreign-officials-corruption-including-alleged-graft-covid-2021-12-09 for graft in their countries' COVID-19 responses, as well as other allegedly corrupt schemes, were announced as the summit began on Thursday. 
U.S. officials hope to win support during the meetings for global initiatives such as use of technology https://www.reuters.com/technology/white-house-fund-tech-evade-censorship-increase-privacy-2021-12-08 to enhance privacy or circumvent censorship and for countries to make specific public commitments to improve their democracies before an in-person summit planned for late 2022.
Some question whether the summit can force meaningful change, particularly by leaders who are accused by human rights groups of harboring authoritarian tendencies, like the Philippines, Poland and Brazil.
Annie Boyajian, director of advocacy at nonprofit Freedom House, said the event had the potential to push struggling democracies to do better and to spur coordination between democratic governments.
""But, a full assessment won’t be possible until we know what commitments there are and how they are implemented in the year ahead,"" Boyajian said.

The State Department's top official for civilian security, democracy and human rights, Uzra Zeya said civil society would help hold the countries, including the United States, accountable. Zeya declined to say whether Washington would disinvite leaders who do not fulfill their pledges.
Human Rights Watch's Washington director Sarah Holewinski said making the invitation to the 2022 summit dependent on delivering on commitments was the only way to get nations to step up.

(Reuters) -A prosecutor said on Wednesday a white former Minnesota police officer on trial for killing Black motorist Daunte Wright flouted years of training by mistakenly using her pistol instead of her Taser, while the defense sought to blame the slain man for resisting arrest in a routine traffic stop.
The dueling narratives were presented to jurors during opening statements in the trial of Kimberly Potter, a 26-year veteran of the police force in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center who is charged with manslaughter in the April death of Wright, 20.
""This case is about the defendant Kimberly Potter betraying her badge and betraying her oath and betraying her position of public trust,"" Assistant Minnesota Attorney General Erin Eldridge told the jury. ""Their duty to their badge and to the community is to protect life, not to take life."" 
Potter, 49, has pleaded not guilty to first- and second-degree manslaughter charges, which carry maximum sentences of 15 and 10 years respectively. Her lawyers have said Potter thought she was using her Taser when she shot Wright in the chest with her Glock handgun as he tried to flee the scene in his car.
Eldridge spoke at length about the extensive training received by Potter, which included two Taser-specific courses in the six months prior to the incident. Eldridge said Potter ""flouted"" her training and escalated the traffic stop.
Potter, who resigned from the police department after the incident, and two other officers were attempting to detain Wright on an outstanding warrant for his arrest on a misdemeanor weapons charge. The officers pulled him over because there was an air freshener hanging from his rearview mirror and his license plate tabs were expired, then learned of the warrant.
Eldridge showed the jury video of the incident in which Potter can be heard shouting ""Taser, Taser, Taser"" before firing into the car as Wright broke free from a second officer and tried to drive away. A third officer, Sergeant Michael Johnson, had entered through the passenger side of the vehicle to assist with the arrest.
Paul Engh, an attorney for Potter, called the shooting an accident and a mistake. Engh said it was Wright who created the volatile situation by trying to flee. Engh said Potter had a duty to stop Wright because Johnson could have lost his life if he had been dragged down the street in the fleeing vehicle. 
""All he has to do is stop and he'd be with us,"" Engh said of Wright. ""She can't let him leave because he is going to kill her partner.""
Caught on Potter's body-worn camera, the shooting of Wright triggered demonstrations in Brooklyn Center, with critics calling the incident another example of police violence against Black Americans.
The shooting occurred just a few miles north of where Derek Chauvin, a white former Minneapolis police officer, was standing trial https://www.reuters.com/world/us/jurors-resume-deliberations-derek-chauvin-murder-trial-2021-04-20 at the time in the case of George Floyd, a Black man whose 2020 death during an arrest set off racial justice protests in many U.S. cities. Chauvin was convicted of murder.

The prosecutor wrapped up her remarks by showing jurors a photo of the jacket worn by Wright emblazoned with the phrase ""Heart Breaker."" Eldridge said that ""it the defendant who broke Daunte Wright's heart"" when she fired a bullet into his chest.
""He had a new baby boy, a loving family and his whole adult life ahead of him,"" Eldridge said. ""There is no do-over when you take a young man's life.""

WASHINGTON/SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday targeted foreign government officials and companies it accused of corruption, including senior figures in El Salvador and Guatemala involved in their countries' COVID-19 responses.
Thursday's action, the latest in a series of sanctions announcements in the week of President Joe Biden's democracy summit, targeted 15 individuals and entities across countries in Central America, Africa and Europe, the Treasury said.
""Corrupt acts take resources from citizens, undermine public trust, and threaten the progress of those who fight for democracy,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. 
Those targeted include El Salvador's chief of Cabinet, Martha Carolina Recinos De Bernal, who the Treasury alleges headed a scheme to award inflated contracts as part of the country's coronavirus response, and a Guatemalan health official suspected of engaging in misappropriation of funds. 
Sanctions were also applied by the State Department against Osiris Luna and Carlos Marroquin, two El Salvador officials who a day earlier were accused by the Treasury of leading, facilitating and organizing a number of secret meetings with incarcerated leaders of the MS-13 and Barrio-18 gangs. 
El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, hit back on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), writing: ""These daily accusations seem absurd."" 
""It is clear that the United States Government does not accept collaboration, friendship or alliance,"" he said.
In a sign of deepening tensions with Washington, Bukele also tweeted screenshots of private WhatsApp messages he exchanged with Jean Manes, former charge d'affaires of the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador, who left her post last month as ties deteriorated.
The State Department also applied further sanctions against Nestor Moncada Lau, a national security adviser to Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, alleging he operates an ""import and customs fraud scheme"" to enrich members of Ortega's government.
Among other officials targeted were Liberian warlord-turned-Senator Prince Yormie Johnson, who the Treasury accuses of a ""pay-for-play"" scheme with government ministries and organizations for personal enrichment.

The Treasury also imposed sanctions on former Ukrainian official Andrey Portnov, accusing him of buying influence in Ukraine's courts, as well as two former Angolan officials - Leopoldino Fragoso do Nascimento and Manuel Helder Vieira Dias Jr., who it alleges embezzled billions of dollars.
The State Department also announced visa bans on nine individuals it said were involved in significant corruption, and their immediate family members.

Dole served a combined 36 years in the House of Representatives and Senate and was receiving a tribute similar to those afforded U.S. presidents upon their deaths.
President Joe Biden was on hand to deliver remarks.
Dole's wife Elizabeth, also a former senator, stood at the top of the Capitol's East Front steps as a military honor guard carried his flag-draped casket up the steep incline to be placed in the building's storied Rotunda for the memorial service.
Members of Congress and other invited guests paid their respects to Dole, who represented Kansas in the House of Representatives for eight years and then in the Senate from 1969-1996, including two stints as majority leader. 
He died in his sleep on Sunday at age 98 after a lung cancer diagnosis earlier this year.
Dole was awarded two Purple Hearts from the U.S. military during World War Two for wounds suffered in combat.
He sought the presidency three times and was his party's nominee in 1996, when he lost to Democratic President Bill Clinton. He was also President Gerald Ford's running mate in the 1976 election won by Democrat Jimmy Carter.
Dole's body will lie in state until Friday morning. He is the 33rd person to receive that honor.

No public viewing will take place because of the COVID-19 pandemic, although invited guests were present.
Dole's funeral will be held on Friday at the Washington National Cathedral.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California must prepare for an influx of women seeking abortions in the liberal state if the U.S. Supreme Court ends the constitutional right to the procedure, dozens of women's health and rights groups said in a report released on Wednesday.
The report by the Future of Abortion Council is aimed at positioning California as place where women from conservative states can get abortions. It comes as the Supreme Court considers overturning or weakening its landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized the procedure nationwide.
Last week, the conservative-dominated court signaled a willingness to dramatically curtail abortion rights in America and possibly overturn Roe during oral arguments for a Mississippi case.
""It is imperative that California take the lead, live up to its proclamation as a 'Reproductive Freedom State,' and be ready to serve anyone who seeks abortion services,"" Democrat Toni Atkins, president pro tem of the state Senate, wrote in a letter introducing the report.
The council made more than 40 recommendations, including a call for the state to fund programs to train additional abortion providers and legal protections for women from states where abortion becomes illegal.
Twenty-six states are certain or likely to ban abortions if the court limits or overturns Roe, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which studies abortion rights.
More than 40 health care providers, women's rights groups and Democratic politicians formed the council in September after the Supreme Court refused to block a Texas law that effectively bans abortion at about six weeks and allows people to sue doctors or others who have helped a woman end a pregnancy after fetal cardiac activity can be detected.
The Guttmacher Institute predicted in September that as many as 1.4 million women may drive in to California for abortion services if neighboring states outlaw or severely limit access to the procedure. That estimate doesn't include women who might fly to the West Coast for abortions.

When the new Texas law took effect in September, Planned Parenthood clinics in California began treating two to three Texans per day, said Brandon Richards, a spokesperson for the clinics.
""We started to see an immediate impact on our health centers in California,"" Richards said.

PARIS (Reuters) -The European Union needs an emergency response mechanism that a member state can trigger when the bloc's external borders are under threat, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday.
Migration crises along the EU's eastern flank this autumn underlined Europe's need to strengthen its ability to control who moves in and out of the bloc, the president said.
Only if Europe mastered its outside borders could free movement within the bloc's Schengen zone function properly, Macron added, as he set out a key reform plank of France's rotating presidency of the EU.
""A sovereign Europe is for me above all a Europe capable of controlling its borders,"" Macron told a news conference.
It comes as thousands of migrants are stuck on the EU's eastern frontier, in what the Brussels says is a crisis Belarus engineered by distributing visas to would-be migrants in the Middle East, flying them in and pushing them across the bloc's border. Belarus denies the accusation.
Macron said the emergency mechanism would need to rely on the support of EU border agency Frontex, as well as reinforcements from national law enforcement agencies when needed.
""Often we are too slow to react,"" Macron said.
The rules governing movement across the Schengen zone's open borders also needed reworking, Macron said, adding that he wanted the bloc to have regular political meetings on migration just as it has on economic matters.
The bloc has been deeply divided for years in its response to immigration and how to police the common external borders of its Schengen area.

On the economy, the French president urged the bloc to rethink its budget framework and alter deficit rules to encourage post-pandemic investment and foster growth as the world seeks to emerge from the COVID-19 crisis.
""We must move from a Europe of cooperation within our borders to a Europe that is powerful in the world, fully sovereign, free in its choices and master of its destiny,"" Macron said.

OSLO (Reuters) - Elections worldwide cannot be conducted with integrity as long as social media platforms amplify lies over facts, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Ressa said on Thursday, a day before she will collect the award jointly with Russia's Dmitry Muratov.
The journalists won the award for their efforts to safeguard freedom of expression at a time when free, independent and fact-based journalism is under fire, the Norwegian Nobel Committee said when announcing the prize in October.
Ressa is from the Philippines, which votes in May to choose a successor to President Rodrigo Duterte.
""It is going to be impossible to have integrity of elections if you don't have integrity of facts and right now that is the case,"" Ressa, told a news conference, referring to elections both in the Philippines and elsewhere.
""Because by design the social media platforms, which deliver the news, are ... amplifying and delivering to your newsfeeds lies over facts.""
Ressa, a co-founder of news site Rappler, has grown prominent through investigative reporting, including into large scale killings during a police campaign against drugs. 
Her co-laureate, Novaya Gazeta editor-in-chief Dmitry Muratov, said authoritarian leaders undermined democratic institutions at the peril of peace. 
""Lack of belief in democracy means that, with time, people turn their backs on democracy, you will get a dictator, and dictatorship leads to war,"" Muratov told the news conference.
Ressa and Muratov are the first journalists to receive the prize since Germany's Carl von Ossietzky won the 1935 award for revealing his country's secret post-war rearmament programme.

Both hoped the prize will bolster a new generation to fight against lies and propaganda and to make it safer for existing ones. 
""I hope (the prize) will make it safer for journalists,"" said Ressa. ""The only weapon is to shine the light and keep doing our jobs.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. and Israeli defense chiefs are expected on Thursday to discuss possible military exercises that would prepare for a worst-case scenario to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities should diplomacy https://www.reuters.com/world/us-envoy-malley-return-vienna-resumed-iran-nuclear-talks-over-weekend-state-dept-2021-12-08 fail and if their nations' leaders request it, a senior U.S. official told Reuters.
The scheduled U.S. talks with visiting Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz follow an Oct. 25 briefing by Pentagon leaders to White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan on the full set of military options available to ensure that Iran would not be able to produce a nuclear weapon, the official said on Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons, saying it wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.
The U.S.-Israeli preparations, which have not been previously reported, underscore Western concern about difficult nuclear talks with Iran that President Joe Biden had hoped would revive a 2015 nuclear deal abandoned by his predecessor, Donald Trump.
But U.S. and European officials have voiced dismay after talks last week at sweeping demands by Iran's new, hardline government, heightening suspicions in the West that Iran is playing for time while advancing its nuclear program.
The U.S. official declined to offer details on the potential military exercises.
""We're in this pickle because Iran's nuclear program is advancing to a point beyond which it has any conventional rationale,"" the official said, while still voicing hope for discussions.
The Israeli embassy in Washington and Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Gantz, in a post on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) as he departed for the United States, said: ""We will discuss possible modes of action to ensure the cessation of (Iran's) attempt to enter the nuclear sphere and broaden its activity in the region."" He did not elaborate.
Nuclear negotiations will resume on Thursday, according to the European Union official chairing the talks, and the U.S. special envoy for Iran plans to join them over the weekend.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said last week that Iran had started the process of enriching uranium to up to 20% purity with one cascade, or cluster, of 166 advanced IR-6 machines at its Fordow plant, which is dug into a mountain, making it harder to attack.
The 2015 agreement gave Iran sanctions relief but imposed strict limits on its uranium enrichment activities, extending the time it would need to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon, if it chose to, to at least a year from around two to three months. Most nuclear experts say that period is now considerably shorter.
Underlining how badly eroded the deal is, that pact does not allow Iran to enrich uranium at Fordow at all, let alone with advanced centrifuges.
COMPROMISED
With the deal's nuclear benefits now badly compromised, some Western officials say there is little time left before the foundation of the deal is damaged beyond repair.
Such drills by the United States and Israel could address calls by Dennis Ross, a former senior U.S. official and Middle East expert, and others to openly signal to Iran that the United States and Israel are still serious about preventing it from obtaining a nuclear weapon. 
""Biden needs to disabuse Iran of the notion that Washington will not act militarily and will stop Israel from doing so,"" Ross wrote last month.
Ross even suggested the United States should perhaps signal a willingness to give the Israeli's the U.S. military's bunker-busting Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a 30,000-pound bomb.
Asked about such remarks about deterrence, the senior U.S. official said: ""When President Biden says Iran will never get a nuclear weapon, I mean, he means it."" Central Intelligence Agency Director Bill Burns said on Monday that the CIA does not believe Iran's supreme leader has decided to take steps to weaponize a nuclear device but noted advances in its ability to enrich uranium, one pathway to the fissile material for a bomb.
Burns cautioned that, even if Iran decided to go ahead, it would still require a lot of work to weaponize that fissile material before attaching a nuclear weapon to a missile or other delivery system.

""But they're further along in their mastery of the nuclear fuel cycle and that's the kind of knowledge that is very difficult to sanction away or make disappear, as well,"" he said.
U.S. officials have also long worried about America's ability to detect and destroy dispersed components of Iran's nuclear weaponization program once enough fissile material for a bomb were produced.

OTTAWA/BEIJING (Reuters) - Canada joined Australia, Britain and the United States in a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics in Beijing on Wednesday, with China calling the boycotts ""political posturing"" and a smear campaign.
The United States was the first to announce the boycott this week, saying on Monday its government officials would not attend February's Beijing Olympics because of China's human rights ""atrocities"", weeks after talks aimed at easing tense relations between the world's two largest economies.
China on Tuesday said the United States would ""pay a price"" for its decision and warned of countermeasures but gave no details. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) sought to play down the growing diplomatic boycott.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Beijing would be aware of long-standing Western concerns about human rights in China. ""(So) it shouldn't be a surprise that we decided not to send diplomatic representation.""
Trudeau's decision seems sure to add tension to a relationship already strained over the detention of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. warrant.
A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Canada accused Trudeau of making false claims.
""Based on ideological biases as well as lies and rumors, Canada and a handful of western countries have been flagrantly engaged in political maneuvering, with the attempt to disrupt the smooth progress of Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. Their clumsy performance can hardly find any support and is doomed to fail,"" the spokesperson said in a written statement.
IOC President Thomas Bach said the Committee had always been concerned with the participation of the athletes in the Olympic Games.
So ""we welcome the support for their Olympic teams all these governments have been emphasising,"" he told a video news conference. ""This is giving the athletes certainty and this is what the IOC is about.""
The chairman of the athletes' committee of Beijing 2022 said the Games were a stage for athletes, not a runway for politics, according to the Xinhua news agency.
""The politicisation of sport and the use of the Olympic Games as a vehicle for political purposes by individual politicians would undoubtedly breach (the) Olympic Charter,"" said Yang Yang, China's first Winter Olympics gold medalist. 
BRITAIN, AUSTRALIA BOYCOTT
Asked earlier in parliament if his country would follow Washington's lead, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""There will be effectively a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, no ministers are expected to attend and no officials.""
""I do not think that sporting boycotts are sensible and that remains the policy of the government,"" he added, indicating British athletes will still compete. 
China said it had not invited British officials.
""Making an issue out of the presence of government officials at the Beijing Winter Olympics is in essence a political smearing campaign,"" a spokesman for the Chinese embassy in London said.
Earlier, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia's decision came because of its struggles to reopen diplomatic channels with China to discuss alleged human rights abuses in the far western region of Xinjiang and Beijing's moves against Australian imports.
China has denied any wrongdoing in Xinjiang and said allegations are fabricated.
Foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Australian politicians were engaged in ""political posturing"".
""Whether they come or not, nobody cares,"" he added.
The Australian Olympic Committee said the boycott would have no impact on athletes' preparations for the Games, which run from Feb. 4 to 20, adding that ""diplomatic options"" were a matter for governments.
For the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC), a diplomatic boycott recognised the distinction between government and athlete participation while providing a platform to shine a light on China issues. 
""The Canadian Olympic Committee and Canadian Paralympic Committee remain concerned about the issues in China but understand the Games will create an important platform to draw attention to them,"" said the COC in a statement.
SLOW TO COMMIT
Other U.S. allies have been slow to commit to joining the boycott, though Japan is considering not sending cabinet members to the Games, the Sankei Shimbun daily said on Wednesday, citing unidentified government sources.
""Countries' decisions to boycott the Olympics, that's their decision that they have to make for themselves,"" said White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre. ""It's up to them (other countries) to decide how they're going to move forward, and if they're going to boycott or not."" 

President Joe Biden's administration cited what the United States calls genocide against minority Muslims in China's Xinjiang region. China denies all rights abuses.
The United States is set to host the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and is preparing to bid for the 2030 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.

PARIS (Reuters) - France on Wednesday released a Saudi national arrested at a Paris airport over suspected links to the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi after officials concluded it was a case of mistaken identity.
French law enforcement sources had identified the man in detention as Khaled Aedh Al-Otaibi, the same name as a former member of the Saudi Royal Guard listed in U.S. and British sanctions documents and a U.N.-commissioned report as having been involved in Khashoggi's killing in Turkey. 
The Saudi Embassy in Paris had said late on Tuesday the arrested person ""has nothing to do with the case in question.""
Prosecutors said checks had shown that an arrest warrant issued by Turkey did not apply to the man. Earlier, a police source said he had been detained when a scan of his passport triggered an alert.
""Extensive checks on the identity of this person showed that the warrant did not apply to him... he was released,"" the statement from the prosecutor's office said.
The Saudi national had been visiting Paris with a friend and held a valid visa for France, a source familiar with the matter said after the man's release. He shared the same first name and family name as al-Otaibi, but not the same patronymic name. Nor did his passport number match the wanted suspect's passport number, the source added.
Khashoggi, a Washington Post journalist and critic of Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was last seen entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018. Turkish officials believe his body was dismembered and removed. His remains have not been found.
CONFUSION
A senior French police official said he was baffled by events. The man held overnight had made several European trips in past months and entered France in November without issue, he added, requesting anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. 
When news of the arrest in Paris first broke, rights groups and Khashoggi's fiancee had expressed relief that such a high-profile suspect had been caught.
A 2019 U.N. investigation report said Al-Otaibi was a member of a 15-man Saudi team involved in killing Khashoggi after the journalist went to the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul to obtain a document to allow him to marry his fiancee.
The arrest had come at a sensitive time for the countries involved. 
President Emmanuel Macron had days earlier become the first major Western leader to hold face-to-face talks with Prince Mohammed in the kingdom, a major buyer of French arms, since Khashoggi's murder. 

Macron considers Saudi Arabia vital to help forge a region-wide peace deal with Iran, as well as an ally in the fight against Islamist militants from the Middle East to West Africa, and a rampart against the Muslim Brotherhood.
Turkey initially sought to pile international pressure on Prince Mohammed after Khashoggi's murder, saying the order had come from the highest level of the Saudi government, but Ankara has recently appeared to favour mending relations.

MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines' Supreme Court declared two parts of a controversial anti-terrorism law unconstitutional on Thursday, dismaying activists and rights groups who sought the scrapping of the legislation over fears it threatened civil liberties.
While the Philippines does have legitimate security threats, including Islamist extremism, lawyers and human rights groups challenging the legislation say it could be abused to target government opponents and suppress peaceful dissent. 
President Rodrigo Duterte has defended the legislation https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-security-idUSKBN2482SO, saying law-abiding citizens have nothing to fear.
The Supreme Court, which has yet to release a breakdown of ruling, said in a statement said it struck down a part of the law ""for being overbroad and violative of freedom of expression."" 
It also declared as unconstitutional a provision that allows an anti-terrorism council appointed by the president to adopt requests by other entities, including international organisations, to designate individuals and groups as terrorists. 
Akbayan, a group of activists and legislators, said the ruling was a devastating blow for the country.
""The Supreme Court missed the opportunity to defend the Filipino people's human rights and democracy,"" it said.
""You don't defeat terrorism by terrorising the people and stifling their rights. The answer to non-state terrorism is not state terrorism.""
Lawmaker Edcel Lagman, who was among the petitioners, said a law that allows detention of a suspect for up to 24 days without a warrant was a ""blatant violation of the constitution"". 
Duterte's office said it would await details of the decision before commenting, but said it remained committed to fighting security threats. 

Hermogenes Esperon, the national security adviser and vice chairman of the anti-terrorism council, said the government would respect whatever the court decided. 
Rights group Karapatan, another petitioner, said the entire law should be ditched over repressive provisions that were ""only set to worsen the already dismal human rights situation.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) -A Hong Kong court found three prominent pro-democracy activists guilty on Thursday over an unauthorised assembly on June 4 last year to mark Beijing's 1989 crackdown on protesters in and around Tiananmen Square.
Hong Kong has traditionally held the world's largest annual June 4 vigils, as part of wide-ranging freedoms promised when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997, but applications to hold the vigils this year and in 2020 were rejected by police.
The ruling against media tycoon Jimmy Lai, barrister Chow Hang-tung and former opposition politician Gwyneth Ho is the latest blow to the democracy movement, in which scores of activists have been arrested, jailed or fled since Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law.
Lai, Chow and Ho had pleaded not guilty to the charges linked to the gathering on June 4, 2020.
Prosecutors had been ""able to prove beyond reasonable doubt"" that Lai and Chow had incited others to attend the vigil, District Court Judge Amanda Woodcock wrote in her judgment.
These efforts included an appeal by Chow for people to ""light candles"" across Hong Kong, including at the vigil site of Victoria Park.
Lai was found guilty after spending 15 minutes in the park in what Woodcock called a ""deliberate act to rally support for and publicly spotlight the unauthorised assembly that followed"", even if he did not speak.
Ho was found guilty of participating in an unauthorised assembly.
During the trial, Chow, a former leader of the now disbanded Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, had argued the annual vigil was ""their right, their freedom"". 
The police, however, rejected the Alliance's application after taking into account the advice of government medical experts regarding COVID risks and that a mass gathering was ""not recommended"", according to the judgement.
Ho earlier told the court that ""remembrance is resistance"", adding that she only went to the site to test the difference between Hong Kong and mainland China, where any commemoration of June 4 is taboo and can lead to imprisonment. 
Sentencing will be delivered on Dec. 13. 
Sixteen other activists are already serving sentences of between four and 10 months for the same incident. 
After mass pro-democracy protests in 2019, China imposed a sweeping national security law that punishes offences such as subversion and secession with jail terms of up to life. 
Critics, including the U.S. government, say the law has been used as a tool to erode the city's freedoms and quash dissent, but Beijing says it has brought stability and order to the financial hub. 

Chow and several former leaders of the now disbanded Alliance, which had long sought to ""end one-party rule"", have also been charged with inciting subversion under the new law.
China has never given a full account of the 1989 crackdown. Days later officials put the death toll at about 300, most of them soldiers, but rights groups and witnesses say thousands of protesters may have been killed.

(Reuters) - The number of journalists worldwide who are behind bars reached a global high in 2021, according to a new report from the nonprofit Committee to Protect Journalists, which says that 293 reporters were imprisoned as of Dec. 1 this year.
At least 24 journalists were killed because of their coverage, and 18 others died in circumstances that make it too difficult to determine whether they were targeted because of their work, the CPJ said on Thursday in its annual survey on press freedom and attacks on the media. 
(GRAPHIC: Journalists killed in 2021 -https://graphics.reuters.com/RIGHTS-JOURNALISTS/dwpkrzkryvm/cpj-2021_killed-2021.jpg) 
While the reasons for jailing reporters varies between countries, the record number reflects political upheaval around the world and a growing intolerance of independent reporting, according to the U.S.-based nonprofit.
""This is the sixth year in a row that CPJ has documented record numbers of journalists imprisoned around the world,"" said CPJ Executive Director Joel Simon in a statement. ""The number reflects two inextricable challenges – governments are determined to control and manage information, and they are increasingly brazen in their efforts to do so."" 
(GRAPHIC: Journalists imprisoned since 1992 - https://graphics.reuters.com/RIGHTS-JOURNALISTS/jnpweajeypw/cpj-2021_imprisoned-total.jpg) 
The journalists who were killed in 2021 include Danish Siddiqui, a Reuters photographer who died in a Taliban attack in Afghanistan in July, and Gustavo Sanchez Cabrera, who was shot and killed in Mexico in June.
China imprisoned 50 journalists, the most of any country, followed by Myanmar (26), which arrested reporters as part of a crackdown after its Feb. 1 military coup, then Egypt (25), Vietnam (23) and Belarus (19), the CPJ said. 
(GRAPHIC: Journalists imprisoned in 2021 - https://graphics.reuters.com/RIGHTS-JOURNALISTS/zdpxoxqylvx/cpj-2021_imprisoned-2021.jpg) 
For the first time, the CPJ's list includes journalists incarcerated in Hong Kong – a byproduct of the 2020 national security law, which makes anything Beijing regards as subversion, secession, terrorism or colluding with foreign forces punishable by up to life in prison. 

Mexico, where journalists are often targeted when their work upsets criminal gangs or corrupt officials, remains the Western hemisphere's deadliest country for reporters, according to the CPJ.

The U.S. Treasury Department said Wednesday's action, the latest in a series of sanctions announcements marking the week of President Joe Biden's democracy summit, named 16 individuals and 24 entities linked to transnational crime.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said gangs that operate across borders were destabilizing and often colluded with government officials. 
""We also know that organized crime backed by corrupt actors can destabilize rule of law, erode confidence in public institutions, and weaken democratic governance,"" Blinken said in a statement. 
The Treasury said it slapped sanctions on Osiris Luna Meza, the chief of the Salvadoran Penal System and vice minister of justice and public security, and Carlos Amilcar Marroquin Chica, chairman of the social fabric reconstruction unit.
It accused the officials of leading, facilitating and organizing a number of secret meetings with incarcerated gang leaders including of Mara Salvatrucha 13 (MS-13) as part of El Salvador's efforts to ""negotiate a secret truce with gang leadership.""
El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) denied his government was negotiating with the gangs, instead placing blame on the previous government and former mayor of San Salvador.
""It is clear that the interests of the United States government have NOTHING TO DO with democracy, in ANY COUNTRY,"" Bukele added later. ""It's funny that there are people who think that is the case."" 

Also blacklisted were Kosovan gang leader Zvonko Veselinovic and his brother, whom the Treasury accused of having agreements with politicians to help their party win elections and contribute money to the candidates.
In return, the politicians would grant the brothers the best infrastructure contracts, provide proprietary business information to support their investments and grant them control of certain areas for their businesses, the Treasury said.

BOSTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's administration on Wednesday urged the U.S. Supreme Court to decline to hear a case against Harvard University challenging the ability of it and other schools to consider race as a factor in student admissions to boost diversity.
The justices in June asked the administration for its views on the case, which could give the court's 6-3 conservative majority a chance to end affirmative action policies used to increase the number of Black and Hispanic students on American campuses.
Students for Fair Admissions, a group founded by anti-affirmative action activist Edward Blum, is appealing a decision upholding Harvard's race-conscious admissions practices and hopes to overturn a 2003 Supreme Court ruling that preserved such polices.
SFFA accuses Harvard of discriminating against Asian-American applicants by engaging in impermissible ""racial balancing"" to make it easier for Blacks and Hispanics to win admission at the expense of Asian-American applicants.
But Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued in a brief that it would be an ""extraordinary step"" for the court to reconsider its past rulings and called the case a ""poor vehicle"" to do so.
The lawsuit contends Harvard's actions violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars racial discrimination under any program receiving federal financial assistance.
Prelogar argued reconsidering its past decisions would be disruptive for universities that had come to ""rely on the permissibility of a holistic, flexible approach like Harvard's as a benchmark in structuring their own admissions policies.""

Blum in a statement said the brief ""regrettably advocates for the continuation of racial classifications and preferences in college admissions,"" and urged the court to hear the case and a related one against the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Harvard in a statement welcomed the administration's support of policies like its own to create diverse campuses.

WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday that putting American troops on the ground in Ukraine to deter a potential Russian invasion was ""not on the table,"" as tension between Moscow and Washington eased slightly after a virtual summit this week.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would send ideas to Washington within a week to follow up his talks with Biden on Tuesday about the Ukraine crisis.
Speaking to reporters at the White House, Biden said he hoped there would be an announcement by Friday of high-level meetings with Russia and major NATO allies to discuss Moscow's ""concerns relative to NATO writ large"" and the possibility of ""bringing down the temperature along the eastern front."" 
The United States has voiced growing unease about a Russian military buildup near Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has tilted toward the West since 2014. Moscow denies aiming to invade Ukraine and instead warns of a creeping NATO expansion eastward. 
Biden said the United States had a moral and legalobligation to defend NATO allies if they are attacked, but thatobligation did not extend to Ukraine.
""That is not on the table,"" Biden said when asked if U.S.troops would be used to stop a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
""It would depend upon what the rest of the NATO countries were willing to do as well,"" Biden said. ""But the idea the United States is going to unilaterally use force to confront Russia invading Ukraine is not ... in the cards right now.""
He said he made it clear to Putin during their talks on Tuesday that there would be economic consequences like none before if Russia invades Ukraine, and that he is confident Putin got the message.
Biden warned Putin on Tuesday that the West would impose ""strong economic and other measures"" on Moscow if it invaded, while Putin demanded guarantees that NATO would not expand to the east. 
Neither side spoke of a breakthrough after the two-hour video call but agreed to keep talking about what the Kremlin called ""this complex confrontational situation."" 
""We agreed we will continue this discussion and we'll do it in a substantive way. We will exchange our ideas in the very near future. Russia will draw up its ideas literally in the coming days, within a week we will give this to the U.S. side to consider,"" Putin told reporters on Wednesday.
In his first public comments since the conversation, Putin said it was ""provocative"" to pose the question of whether Russia planned to attack Ukraine, and again accused Kyiv and NATO of threatening Russia's security.
""We cannot fail to be concerned about the prospect of Ukraine's possible admission to NATO, because this will undoubtedly be followed by the deployment there of military contingents, bases and weapons that threaten us,"" he said.
It would be ""criminal inaction"" on Russia's part not to respond, he said. ""We are working on the assumption that our concerns, at least this time, will be heard.""
Biden is to speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday to discuss the Russian military buildup and then convene a call with the leaders of the so-called Bucharest Nine group of Eastern European NATO allies, the White House said.
FIGHTER JETS
Russia, Ukraine and NATO have all stepped up military exercises as tensions have mounted in the past month.
Russian military aircraft were scrambled on Wednesday to escort French Rafale and Mirage fighter jets flying over the Black Sea, RIA news agency quoted the Defence Ministry as saying.
Russia's Foreign Ministry said it had handed a note of protest to the U.S. Embassy over ""dangerous"" flights of U.S. and NATO military planes near Russia's borders.
Zelenskiy welcomed Biden's role in trying to attain peace in eastern Ukraine, where Ukraine says more than 14,000 people have been killed in seven years of fighting with Russian-backed separatists.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told Reuters the talks between Biden and Putin had served the purpose of ""deterrence and de-escalation"".
A Russian Foreign Ministry official was quoted as saying the United States might be included for the first time in a group of countries working to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine. 
RIA quoted the official, Oleg Krasnitsky, as saying there was no reason why the United States should not join the so-called Normandy grouping - comprising Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany - that has tried but so far failed to end the war.

""A lot depends on the position of Washington in settling the Ukrainian conflict. In principle, if the U.S. is really ready to make a contribution, we've always been open to America exercising its influence on Kyiv,"" he was quoted as saying.
The remarks appeared to indicate that Moscow was open to an offer by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken last week for Washington to facilitate talks on the fighting.

The talks seek to find a way for the United States and Iran to resume compliance with the agreement, under which Iran restricted its nuclear program in return for relief from U.S., European Union and U.N. sanctions.
Then-President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the deal in 2018 and reimposed U.S. sanctions, prompting Iran to start violating the nuclear restrictions about a year later. Iran struck the original deal with six major powers: Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States. 
Enrique Mora, the senior European Union official chairing the talks, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that they would resume on Thursday.
The talks have effectively been indirect negotiations between Iran and the United States, with diplomats from other nations shuttling between them because Tehran has refused face-to-face meetings with U.S. officials.
Noting the EU statement that talks resume on Thursday, the State Department spokesman told reporters: ""We understand that there will be a day of meetings before the heads of delegations need to attend ... so Special Envoy Malley and his inter-agency delegation will plan to join the talks over the weekend.""
After a round of talks that ended on Dec. 3, senior U.S. and European officials voiced disappointment and said Iran sought sweeping changes to draft agreements reached earlier this year.

The spokesman said Washington should be able to make a quick judgment about whether Iran was willing to negotiate seriously. 
""We should know in pretty short order if the Iranians are ... returning to negotiate in good faith,"" Price told reporters at a regular briefing.

Peterson, 49, had been held on death row at San Quentin State prison since 2005 after being convicted a year earlier of murdering his wife, Laci, who was seven months pregnant with their unborn son, Conner.
His new sentence was handed down by Judge Anne-Christine Massullo in San Mateo County Superior Court.
Laci Peterson's family gave emotional testimony about their enduring grief over her death, especially at Christmas, local media reported. 
Scott Peterson attended the hearing, but was not allowed to speak, defense attorney Pat Harris told reporters outside the Redwood (NYSE:RWT) City, California, courthouse.
Peterson had hoped to say that he had been looking forward to fatherhood, contrary to a prosecution theory that his wife's pregnancy motivated him to kill her, Harris said.
""One of the things that really upsets him is this concept that he did not want to have a child,"" he said. ""And he wanted to talk a little bit about that.""
Stanislaus County District Attorney Birgit Fladager, whose office prosecuted the case, declared in May court that she would not seek another death sentence.
Laci Peterson was reported missing from the couple's home in Modesto, California, on Christmas Eve, 2002, touching off a months-long search and investigation in the glare of national media. Her partial remains and those of her unborn son washed ashore along San Francisco Bay the following April.
California's Supreme Court threw out Peterson's death sentence in August 2020 on the grounds that the presiding San Mateo County Superior Court judge wrongly dismissed 13 potential jurors because, in filling out an initial questionnaire, they expressed opposition to the death penalty.

Separately, the state Supreme Court in October 2020 ordered the trial court to review Peterson's conviction based on his contention that his two counts of murder should be set aside because of prejudicial misconduct by a member of the jury.
Harris said the defense team is focused on a Feb. 25 hearing stemming from the Supreme Court ruling at which they hope to win a new trial.

(Reuters) - Conservative U.S. Supreme Court justices on Wednesday appeared ready to further expand public funding of religiously based entities, indicating sympathy toward a challenge by two Christian families to a Maine tuition assistance program that excludes private schools that promote religious beliefs.
The court heard nearly two hours of arguments in an appeal by the families of a lower court ruling rejecting their claim that Maine's program singles them out for religious discrimination in violation of the U.S. Constitution including its First Amendment protection of the free exercise of religion. 
The families sought taxpayer dollars to send their children to two Christian schools that integrate religion into their classrooms and have policies against gay and transgender students and staff. The First Amendment also prohibits government endorsement of any particular religion.
Expanding religious rights has been a priority in recent years for the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority. The court's ruling last year in a Montana case paved the way for more taxpayer dollars to flow to religious schools. 
Conservative justices asked questions aimed at exposing potential bias in Maine's program, indicating concern that religious schools and parents are being treated differently than their secular counterparts. 
The lesson from the court's prior rulings in this area, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said, is that ""discriminating against all religions versus secular is itself a kind of discrimination that the court has said is odious to the Constitution, at least in certain contexts.""
Maine's program applies only in sparsely populated areas lacking public secondary schools. Public funds may be used to pay for tuition at ""nonsectarian"" private schools that do not promote a particular religion or present material ""through the lens of that faith.""
Chief Justice John Roberts worried that Maine's eligibility decisions could favor one religion over another. 
""You're discriminating among religions based on their belief, right?"" Roberts asked a lawyer for Maine. 
The ruling in the case, due by the end of June, could further erode the separation of church and state in the United States. Maine is backed in the case by President Joe Biden's administration, public school boards and teacher unions.
Liberal justices emphasized that Maine's program is meant only to ensure availability of public education. They expressed concern that funding the promotion of religion could cause strife in society. 
Justice Sonia Sotomayor wondered why rural parents should get money for religious schools when parents in more populated areas would not have that option.
Justice Elena Kagan said states can legally make choices around religion that best fit their communities. 
The two schools involved in the case, Kagan said, are ""proudly discriminatory. Other people won't understand why in the world their taxpayer dollars are going to discriminatory schools. For any of a number of reasons, a state can say, 'We don't want to play in this game.'""
Two sets of parents - David and Amy Carson, and Troy and Angela Nelson - sued Maine in 2018. 
The Nelsons would like to use the tuition aid to send their son to a Christian school called Temple Academy in Waterville, but instead use it to send him to a secular private high school. The Carsons paid out-of-pocket to send their daughter to Bangor Christian Schools. 

The two schools describe themselves as seeking to instill a ""Biblical worldview"" in students, according to court records. They will not admit gay or transgender students or hire gay teachers. Bangor Christian Schools teaches that a ""husband is the leader of the household"" and includes a class instructing students to ""refute the teachings of the Islamic religion with the truth of God's Word.""
Last year's Montana ruling prevented states from disqualifying schools from public aid based on their religious status or affiliation. The Maine case goes further, with the possibility looming of requiring states that subsidize private education to also fund religious activities.

The charred remains were found in a village in Sagaing, an area that has seen fierce fighting between security forces and militia set up by opponents of military rule since a Feb. 1 coup, said residents, who said some of the victims were still alive when burned. 
Video footage purporting to show the burned bodies was circulated on social media and images were published by some media, including the Myanmar Now news portal. 
Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the footage or claims over how the 11 died. A spokesman for the junta did not answer calls seeking comment.
A volunteer aid worker in the area, who asked not to be identified, said by telephone troops had entered Don Taw village early on Tuesday and the victims were killed at around 11 a.m. that day.
""The troops were just brutally killing anyone they could find,"" the volunteer said, citing witness accounts. The volunteer has assisted people who have fled Don Taw and other nearby villages.
The volunteer said it was unclear if the victims were militia members or ordinary civilians.
Myanmar has been in chaos since the military overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi's democratically elected government, with widespread protests and the formation of militia, known as People's Defence Forces (PDF), to take on the well-equipped army.
Kyaw Wunna, a member of a PDF in the region, said by telephone he was informed that troops had arrived firing weapons and those detained were taken to a field near the village before being killed. 
Kyaw Wunna declined to disclose the source of the information. 
Another volunteer aid worker said they had spoken to witnesses among some of the 3,000 people who had fled from five villages in the area and had gone into hiding, fearful of more arrests and killings.
A relative of one of the victims told Reuters the dead man, Htet Ko, was a 22-year-old university student and not a member of any militia and not armed.
""This is inhumane. I feel deep pain in my heart,"" said the relative, who said the man had tried to flee, but had been wounded by gunfire.
Dr Sasa, a spokesperson for Myanmar's shadow civilian government set up following the coup, alleged the victims had been ""lashed together, tortured, and ultimately burned alive"".
In a post on social media, he listed what he said were the names of the 11, all male and including a boy of 14.
""These horrific attacks show that the military have no regard for the sanctity of human life,"" he said.
U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the United Nations was deeply concerned by the reports of the ""horrific killing.""
""We strongly condemn such violence and remind Myanmar’s military authorities of their obligations under international law to ensure the safety and protection of civilians. Those individuals responsible for this heinous act must be held to account,"" Dujarric said. 

The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), a monitoring group cited by the United Nations, says more than 10,700 civilians have been detained and 1,300 killed by security forces since the military seized power.
The military says the AAPP is biased and uses exaggerated data and that hundreds of soldiers have also been killed.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) -Chile's Congress passed a law to legalize same-sex marriage on Tuesday, in a milestone for the conservative South American nation after a decade-long legal battle and with the country delicately poised ahead of a crossroads election this month.
""Today is a historic day, our country has approved same-sex marriage, one more step forward in terms of justice, in terms of equality, recognizing that love is love,"" Minister of Social Development Karla Rubilar said after the vote. 
Chile's Senate and lower house of parliament both voted heavily in favor of the bill on Tuesday, which had previously been partially approved in November before the Senate sent it back to a committee to clarify ambiguities. 
Current President Sebastian Pinera, who will leave office in March, has backed the bill and is expected to sign it into law.
The vote culminates a process that began in 2017, when the first bill was introduced, backed by then-President Michelle Bachelet. Chile is now poised to join over 20 countries globally with legal same-sex marriage, including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica and Uruguay in Latin America.
""It is hard to believe that today we are taking this step,"" said Rolando Jimenez from LGBT rights group Movilh, one of the major backers of the bill and which helped spearhead Chile's push to legalize same sex marriage for more than a decade.
Chile will elect a new president on Dec. 19, choosing between progressive Gabriel Boric and social conservative Jose Antonio Kast, a practicing Catholic. The two offer wildly different visions for the country's future.
While Kast disagrees with same-sex marriage, he had said he would have signed the bill into law anyway had it been passed by Congress during a potential presidency of his. 
Chile has long had a conservative reputation even compared with its deeply Catholic Latin American peers. Still, a strong majority of Chileans now support same-sex marriage and Chileans have shown signs of moving left on social and cultural issues in recent years. 
Civil unions have been permitted in Chile since 2015, which affords same-sex partners many but not all the benefits of married couples, like the right to adoption.
The law, which will come into effect 90 days after it is published in the Official Gazette, was cheered by rights groups and couples, opening the door for both parents in a same sex couple to receive full legal recognition.

""This is cause for all Chilean society to celebrate,"" said Isabel Amor, executive director of equality group Iguales.
""Not only will people who have a same-sex relationship be able to marry, but hundreds of children and adolescents will get recognition for their two mothers or two fathers.""

BERLIN (Reuters) -Social Democrat Olaf Scholz became Germany's chancellor on Wednesday, ending 16 years of conservative rule under Angela Merkel and launching his three-way coalition that has pledged to boost green investment and strengthen European integration.
Scholz, 63, who over the past four years served as vice chancellor and finance minister in coalition with Merkel, won a majority of 395 votes from lawmakers in the lower house of parliament, Bundestag President Baerbel Bas said.
Wearing a black face mask, Scholz waved as he received a standing ovation from lawmakers and accepted bouquets of flowers and a basket of apples from leading members of parliament.
After being formally nominated by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier in the nearby Bellevue Palace, Scholz returned to the historic Reichstag building in the heart of the German capital to take the oath of office in front of lawmakers and become Germany's ninth chancellor since the end of World War Two.
In one of his first interviews as chancellor, Scholz told Welt TV that Russia would have to face consequences if Ukraine's borders were violated, but he added that Germany and its allies were doing everything possible to avoid such an escalation.
Concerned by a Russian military build-up near the Ukrainian border, the United States wants Germany to use its pending approval of the nearly finished Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia as leverage in the standoff with Moscow over Ukraine.
In another interview with ZDF television, Scholz skirted questions about whether Germany would join the United States, Australia and Britain in a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympic Games in Beijing.
In parliament, he swore to devote his energies to the welfare of the German people - but did not ask for God's help, a phrase that is usually included in the oath of office and was spoken by Merkel.
'STEADY HAND'
Back in Bellevue Palace, the ministers of the new cabinet received their appointment certificates from the president.
Merkel officially handed over the chancellery to Scholz and wished him a ""steady hand"" as Germany faces a surging fourth wave of coronavirus infections and hybrid attacks on democracies by authoritarian leaders.
In a short speech, Scholz hailed Merkel as a great chancellor and thanked her for a close and trustful relationship over the past years.
""I would like to build on the northeast German mentality, if I may say so, that has reigned here so far. Not much will change it this regard,"" Scholz said in reference to their shared northern roots in the port city of Hamburg.
With his down-to-earth and no-nonsense manner, Scholz has positioned himself as Merkel's natural successor and a safe pair of hands to steer Germany through challenges ranging from tackling the climate crisis to dealing with a more confrontational Russia and increasingly assertive China.
Scholz will lead an unprecedented tripartite coalition on the federal level with the pro-spending, environmentalist Greens and the fiscally more conservative, libertarian Free Democrats (FDP) - unlikely political bedfellows in the past.
Scholz is an experienced negotiator and veteran politician who as SPD party secretary general from 2002 until 2004 defended disputed labour market reforms and social welfare cuts under then-Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
As labour minister from 2007-2009 in Merkel's first ruling coalition, Scholz pushed for a generous short-time work scheme that helped protect millions of workers from the fallout of the global financial crisis.
After being mayor of Hamburg from 2011-2018, Scholz returned to Berlin as Merkel's finance minister - a role in which he got rid of the goal of balanced budgets and enabled record new borrowing to shield companies and employees from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
On the European level, he worked closely with France and persuaded Merkel to support a debt-financed European Recovery Fund worth 800 billion euros ($900 billion) to help EU member states hit hardest by COVID-19.

Merkel, 67, a lover of opera and hiking in the little spare time she has had in the last 16 years, has given few clues about what she plans to do in retirement.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A man testified at Ghislaine Maxwell's criminal sex abuse trial on Wednesday that he drove teen girls to the Florida mansion of the late financier Jeffrey Epstein and saw them leave with hundred dollar bills.
The man, who identified himself as Shawn, testified that he had begun dating a woman named Carolyn in Florida when he was 17 and she was 14.
Carolyn, now in her mid-30s, testified on Tuesday that she had sexual encounters with Epstein at his Palm Beach, Florida, home beginning when she was 14 in 2002. 
The British socialite, 59, has pleaded not guilty to eight counts of sex trafficking and other charges for her alleged role in recruiting and grooming four girls, including Carolyn, for Epstein to abuse between 1994 and 2004.
Maxwell's lawyers have said that her accusers' memories have been corrupted over the years, and that Maxwell is being scapegoated for Epstein's alleged conduct.
The globetrotting investor died by suicide in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting his own sex abuse trial. 
Carolyn's case underlies Maxwell's sex trafficking charge, because she was allegedly paid for interactions with Epstein, and allegedly received gifts from Maxwell that were sent from a New York address to Carolyn's home in Florida. Carolyn said the encounters with Epstein began as massages before escalating.
Shawn, now 38, recalled traveling to Epstein's house with Carolyn for the first time with a girl named Virginia Roberts and Roberts' boyfriend after Roberts told Carolyn the pair could make money by giving ""a guy a massage."" 
""She was excited to make money,"" said Shawn, who has not been accused of wrongdoing in the case. 
He added that he and Roberts' boyfriend saw Roberts and Carolyn go into Epstein's home, waited for them for more than an hour, and saw them leave the home with hundred dollar bills. 
Roberts, now known as Virginia Giuffre, is one of Epstein's and Maxwell's most prominent accusers, though she is not expected to testify in Maxwell's criminal case. 
Shawn's account of that first trip largely matched up with Carolyn's version. After that first trip, Shawn said he drove Carolyn to Epstein's home every two weeks, and that Carolyn would leave with hundred dollar bills. They would use the cash to buy drugs, Shawn said, echoing his former girlfriend's statement on the stand on Tuesday.
When a prosecutor asked him why Carolyn did not drive herself, Shawn replied, ""She was too young."" 
Shawn also recalled that Carolyn once received a package of lingerie from a New York address around the time she was meeting with Epstein. He said he also drove two other girls he was dating at the time, Amanda and Melissa, to Epstein's home. 
Shawn said he never met Maxwell. He recalled Carolyn telling him about a woman named ""Maxwell"" whose first name she could not pronounce. 
He said he sometimes received calls from Epstein employees seeking to schedule a massage appointment for Epstein with Carolyn, including from someone with an English accent who did not give their name.

Besides Carolyn, jurors have also heard from women known as Jane and Kate who said they were abused by Epstein as teens.
Prosecutors are expected as soon as Wednesday afternoon to call the fourth woman identified in Maxwell's indictment to begin testifying.

The 46-year-old fashion magnate and art collector successfully launched from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan along with his assistant Yozo Hirano, who will document the journey, as well as Russian cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin.
Maezawa, a space enthusiast who has been training for the journey for months, has become a household name in Japan thanks to his penchant for private jets, celebrity girlfriends and cash giveaways to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) followers, in a country known for its conformist corporate culture.
Maezawa plans to upload footage of his flight to his YouTube channel, which has 795,000 followers. He has called on his supporters to give him 100 ideas of things to do in space, and said he plans to play badminton aboard the ISS. 

The cost of Maezawa's trip was not disclosed but some reports have put the price tag for tourist space flights as high as $50 million. 
Maezawa is also set to become the first private passenger on the SpaceX moon trip and has begun searching for eight people to join him, requiring applicants to pass medical tests and an interview.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -The head of India's armed forces, General Bipin Rawat, was among 13 people killed on Wednesday when the military helicopter they were travelling in crashed, the air force said.
They were en route from an air force base to a hillside military college in the southern state of Tamil Nadu when the Russian-made Mi-17V5 helicopter came down near the town of Coonoor.
Local television footage showed rescuers and army personnel carrying bodies up steep slopes from the mangled wreckage. Only one of the 14 people on board survived and was in hospital with injuries.
""With deep regret, it has now been ascertained that Gen Bipin Rawat, (his wife) Mrs Madhulika Rawat and 11 other persons on board have died,"" the Air Force said in a statement.
Rawat, 63, was appointed as India's first Chief of Defence Staff by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government in late 2019. The position was set up with the aim of integrating India's three military services - the Army, the Navy and the Air Force.
Several of the bodies were badly burnt, two government sources said. ""Some bodies were so charred that they could not be immediately identified,"" one of the sources said.
Modi said he was deeply saddened by Rawat's death. ""A true patriot, he greatly contributed to modernising our armed forces and security apparatus,"" the prime minister said.
In a tweet, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh called Rawat's death ""an irreparable loss to our armed forces and the country.""
The Indian Air Force ordered an inquiry into the cause of the accident.
India has dozens of Mi-17s in service. They are widely deployed to transport senior army personnel and government ministers.
""This is a safe, proven helicopter, I have travelled on it in difficult situations,"" former army chief J.J.Singh said.

An infantryman with over four decades of military service, Rawat served along India's border with China, the disputed Kashmir region and on a United Nations mission in Africa, before taking charge of the Indian army in late 2016.
In New Delhi, Defence Minister Singh visited Rawat's official residence and the state broadcaster said Modi had summoned a meeting of the cabinet committee on security on Wednesday evening.

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told Reuters on Wednesday that talks between U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin had enabled ""deterrence and de-escalation"".
In the first reaction by a senior Ukrainian official about Tuesday's video call between Biden and Putin, Kuleba welcomed U.S. efforts to bring Russia to the negotiating table. 
But he added that the priority was drawing up a deterrence package to ward Moscow off any further military escalation.
Ukraine and its NATO allies have sounded the alarm about Russian troop movements near Ukraine's borders this year, sparking worries that a simmering conflict in eastern Ukraine could erupt into open war between the two neighbours. 
""The contact itself serves (as) deterrence and de-escalation,"" Kuleba said in written remarks about Tuesday's call. ""We appreciate the crucial diplomatic engagement of the U.S. in efforts to bring Russia back to the table of negotiations."" 
Biden warned Putin on Tuesday that the West would impose ""strong economic and other measures"" on Russia if Russia launched a new offensive against Ukraine, while Putin demanded guarantees that NATO would not expand farther eastward.
STRONG SIGNALS TO PUTIN
Kuleba has led Kyiv's diplomatic efforts to press allies for a package of measures to deter Russia from launching a new offensive. Russia has dismissed suggestions of such an attack as false and inflammatory while blaming Ukraine and the United States for destabilising behaviour.
Kuleba said he was confident ""Putin heard some very clear and strong signals regarding Russia's escalation along the border of Ukraine and in the region"". 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will speak to Biden on Thursday.
Kuleba said Thursday's talks would allow the two leaders to discuss further steps to deter Russia and ways to revitalise four-way peace talks between Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany about the conflict in eastern Ukraine. 
""Currently, as we see a clear lack of constructiveness on the Russian side, the main priority is to effectively implement the comprehensive deterrence package to demotivate Russia from further military escalation,"" Kuleba said.
""We are working closely with our allies on both sides of the Atlantic to achieve that.""
Ukraine's ties with Russia collapsed in 2014 after Moscow-backed forces seized territory in eastern Ukraine that Kyiv wants back. Kyiv says some 14,000 people have been killed in fighting since then.

Since the latest crisis started, Moscow has set out demands for legally binding security guarantees from the West that NATO will not admit Ukraine as a member or deploy missile systems there to target Russia.
Ukraine says Russia has no say over its ambitions to join the NATO alliance and dismissed the suggestion of security guarantees as illegitimate.

LOON-PLAGE, France (Reuters) - Afghan refugee Abdul Saboor began photographing the lives of migrants as he made his own arduous journey to Western Europe, determined to portray the hardship of being uprooted and cast into the unknown.
Saboor, 29, said he was hounded out of Afghanistan by Taliban insurgents in 2015 and spent two years making his way to Europe. He captured his first images on a mobile phone before a charity later gave him a camera.
""There was no one to photograph, to document what was happening,"" he told Reuters. ""I decided to be a witness of our journey and show to the world, show to the people how difficult it is when you leave your home.""
Saboor has been a photographer ever since. He spends much of his time in the makeshift camps in northern France where migrants fleeing war, poverty and persecution in Africa and the Middle East often hunker down before trying to reach Britain.
It was from the Channel shores of northern France that the 27 migrants who drowned while attempting to cross the Channel in an inflatable dinghy last month had set off.
""I know how difficult it is when you leave all your dreams behind,"" Saboor, who trained as a mechanical engineer in his homeland, said in Loon-Plage, a coastal town 20 km (12 miles) east of Calais where many of the migrant camps are situated.
But dreams can be reborn.
Saboor has been granted refugee states in France, and he now divides his time between Paris, Toulouse, where he teaches at an art school, and Calais, working for international media houses.

This week, some of Saboor's images were screened at an event at a cultural bar in Paris where artists and journalists present their works. Curator Yael Caux said Saboor's own experience lends a rare empathy to his images. 
Saboor's next ambition is to return to the Afghan border, where his exile started, and capture shots of those starting out on their own new journey.

(Reuters) - As Ghislaine Maxwell's lawyers cross-examine her accusers, they face the difficult task of casting doubt on their credibility without seeming too aggressive toward women who say they were abused, legal experts say.
Prosecutors have accused the British socialite of recruiting young girls to be sexually abused by financier Jeffrey Epstein, who died by suicide at 66 in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges. Maxwell has pleaded not guilty.
Maxwell's attorneys have already cross-examined three of the four women cited as victims in the indictment who are testifying at the trial.
They sought to undercut the witnesses' credibility by asking about inconsistencies in statements they made to law enforcement and, for two of the women, asking about past drug use.
Experts said that going after accusers aggressively could risk backfiring and alienating the jury, particularly as the MeToo movement has brought more attention to issues of sexual abuse.
""Any good defense attorney would try to challenge the credibility of these young women, but in doing so you really have to walk a tightrope so that the jury doesn't hate you,"" said Daniel Hochheiser, a New York criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor.
Defense lawyers in recent high-profile sexual abuse trials, including those of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and R&B star R. Kelly, aggressively questioned their clients' accusers, suggesting they were lying for financial gain and highlighting inconsistencies in their past statements.
Both men were convicted, though it is unclear how important defense lawyers' questioning tactics were to jurors in those cases.
Hochheiser said Maxwell's attorneys' task was made easier by the fact that they only needed to shift blame onto Epstein while painting Maxwell as an ""unwitting accomplice,"" rather than deny that the women were abused at all. Nonetheless, he said, they had to give jurors reason to doubt the witnesses' truthfulness.
Bennett Gershman, a professor at Pace Law School, called attacking the accusers a ""huge risk,"" but said Maxwell's lawyers may have no choice but to go on the offense, in the hope that one of the women will say something self-incriminating.
""These witnesses have been very credible,"" Gershman said. ""The testimony that they're giving is powerful, and the defense knows that ... There may be no way you can blunt the force of their testimony except trying to attack them.""

Despite the risks, the defense's approach is not unusual in a sexual abuse case, according to Deborah Tuerkheimer, a professor at Northwestern (NASDAQ:NWE) University School of Law.
""We're primed as a culture to be skeptical of these kinds of allegations, so the defense is using familiar tactics that over time have really worked in court,"" Tuerkheimer said.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese LGBTQ rights activists on Wednesday hailed Tokyo's move to introduce a same-sex partnership system as a huge step in their fight for equality in the only G7 country that does not fully recognise same-sex marriage.
Under plans announced by Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike on Tuesday, partnerships would be allowed early next year and made legal in the fiscal year beginning April 2022, vastly expanding the number of people in Japan who can benefit. 
The partnership system allows same-sex partners to register their relationship and gain some of the privileges enjoyed by married couples, such as being allowed to rent places to live together and gain hospital visitation rights. 
Though it falls short of a legal marriage, Tokyo's move to adopt the partnership system is seen as an important step towards legalising same-sex unions in a nation where the Constitution still defines marriage as based on ""the mutual consent of both sexes.""
""This is amazing news,"" said Masa Yanagisawa, head of Prime Services Japan at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and a board member of activist group ""Marriage for All Japan"".
""Some conservatives have voiced concerns that even though these partnerships are just symbolic pieces of paper, they could undermine Japanese traditions or the traditional Japanese family system. Hopefully this will be a chance to prove otherwise.""
Tokyo's Shibuya ward in 2015 was the first place in Japan to introduce the partnership system. The system already covers 41% of Japan's population and the extension to Tokyo means over half of the nation could potentially benefit, according to campaign group Nijiiro Diversity.
Activists have long lobbied for the whole capital city to adopt the system, and stepped up such efforts ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, delayed by the coronavirus pandemic until this summer.
Takeharu Kato, a lawyer in charge of a landmark court case in March where barring same-sex marriage was ruled ""unconstitutional"", said the government may have shown restraint in expanding the partnership system due to ""the fact that a lot of ruling party lawmakers are reluctant about this.""
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told parliament that introducing same-sex marriage would require ""prudent consideration"".
""The introduction of a system allowing same-sex marriage would be an issue that goes straight to the very core of how families ought to be in Japan,"" he said.
OLYMPICS IMPACT 
While Tokyo as a whole did not adopt the partnership system before the Games, the Olympics, with its focus on diversity, helped sway public opinion, Kato and others said.
A recent poll of Tokyo residents conducted by the metropolitan government found 70% of respondents were in favour of same-sex partnerships.
""I'm sure the Olympics had an impact since Tokyo has been thinking of what kind of legacy they should leave,"" said LGBTQ rights activist Gon Matsunaka. 
Another incentive has been Tokyo's interest in branding itself a major international centre and attracting foreign companies, many of which have greater emphasis on LGBTQ rights.
As part of Governor Koike's preparation for her announcement, she spoke with foreign business leaders, who said Tokyo was behind on that front, said Goldman's Yanagisawa.
""From my perspective as a Goldman Sachs employee, we want to attract international talent but Japan is always at a disadvantage,"" he added.
""We offer our own employee benefits on top of the national provisions to try to equalise the system but there's a limitation to what is possible, and obviously not every company can do this.""
Ordinary Japanese, such as business owner Yoko Namiki, applauded the move, calling it ""revolutionary.""

The next goal is making marriage possible, though this probably requires more local areas to adopt same-sex partnership regulations, creating enough pressure that the national government can no longer ignore it, activists say.
""Of course I'm happy,"" said lawyer Kato. ""But this is just one waypoint on a long road. We need to use it to push towards actual marriage.""

It gave no date or details of how the contacts would take place.
Agreement to keep talking was the main tangible result of the video call where the two leaders set out opposing positions on Ukraine, which says it is braced for a possible invasion by tens of thousands of Russian troops close to its border.
Neither side spoke of a breakthrough in the discussion, in which Biden warned Putin that the West would impose ""strong economic and other measures"" on Russia if it invaded, while Putin demanded guarantees that NATO would not expand eastward.
Russia denies threatening its neighbour and says it is responding to menacing actions by Ukraine and NATO.
""The presidents agreed to appoint their representatives, who will very promptly begin a discussion of this complex confrontational situation, a discussion of strategic security issues on the continent,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
He said the two leaders would need to speak again after contacts between their officials but that no date had been set for their next exchange.
Peskov said the possibility of Western sanctions against Russia's newly built Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline had not been raised on the call.
U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday the fact that gas was not yet flowing through Nord Stream 2 - led by Russian gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) - created leverage for the West over Putin.
""If Vladimir Putin wants to see gas flow through that pipeline, he may not want to take the risk of invading Ukraine,"" Sullivan told reporters at the White House.

WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Joe Biden warned Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday that the West would impose ""strong economic and other measures"" on Russia if it invades Ukraine, while Putin demanded guarantees that NATO would not expand farther eastward.
The two leaders held two hours of virtual talks on Ukraine and other disputes in a video call about U.S.-Russian relations, which have sunk to their lowest point since the end of the Cold War more than three decades ago, as Russia masses tens of thousands of troops on Ukraine's border.
Putin responded to the warning with a demand for reliable, legally binding guarantees against NATO expansion eastward and complained about NATO attempts to ""develop"" Ukrainian territory,"" the Kremlin said.
The White House said Biden did not make any guarantees to limit NATO expansion with regard to Ukraine. 
""I will tell you clearly and directly he made no such commitments or concessions. He stands by the proposition that countries should be able to freely choose who they associate with,"" Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters.
No breakthroughs were reported but both sides agreed to continue communications, a development that could lower global tensions. 
The Kremlin has denied harboring any intention to attack Ukraine and has said a troop buildup on its southern border is defensive, but neighboring nations are sounding alarms.
Biden warned Putin he could face stiff economic sanctions, the disruption of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Europe, and that the United States and European allies would provide additional defensive capabilities to Ukraine.
The president ""made clear that the U.S. and our Allies would respond with strong economic and other measures in the event of military escalation,"" the White House said in a statement.
""Things we did not do in 2014 we are prepared to do now,"" Sullivan told reporters after the call, referring to the reaction to Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.
In case of an attack, the United States would be looking to respond positively if Baltic allies ask for additional U.S. ""capabilities"" or ""deployments,"" he said. 
The United States could also target Russia's biggest banks and Moscow's ability to convert roubles into dollars and other currencies, one official said.
In 2014, Washington focused mainly on defensive, non-lethal aid following Russia's annexation of Crimea out of fear it would escalate the crisis.
Biden was ""direct and straightforward"" with Putin, Sullivan said. ""There was a lot of give-and-take, there was no finger-wagging, but the president was crystal clear where the United States stands on all of these issues,"" Sullivan said.
The Kremlin said Putin told Biden it was wrong to put all the responsibility on Russia's shoulders for current tensions.
Moscow has voiced rising irritation over Western military aid to Ukraine, a fellow former Soviet republic that has tilted toward the West since a popular revolt toppled a pro-Russian president in 2014, and what Russia calls creeping NATO expansion.
RUSSIA WANTS GUARANTEES
Putin complained about NATO attempts to ""develop"" Ukrainian territory, the Kremlin said.
""Therefore, Russia is seriously interested in obtaining reliable, legally fixed guarantees that rule out NATO expansion eastward and the deployment of offensive strike weapons systems in states adjacent to Russia,"" the Kremlin said.
Putin also called for guarantees that offensive strike systems would not be deployed in countries close to Russia, according to the Kremlin.
Russian TV footage showed Biden and Putin greeting each other in a friendly manner at the start of the virtual summit. 
Both sides say they hope the two leaders can hold an in-person summit to discuss ties between the two nations, which have long-standing differences over Syria, U.S. economic sanctions and alleged Russian cyberattacks on U.S. companies.
A Ukraine official said after the talks that Kyiv was grateful to Biden for his ""unwavering support"". 
A U.S. congressional defense bill released after the talks included $300 million for Ukraine's military. 
For the Kremlin, the growing NATO embrace of neighbouring Ukraine - and what it sees as the nightmare possibility of alliance missiles in Ukraine targeted against Russia - is a ""red line"" it will not allow to be crossed.
Moscow has questioned Ukrainian intentions and said it wants guarantees that Kyiv will not use force to try to retake territory lost in 2014 to Russia-backed separatists, a scenario Ukraine has ruled out. 
WESTERN ALLIES ENGAGED
Leaders from Britain, the United States, France, Germany and Italy spoke on Monday and ""agreed to stay in close touch on a coordinated and comprehensive approach in response to Russia’s military build-up on Ukraine's borders"", the White House said.
The Russian rouble weakened slightly on Tuesday, with some market analysts predicting the talks would de-escalate tensions and others saying the U.S. sanctions threat eroded hopes of finding common ground.
U.S. officials have told members of Congress they have an understanding with Germany about shutting down the Nord Stream 2 pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior congressional aide said.
""If President Putin moves on Ukraine, our expectation is that the pipeline will be suspended,"" Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
The United States has evaluated the possibility of curbing investors' ability to buy Russian debt on the secondary market, a measure that even if taken only by Washington was seen as having a severe impact on Russia’s government, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
Washington could target the Russian Direct Investment Fund as well.
CNN reported that sanctions could include disconnecting Russia from the SWIFT international payment system used by banks around the world, an extreme step that would likely require coordination with allies. 

German Gref, chief executive of Russia's top bank, Sberbank, on Tuesday called that idea ""nonsense"" and ""impossible to execute"".
The United States has urged both Ukraine and Russia to return to a set of largely unimplemented agreements signed in 2014 and 2015 that were designed to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine.

PARIS (Reuters) - French police on Tuesday arrested a suspected member of the hit squad that killed Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi as the man was about to board a flight from Paris to Riyadh, French law enforcement sources said.
Khashoggi's fiancee welcomed the detention of the suspect and said he should be prosecuted for his role in the 2018 killing. But the Saudi Embassy in Paris said the arrested person ""has nothing to do with the case in question.""
""Therefore the Kingdom's embassy expects his immediate release,"" it said in a statement.
A French police source and a judicial source named the man as Khaled Aedh Al-Otaibi - the same name as a former member of the Saudi Royal Guard who is identified in U.S. and British sanctions lists, and a U.N.-commissioned report, as having been involved in Khashoggi's killing.
The police who detained him were acting on a 2019 arrest warrant issued by Turkey, the country where Khashoggi was killed, according to the police source.
Khashoggi, a Washington Post journalist and critic of Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was last seen entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018. Turkish officials believe his body was dismembered and removed. His remains have not been found.
A U.S. intelligence report released in March this year said Prince Mohammed had approved the operation to kill or capture Khashoggi. The Saudi government has denied any involvement by the crown prince and rejected the report's findings.
Last year, a Saudi court jailed eight people for between seven and 20 years over the killing, but none of the defendants was named. The trial was criticised by a U.N. official and human rights campaigners who said the masterminds of the murder remained free.
""This could be a major breakthrough in the quest for justice for Jamal Khashoggi,"" former U.N. investigator Agnes Callamard said of the Paris detention. 
In her 2019 report for the United Nations, Callamard named Al-Otaibi as being part of a Saudi team that killed Khashoggi and dismembered his body before flying back to Saudi Arabia.
Callamard, now head of rights group Amnesty International, said more confirmation was required to prove that the man held in France is the same person she identified in her report.
The police source said the detained man was being held at a border police detention facility at Charles de Gaulle airport, near Paris, and would be taken to court in the centre of the city on Wednesday morning for a hearing on his extradition to Turkey.
Last weekend, French President Emmanuel Macron held face-to-face talks in Saudi Arabia with Prince Mohammed, becoming the first major Western leader to visit the kingdom since Khashoggi's murder.
'MISTAKEN IDENTITY'
It was unclear how or when Al-Otaibi arrived in France.
The French Interior Ministry declined to comment. Turkish officials said they were waiting for confirmation of the detained man's identity. 
A Saudi official told Reuters: ""Media reports suggesting that a person who was implicated in the crime against Saudi citizen Jamal Khashoggi has been arrested in France are false.""
""This is a case of mistaken identity. Those convicted of the crime are currently serving their sentences in Saudi Arabia.""
Khashoggi's fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR): ""I welcome the arrest today of one of Jamal's killers today in France.""
""France should try him for his crime, or extradite him to a country able and willing to genuinely investigate and prosecute him as well as the person who gave the order to murder Jamal,"" Cengiz said.
The 2019 report compiled by Callamard said Al-Otaibi was a member of a 15-man Saudi team involved in killing Khashoggi after the journalist went to the consulate to obtain a document to allow him to marry his fiancee.

That report said Al-Otaibi was one of five members of the team who were not in the consulate itself - where the report said the killing took place - but in the consul general's residence. 
A report by Britain's Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation said Al-Otaibi was ""involved in the concealment of evidence at the Saudi General Consul's residence following the killing."" A U.S. Treasury Department report named Al-Otaibi as among those involved in Khashoggi's killing.

Thousands of people have been displaced and 22 remain missing, according to the disaster mitigation agency.
After visiting evacuation centres and surveying the area by helicopter - getting an aerial view of villages submerged in molten ash - the president said recovery efforts would be bolstered now and in the months ahead.
""I came to the site to ensure that we have the forces to locate the victims,"" said the president, speaking from Sumberwuluh, one of the worst-hit areas.
""We hope that after everything has subsided, that everything can start - fixing infrastructure or even relocating those from the places we predict are too dangerous to return to.""
At least 2,000 homes would need to be relocated to safer areas, he said.
Search and rescue efforts continued on Tuesday but have been hampered by wind and rain, and limited equipment in some areas. 

Mt. Semeru erupted three times on Tuesday. Indonesia's Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation said on Monday there was potential for further flows of hot gas, ash and rocks.
Mt. Semeru is one of more than 100 active volcanoes in Indonesia, in an area of high seismic activity atop multiple tectonic plates known as the ""Pacific Ring of Fire"".

125,"<span>Dec 07, 2021 09:11PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -Hawaii prepared for more rainfall on Tuesday after the Pacific island chain was beset with torrential downpours that caused flooding, triggered landslide warnings and prompted the state to take emergency action.
A stalled ""kona low"" weather system brought up to 12 inches (30 cm) of rain over three days, although actual amounts varied greatly throughout the islands' mountainous terrain, the National Weather Service said.
""It's a kind of a typical pattern for Hawaii that can produce heavy rain,"" said meteorologist Bob Oravec of the NWS Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland.
""It's not something that happens, obviously, every day, but it can happen every year,"" Oravec said. 
The NWS issued flash flood watches through Tuesday afternoon for Oahu, the most populous island, and Kauai, the western-most island. Each was expected to get another 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) of rain.
""Rain events of this size can cause catastrophic flooding and affect areas that do not usually flood,"" the NWS said in a bulletin from his Honolulu office. ""Numerous landslides are expected in areas with steep terrain.""
On Monday, the deluge prompted Governor David Ige to issue an emergency declaration that will remain in effect through Friday.
""The emergency declaration allows the state to use funds to support state and county efforts in providing quick and efficient relief of suffering, damage, and losses caused by flooding and other effects of heavy rains,"" Ige said in a statement.
Five people were rescued on Monday night from a swollen stream near Oahu's Pali Highway, the Honolulu Fire Department said in a statement. 
Four shelters were set up in the capital city of Honolulu, the Oahu Department of Emergency Management said.
The state Department of Education said most schools were set to open on Tuesday, and there were very few power outages reported by PowerOutage.US, which collects data from across the country.

The system also brought snow and high winds to some Big Island mountain tops a few days ago, including Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano where the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFH Telescope) observatory is located. The NWS said such high-elevation snowfalls are ""fairly common."" 
Most of the rain has already moved away from the eastern-most islands, the big island of Hawaii and Maui, and the system should clear out of the rest of the island chain by the end of Tuesday, the NWS said.

LIMA (Reuters) -Peruvian President Pedro Castillo gained breathing room on Tuesday after Congress voted against a motion to impeach him amid protests in capital city Lima both for and against the under-fire leftist leader.
Peruvian lawmakers voted 76 against the motion and 46 in favor, short of the threshold required to proceed to an impeachment trial, after Castillo garnered support in recent days to fend off the attempt to oust him by right-wing parties.
The impeachment vote had threatened to tip Peru into political uncertainty with Castillo battling crises as his popularity wanes months into his administration amid corruption allegations and widespread mining protests.
Castillo's own party, the Marxist Peru Libre, had at one point considered supporting the motion, though on Monday rallied behind the president despite clashing with him over policy and called the attempt a right-wing coup.
""The impeachment motion failed, fascism failed, the parliamentary blow to democracy failed,"" Peru Libre leader Vladimir Cerron, who hasn't always seen eye-to-eye with more moderate Castillo, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) after the vote.
Earlier in the day hundreds of protesters supporting and opposing Castillo, a former teacher from a peasant farming family, had congregated around Congress.
""We want him to keep working,"" said María Lázaro Cornelio, a protester supporting Castillo, who came to office in July pledging major social change. ""We want him to keep his word on things that he has promised us.""
Another protester, who gave her name as Jacky, said she wanted Castillo out because she alleged he was ""destroying Peru, destroying our economy and the freedom of all Peruvians.""
The impeachment push, backed by right-wing lawmaker and defeated presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori, had appeared to lose steam in recent days after Castillo held talks with various political parties.
""""The issue of vacating (the presidency) is slowly being deflated,"" Vice President Dina Boluarte had told reporters earlier on Tuesday.
The three right-wing parties seeking Castillo's removal controlled 43 legislators. The motion needed 52 votes from the 130 members of Congress to move forward and then 87 votes in a later vote to remove the president from office.
The reprieve comes as prosecutors investigate alleged cases of corruption by aides to Castillo, who accused his opponents and ""economic interest groups"" of conspiring against him.

The Andean country's fragmented Congress has a history of clashing with the executive branch. 
The copper-rich country has had five presidents since 2016. In 2018, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski resigned from the presidency minutes before an impeachment vote, while centrist Martín Vizcarra was ousted following two impeachment trials last year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A woman whose accusations underlie the criminal sex trafficking case against Ghislaine Maxwell testified on Tuesday that she felt ""broken"" after the British socialite fondled her around the time she was giving nude massages to Jeffrey Epstein at age 14.
The woman, identified as Carolyn, said Maxwell would sometimes call her to schedule massages for the financier, when Epstein would touch her breasts and buttocks. He would then masturbate until he ejaculated, she said.
""I was fully nude and she came in and she felt my boobs and my hips and my buttocks and said that ... I had a great body for Mr. Epstein and his friends,"" Carolyn, who chose not to reveal her last name, told jurors in Manhattan federal court.
Carolyn, now in her mid-30s testified that when she was 14, she had told Maxwell her age at Epstein's estate in Palm Beach, Florida.
Carolyn is the third woman to have testified that she was abused by Epstein at Maxwell's trial, which appears to be going faster than expected.
Both sides had projected the trial would last into mid-January, but prosecutor Alison Moe told U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan outside the jury's presence that the government may finish its case by Thursday.
It is unclear how long a defense case might last. The trial has been going on seven days so far.
Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and other charges for allegedly recruiting and grooming teenage girls for Epstein, her onetime employer and boyfriend.
Lawyers for Maxwell have said her accusers' memories have been corrupted over time.
They also said she is being scapegoated for Epstein's alleged crimes, after Epstein killed himself in 2019 in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.
Maxwell lawyer Jeffrey Pagliuca cross-examined Carolyn about possible inconsistencies between her testimony, her 2007 FBI interview about Epstein, and her 2009 lawsuit against Epstein and another assistant in which she did not mention Maxwell.
Carolyn said Maxwell was ""not a topic of conversation"" during her conversations with law enforcement.
""The only thing Ms. Maxwell was involved in was fondling my breast and my buttocks, and for that my soul is broken and so is my heart,"" she said. 
Pagliuca also asked Carolyn if there was an ""incentive for you to stick to your story"" after she reached a $3.25 million civil settlement with a fund to compensate Epstein's victims, where she mentioned Maxwell in her claim.
""Money will not ever fix what that woman has done to me,"" Carolyn said, sobbing.
One juror shook her head as Pagliuca questioned Carolyn on how fast she spent settlement money from her 2009 lawsuit.
'I WAS TOO YOUNG'
Jurors had previously heard from two women who said Maxwell set them up for sexual encounters with Epstein when they were also teenagers.
The women, known by the pseudonyms Jane and Kate, testified that they had been aspiring entertainers and that Maxwell had told them Epstein could help advance their careers. 
Carolyn's background was different.
She testified that her mother was a drug user and alcoholic and her grandfather sexually abused her when she was four. Carolyn also said she became a cocaine addict, and dropped out of school in the seventh grade.
Carolyn said she was introduced to Epstein in 2002 by Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's and Maxwell's most prominent accusers, who asked her ""if I wanted to go make money.""
She said she helped Giuffre massage Epstein for 45 minutes, and then watched Epstein have sex with Giuffre. Carolyn said three $100 bills were left for her on a bathroom sink.

Giuffre has said in civil lawsuits that Epstein and Maxwell trafficked her while she was a teenager. She is not expected to testify at Maxwell's criminal trial. 
Prosecutors on Tuesday also showed jurors photos depicting what they called Epstein's intimate relationship with Maxwell, including Maxwell massaging Epstein's foot while it was pressed against her chest.

SAN JOSE, Calif. (Reuters) -Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes denied making misleading statements about the blood-testing startup during cross-examination on Tuesday, as her testimony in defense against fraud charges neared its end.
Former Theranos investors have testified at the trial that Holmes had led them to believe the company's technology was being used by the U.S. military in the field. Under questioning from prosecutor Robert Leach, Holmes said she had never made such statements to investors and that they would not have been true.
Holmes also said she did not recall telling an investor that Theranos expected to achieve $990 million in revenue in 2015, a claim prosecutors have said was false.
But Holmes acknowledged she was in regular contact with Theranos' financial controller and had ultimate responsibility for the company's finances as its chief executive officer.
Leach completed his cross-examination of Holmes on Tuesday afternoon.
Holmes rose to fame in Silicon Valley for her ambitious play to reinvent diagnostic testing. But she has been on trial for three months in a San Jose, California, court, accused of exaggerating Theranos' technology to bilk patients and investors.
Once valued at $9 billion, Theranos collapsed after the Wall Street Journal published a series of articles, starting in 2015, that suggested its devices were flawed and inaccurate. 
On the stand, Holmes has testified that she believed Theranos could have achieved its goal of a miniaturized device that would make blood testing cheaper and more accessible.
Holmes has explained some of her actions, such as attempts to quash a Wall Street Journal story on Theranos, saying they were aimed at protecting the company's trade secrets.
She also invoked intellectual property concerns to justify withholding Theranos' use of third-party blood testing machines from Walgreens.
The pharmacy chain had a partnership with Theranos to offer blood tests in some of its stores. 
Holmes testified on Tuesday that Theranos shared confidential information in other instances, including sending one of its devices to Walgreens for it to examine.
Theranos trusted Walgreens not to reverse-engineer its technology because that would violate a confidentiality agreement between the companies, she said.

Her attorneys, who have characterized Holmes as young entrepreneur who underestimated the obstacles Theranos faced and argued that the company's failure was not a crime, said the defense case is expected to conclude this week.
Holmes' testimony is expected to conclude on Wednesday.

DOHA (Reuters) - Talks on reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal are expected to resume on Thursday, France's foreign minister said, although he added that he feared Iran was playing for time.
""The elements... are not very encouraging,"" French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a French parliament committee, referring to the seventh round of nuclear talks between Iran and major powers that began on Nov. 29 and paused on Friday.
""We have the feeling the Iranians want to make it last and the longer the talks last, the more they go back on their commitments... and get closer to capacity to get a nuclear weapon,"" Le Drian said.
Under the 2015 deal struck by Tehran and six major powers, Iran limited its nuclear program in return for relief from U.S., European Union and U.N. sanctions. 
Then-President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the deal in 2018 and reimposed harsh U.S. sanctions, and Iran began violating the nuclear restrictions a year later.
While Le Drian and Iranian media reports said talks were expected to resume Thursday, a senior U.S. State Department official said Washington did not yet have a confirmed date.
The indirect U.S.-Iranian talks in Vienna, in which other diplomats shuttle between them because Tehran refuses direct talks with Washington, aim to get both sides to resume compliance with the deal.
However, last week's discussions broke off with European and U.S. officials voicing dismay at sweeping demands by Iran's new, hardline government under anti-Western President Ebrahim Raisi, whose June election caused a five-month pause in the talks.
A senior U.S. official on Saturday said Iran abandoned any compromises it had made in the previous six rounds of talks, pocketed those made by others, and demanded more last week.
Each side appears to be trying to blame the other for the lack of progress.
U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the presidents of the United States and Russia - two of the six major powers in the deal along with Britain, China, France, and Germany - had a ""productive"" discussion about Iran on Tuesday.
""The more Iran demonstrates a lack of seriousness at the negotiating table, the more unity there is among the P5+1 and the more they will be exposed as the isolated party in this negotiation,"" he told reporters, referring to the six powers. 
Speaking on Monday, Central Intelligence Agency Director Bill Burns said the agency does not believe Iran's supreme leader has decided to take steps to ""weaponize"" a nuclear device but noted that it has made advances in its ability to enrich uranium, one pathway to the fissile material for a bomb.
Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons, saying it only wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.
""We don't see any evidence as an agency right now that Iran's supreme leader has made a decision to move to weaponize,"" Burns told the Wall Street Journal's CEO Council Summit.

Burns described Iran's challenge as ""a three-legged race"" to obtain fissile material, to ""weaponize"" by placing such material into a device designed to cause a nuclear explosion, and to mate it to a delivery system such as a ballistic missile.
On weaponization, Burns said ""the Iranians still have a lot of work to do there as far as we judge it.""

(Reuters) - The United States marked the 80th anniversary of the Japanese attack on the U.S. naval base in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on Tuesday as the number of Americans belonging to the ""Greatest Generation"" who lived through World War Two dwindles. 
The attack on Dec. 7, 1941 shook a country so focused on the war in Europe that it lost sight of the threat posed by Japan, according to historians. It killed 2,390 Americans, and the United States declared war on Japan the next day. 
""The ranks of Pearl Harbor survivors grow thinner with each passing year. But the memory of their heroism-and our gratitude-still shine bright,"" U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement. ""They were among the first of the Greatest Generation to taste combat, to know war. And they answered that call to duty with exceptional skill and fortitude.""
President Joe Biden visited the World War Two memorial in Washington early Tuesday morning to observe the anniversary, saluting a wreath among the columns. First lady Jill Biden laid a bouquet at the memorial's New Jersey pillar to honor her father, Donald Jacobs, who served as a U.S. Navy Signalman in the war. 
""We honor the patriots who perished, commemorate the valor of all those who defended our nation, and recommit ourselves to carrying forth the ensuing peace and reconciliation that brought a better future for our world,"" Biden later said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
In Hawaii, a memorial ceremony at Pearl Harbor Monday evening honored the 58 service members who died aboard the battleship USS Utah, one of the first ships hit in the attack.
Members of the U.S. Navy, veterans, friends and family members stood as the names of those who died were read out, each accompanied by a tolling bell. The bugle call ""Taps"" then rang out near the site of the sinking. 
Several other remembrances organized by the National Park Service and the U.S. Navy are also planned to mark the day. 
The bombing was famously dubbed ""a date which will live in infamy"" by then-U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
The United States defeated Japan in August 1945, days after U.S. atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki killed hundreds of thousands of civilians.
Eighty years later, a dwindling number of veterans remains. 
Former Republican U.S. Senator Bob Dole, who overcame grievous World War Two combat wounds, died on Sunday at age 98. 

Former U.S. President George H.W. Bush, who joined the U.S. Navy after the Pearl Harbor attack, died in 2018 at age 94.
Ray Chavez, who was the oldest surviving U.S. veteran of the attack, died in 2018 at age 106, according to media reports.

VITRY-SUR-SEINE, France (Reuters) - French archivist Adele Bellot went on Tuesday to get a booster shot against COVID-19 with one aim in mind - to save Christmas.
""Christmas is coming soon and there are elderly people in my family. I really want to protect them from getting infected, that's it,"" she said, after getting her third shot in a vaccination center in Vitry-sur-Seine, just outside Paris. 
With the holidays nearing and a fifth wave of the pandemic surging through France amid worries over the new Omicron variant, vaccination centers are at full stretch.
More than 9 million French people have received a booster. The Doctolib health app said 464,000 appointments for a booster had been made across France through its system on Monday alone.
Liliane Tiburce, 73, said she was relieved to get her booster shot ahead of Christmas.
""I am very happy to be able to do this before the coming holidays and celebrations. My children and grand-children are coming so that's for the best,"" she said.
Head nurse Chantal Simon said the Vitry-sur-Seine vaccination center, like many others across France, was getting swamped.
""There are not enough slots, everybody says so. People call us and tell us that they cannot find appointments,"" she said.
With more than 90% of French aged 12 and over having had at least one jab, and over 88% having received two, and people now going for their third shot, Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Monday that France, unlike some of its neighbours, did not need to tighten restrictions much more.
But with the virus still spreading, nightclubs will be shut for four weeks and vaccination will be open to children, he said.

In the Vitry-sur-Seine vaccination center there were first-timers too, including pensioner Viviane Chieze, getting her first jab despite concerns, she said, over how quickly COVID-19 vaccines had been developed.
Asked what changed her mind, she said: ""My doctor. He told me off ... he told me that it was wrong to not get vaccinated.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican officials have sped up the transfer of thousands of migrants from southern Mexico to other regions, as northern border states prepare to receive asylum seekers sent back to Mexico from the United States.
Dozens of buses full of migrants, mostly from Central America as well as some from Cuba and Venezuela, have left the city of Tapachula in Chiapas state in recent days to head to other states, a Reuters witness and an activist said on Monday.
Many of the migrants had waited months in Tapachula, near the Guatemala border, to try to regularize their migration status. Many have left violent and impoverished home countries hoping to eventually seek asylum in the United States.
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration on Thursday said it would reinstate the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), a contentious Trump-era policy that requires asylum seekers to wait out their cases in Mexico, a decision that shelters along the northern border have said could overwhelm their capacity. 
The first group of migrants under the revamped program are expected to be returned to Mexico this week.
Enrique Valenzuela, a local council head in the northern state of Chihuahua, said he was expecting the first migrants to arrive through the border city of Ciudad Juarez, opposite El Paso, Texas.
In Tapachula, 45 buses took migrants out of the city on Saturday, said a government source who requested anonymity. 
Migrant rights activist Luis Garcia Villagran said migration officers took 32 full buses of migrants out of the city on Sunday, and another 70 on Monday. 
""They are trying to not saturate the northern border now that MPP is starting,"" he said. ""That's why they are moving them more quickly, controlling where the migrants are going."" 
Mexico's National Migration Institute did not respond to a request for comment. 
A Nicaraguan migrant who declined to be identified said he was relieved to get on a bus to the city of San Miguel de Allende in the central state of Guanajuato. 

""I was here for a few months but thank God we are going,"" he said.
Large numbers of migrants, especially from Haiti, remained clustered in Tapachula waiting for buses, with some sleeping in a camp outside a stadium that migration officers have used as a processing center.

CURAH KOBOKAN, Indonesia (Reuters) - At the foot of Indonesia's Mount Semeru, what is left of the houses along the main village road are covered in a thick layer of hardened volcanic ash.
Curah Kobokan was among the worst-hit areas when the 3,676-metre (12,060 ft) Mount Semeru erupted on Saturday, sending a cloud of ash into the sky and dangerous pyroclastic flows into villages below.
At least 34 people were killed and 22 people were missing as of Tuesday. 
    Since day one of the disaster, volunteer Dodik Suryadiawan, 36, has driven on the bumpy roads in his personal four-wheel drive, helping to retrieve the remains of those who perished. 
Among the victims he found was a mother who died cuddling her child.
""I feel very sorry, especially when I try to imagine hot ash falling at that time,"" he said. 
Using heavy equipment and shovels, Dodik and fellow volunteers joined a search team of police, military and the disaster mitigation agency, combing through land where houses and a sand mine company once stood.
    As the active volcano spews hot air behind him, Dodik, who has no formal training, is constantly reminded of how dangerous his work is.
    Indonesia's volcanology agency on Monday said there was potential for further flows of hot gas, ash and rock.
    Dodik started volunteering as part of a four-wheel drive hobby group helping in a search and rescue operation last December when floods hit Lumajang Regency, where Curah Kobokan is located.
    ""We were inspired to express our loyalty (to the community) through our hobby,"" he said. 
    On Tuesday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited the disaster zone and said at least 2,000 homes would need to be relocated to safer areas.
For Dodik, helping people to find their loved ones is all that matters.
""We must be ready to jump into action,"" he said.

(Reuters) - The imprisonment of former Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi showed that no one was above the law, a senior junta official said on Tuesday, and the country's ruling general had commuted her sentence on ""grounds of humanity"".
Nobel laureate Suu Kyi, 76, was sentenced to four years in prison for incitement and breaching coronavirus regulations, but that was reduced to a two-year term of detention in her current, undisclosed location.
The verdicts were the first in nearly a dozen cases against her that carry combined maximum sentences of more than 100 years in prison. Suu Kyi denies all charges. 
""There is no one above the law,"" Information Minister Maung Maung Ohn said on Tuesday, adding that Myanmar's judicial system ""has no partiality"".
He was speaking at a rare media briefing on Myanmar's economy during which he and the junta's investment minister said the situation was stabilising.
They said preparations were under way for elections to be held before August 2023, but would not confirm whether Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party would be allowed to compete.
The party is under investigation by the election commission, which Maung Maung Ohn said was due to report back early next year.
Myanmar's state media last month announced Suu Kyi would be prosecuted for fraud over the 2020 elections, which were won convincingly by the NLD. 
Myanmar has been in crisis since the military seized power in a Feb. 1 coup, arresting Suu Kyi and most of her government. 
Security forces seeking to crush opposition have since killed more than 1,300 people, according to monitoring group the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, and armed rebellions have sprung up across the country.
'INTERNAL MATTER'
The verdict against Suu Kyi was condemned around the world on Monday. 
But reaction varied among Myanmar's neighbours in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which is leading international diplomatic efforts, demonstrating challenges ahead in pressuring the generals to free detainees and end hostilities. 
Singapore's foreign ministry urged the junta to honour peace commitments with ASEAN and free ""all political detainees including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi"".
A spokesperson for Thailand's prime minister, however, called her sentencing ""an internal matter of Myanmar"". 
The junta's foreign minister met on Tuesday with Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen - ASEAN's chairman next year - but there was no mention of Suu Kyi's verdict in official statements.
The junta has defended its crackdown on pro-democracy forces as necessary to fight ""terrorists"" determined to harm the country and has dismissed international criticism as biased and misguided.
On Sunday, security forces in a truck rammed into a protest, killing at least five people, media reported.

Maung Maung Ohn said the protest was the result of pressure from anti-coup groups ""so that young people get emotional"" but that crowd management by authorities ""is sometimes handled unintentionally"".
""Such kind of protests should be prevented according to the law,"" he said.

Police found two adults, both 40, and three children aged four, eight and 10 dead from gunshot wounds in a family home in Koenigs Wusterhausen south of Berlin on Saturday.
In a farewell note found by police, the man said he forged a vaccination certificate for his wife. Her employer had found out, prompting the couple to fear they would be arrested and lose their children, prosecutor Gernot Bantleon told Reuters.
Police were called to the house after being alerted by witnesses who had seen lifeless bodies in the house, police and prosecutors said on Saturday.

The grisly case comes as Germany has been tightening up restrictions to try to stem a fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic. From last month, employees have been required to show they are vaccinated, recovered or test negative for COVID-19.
German authorities agreed last week to bar the unvaccinated from access to all but the most essential businesses such as grocery stores, pharmacies and bakeries, and they also plan to make vaccination mandatory for some jobs.

Biden and Putin are expected to hold a video conference at around 1500 GMT amid Western fears about a Russian troop build-up near Ukraine. Biden plans to warn Putin of severe economic consequences if Russia invades, U.S. officials said on Monday.
Russia has denied it plans to attack Ukraine. 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Tuesday that Moscow regretted what he called the White House's predictable tendency to resort to sanctions, but said that Putin was ready to hear out Biden's concerns and that the Kremlin leader wanted to set out his own. 

""There's no need to expect any breakthroughs from this conversation. It is a working conversation at a very difficult period,"" Peskov said.
""The escalation of tensions in Europe is off the scale, it is extraordinary, and this requires a personal discussion at the highest level,"" he added.

WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) -U.S. government officials will boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing because of China's human rights ""atrocities"", the White House said on Monday, just weeks after talks aimed at easing tense relations between the two superpowers. 
The diplomatic boycott, which leaves athletes free to travel to Beijing to compete, has been encouraged by some members of Congress and rights advocacy groups for months.
Beijing threatened unspecified ""resolute countermeasures"" against any such move before Monday's announcement, which is certain to further strain relations already at their lowest point in decades.
President Joe Biden's administration highlighted what Washington says is genocide against minority Muslims in China's western region of Xinjiang. China denies all rights abuses.
""U.S. diplomatic or official representation would treat these games as business as usual in the face of the PRC's egregious human rights abuses and atrocities in Xinjiang, and we simply can't do that,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told a daily press briefing, referring to the People's Republic of China.
""The athletes on Team USA have our full support,"" Psaki added. ""We will be behind them 100% as we cheer them on from home."" 
The move comes despite an effort to stabilize ties with a video meeting last month between Biden and China's leader Xi Jinping.
China's embassy in Washington called the boycott ""political manipulation"" that would have no impact on the Games as no invitations had been extended to U.S. politicians.
Russian President Vladimir Putin is the only leader of a major country who has accepted an invitation.
The Chinese Mission to the United Nations said the move ""reflects the Cold War mentality of the United States.""
""The U.S. just wants to politicize sports, create divisions and provoke confrontation,"" a statement from the mission said. ""This approach will find no support and is doomed to fail.""
It was unclear if others would join the United States, although U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had said allies were consulted on a ""shared approach"".
Canada's foreign ministry said it ""remains deeply disturbed by the troubling reports of human rights violations in China"" and is continuing to discuss the matter ""with our partners and allies.""
The Australian and Japanese governments said they were also still considering their positions for the Games, which begin on Feb. 4. 
""We will consider matters such as the meaning of the Olympic Games and our diplomatic relations, and would like to make our own decision based on what is best for our national interest,"" Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters.
New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson said his country would not send government officials but that decision was based largely on COVID-19 concerns and preceded the U.S. boycott. 
""We've made clear to China on numerous occasions our concerns about human rights issues,"" Robertson told reporters, according to state broadcaster TVNZ. 
Stefano Sannino, chief of the European Union's diplomatic service, said last week that boycotts were a matter for individual member states, not common EU foreign policy.
Human rights groups welcomed the move, but said Washington could do more to hold China accountable. 
However, some political analysts said the boycott was less a threat to the Games and more of an optics problem that Beijing fueled by threatening retaliation.
""It would have been a non-story if let alone,"" said Lisa Delpy Neirotti, an associate professor of sport management at the George Washington University School of Business. ""We typically do not send a large government delegation anyway, especially in COVID times.""
George W. Bush was the last U.S. president to attend a Games opening ceremony, as host at Salt Lake City in 2004. Vice President Mike Pence attended the 2018 winter Games in Pyeongchang.
The diplomatic boycott puts corporate Olympic sponsors in ""an awkward spot"" but was less concerning than a full measure barring athletes, said Neal Pilson, a former president of CBS Sports who has overseen Olympics broadcast rights deals.
U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters the government would not dictate private sector practices, but said firms should be ""fully cognizant"" of what is transpiring in Xinjiang.
A spokesperson from Comcast-owned NBCUniversal said it would broadcast the Games as planned. 
POTENTIAL RETALIATION
Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Beijing's options to retaliate included limiting bilateral dialogue, stalling visas, or hamstringing athletic delegations and journalists at the Games.
The United States is due to host the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. 
The International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has faced criticism for turning a blind eye to China's right record, said the Games should be ""beyond politics"".
Sarah Hirshland, chief executive of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, said Team USA was ""excited and ready to make the nation proud.""

Many U.S. athletes argued it would have been unfair to ban them from the Games, and some U.S. lawmakers who supported not sending officials had said it was in U.S. interests for its national anthem to be playing in Beijing as Americans received medals. 
Four-time Olympian Angela Ruggiero greeted the announcement with relief: ""You know, you work all your life to compete and you never want politics to get in the way of that chance.""

(Reuters) - Detectives on Monday questioned an artist linked to the Detroit studio where the parents of a 15-year-old accused Michigan school shooter were arrested after a manhunt, local law enforcement officials said.
Andrzej Sikora, 65, was not arrested after a two-hour interview, the Oakland County Sheriff's Department said in a statement, adding that detectives searched his home and seized several digital devices. 
""The issue for Detectives is what did Sikora know and 
when did he know it,"" the sheriff's department said. 
Ethan Crumbley, 15, was taken into custody last week after a shooting at Oxford High School in suburban Oakland County, some 30 miles (48 km) northwest of Detroit. He is being held without bail and charged as an adult in the attack, the deadliest U.S. school shooting of 2021.
Four students were slain and seven other people, including a teacher, were wounded.
Police, FBI agents and the U.S. Marshals Service began searching for the boy's parents, James Crumbley, 45, and Jennifer Crumbley, 43, after Oakland County prosecutors announced manslaughter charges against the couple. 
They are accused of purchasing the handgun for their son as an early Christmas present and then ignoring warning signs that he was planning a shooting at the high school.
Detroit Police Chief James White told reporters that the couple was found on Saturday hiding in a commercial building on the city's east side, the site of Sikora's art studio. White said they had not broken into the building, but had been let in by someone with access.
An attorney representing Sikora, Clarence Dass, has said that his client ""maintains his innocence throughout this process and is fully cooperating with law enforcement to assist in their investigation.”
The attorney, who has said that Sikora contacted police after the Crumbleys' arrest, was present for his interrogation.

James and Jennifer Crumbley both pleaded not guilty to four counts of involuntary manslaughter at an arraignment on Saturday and were ordered held in lieu of $500,000 bail.
An attorney for the Crumbleys has said the couple were not attempting to flee law enforcement and had planned to turn themselves in.

(Reuters) - The U.S. government on Monday said it failed to prove a crucial witness lied 66 years ago in the lynching death of Black teen Emmett Till in Mississippi, closing without charges its probe into the killing that helped ignite the civil rights movement. 
The Justice Department had reopened its investigation into the case in 2018 after publication of the book ""The Blood of Emmett Till"" by Duke University Professor Timothy Tyson. 
In it, Tyson said Carolyn Bryant Donham, a white woman who testified at a 1955 trial that 14-year-old Till touched her and made sexual advances, had recanted to him in a 2008 interview and said parts of her testimony were not true.
But after looking again at the case, the Justice Department found insufficient evidence to prove that Donham had ""ever told the professor that any part of her testimony was untrue,"" it said on Monday. 
Tyson told Reuters in an email that he was not recording Donham when she recanted but was taking careful notes. He said he stood by his work. Donham could not be located. 
""In closing this matter without prosecution, the government does not take the position that the state court testimony the woman gave in 1955 was truthful or accurate,"" the Justice Department said.
""There remains considerable doubt as to the credibility of her version of events, which is contradicted by others who were with Till at the time, including the account of a living witness."" 
Till, visiting from Chicago, was beaten, shot and mutilated in Money, Mississippi, four days after Donham, then 20, accused him of whistling at her. Later, the woman added the accusation that Till grabbed her waist and made sexual remarks. 
Donham's husband at the time, Roy Bryant, and his half brother, J.W. Milam, were charged with Till's murder, but the two white men were later acquitted of the crime by an all-white jury. 
The pair later confessed in a paid magazine interview to abducting and killing the teenager. The two men have since died, in 1994 and 1981, respectively. 
Till's relatives expressed sadness at the new developments. 

""Even though we do not feel we got justice, we must move forward,"" Ollie Gordon, Till's cousin, said at a news conference in Chicago. ""Let's figure out how we can continue to make a change.""
The decision by Till's mother, Mamie Till Mobley, to hold an open-casket funeral showing her son's tortured body helped launch the civil rights movement. Images of Till's body in his casket were published in Black media outlets at the time but not in the mainstream press.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A woman who says Ghislaine Maxwell groomed her for abuse by late financier Jeffrey Epstein when she was a teenager testified on Monday that she initially looked up to the British socialite, calling her ""everything that I wanted to be.""
The woman, who is testifying under the pseudonym Kate, is the second of four women cited in a 2021 indictment of Maxwell to take the stand at the former Epstein companion's sex abuse trial in Manhattan federal court. The trial began last week and is set to last into January.
Kate said she was 17 and struggling to make friends after moving to Britain from France when she met Maxwell for tea at her London townhouse in 1994. Maxwell offered to introduce Kate to her boyfriend, who she said could help with her aspiring music career, Kate said. 
""She seemed to be everything that I wanted to be,"" said Kate, who is now 44. ""I left there feeling exhilarated and like somebody wanted to be my friend.""
Maxwell later invited her to the house to give her boyfriend - Epstein - a massage, even though she was not a massage therapist, she said. Kate said she had the first of many sexual encounters with Epstein that day. 
Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to eight counts of sex trafficking and other charges. Her lawyers say the memories of the accusers have been corrupted over the decades that have passed since the alleged encounters. 
As Kate was over the age of consent in Britain, U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan instructed the jury that any sexual encounters she described were not ""illegal sex acts."" 
Still, prosecutors can use Kate's testimony to corroborate patterns in Epstein's and Maxwell's behavior that other witnesses have described, including that Maxwell took teenage girls under her wing as a means of ""grooming"" them for Epstein's abuse. 
Kate said she went on to become a musician and a model, and stayed in contact with Maxwell and Epstein for years.
""I was also fearful of disengaging because I had witnessed how connected they both were,"" said Kate, who recalled that Maxwell told her she was friends with Britain's Prince Andrew and U.S. businessman Donald Trump, who went on to become president. 
Neither Trump nor Prince Andrew has been accused of wrongdoing in the case.
Last week, jurors heard from Jane, a woman now in her early 40s who said Epstein began abusing her while she was 14 in 1994.
GREEN HELICOPTER
Maxwell was Epstein's employee responsible for managing his various personal properties at the time of their encounters with Kate. Maxwell and Epstein were romantically involved in the 1990s and remained associates after their relationship broke off.
Maxwell's lawyers say their client is being scapegoated for Epstein's alleged crimes since he is dead. The globetrotting investor killed himself in 2019 at age 66 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges.
Prosecutors have said Maxwell wanted to keep Epstein ""satisfied"" to ""stay in the lifestyle to which she was accustomed."" 
On Monday afternoon, prosecutors displayed bank records showing that Epstein wired Maxwell upward of $30 million in three transactions in 1999, 2002 and 2007. 

In 2007, after receiving $7.4 million from Epstein, Maxwell transferred the funds to an account for a company called Air Ghislaine Inc that then bought a green helicopter, the records show.
Last week, Epstein's personal pilot described taking Maxwell to helicopter pilot training.

SEKENANI, Kenya (Reuters) - When a group arrived at the Sekenani health clinic in rural Kenya for their COVID-19 vaccines recently, staff told them there were no doses left and that they should come back soon.
For some, it meant a long wasted journey on foot and a day away from their cattle herds.
Yet Narok county, where the clinic is located, was not short of vaccines; nearly 14,000 doses were sitting in a fridge in the nearest town, 115 km away. A mix-up with county officials meant Sekenani did not get enough, two health workers said.
""We had to say sorry. It's not a good feeling, when somebody comes and they want the vaccine, and we don't have it,"" clinician Mike Nalakiti, 27, told Reuters.
The small failure in a village 270 km southwest of the capital Nairobi is an illustration of the challenges African nations now face as they battle COVID-19: even though vaccine supplies are finally ramping up, getting needles into arms is proving the hard part.
Successful vaccination campaigns in Africa are vital to ending the pandemic globally, health experts say. The continent's low inoculation rates encourage viral mutations like the new Omicron variant spreading across South Africa, which has prompted another spate of international travel bans.
Only 102 million people, or 7.5% of the continent's population, are fully vaccinated, according to the World Health Organization, which warned vaccine inequity will prolong the pandemic.
African governments have been crying out for higher vaccine deliveries this year, but production constraints and hoarding by richer countries severely limited supplies until recently. 
Shortages of funds, medical staff and equipment, as well as vaccine hesitancy, were already hobbling inoculation campaigns in some parts of Africa. The anticipated surge, comprising millions of jabs in the coming weeks, could expose those weaknesses further, experts warn.
About 40% of vaccines that have arrived so far on the continent have not been used, according to data from the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, a policy think-tank.
The rate of vaccine use will have to rise four-fold to keep up with expected supply in coming months, the institute says.
""We are all, like you, very concerned that countries are not picking up the vaccines. The uptake is not as we would have loved to see,"" head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention John Nkengasong said.
FRIDGES AND MOTORBIKES
Vaccination rates vary widely across Africa, a continent of well over a billion people, and some health systems in relatively small nations and in North Africa are having more success.
Cape Verde, an archipelago nation off West Africa with a population of about 600,000, has vaccinated nearly 65% of adults, rivalling some European countries.
In Democratic Republic of Congo, a restive country in Central Africa with a population of nearly 90 million, the number is 0.1%.
In some ways, Kenya is doing relatively well. East Africa's largest economy has received nearly 5 million doses in the past two weeks after months of slow supplies.
On Dec. 1, it vaccinated a record 110,000 people and aims to maintain that rate for the next 30 days, said Willis Akhwale, head of the government's COVID-19 vaccine task force. That would bring the total vaccinated to 10 million out of a population of 47 million, he said.
Yet in the rural Sekenani clinic at the edge of the famous Maasai Mara Game Reserve, where elephants and lions roam, challenges abound.
The clinic started offering COVID-19 vaccinations four weeks ago. It keeps running out of doses and has only one reliable fridge, which is also used for routine immunisations, said clinical officer Gerald Yiaile.
Staff need motorbikes to take vaccines to the community, semi-nomadic livestock herders from the Maasai ethnic group who struggle to afford transport for healthcare, he said.
He applied to local authorities for funds for mobile vaccination and has not heard back.
""We have been forced to ask the community to come to us instead of us going to them,"" Yiaile said.
NOT ENOUGH MONEY
African nations scrambled to ready their health systems earlier this year as global vaccine-sharing scheme COVAX began delivering doses in small quantities months after wealthy countries began inoculations.
Cash-strapped countries were short of cotton wool, fridges, face masks and trucks.
COVAX deliveries were then disrupted after COVAX's major supplier India vaccine exports. The pause gave countries time to improve vaccination rollout without being inundated. They did so to differing degrees.
The GAVI vaccine alliance, a co-leader of COVAX, initially did not prioritize investing in the ultra-cold chain equipment needed for mRNA shots like  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s because it expected the bulk of doses to be the cheaper and easier-to-administer AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) shots produced in India, Reuters reported in September.
As vaccine deliveries to Africa soar, absorption of large volumes is expected to represent a major challenge for many poor countries, particularly because a substantial volume will be from Pfizer, GAVI said in internal documents prepared for its board meeting last week and seen by Reuters.
Even Kenya, which has the ultra-cold chain capacity to store 3 million Pfizer doses, is worried its cold chain will get constrained by the influx, threatening its routine immunization program, Akhwale said.
Cameroon in Central Africa had 244 vaccination centres at the start of its vaccine rollout in April, and now has 1,000, said Njoh Andreas Ateke, deputy head of the immunisation program.
But health workers and officials say that power outages and lack of staff have compromised vaccines.
The country has one refrigerated truck suitable to transport vaccines, said Leonard Kouadio, UNICEF'S health section head in Cameroon. It needs at least 2,500 more fridge temperature gauges and more trucks to increase distribution, he added.
Mali, one of Africa's largest and poorest countries, has two refrigerated trucks to carry vaccines long distances. Some health workers fled their posts in the north because of insecurity caused by an Islamist insurgency, said UNICEF health program manager in Mali, Abdoul Gadiry Fadiga.
The country expects to receive about 3.5 million doses between now and the end of March, more than double the number it has received since inoculations began, Fadiga said.
Mali has enough cold chain capacity to deal with the initial rush of doses until March, Fadiga added, but it still needs 288 fridges and freezers for its full rollout, only 10 freezers of which had arrived.
Funds have been slow to materialise. The World Bank has approved $9.8 billion for emergency health responses, including for vaccine deployment, in developing countries globally, but so far only $4.4 billion has been disbursed.
Mali and Cameroon await support.
A World Bank official said disbursements were happening ""very fast"".
REACHING OUT
Even when help arrives it can backfire. Donors have sometimes sent African nations vaccine batches nearing expiration, in some cases rendering them unusable.
Countries desperate for vaccines, including South Sudan and Congo, had to send some back because they could not distribute them in time. Namibia warned last month it may have to destroy thousands of out-of-date doses.
South Africa asked Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Pfizer to delay delivery of vaccines because it had too much stock.
A key difficulty in administering vaccines is community skepticism, sometimes driven by religious belief and mistrust of Western drug companies and their own governments. Insufficient education about COVID-19 vaccines enables rumours to spread.
That can be the result of local staff and budget shortages, health workers from across the continent told Reuters.
Ethiopia is worried that vaccines might expire before they are used due to low demand, and is trying to overcome vaccine hesitancy through outreach to communities via local religious and civil society groups, said Muluken Yohannes, a senior adviser to Ethiopia's health ministry.
""Currently, developed countries ... have satisfied their vaccine needs. As a result, they are pushing leftover vaccines ... to developing countries. However, the golden period to absorb these vaccines has already passed,"" he said.
Kenya has ramped up its vaccine rollout with social media and television and radio ads promoting vaccines. Posts on the health ministry Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) feed urge pregnant and breastfeeding mothers to get vaccinated.
Not everyone gets the message. Nicky Theron, 20, who works at a clothing shop in the town of Talek, is five months pregnant and scared of the jab. She doesn't follow any government Twitter accounts.
""I have never heard of anybody who is pregnant receiving the vaccine,"" she said.
Some feel they could be persuaded if someone came to explain in person.
Julius Tuyioto, who herds livestock on arid plains in southern Kenya, hears the government warn of the dangers of COVID-19 on the radio. But the disease hasn't hit his community; he says it doesn't feel real.

""There is no civic education on why we should be vaccinated. No one is telling us,"" Tuyioto told Reuters outside his mud brick home in Narok County, to the chime of goat bells.
Last month, the government sent vaccines by motorbike to the nearest primary school, five kilometres away, he said. But he did not hear about it until the third and final day, when it was too late for him to go.

144,"<span>Dec 06, 2021 10:42AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -A court in military-ruled Myanmar found deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi guilty of charges of incitement and breaching coronavirus restrictions on Monday, drawing international condemnation of what critics described as a ""sham trial"".
Suu Kyi is set to serve two years in detention at an undisclosed location, a sentence reduced from four years after a partial pardon from the country's military chief, state TV reported. 
President Win Myint was also initially sentenced to four years as the court delivered its first verdicts in numerous cases against Suu Kyi, who led the former civilian government in the role of state counsellor, and other leaders ousted by the military in a coup on Feb. 1.
Myanmar has been in turmoil since the coup against Suu Kyi's democratically elected government led to widespread protests and raised international concern about the end of tentative political reforms following decades of military rule.
Suu Kyi's supporters say the cases against her are baseless and designed to end her political career and tie her up in legal proceedings while the military consolidates power.
Her conviction had been widely expected in Myanmar. Demonstrators in the largest city, Yangon, risked arrest to stage a flash protest following the verdict on Monday. Images seen by Reuters show a small group giving three-fingered salutes that signal opposition to the junta.
Nobel Peace Prize winner Suu Kyi, 76, has been detained since the coup, along with most senior leaders of her National League for Democracy (NLD) party. Others are abroad or in hiding.
""The conviction of the State Counsellor following a sham trial in secretive proceedings before a military-controlled court is nothing but politically motivated,"" U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said in comments echoed by the European Union and others.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the conviction was ""unjust"" and called for the release of Suu Kyi and other detained elected officials.
A military spokesman did not respond to attempts by Reuters to reach him for comment on the sentencing, which was widely reported in domestic media.
The military has not given details of where Suu Kyi - who spent years under house arrest due to her opposition to military rule before becoming Myanmar's leader - is being detained. 
She is due to remain at that location to serve her sentence, MRTV reported, suggesting she will not be sent to prison.
CLOSED TRIAL
The trial in the capital Naypyitaw has been closed to the media and the junta's public information outlets have not mentioned the proceedings. Suu Kyi's lawyers have been barred from communicating with the media and public.
Suu Kyi faces a dozen cases that include multiple corruption charges plus violations of a state secrets act, a telecoms law and COVID-19 regulations, which carry combined maximum sentences of more than a century in prison.
Suu Kyi and co-defendant Win Myint received terms of two years for incitement and the same term for breaches of coronavirus protocols, before state media announced that both had their terms halved in a pardon. They had denied the charges.
Western countries have demanded Suu Kyi's release and criticised the violence since the coup in which some 1,300 people have been killed, according to rights groups.
Liz Truss, the foreign minister of former colonial power Britain, said Suu Kyi's sentencing was ""another appalling attempt by Myanmar’s military regime to stifle opposition and suppress freedom and democracy"".
The European Union's top diplomat condemned the verdict as ""politically motivated"" and called for the immediate release of all political prisoners in Myanmar.
China, which has long had good relations with the military as well as Suu Kyi's government, urged all parties to ""bridge their differences"", while Japan, a major investor in Myanmar, said the verdict was an ""unfavourable development"".
Dr. Sasa, a spokesperson for Myanmar's shadow civilian government set up following the coup, called on the international community to step up sanctions against Myanmar's military rulers.
In a rare statement of condemnation, the chair of Norway's Nobel Prize awards committee, Berit Reiss-Andersen, said the legal process had ""low credibility' and the conviction was part of the military's suppression of the opposition.
The United States, EU and others issued a flurry of sanctions against senior military leaders and military-linked firms following the coup, but have stopped short of targeting offshore gas projects that activists say are a financial lifeline for the junta.

Mark Farmaner, head of pressure group Burma Campaign UK, said Monday's verdict should prompt more action.
""Governments making statements condemning the sentencing of Aung San Suu Kyi should ask themselves, are they doing everything they can to help free political prisoners in Myanmar? I can guarantee the answer is no,"" he said.
 
"
145,"<span>Dec 06, 2021 10:12AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Put on trial by the generals who overthrew her elected government in a coup that cut short democratic reforms she had fought for decades to bring about, Myanmar's ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi was sentenced on Monday to four years in prison.
The 76-year-old's sentence was later reduced to two years' detention in an undisclosed location after she was convicted of incitement and violations of a law on natural disasters in the first verdicts in more than a dozen criminal cases filed against her since the Feb. 1 military takeover. 
Just 14 months before the coup, she had travelled to the U.N. International Court of Justice in the Hague to defend those same generals against charges of genocide over a 2017 military offensive that drove ethnic Rohingya Muslims out of Myanmar.
Suu Kyi's long struggle for democracy made her a heroine in predominantly Buddhist Myanmar, and the mostly Western criticism she faced over the plight of the Rohingya had no negative impact on her popularity at home.
Known as ""the Lady"", Suu Kyi had fulfilled the dreams of millions when her party first won a landslide election in 2015 that established Myanmar's first civilian government in half a century.
She spent 15 years under house arrest in the struggle for democracy, but her administration had to cohabit with the generals who retained control of defence and security.
That hybrid government failed to unite Myanmar's many ethnic groups or end its decades-long civil wars, and Suu Kyi also oversaw tightening restrictions on the press and civil society while falling out with some former allies.
But her second election victory in November unnerved the military - and it seized power on Feb. 1, alleging voter fraud by her National League for Democracy party despite rejection of the army's claims by the election commission and monitors.
The first criminal cases filed against Suu Kyi included breaching coronavirus restrictions and possession of unlicensed walkie-talkies.
More serious charges were to follow, including incitement, corruption and breaching the Official Secrets Act. She now faces a dozen cases with combined maximum sentences of more 100 years.
Protesters have taken to the streets in her name, calling for the release of ""Mother Suu"" despite hundreds of killings and thousands of detentions since the coup.
LADY BY THE LAKE
The daughter of independence hero Aung San, who was assassinated in 1947 when she was 2 years old, Suu Kyi spent much of her young life overseas. She attended Oxford University, met her husband, the British academic Michael Aris, and had two sons.
Before they married, she asked Aris to promise he would not stop her if she needed to return home. In 1988, she got the phone call that changed their lives: her mother was dying.
In the capital Yangon, then known as Rangoon, she was swept up in a student-led revolution against the then junta that had plunged the country into a ruinous isolation.
An eloquent public speaker, Suu Kyi became the leader of the new movement, quoting her father’s dream to ""build up a free Burma"".
The revolution was crushed, its leaders killed and jailed, and Suu Kyi was confined to her lakeside home. Speaking her name in public could earn her supporters a prison sentence, so they called her ""the Lady"".
Slightly built and soft-spoken, she played a crucial role in keeping world attention on Myanmar’s junta and its human rights record, winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.
Aris died in 1997, but she did not attend his funeral, fearful she would not be allowed to return.
During a brief release from house arrest in 1998 she attempted to travel outside Yangon to visit supporters and was blocked by the army. She sat inside her van for several days and nights, despite dehydration in the sweltering heat, and was said to have caught rainwater in an open umbrella.
She survived an assassination attempt in 2003 when pro-military men wielding spikes and rods attacked a convoy she was travelling in, killing and wounding some of her supporters.
The army again placed her under house arrest and from behind the gates, she gave weekly addresses to supporters, standing on rickety tables and talking about democracy under the watchful eyes of police.
A devout Buddhist, she sometimes spoke of her struggle in spiritual terms.
In 2010, the military began a series of democratic reforms and Suu Kyi was released before thousands of weeping, cheering supporters.
In the West, she was feted. Barack Obama became the first U.S president to visit Myanmar in 2012, calling her an ""inspiration to people all around the world, including myself"". U.S economic sanctions on Myanmar were eased, though Suu Kyi remained cautious about the extent of reforms.
But the Western optimism generated by Suu Kyi's 2015 election win evaporated two years later, when Rohingya militants attacked security forces and the military responded with an offensive that eventually expelled more than 730,000 Rohingya from Myanmar.

U.N. investigators in an August 2018 report said the Myanmar military had carried out killings and mass rape.
In December 2019, Suu Kyi defended the military operation before the U.N. International Court of Justice, describing it as a counterterrorism response and asking the court to dismiss a genocide accusation brought by Gambia.

GUWAHATI, India (Reuters) -Protesters threw stones and set fire to areas around a camp belonging to Indian forces in the remote northeast, with one civilian shot dead in renewed violence a day after 14 people were killed by defence forces, officials said.
At least 14 civilians and one member of the security forces were killed in Nagaland state on Saturday night, after Indian forces mistook a group of labourers for militants and opened fire.
More than a dozen civilians and some members of the security forces were also wounded in the incident and violence that followed, said a federal defence ministry official based in New Delhi.
Indian Home Minister Amit Shah said he was ""anguished"" at the news of civilians, who were members of a local tribal group, being killed.
Nagaland's chief minister Neiphiu Rio told Reuters an investigation would be conducted and the guilty punished. He said the incident was the result of an intelligence failure.
India's northeast is home to a complex web of tribal groups, many of which have launched insurgencies, accusing New Delhi of plundering resources and doing little to improve their lives.
People in Nagaland have frequently accused security forces of wrongly targeting innocent locals in their counterinsurgency operations against rebel groups. 
On Sunday, civilians launched protests against the government in the Mon district of Nagaland, where the 14 tribal people were killed. 
""There is a mob outside which is pelting stones,"" a security official who did not want to be named told Reuters from the camp, which was surrounded by protesters.
""One civilian was shot dead and two more injured in firing by Assam Rifles a short while ago in Mon town,"" Noklem Konyak, president of the Konyak Students Union, told Reuters by telephone.
Konyak is the dominant tribe in Mon district.
Indian military and government officials were not immediately available to comment on the latest killing.
'CRUDE WEAPONS'
Saturday's incident took place in and around Oting village in Mon district, bordering Myanmar, during a counterinsurgency operation conducted by members of the Assam Rifles, the country's oldest paramilitary force, said a senior police official based in Nagaland.
Firing began when a truck carrying 30 or more coal mine labourers were passing the Assam Rifles camp.
""The troopers had intelligence inputs about some militant movement in the area and on seeing the truck they mistook the miners to be rebels and opened fire killing six labourers,"" the senior police official told Reuters, requesting anonymity. 
""After the news of firing spread in the village, hundreds of tribal people surrounded the camp. They burnt Assam Rifles vehicles and clashed with the troopers using crude weapons,"" he said.
Members of the Assam Rifles retaliated, and in the second attack eight more civilians and a security force member were killed, the official said.
The Naga Mothers' Association (NMA), an influential rights' group in Nagaland, appealed to all Naga tribes to mourn the loss of civilian lives and demanded that the Indian army's cantonments should be shifted out of civilian areas. 
""Let the world know our grief and sorrow and may our voices of protest be heard against the continuing militarisation and killings under the Armed Forces Powers Act,"" said Abeiu Meru, the president of NMA.
The Act gives armed forces sweeping powers to search and arrest, and to open fire if they deem it necessary for the maintenance of public order in parts of the country they declared as ""disturbed areas"". 
Some parts of Nagaland were given that designation by the federal government last year.
Police and local government officials have intensified vigilance and patrolling across the border state ahead of final rites for the dead scheduled on Monday. 
In recent years India has tried to persuade Myanmar to evict rebels from bases in the thick jungles of the unfenced region, which borders Nagaland, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh.

Earlier on Monday, a court in Myanmar found Suu Kyi, ousted in a Feb. 1 coup, guilty of charges of incitement and breaching coronavirus restrictions, drawing international outrage at what some critics described as a ""sham trial"".

President Win Myint was sentenced to four years' detention, Myanmar's state-run broadcaster MRTV reported.
Both Suu Kyi and Win Myint will serve their sentences where they are currently being detained, an undisclosed location, suggesting they will not be sent to prison.

SUMBERWULUH, Indonesia (Reuters) - An Indonesian volcano was active again on Monday, spewing out hot clouds of ash, two days after a powerful eruption killed at least 22 people and left dozens missing.
Mt. Semeru, the tallest mountain on the island of Java, erupted dramatically on Saturday, shooting a towering column of ash into the sky that blanketed surrounding villages.
Aerial footage showed roofs jutting out of an ashen landscape, while on the ground, military officers, police and residents dug through mud with their hands to pull out victims.
The death toll had risen to 22 by Monday, while 27 were missing, Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency said. 
The volcano erupted again on Monday, Indonesia's Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation confirmed via its Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account, warning of continued seismic activity. 
""Semeru is one of the most active volcanoes in Indonesia. Before and after the December 4 eruption, it will continue to be active,"" Liswanto, the head of the Semeru Volcano Observatory, told Reuters.
Some residents returned to their homes to check on belongings and livestock, but Liswanto urged people to keep a safe distance.
""People need to be more vigilant because the potential threat is still there,"" he added.
In the Sumberwuluh area, rescue teams battled poor weather to retrieve victims from the rubble.
""The main obstacle is the weather... Hopefully the weather going forward will be good enough to make it easier for us to search,"" Wuryanto, operations director of the national search and rescue agency (Basarnas), told reporters. 
People have posted photos of missing loved ones on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), with pleas for any information about their whereabouts.
Complicating logistics and rescue efforts, lava flows from Saturday's eruption destroyed a bridge connecting two areas in the district of Lumajang with the city of Malang.

Public kitchens and health facilities have been set up for more than 1,700 people who have been displaced. 
Semeru is one of more than 100 active volcanoes in Indonesia, a country that straddles the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of high seismic activity that rests atop multiple tectonic plates.

149,"<span>Dec 06, 2021 07:51AM ET</span>",,,,,,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Chief ministers of two Indian border states on Monday called for the withdrawal of a law that gives armed forces special powers to operate in some northeastern regions affected by insurgencies.
The push to repeal the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958, known as the AFSPA, came after Indian security forces killed 13 civilians in Nagaland on Saturday in an apparent case of mistaken identity.
WHAT IS THE AFSPA?
Enacted by the Indian parliament in 1958, the AFSPA was initially drawn up to support armed forces trying to maintain order in any part of the northeastern states of Assam and Manipur designated as a ""disturbed area"".
By the late 1980s, the law was expanded to include seven northeastern states. The AFSPA remains operational in four states, including Nagaland, according to the home ministry.
A similar law is also in force in the disputed northern region of Jammu and Kashmir, where an armed insurgency against New Delhi has raged since the 1990s.
WHAT DOES THE AFSPA INCLUDE?
Once government authorities declare any part as a ""disturbed area"", the AFSPA permits armed forces personnel above a certain rank to use force after due warning ""even to the causing of death"".
The law allows the personnel to make arrests, including on the basis of reasonable suspicion, and enter and search any premises - both without warrant. 
It includes a provision to destroy structures from which armed attacks are made or are likely to be made, or ones that can be utilised by potential offenders.
The AFSPA also provides protection to any personnel acting under its purview, stating that ""no prosecution, suit or other legal proceeding shall be instituted, except with the previous sanction of the central government.""
WHY IS THE LAW CONTROVERSIAL?
For years, human rights activists and groups have said that the AFSPA has led to human rights violations, while allowing members of the armed forces to operate with impunity.
""The Act has been at the heart of concerns about human rights violations in the region, such as arbitrary killings, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and enforced disappearances,"" the Hong Kong-based Asian Human Rights Commission said in 2011.
In a 2008 report, advocacy group Human Rights Watch said the AFSPA violates provisions of international human rights law, including the right to life, the right to be protected from arbitrary arrest and detention.
Indian authorities have maintained that the law is required to help contain armed insurrections. 
WHO HAS OPPOSED THE LAW?
Sustained campaigns against the AFSPA have been held in India's northeast, including notably a 16-year-old hunger strike by human rights activist Irom Sharmila in Manipur, which borders Nagaland.
Sharmila started her protest in 2000 after 10 civilians were killed in Manipur by security forces.
On Monday, chief ministers of Nagaland and nearby Meghalaya called for the scrapping of the AFSPA.

""Today the whole world is criticising AFSPA and now the Nagaland government wants AFSPA to be withdrawn,"" Nagaland Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio said.
In a tweet, Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma said, ""AFSPA should be repealed"".

150,"<span>Dec 06, 2021 07:46AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin will speak by video link on Tuesday. Since their Geneva summit in June, the list of contentious issues between their two countries has lengthened. Here's a quick summary.
UKRAINE AND POSSIBLE WESTERN SANCTIONS
The United States has warned Russia it will face ""severe costs"" including high-impact economic sanctions if it invades Ukraine, which says more than 94,000 Russian troops have gathered within reach of its border. Washington has urged a return to accords signed in Minsk in 2014 and 2015 that were designed to end a war between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists in the east of Ukraine that has now dragged on for seven years.
RUSSIA'S DEMAND FOR SECURITY GUARANTEES FROM NATO
Russia says its troop deployments are a response to aggressive behaviour by NATO and Ukraine, including U.S. strategic bomber flights and warship manoeuvres in the Black Sea. It is demanding legally binding security guarantees from the West that NATO will not expand further eastwards - which would prevent Ukraine becoming a member - or deploy missiles in Ukraine that would target Russia. The United States says no country can veto Ukraine's NATO aspirations. 
BELARUS
The United States has accused Russia's ally Belarus of ""weaponising"" migrants from the Middle East by encouraging thousands of them to try to enter the European Union from its territory, creating a crisis for the EU. Russia has backed Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko, including by sending nuclear-capable warplanes to patrol Belarusian airspace.
ENERGY
The United States has said Russia could and should do more to ease an energy crunch in Europe by increasing gas supplies, and warned it not to use energy as a political weapon, particularly against Ukraine. It has imposed sanctions against Russian entities involved in Nord Stream 2, a newly built gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea. Nord Stream 2 is awaiting approval from a German regulator before Russia can start pumping gas through it, so would be potentially vulnerable to further Western sanctions if the Ukraine crisis escalated.
EMBASSIES DISPUTE
Russia and the United States have shrunk the size of each other's embassies in a series of tit-for-tat moves. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov suggested on Dec. 2 that this was one area where the two countries could seek to draw a line and start afresh by removing limits on representation.
CYBERATTACKS
The United States has accused hackers working for the Russian government or from Russian territory of mounting cyber attacks against U.S. political parties, companies and critical infrastructure. Russia denies carrying out or tolerating cyberattacks. Biden raised the issue with Putin in June and listed 16 critical areas he said should be ""off-limits"" to cyberattacks, but the two sides have not publicly signalled any progress on the issue since then. 
ARMS CONTROL
Soon after Biden took office, the two countries extended a key agreement limiting the size of their strategic nuclear arsenals. In Geneva they promised ""to lay the groundwork for future arms control and risk reduction measures"" and Biden said it would take six months to a year to find out whether a meaningful strategic dialogue was possible. So far there have been no obvious signs of progress. 
NAVALNY
Washington has criticised the imprisonment of Alexei Navalny, Putin's most prominent political opponent, and may restate its concerns over human rights in Russia.
JAILED AMERICANS
The U.S. side has repeatedly raised the cases of two former Marines, Trevor Reed and Paul Whelan, who have been jailed in Russia on what it regards as false charges.

INTERNATIONAL ISSUES
The two countries are at odds over various issues including Syria, where Russia intervened militarily in 2015 to prop up President Bashar al Assad in a civil war. But U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week there were also areas where they could work together, despite their tensions. He mentioned international efforts to stop Iran acquiring nuclear weapons, and the peace process between former Soviet republics Armenia and Azerbaijan, in which Moscow has taken the leading role.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada's tight labor market is forcing many companies to offer regular COVID-19 testing over vaccine mandates, while others are reversing previously announced inoculation requirements even as Omicron variant cases rise.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government adopted one of the strictest inoculation policies in the world for civil servants and has already put more than 1,000 workers on unpaid leave, with thousands more at risk.
Airlines, police forces, school boards and even Canada's Big Five banks https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canadas-major-banks-require-employees-entering-premises-be-vaccinated-2021-08-20 have also pledged strict mandatory vaccine policies. But following through has proven less straightforward, especially as employers grapple with staffing shortages and workers demand exemptions.
Job vacancies in Canada have doubled so far this year, official data shows, and vaccine mandates can make filling those jobs harder, potentially putting upward pressure on wages. That could fuel inflation https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canadas-annual-inflation-rate-hits-47-oct-highest-since-feb-2003-2021-11-17, already running at a near two-decade high.
""It's already difficult to find staff, let alone putting in a vaccine mandate. You'd cut out potentially another 20%"" of potential workers, said Dan Kelly, chief executive of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.
There are pitfalls to employing the unvaccinated. Companies run a higher risk of COVID-19 outbreaks and many vaccinated employees are uncomfortable working with those who have not had the jab, said industry groups and marketing experts.
At Luda Foods, a Montreal-based soup and sauce maker, president Robert Eiser said he has 14 open jobs, no vaccine mandate and no plans to restrict new hires to the vaccinated.
""I don't know that I want to reduce the (labor) pool, which is already quite low,"" said Eiser. ""We need to attract people to meet the demand. If we don't, our competitors will.""
Data released on Friday underpinned Canada's tight labor market, with a hefty 153,700 jobs https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/canada-posts-hefty-job-gains-outlook-clouded-by-omicron-variant-2021-12-03 added in November. It also showed a growing mismatch between available workers and unfilled jobs. And job postings are far above pre-pandemic levels.
WALKING BACK
The province of Quebec backtracked on a vaccine mandates for healthcare workers last month, saying they could not afford to lose thousands of unvaccinated staff. Ontario, which was also eyeing a mandate, said it would not go ahead.
Toronto-Dominion Bank and Bank of Montreal have both softened their vaccine policy to allow regular testing for workers who missed their Oct. 31 inoculation deadline.
In Canada, 86% of adults are fully inoculated, though that drops under 80% among 18-40 year olds. At least 15 cases of the new Omicron https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/canada-has-reported-total-11-cases-omicron-variant-health-official-2021-12-03 variant in Canada have been reported in the past week.
John Cappelli, vice president of onsite managed services in Canada for global recruitment firm  Adecco  (SIX:ADEN), said half of his clients are mandating vaccines with the other half allowing regular testing for the unvaccinated.
But he expects the Omicron variant will prompt more workplaces to get strict on vaccination, even as they grapple with the tightest job market he's seen in his 25-year career.
""We are now starting to see our first workplace (COVID-19) cases in five months,"" he said.
The number of Canadian job postings on search website Indeed mentioning vaccine requirements has quadrupled since August.
In the hard-hit manufacturing sector, where 77% of firms say their top concern is attracting and retaining workers, vaccine mandates are more rare.
Dennis Darby, CEO of Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, said most of Canada's factories have operated safely throughout the pandemic. While CME encourages vaccination, ""some companies are still using rapid testing if somebody doesn't want to get vaccinated,"" he added.

But companies risk a hit to their reputation if they are overt in efforts to tap into the unvaccinated as a labor pool, said Wojtek Dabrowski, managing partner at Provident Communications. 
""If you go out and say, 'We are intentionally seeking to hire unvaccinated people,' many customers are equating that with you being anti-science and anti-safety,"" said Dabrowski.

The possibility of Islamist militants in Afghanistan infiltrating Tajikistan and other former Soviet republics in Central Asia is a worry for Moscow, which views the region as a defensive buffer to its south.
Russian forces on Monday practiced repelling an enemy aerial attack on military facilities using its S-300PS systems, the Interfax news agency cited the Defence Ministry as saying. 
The base in ex-Soviet Tajikistan, Russia's largest outside its own borders, simulated 10 missile launches against aerial targets as part of the drills, the ministry said. 

""A batch of 30 upgraded T-72B3M tanks with improved combat characteristics will arrive to rearm the 201st Russian military base stationed in Tajikistan on Dec. 6,"" it was quoted as saying.
Russia held large-scale joint military exercises with its allies near the Tajik-Afghan border in October after the United States and its allies withdrew troops from Afghanistan and the Taliban swept to power.

JAKARTA/KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is due to visit Indonesia and Malaysia next week as the Biden administration ramps up engagement in Southeast Asia, a bloc it sees as central to its efforts to counter China's growing influence. 
I Gede Ngurah Swajaya, Indonesia's director general for American and European Affairs, told reporters on Monday that Blinken will visit Jakarta on Dec. 13-14, the third and most senior U.S. official to visit the region in two months.
Two Southeast Asian diplomatic sources, who requested anonymity, said Blinken was also expected to visit Malaysia on Dec. 14-15 in his maiden trip to the region. 
During his Indonesia leg, Blinken is due to deliver a speech on health, investment, and infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific, Ngurah said. Blinken will also participate virtually in the Bali Democracy Forum on Dec. 9.
It was not immediately clear whether Blinken will be visiting other countries in the region. A U.S. embassy spokesman in Jakarta declined to comment.

154,"<span>Dec 06, 2021 02:05AM ET</span>","JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) -South Africa is preparing its hospitals for more admissions, as the Omicron coronavirus variant pushes the country into a fourth wave of COVID-19 cases, President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Monday.
Omicron was first detected in southern Africa last month and has triggered global alarm as governments fear another surge in infections.
South Africa's daily infections surged last week to more than 16,000 on Friday from roughly 2,300 on Monday.
Ramaphosa said in a weekly newsletter that Omicron appeared to be dominating new cases in most of the country's nine provinces and urged more people to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
""South Africa now has sufficient supplies of vaccines, ... vaccination is essential for our economic recovery because as more people are vaccinated more areas of economic activity will be opened up,"" he said.
The government would soon convene the National Coronavirus Command Council to review the state of the pandemic and decide whether further measures are needed to keep people safe, Ramaphosa said.
Scientists in South Africa and other countries are racing to establish whether Omicron is more contagious, causes more severe disease and is more resistant to existing vaccines. 

But some anecdotal accounts from doctors and experts in South Africa are reassuring, suggesting that many infections it causes are mild.
""We are keeping a close eye on the rates of infection and hospitalisation,"" Ramaphosa said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union states spent nearly 200 billion euros ($225 billion) on defence in 2020, the most since records began in 2006, but joint investment by governments fell, the European Defence Agency (EDA) said in a report on Monday.
The EDA, an EU agency that helps the bloc's governments to develop their military capabilities, said the total spending of EU countries except for Denmark - which opts out of EU military projects - reached $198 billion, a 5% increase on 2019.
The defence expenditure amounted to 1.5% of the 26 EU states' economic output, a welcome figure for the U.S.-led NATO alliance, which has sought a 2% spending goal for its allies. Most EU members are also part of NATO but want to able to act independently of the United States when necessary.
Proponents of stronger EU defence say the warnings have been many, from Britain's departure from the bloc to former U.S. President Donald Trump's ""America First"" priorities and failing states on Europe's frontiers.
However, the EDA report noted a slump in collaborative spending despite an EU defence pact signed in late 2017 to try to pool resources and end the competition between national industries that has weakened past defence efforts.
""The downward trend on European collaborative spending is particularly concerning,"" EDA Chief Executive Jiri Sedivy said in the report, which found a 13% decrease in joint equipment procurement compared to 2019, to 4.1 billion euros, the third-lowest value recorded by the agency. 
When buying equipment last year, EU governments mainly did deals on their own, falling well short of a commitment made in their 2017 pact to ensure that slightly more than a third of such procurement is done jointly with other Union members.

While the EU has also launched a joint weapons fund, is working on 60 joint military projects and aims to agree a new rapid-reaction force, investment in defence research and technology also remains disjointed and lacking collaboration, the EDA said.

Photographs and videos posted on social media showed a speeding vehicle crashing through a group of anti-coup protesters on Sunday in the main city of Yangon and bodies lying on the road. Witnesses told Reuters dozens had been injured. 
""Those responsible for the use of excessive and disproportionate use of force against unarmed civilians must be held to account,"" Ramanathan Balakrishnan, the U.N resident coordinator in Myanmar, said in a statement.
The Myanmar Now news portal said the incident occurred minutes after a ""flash mob"" of people protesting against a Feb. 1 military coup had formed. As well as at least five deaths, 15 had also been arrested, it said.
The state-run Global New light of Myanmar newspaper said security forces dispersed an ""unlawful riot"" and arrested eight protesters. It said three people had been injured but did not mention any deaths and said those arrested would face legal action. 
The U.S embassy said in a statement it was ""horrified by reports that security forces opened fire against, ran over, and killed several peaceful protesters"".
Anti-military protests have not stopped despite the killing of more than 1,300 people since the February overthrow of an elected government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and the return of military rule.
One of the protesters on Sunday said he had fallen after being hit by a vehicle before fleeing. 
""A soldier beat me with his rifle but I defended and pushed him back. Then he immediately shot at me as I ran away in a zig-zag pattern,"" the protester, who declined to be identified for security reasons, told Reuters by telephone.
The car occupied by soldiers hit the mob from behind, two witnesses said. Soldiers chased the scattering protesters arresting and beating some. 
Some were hurt with head wounds and left unconscious, according to the witnesses. 
A military spokesman did not respond to attempts by Reuters to reach him for comment on the incident.
Previously, the military has said protesters who have been killed instigated violence. It says it staged the coup because an election in November last year won by Suu Kyi's party was rigged. 

The election commission at the time dismissed the assertion.
Suu Kyi, 76, faces a dozen legal cases against her including incitement and violations of COVID-19 protocols. Her supporters say the charges are politically motivated.

CANBERRA (Reuters) - A chaotic parliament session has left Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison seeking a reset as his conservative coalition trails in opinion polls and infighting derails his legislative agenda less than six months before an election.
Morrison had planned to use the last sitting of 2021 to pass bills that would create sharp differences with the opposition Labor Party, including a controversial religious freedom bill that was promised after same-sex marriage became law.
Instead, the final two weeks of parliament saw his coalition fractured, as his own lawmakers crossed the floor to vote against the government, forcing a delay to the religious freedom bill and other legislation, possibly until after the election.
""The events of the past few days have shown the government may be effectively unable to govern until the next election,"" said Haydon Manning, a professor of political science at Flinders University in South Australia. 
""It can't pass legislation and the prime minister will have to decide whether to wait or call an early election.""
With little time left for Morrison to reverse his fortunes, as he has to go to the polls by May 2022, the prime minister has embarked on a series of unofficial campaign events.
It is not a new situation for Morrison - three years ago he had just become prime minister after his predecessor was rolled in a party-room vote and he was trailing in polls. Yet he secured a stunning election win in May 2019.
On Monday the closely watched Newspoll showed Morrison's coalition government would lose office to Labor. That, and a budget scheduled for late March, suggest Morrison will leave his run as late as possible, just as he did in 2019.
QUESTIONS OF INTEGRITY
The divisions in Morrison's government over issues such as the religious freedom bill and climate policy came despite his calls for unity.
He warned his backbench lawmakers last week that fractures would cost the election, a source familiar with his comments in meeting of his ruling Liberal Party said.
Morrison is also struggling to appeal to female voters, polls show. The government was damaged after allegations this year of a rape in parliament house, fed by criticism of how senior government lawmakers handled the complaint. 
Spurred by public anger, Morrison commissioned a report into the workplace culture of parliament house. Published last week, it showed that one in three of those working there had experienced sexual harassment.
The issue grew when the minister for education stood aside last week pending an investigation into allegations of abusive behaviour during an extramarital affair with a staffer, accusations the minister strongly denied. 
Morrison has also been wounded by attacks on his integrity after French President Emmanuel Macron said the prime minister had lied to him over a cancelled submarine deal.
Labor used parliament to repeatedly raise questions of Morrison's credibility and trustworthiness, and the issue seems to have gained some traction with voters. [L4N2RR0V1]

Morrison concedes he is the underdog in the election, but government sources say the he is confident he can repeat the miracle win of 2019.
""He is a good campaigner, he does have that everyman feel to him, and people like him in key parts of the country,"" said Peter Chen, a professor of political science at the University of Sydney. ""He can definitely turn this around.""

(Reuters) - Detectives plan to interview an artist connected to the Detroit studio where the parents of a 15-year-old accused Michigan school shooter were found following a manhunt, a local sheriff said on Sunday.
Andrzej Sikora, 65, will be questioned to determine what role, if any, he had in the disappearance of James and Jennifer Crumbley, Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard said in a written statement. 
“We will vigorously investigate the totality of the situation so a determination can be made if there is any criminality or obstruction of justice involved,” Bouchard said. “Our findings will be presented to the prosecutor.”
An attorney representing Sikora, Clarence Dass, said in a statement to the Detroit Free Press that his client ""maintains his innocence throughout this process and is fully cooperating with law enforcement to assist in their investigation.”
Ethan Crumbley, 15, was taken into custody on Tuesday following the shooting rampage at Oxford High School in suburban Oakland County, some 30 miles (48 km) northwest of Detroit. He is being held without bail and charged as an adult in the attack, the deadliest U.S. school shooting of 2021 https://www.reuters.com/world/us/deadly-michigan-school-shooting-baffles-police-young-suspect-keeps-silent-2021-12-01.
Four students were slain and seven other people, including a teacher, were wounded.
Police, FBI agents and the U.S. Marshals Service began searching for James Crumbley, 45, and Jennifer Crumbley, 43, after Oakland County prosecutors announced manslaughter charges against the couple. 
They are accused of purchasing the handgun for their teenage son as an early Christmas present and then ignoring warning signs that he was planning a mass shooting at the high school.
Detroit Police Chief James White told reporters early on Saturday that the couple had been found hiding in a commercial building on the city's east side, the site of Sikora's art studio. White said they had not broken into the building, but had been let in by someone with access.
Dass said Sikora contacted the Oakland County Sheriff's Office following the Crumbleys' arrest.
“Mr. Sikora has not been charged with any crime. Nevertheless, upon learning of the Crumbleys’ arrest on December 4, 2021, he voluntarily contacted the Detroit Police Department and Oakland County Sheriff’s Office to provide information,"" Dass said in his written statement to the Free Press.
James and Jennifer Crumbley both pleaded not guilty to four counts of involuntary manslaughter at an arraignment on Saturday and were ordered held in lieu of $500,000 bail.

An attorney for the Crumbleys has said the couple were not attempting to flee law enforcement and had planned to turn themselves in.
A 14-year-old student wounded in the attack was released from a hospital on Sunday. One student remains hospitalized, listed in stable condition.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Julio Borges, who serves as foreign minister for Venezuela's U.S.-backed interim government, said on Sunday he would leave his post, further weakening the opposition just weeks after it was routed in regional elections.
The United States and dozens of other countries recognize the interim government, led by Juan Guaido and formed at the beginning of 2019, and consider the 2018 re-election of socialist President Nicolas Maduro to be fraudulent.
The interim government is not serving its purpose, Borges, whose differences with Guaido are well-known, said in an online news conference.
""The (interim) government makes sense as an instrument to get out of the dictatorship. But at this moment, in our way of seeing it, the interim government has been damaged,"" Borges said.
""Instead of being an instrument to fight the dictatorship, the interim government has become a kind of ... caste,"" he said.
Borges lives in Bogota, the capital of neighboring Colombia, where he was granted political asylum after Maduro's government accused him of being part of a plot against the president.
He is a member of the First Justice party, one of the four major opposition parties and part of Guaido's coalition in the national assembly.
Neither First Justice nor Guaido's office immediately responded to requests for comment.
Borges said he would make his resignation official during a legislative session on Tuesday and that the interim government should ""disappear.""
It should only serve to manage foreign-based state assets like U.S.-based refiner Citgo Petroleum Corp, and its political structure must be rejigged, he added.
Internal divisions and delayed alliance agreements among opposition parties are seen by analysts and some members of the opposition as one of the causes of losses in local and regional elections in November, when the opposition won just three of 23 governorships.
Maduro said on state television that former Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza would be the ruling party's candidate for a January rerun of the gubernatorial election in Barinas state.

The Supreme Court of Justice ordered a new vote because of a close race and disqualified opposition candidate Freddy Superlano, citing pending administrative investigations against him.
The opposition is backing Superlano's wife, Aurora Silva.

SUMBERWULUH, Indonesia (Reuters) -The eruption of Semeru volcano has killed at least 14 people and injured dozens on Java island, Indonesia's disaster agency said on Sunday, as rescue teams searched for victims under layers of ash, sometimes digging with their bare hands. 
Semeru, the tallest mountain on Java, threw up towers of ash and hot clouds on Saturday that blanketed nearby villages in East Java province and sent people fleeing in panic.
The eruption destroyed buildings and severed a strategic bridge connecting two areas in the nearby district of Lumajang with the city of Malang, authorities said. 
A BNPB official said in a news conference late on Sunday that 14 people had been killed, nine of whom have been identified, and 56 people suffered injuries, most of them burns. 
Around 1,300 people have been evacuated, while nine people remain unaccounted for, BNPB said.
Taufiq Ismail Marzuqi, a resident in the district of Lumajang who had volunteered to help, told Reuters that rescue efforts were ""very dire"" because of the severed bridge and volunteers lacking experience.
In a video he recorded, police and military officials tried to excavate bodies with their bare hands.
Rescuers in the village of Curah Kobokan, also in Lumajang, found the body of a mother still holding her dead baby, the state news agency Antara reported. 
A Reuters witness in the Sumberwuluh area said homes and vehicles were almost completely submerged by thick, grey ash, fallen trees blocked roads and a cow which villagers had been unable to rescue lay by the roadside, the witness said. 
Hosniya, a 31-year-old local resident who was evacuated with her family, told Reuters that the eruption was very sudden.
""At first, I thought it was a bomb explosive...suddenly it was all dark, like it was going to destroy the earth,"" she said.
Hosniya and her family fled, unable to take anything with them other than their official papers. 
RESCUE EFFORTS
Heavy rain is expected for the next three days, which could complicate evacuation efforts, a meteorological agency official said late on Sunday. Rock debris and hot volcanic sediment were already limiting movement, local rescuers said.
BNPB will rebuild the wrecked homes, and heavy equipment, including excavators and bulldozers, is being deployed, its chief said. 
The agency also said that 10 people trapped in sand mines by the eruption had been evacuated to safety.
Semeru, which according to volcano experts has been in an eruptive phase since 2014 https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=263300, had started emitting hot clouds and lava flows recently, prompting the authorities to issue warnings for people not to go near it from Wednesday.
Indonesia's transportation ministry said on Sunday the eruption had not caused any disruption to flights, though pilots have been alerted to watch out for the ashfall. 
Semeru, more than 3,600 metres (12,000 feet) high, is one of Indonesia's nearly 130 active volcanoes.

Indonesia straddles the ""Pacific Ring of Fire"", a highly seismically active zone, where different plates on the earth’s crust meet and create a large number of earthquakes and volcanoes.
While many Indonesian volcanoes show high levels of continued activity, eruptions can be years apart. In 2010, an eruption of the Merapi volcano on Java island killed over 350 people and displaced 400,000.

LESBOS, Greece (Reuters) -Pope Francis condemned the exploitation of migrants for political purposes on Sunday during a visit to the Greek island of Lesbos, branding the global indifference to their plight the ""shipwreck of civilisation"".
Francis walked through the Mavrovouni camp, which holds about 2,300 people, stopping to greet dozens of refugees and giving a high five to a young African boy.
He first visited the island, one of the main entry points for migrants, in 2016 and took 12 Syrian refugees back to Italy with him. He lamented that ""little has changed"" since then.
The Mediterranean, where thousands have died trying to make the crossing from north Africa to Europe, was still ""a grim cemetery without tombstones"".
""Please, let us stop this shipwreck of civilisation!"" he said.
Francis for the second straight day chided those who use the migration crisis for political ends.
""It is easy to stir up public opinion by instilling fear of others,"" he said, adding that people who are anti-immigrant ""fail to speak with equal vehemence"" about the exploitation of the poor, wars, and the arms industry.
""The remote causes should be attacked, not the poor people who pay the consequences and are even used for political propaganda,"" he said. 
The camp, set up in a old army firing range, is made up of dozens of prefabricated structures, some similar to shipping containers and other, smaller ones made of plastic.
ERA OF WALLS AND BARBED WIRE
The spaces between the structures are like streets of a bleak village where people live in limbo. Baby carriages and children's tricycles leaned on the home of one Afghan couple.
Sitting on a chair under a tent with the sea behind him, the pope listened to Christian Tango Mukaya, a 30-year-old refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo who has been at the camp with two of his children for a year. He has not had contact with his wife and another child since he arrived.
Mavrovouni, whose perimeter is surrounded by cement, barbed wire and the sea, replaced the notorious Moria camp that burned down last year https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-greece-lesbos-idUSKBN26002M.
The pope visited several families there at the end of his morning visit. 
Departing from his prepared address, Francis said it was ""distressing"" to hear that some European leaders wanted to use common funds to build a wall and put up barbed wire to keep immigrants out.
""We are in the era of walls and barbed wire,"" he said.
Poland's prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has called for the EU to jointly finance a border wall https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/polish-police-say-group-50-migrants-broke-through-belarus-border-2021-11-14 to stem the tide of migrants coming from the Middle East through Belarus into Poland.
As grim and bleak as Mavrovouni is, it is a marked improvement over Moria, which human rights groups decried for its squalid and overcrowded conditions.
Greece has long been the main entry point into the European Union for migrants and refugees fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Asia and Africa. Hundreds of thousands of people arrived on Lesbos's beaches in 2015 after crossing on boats from Turkey. 

Joshue, an 18-year-old refugee from Congo, was among those who welcomed the pope's visit.
""It's not like hearing it from afar, he came to the field to see how we live, to see how things happen here, so it gives us hope and strength knowing that such a leader is thinking about us,"" he said.

He wrote ""Great Political Wit: Laughing (Almost) All the Way to the White House,"" a book of anecdotes of political humor. ""Irreverence is in my blood,"" he said.
The day after he lost the 1996 presidential election to Bill Clinton, Dole appeared on David Letterman's late-night comedy show, where he got big laughs. Shortly after came appearances on Jay Leno's show, a cameo role on the sitcom ""Murphy Brown,"" a bit on ""Saturday Night Live"" and television commercials for Pepsi, Dunkin' Donuts and the impotency-fighting drug Viagra.
Dole said he made the appearances to show that there is life after politics and that ""losing an election does not mean losing your sense of humor.""
Here are some examples of Dole's humor:
* ""Tomorrow is the first day of my life when I have nothing to do."" - his 1996 concession speech.
* ""There they are - See No Evil, Hear No Evil and Evil."" - upon seeing, respectively, former presidents Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon together at the White House.
* ""I, Robert J. Dole, do solemnly swear ... Sorry, wrong speech."" - pretending to be sworn in as president when he was accepting a Presidential Medal of Freedom from Clinton in January 1997.
* ""OK but it would have been better had they served some donuts."" - response to a reporter who asked how things went in a meeting at the White House.

* ""I thought I was a conservative but we've got some in Congress now who are so far right they're about to fall out of the Capitol."" - during a sentimental tour of Kansas in 2014.

164,"<span>Dec 05, 2021 12:20PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Former Republican U.S. Senator and presidential candidate Bob Dole, 98, died on Sunday. 
Here are some facts about him: 
* Robert Joseph Dole was born on July 22, 1923, one of four children of a grain elevator manager and traveling saleswoman in Russell, Kansas. During the Great Depression of the 1930s his family moved into their basement and rented out the rest of their home. Dole later went to the University of Kansas and played basketball under legendary coach Phog Allen.
* After serving in the Kansas legislature, Dole was elected to the U.S House of Representatives in 1960. He was elected to the Senate in 1968 and re-elected four times.
* Dole twice served as Senate Republican leader and earned a reputation as an effective middle-of-the-road legislator who was well liked among Democrats as well as Republicans for his ability to build coalitions.
* Dole was part of four unsuccessful presidential campaigns. In 1976 he was President Gerald Ford's vice presidential choice but that ticket lost to Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale. Dole ran for president in 1980 but lost the Republican nomination to Ronald Reagan and eight years later Republicans chose George H.W. Bush over him. Dole won the Republican nomination in 1996 but was defeated by incumbent Democrat Bill Clinton.

* Dole won two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star in World War Two, and was wounded in Italy shortly before the end of the conflict. He needed nine operations and 39 months to recover from wounds that destroyed his right shoulder, paralyzed his arm, broke vertebrae, riddled his body with shrapnel and cost him a kidney. 
* Dole not only appeared in television commercials for the anti-impotency drug Viagra in 1996, he also helped test it. ""It's a little embarrassing to talk about ED (erectile dysfunction) but it's so important to millions of men and their partners that I decided to talk about it publicly,"" he said in the commercial. While he did not specifically endorse Viagra, he urged men to see their doctors if they have problems. Dole was diagnosed in 1991 with prostate cancer, which can cause impotence.

Relations between the two countries have plummeted since last year, when Russia sided with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko during mass street protests and Lukashenko in turn became more vocal in his support for Moscow against Ukraine.
Belarus handed a note of protest to the Ukrainian official, the ministry said in a statement.
""The military attaché was informed that the Ukrainian side is avoiding a dialogue to resolve disputes ... which is very worrying,"" the ministry said.
Belarus said on Saturday that a Ukrainian military helicopter had flown one km (0.6 miles) into Belarusian territory during manoeuvres. A spokesperson for Ukraine's border guard service denied the accusation.

DUBAI (Reuters) -The reluctance of the United States to lift all sanctions on Iran is the main challenge to reviving a 2015 nuclear pact, a senior Iranian official said on Sunday, as Western powers questioned Tehran's determination to salvage the agreement. 
Indirect talks between Washington and Tehran on reinstating their nuclear pact broke off https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-nuclear-talks-break-friday-with-formal-meeting-officials-2021-12-03 on Friday, with both sides saying they would resume the following week, as Western officials voiced dismay at sweeping demands by the Islamic Republic.
""It is now clear that Washington's reluctance to give up sanctions altogether is the main challenge to the progress of the talks,"" the unnamed official was quoted as saying by Iran's Tasnim news agency.
""We believe that a deal is within reach if the U.S. government gives up its campaign of maximum pressure and the European parties show serious flexibility and political will in the talks."" 
Iran and major powers started talks in April aimed at bringing back Tehran and Washington into full compliance with the pact, which was abandoned by former U.S. President Donald Trump three years ago. 
But the talks stopped after the election of Iran's hardline President Ebrahim Raisi in June. 
A year after Trump's reimposition of harsh sanctions on Iran, Tehran began to gradually violate nuclear limits of the agreement. Iran wants all sanctions imposed by the United States to be lifted in a verifiable process. 
While stressing that the United States still wanted to revive the deal, under which Iran had limited its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions, a senior U.S. State Department official said on Saturday time was running short.
Iran's chief nuclear negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani said on Monday that Tehran had delivered two draft proposals to the remaining parties to the deal in Vienna, one on sanctions removal and the other on nuclear limitations.
Tehran said it will later provide a third draft proposal on the ""mechanism and time of verification and issues related to receiving guarantees to prevent the re-withdrawal of the U.S. from the nuclear deal"".
Speaking at the Reuters Next conference, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday that the United States would not let Iran drag out the process while continuing to advance its program and that Washington will pursue other options if diplomacy fails.

""Contrary to the remarks of the American officials, I believe that if other parties have good will, and stop their futile blame game, an agreement is within reach,"" the Iranian official said, according to Tasnim. 
""Other parties should provide proper response or present new proposals and clear ideas in writing ... Then, ways will be opened for the conclusion of a deal and settlement of differences.""

U.S. allies in the region and key balancing powers such as India have never been more dependent on American capacity and willingness to sustain a military and strategic counterweight in response to China's rise, said the Sydney-based foreign policy think tank.
At the same time, Beijing has sought to dissuade Southeast Asian countries from joining the U.S. coalition, while upgrading its military exchanges with Russia and Pakistan as well as North Korea and creating as such a formidable trio of China-aligned nuclear-armed powers in the region.
""Whether the emerging balance of military power contributes to deterrence and strategic stability in the Indo-Pacific is an open question,"" the report said.
""The depth of hostilities, the breadth of U.S.–China competition and the presence of multiple potential flashpoints means the risk of war is significant.""
The impact from the pandemic has undermined the overall region's prosperity, weakening China's comprehensive power. 
""Beijing is now less likely to pull ahead of its peer competitor in comprehensive power by the end of the decade – this suggests that there is nothing inevitable about China's rise in the world,"" the report said. ""It appears very unlikely China will ever be as dominant as the United States once was.""

The think tank said Australia, whose relations with China have deteriorated significantly in recent years, has weathered China's growing power better than most U.S. partners - but is growing more reliant on Washington. 
In 2018, Australia banned Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co from its 5G telecommunications network. Relations worsened last year when Canberra called for an independent investigation into the origins of the coronavirus, prompting a series of trade reprisals from China.

Witnesses on the scene told Reuters dozens had been injured. Photos and videos on social media show a vehicle that crashed through the protesters and bodies lying on the road. 
Another protest was held in Yangon in the afternoon despite the morning violence.
Anti-military protests are continuing despite the killing of more than 1,300 people since the Feb. 1 coup. The scattered protests are often small groups voicing opposition to the overthrow of an elected government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and the return of military rule.
The opposition's shadow government said it was heartbroken to see peaceful protesters crashed and shot to death.
""We will strongly respond to the terrorist military who brutally, inhumanly killed the unarmed peaceful protesters,"" the National Unity Government's defence ministry said in a statement on social media after Sunday's attack.
In the incident, a ""flash mob"" protest in Yangon, Myanmar's largest city, was rammed minutes after it started, witnesses said.
""I got hit and fell down in front of a truck. A soldier beat me with his rifle but I defended and pushed him back. Then he immediately shot at me as I ran away in a zig-zag pattern. Fortunately, I escaped,"" a protester who asked not to be identified for security reasons told Reuters by phone.
A car occupied by soldiers hit the crowd from the back, two witnesses said, and followed the scattered protesters arresting and beating them. Some were seriously injured with head wounds and unconscious, according to the witnesses. 
A spokesman for the ruling junta did not answer calls seeking comment on Sunday.
The military has said that protesters who have been killed instigated the violence. It says it staged the coup because a November election won by Suu Kyi's party was rigged. The election commission has dismissed the assertion.
Wars with ethnic minority insurgents in remote frontier regions in the north and east have intensified significantly since the coup, displacing tens of thousands of civilians, according to United Nations estimates.

Suu Kyi, 76, faces a dozen cases against her including incitement and violations of COVID-19 protocols. 
She has rejected all the charges to date.

(Reuters) -A Michigan judge set bail at $500,000 each for the parents of a teenager accused of murdering four fellow high school students with a weapon the couple bought him as a Christmas gift, after authorities arrested them on Saturday following a manhunt. 
Appearing by videolink from jail for their arraignment, James and Jennifer Crumbley both pleaded not guilty to four counts of involuntary manslaughter. 
Oakland County prosecutor Karen McDonald told the hearing the Crumbleys withdrew $4,000 from an ATM while authorities were searching for them and remained a flight risk. 
""These are not people that we can be assured will return to court on their own,"" she said.
Authorities began searching for the couple after Oakland County prosecutors said on Friday that they would be charged with manslaughter https://www.reuters.com/world/us/manslaughter-charges-against-michigan-shooters-parents-break-new-legal-ground-2021-12-04 in connection with the campus mass shooting. Prosecutors said the Crumbleys bought the handgun for their son as a Christmas present and then ignored warning signs including on the day of the shooting.
The Michigan school shooting is only the latest such incident in the United States, where elected officials have sparred over how to make schools safer for children as attacks have grown increasingly common https://www.reuters.com/world/us/your-voice-matters-says-gun-control-activist-x-gonzlez-2021-12-02 in recent decades.
Judge Julie Nicholson said on Saturday that she had ""some concern about the flight risk"" posed by the couple after they did not appear for the Friday arraignment.
Two attorneys for the Crumbleys, Shannon Smith and Mariell Lehman, have said the couple never sought to evade authorities.
""Our clients were absolutely going to turn themselves in,"" Smith said at Saturday's hearing. ""It was just a matter of logistics.""
Detroit Police Chief James White told reporters in the early hours of Saturday that the couple had been found hiding in a commercial building on the city's east side. He said they had not broken into the building, but were let in by somebody. 
White said a member of the public spotted their vehicle outside the building.
The couple's 15-year-old son, Ethan Crumbley, is being held without bail and has been charged as adult on suspicion of carrying out the deadliest U.S. school shooting of 2021 https://www.reuters.com/world/us/deadly-michigan-school-shooting-baffles-police-young-suspect-keeps-silent-2021-12-01 on Tuesday at Oxford High School, about 40 miles (60 km) north of Detroit. 
Crumbley's parents were expected to appear for a Friday afternoon arraignment but stopped responding to calls from their attorneys, according to Oakland County Undersheriff Mike McCabe, prompting a search by the sheriff's office and U.S. Marshals Service.
During the arraignment, Jennifer Crumbley sobbed as the judge read the names of the students killed in the shooting and related charges. 
The judge set preliminary hearings for Dec. 14 and 22.
GUN PURCHASE
Four days before the shooting, Ethan accompanied his father to a gun shop, where James Crumbley bought a 9mm handgun, prosecutors said.
Michigan law prohibits those under 18 years of age from buying or possessing firearms, except in limited circumstances such as hunting with a license and a supervising adult.
Ethan posted photos of the gun on social media, writing, ""Just got my new beauty today"" and adding a heart emoji. The next day his mother posted that the two of them were at a gun range ""testing out his new Christmas present,"" Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald said. 
McDonald detailed a number of other warning signs that she said the parents failed to act on.
On Nov. 21, a teacher found Ethan Crumbley searching for ammunition on his phone and alerted school officials, who left messages for his mother that went unreturned. His mother later texted him, ""LOL, I'm not mad at you. You have to learn not to get caught.""
On the morning of the shooting, a teacher discovered drawings by Ethan Crumbley that depicted a handgun, a bullet, and a bleeding figure next to the words ""Blood everywhere,"" ""My life is useless,"" and ""The thoughts won't stop - help me."" 
Ethan told school counselors the drawings were for a video game he was designing, and that he wanted to pursue video game design as a career, according to a letter that Oxford Community Schools Superintendent Tim Throne sent the school community on Saturday.
""At no time did counselors believe the student might harm others based on his behavior, responses and demeanor, which appeared calm,"" Throne said in the letter.

School officials summoned the Crumbleys and instructed them to get Ethan into counseling within 48 hours, McDonald said. The parents resisted the idea of taking their son home and did not search his backpack nor ask him about the gun, she said.
Throne said the couple ""flatly refused"" to leave with their son. Ethan Crumbley was returned to class and later walked out of a bathroom with the gun, killing four students and injuring seven other people, authorities said.

ATHENS (Reuters) -An elderly Greek Orthodox priest shouted ""Pope, you are a heretic"" as Pope Francis was entering the Orthodox Archbishopric in Athens on Saturday and was taken away by police, a reminder of the lingering distrust between the two divided churches.
Video showed the man, who was dressed in black robes and black hat and had a long white beard, shouting the words in Greek outside the building before police bundled him away.
Witnesses said he shouted loud enough for the pope to hear the commotion. The man appeared to have fallen while being taken away and was lifted up by police.
Francis arrived in Greece on Saturday for a three-day visit that Greek Catholics hope will bring the Eastern and Western churches closer together.
Christianity split into the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches in 1054 in what is referred to as the Great Schism, and for centuries relations were rocky.
In his address to the archbishop, Beatitude Ieronymos II, Francis asked forgiveness in the name of the Roman Catholic Church for its part in the historical wrongs that led to the breakup.
""Tragically, in later times we grew apart. Worldly concerns poisoned us, weeds of suspicion increased our distance and we ceased to nurture communion,"" Francis told Ieronymos, whom he met during his first trip to Greece in 2016.
""I feel the need to ask anew for the forgiveness of God and of our brothers and sisters for the mistakes committed by many Catholics,"" Francis said.
Pope John Paul II first asked forgiveness for the Catholic role in the break-up when he visited Greece in 2001.

Catholics and Orthodox have been involved in dialogue aimed at eventual reunion for decades and cooperate in many social initiatives but the two sides are still far apart theologically.
""We believe you have the courage and the sincerity to examine the failures and omissions of your fathers,"" Ieronymos told Francis. ""Between those who want to be called Christian brothers, the best language is, and always will be, honesty.""

WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin will hold a video call on Tuesday, with the two leaders set to discuss the tense situation in Ukraine.
""Biden will underscore U.S. concerns with Russian military activities on the border with Ukraine and reaffirm the United States' support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,"" White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said in a statement.
She said other topics would include ""strategic stability, cyber and regional issues.""
The two will also talk about bilateral ties and the implementation of agreements reached at their Geneva summit in June, the Kremlin said on Saturday.
""The conversation will indeed take place on Tuesday,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Reuters. ""Bilateral relations, of course Ukraine and the realization of the agreements reached in Geneva are the main (items) on the agenda,"" he said. 
The exact timing of the call was not disclosed.
More than 94,000 Russian troops are believed to be massed near Ukraine's borders. Ukraine Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said on Friday that Moscow may be planning a large-scale military offensive at the end of January, citing intelligence reports. U.S. officials have come to similar conclusions, they said.
Biden, meanwhile, has rejected Russian demands for security guarantees in the region.
""My expectation is we're going to have a long discussion with Putin,"" Biden told reporters on Friday as he departed for a weekend trip to Camp David. ""I don't accept anybody's red lines,"" he said.
The U.S. president said he and his advisers were preparing a comprehensive set of initiatives aimed at deterring Putin from an invasion. He did not give further details, but the administration has discussed partnering with European allies to impose more sanctions on Russia. 
U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin separately said that Washington was committed to ensuring that Ukraine had what it needed to protect its territory. 
Austin added that there was a lot of space for diplomacy and leadership to work on Ukraine. 
At the same conference, James C. McConville, chief of staff of the U.S. Army, on Saturday referred to estimates of 95,000 to 100,000 Russian troops on the border with Ukraine. 
""I don't know what they are going to do, but I am very, very concerned,"" McConville said. 
Moscow accuses Kyiv of pursuing its own military build-up. It has dismissed as inflammatory suggestions that it is preparing for an attack on its southern neighbor and has defended its right to deploy troops on its own territory as it sees fit.
U.S. officials say they do not know yet what Putin's intentions are, including whether Putin has made a decision to invade Ukraine.
U.S.-Russia relations have been deteriorating for years, notably with Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, its 2015 intervention in Syria and U.S. intelligence charges of meddling in the 2016 election won by now-former President Donald Trump. 
But they have become more volatile in recent months. 
The Biden administration has asked Moscow to crack down on ransomware and cyber crime attacks emanating from Russian soil, and in November charged a Ukraine national and a Russian in one of the worst ransomware attacks against American targets. 
Russia has repeatedly denied carrying out or tolerating cyber attacks.

The two leaders have had one face-to-face meeting since Biden took office in January, sitting down for talks in Geneva in June. They last talked by phone on July 9. Biden relishes direct talks with world leaders, seeing them as a way to lower tensions.

Cross-strait tensions have been rising in recent months, with Taiwan complaining for a year or more of repeated missions by China's air force near the self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its own.
""I don't want to speculate, but certainly ... it looks a lot like rehearsals,"" Austin said while speaking at a conference in California. 

Military training flights by definition are rehearsals for potential operations. 
China has not ruled out using force to bring Taiwan under its control, despite the island's claim that it is an independent country that will defend its freedom and democracy.

The state airline said flight SU501 carrying 142 passengers had had to drop 2,000 feet on Friday after air traffic control told it that another aircraft had crossed its path. 
The crew were able to see the other plane when they passed in the sky, it said in a separate statement. 
The aviation authority, Rosaviatsia, said a smaller CL-650 aircraft flying from the Black Sea resort of Sochi to Skopje had also had to change its course. 
It did not say which NATO member the reconnaissance aircraft belonged to. Russia's Defence Ministry said on Friday it had scrambled fighter jets to escort two U.S. military reconnaissance planes over the Black Sea.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow made no immediate comment about the incident when it was first reported by the Interfax news agency.
Rosaviatsia said an increase in flights by NATO aircraft in the region was creating risks for civilian planes and that Moscow planned to lodge a diplomatic complaint over them. 

International tensions have been rising over Ukraine and the Black Sea region.
Kyiv and NATO powers accuse Russia of building up troops near Ukraine, sparking fears of a possible attack. Moscow denies any such plan and accuses Kyiv of building up its own forces in its east, where Russian-backed separatists control a large part of Ukrainian territory.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Iran abandoned any compromises it had made in talks to revive its 2015 nuclear deal with major powers, pocketed those made by others, and demanded more during indirect U.S.-Iran talks this week, a senior U.S. State Department official said.
Tehran's stance during the first such talks in more than five months disappointed not just the United States and its European allies but also China and Russia, historically more sympathetic to Iran, the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said this week.
While stressing that the United States still wanted to revive the deal, under which Iran had limited its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions, the official told reporters time was running short.
The indirect U.S.-Iranian talks on saving the deal broke off on Friday in Vienna as European officials also voiced dismay at sweeping demands by Iran's hard-line government. 
The latest talks were the first with delegates sent by Iran's anti-Western President Ebrahim Raisi, who was elected in June and whose government had said it needed time to prepare for fresh talks after the six rounds between April and June.
The senior U.S. official said Iran used the time to speed up its nuclear program in ""provocative"" ways and to stonewall the U.N. nuclear watchdog charged with monitoring its eroding compliance with the deal. 
While seeking to leave the door ajar for talks, the official blamed Iran as ""the reason why there is not ... a mutual return to compliance"" with the original deal struck with Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States.
Tehran, however, has placed the onus on Washington, noting that then-President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the deal in 2018 and reimposed U.S. sanctions, prompting Iran to begin violating the nuclear restrictions starting in 2019.
The 2015 agreement imposed strict limits on Iran's uranium enrichment activities, extending the time it would need to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon, if it chose to, to at least a year from around two to three months.
Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons, saying it only wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.
While saying it was unclear whether China and Russia might ramp up economic pressure on Iran if talks fail, he suggested their positions may be evolving.
""They also were quite taken aback by the degree to which Iran had walked back its own compromises and then doubled down on the requests that it (made),"" he said. ""They do share a sense of disappointment, to put it diplomatically.""
The U.S. official said he did not know when the next round of talks would resume - others had said next week - and said the date was less important than Iran's willingness to negotiate.

American officials have said they would consider other options if they cannot revive the deal, a phrase understood to include the possibility of military ones, however remote.
Iranian air defenses fired a missile as part of an exercise on Saturday over the town of Natanz, which houses nuclear installations, state TV said after local residents reported hearing a large blast.

DOHA (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron held face-to-face talks in Saudi Arabia on Saturday with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, becoming the first major Western leader to visit the kingdom since journalist Jamal Khashoggi's 2018 murder.
Macron considers Saudi Arabia vital to help forge a region-wide peace deal with Iran, as well as an ally in the fight against Islamist militants from the Middle East to West Africa, and a rampart against the Muslim Brotherhood. 
France is one of Saudi Arabia's main arms suppliers, but it has faced increasing pressure to review its sales because of the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen, now one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.
While ties between Paris and Riyadh were warmer under Macron's predecessor, Francois Hollande, France has not reaped the business rewards.
The relationship has cooled in recent years despite Macron, prior to Khashoggi's murder, having urged detractors to give time to the then 33-year-old leader-in-waiting.
On arriving in the coastal Red Sea city of Jeddah, Macron exchanged a warm handshake with bin Salman.
Both smiled before heading into talks that included the Iran nuclear file and Lebanon, on which Macron said he had been given a commitment by bin Salman to re-engage to find a solution to the crisis despite it being wary of Iran-backed Hezbollah's heft. 
Macron on Friday had rejected accusations that he was legitimising the crown prince, adding that the region's multiple crises could not be dealt with by ignoring the kingdom.
""We talked about absolutely everything, without any taboos and we were obviously able to bring up the question of human rights,"" Macron told reporters after meeting bin Salman.
""It was a direct exchange, I hope, effective. I still have the same approach of trying to preserve that channel with leaders to get tangible results.""
Recent contracts have been few, with most centred on the Al-Ula tourism project that aims to bring to life the kingdom's Nabatean history, part of Saudi Arabia's diversification drive to wean its economy off oil revenues.
Macron's visit comes at a time when Gulf Arab states have voiced uncertainty about the U.S. focus on the region even as they seek more weapons from Washington. 
Saudi Arabia has been frustrated by the approach of U.S. President Joe Biden's administration, which has pressed Riyadh over its human rights record and the Yemen war and released intelligence linking bin Salman to Khashoggi's murder.

The crown prince has denied any involvement in the killing of the journalist in Riyadh's Istanbul consulate, an incident that sparked global outrage and tainted Prince Mohammed's image.
""Whether it's the objective or not, (this trip) contributes to a policy of rehabilitating the Saudi prince,"" said Agnes Callamard, secretary general of the rights group Amnesty International. ""It pains me that France, the country of human rights, is the instrument of this policy.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - There is little precedent for the criminal charges against the parents of Ethan Crumbley, the Michigan teenager who fatally shot four of his high school classmates with a handgun on Tuesday, but prosecutors may have a strong case, legal experts said.
Detroit police said early on Saturday that the parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, had been taken into custody.
Michigan prosecutors on Friday charged https://www.reuters.com/world/us/parents-michigan-teen-accused-school-shooting-could-face-own-charges-2021-12-03 the couple with involuntary manslaughter for buying their son the weapon as a Christmas gift and ignoring warning signs as late as the day of the shooting. They said Jennifer Crumbley wrote in a text message to her son, ""LOL, I'm not mad at you. You have to learn not to get caught,"" after a teacher saw him searching for ammunition on his phone during class.
The morning of the shooting, a teacher discovered a drawing that Ethan Crumbley had made depicting a handgun, a bullet, and a bleeding figure, with the words ""Blood everywhere"" and ""The thoughts won't stop - help me."" After being summoned to the school and shown the picture, James and Jennifer Crumbley did not take their son home, search his backpack or ask about the gun, prosecutors said.
The Crumbleys' lawyers, Shannon Smith and Mariell Lehman, on Friday denied reports that their clients were fleeing law enforcement. 
Some states have laws holding gun owners liable for failing to secure weapons around children, but Michigan does not. That means prosecutors will be relying on traditional criminal law, under which they must prove that the Crumbleys were not merely negligent, but grossly negligent or reckless, the experts said.
Ethan Crumbley has been charged as an adult, even though he is under 18.
FIRST CASE AGAINST PARENTS
The case appears to be the first against parents of a teenage school shooter. While other parents have been charged for deaths resulting from unsecured guns, those cases have involved much younger children, experts said.
In one case, in a neighboring Michigan county, the owner of a gun used by a six-year-old to shoot a classmate pleaded no contest to involuntary manslaughter in 2000. April Zeoli, a professor at the School of Criminal Justice at Michigan State University, said that prosecution offered the closest parallel to the Crumbleys, and a legal precedent for holding them liable, That case also targeted an adult for failing to secure a gun used by a student in a school shooting.
However, Robert Leider, a professor at George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School, said that and other cases were different from the Crumbleys' because young children legally cannot have criminal intent.
""Here you have a teenager who can form his own criminal intent,"" Leider said. ""That weighs in favor of breaking the chain of causation"" between the Crumbleys and the shooting. 
Eric Ruben, a professor at Southern Methodist University's Dedman School of Law, said whether prosecutors succeed depends on the facts and on their approach. He said a case focusing on what the Crumbleys did - like buying the gun despite knowing it posed a high risk - is likely stronger than one homing in on what they failed to do.
To convict them for failing to do something, he said, prosecutors would need to show that the parents had a duty to the victims.
Michigan law prohibits those under age 18 from buying or possessing firearms, except in limited circumstances such as hunting with a license and a supervising adult. Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald told a news conference the charges were intended to ""send a message: that gun owners have a responsibility.""
Ruben said the parents would likely defend themselves by arguing that they could not have reasonably foreseen that their actions would lead to the shooting, meaning they could not be responsible for causing it.
Lawrence Dubin, a professor of law at University of Detroit Mercy, said that if the parents knew that their son had a dangerous state of mind but gave him easy access to the gun anyway, it could support the manslaughter charges.

Leider said the facts, as alleged by the prosecutors, seemed ""egregious.""
""They clearly knew their child was very troubled and seemed to have gone out of their way to arm him,"" he said.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - The Semeru volcano on the Indonesian island of Java erupted on Saturday, killing one person, injuring at least 35 and trapping some people in buildings as it spewed out huge clouds of smoke and ash, officials said.
Videos shared by emergency officials showed residents running as towering plumes of smoke and ash blanketed nearby villages in East Java province.
The deputy chief of Lumajang district, Indah Masdar, told a news conference one person had died and 41 people had suffered burn injuries.
The disaster mitigation agency (BNPB) said later that 35 patients were being treated at local medical facilities. 
Indah asked for helicopters to rescue people trapped inside buildings.
""We're in big distress,"" she said, adding there were at least 10 people trapped. 
""It's harrowing, their families are all crying.""
Thoriqul Haq, district head of Lumajang, said a number of sand miners were trapped near mines, but did not give further details.
Haq told Reuters that the road and bridge connecting Lumajang and the nearby city of Malang were severed.
""This has been a very pressing, rapid condition since it erupted,"" he said. Haq added that evacuations were underway, but did not give details.
He later told news channel MetroTV that the severed bridge meant one nearby district had no access to medical help.
Authorities were setting up evacuation tents, the country's disaster mitigation agency (BNPB) said. But evacuations have been hampered by thick smoke, BNPB chief Suharyanto said.

AirNav Indonesia, which controls Indonesian airspace, said in a statement the eruption did not ""cause significant impact"" on flights.
Semeru, the highest on Java island, is among Indonesia's nearly 130 active volcanoes. It erupted in January, causing no casualties.

A video released by Israeli police appears to show a man crossing a street and then turning around and several times stabbing or attempting to stab an ultra-Orthodox Jewish man who had been walking behind him. The assailant then runs toward a border policeman and is shot several times by him and another officer as he falls to the ground - all in the space of 50 seconds. 
Another video circulating on social media appears to show the last few seconds of the incident, in which one of the officers continues to shoot at the assailant at least twice when he is already lying on the ground. 
Reuters could not independently verify the footage. 
The chief of Israel's border police Amir Cohen said the officers had acted correctly.
Palestinian officials condemned the assailant's death and said it amounted to an execution. ""The killing of the young man after he had been wounded is a documented war crime,"" Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the statement.
Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett backed the officers, who he said ""acted very quickly and decisively, as expected of Israeli police, against a terrorist who tried to murder an Israeli citizen"".
The Israeli stabbed was moderately wounded, Israel's ambulance service said.
Palestinian stabbing attacks against Israelis, many carried out by assailants with no known affiliation to militant groups, have occurred sporadically since 2015, a year after Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed.

Palestinians want the eastern part of Jerusalem as capital of a future state. Israel captured that territory, including the Old City, in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in a move not recognised internationally. 
Israel says the entire city is its eternal and indivisible capital.

MUMBAI (Reuters) -New Zealand spinner Ajaz Patel became only the third bowler to pick up all 10 wickets in an innings in international cricket, achieving the rare feat against India in the second test at the Wankhede Stadium on Saturday.
The 33-year-old joined England off-spinner Jim Laker (1956, against Australia) and India leg-spinner Anil Kumble (1999, against Pakistan) in picking up all wickets in an innings.
""Welcome to the club #AjazPatel #Perfect10. Well bowled! A special effort to achieve it on day one and two of a test match,"" spin bowling great Kumble, who took 619 test wickets for India, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) https://twitter.com/anilkumble1074/status/1467038083455410185.
It was the first time a bowler took 10 wickets in an innings in a test away from home, although he was playing his first test in the city of his birth.
Ajaz, whose parents immigrated to New Zealand in 1996, added six wickets to the four he took on the first day on Friday to finish with figures of 10-119.
""To be honest, it's pretty surreal,"" he said in a post-innings interview.
""I don't think you ever believe you're going to achieve something like that. So to be able to do it in my career, it's pretty special.""
Ajaz said he had yet to comprehend the magnitude of his achievement and thanked Kumble for his message.
""These things don't sink in until later,"" he later told reporters. ""It's brilliant for me, my family and my wife.
""You spend a lot of time away from home as a cricketer and I'm just grateful to God for this, this occasion.
""Very illustrious group to be a part of. Great to see his (Kumble) message and his kind words. Humbled and fortunate to be in that company.""
The left-arm spinner, who started his career as a fast bowler, extracted sharp turn and bounce from the pitch and carried the New Zealand bowling on his broad shoulders to restrict the hosts' first innings total to 325.
After picking up the wickets of Wriddhiman Saha and Ravichandran Ashwin in his first over on Saturday, the stocky spinner returned after the lunch interval to take the remaining four to wrap up India's innings.
As Rachin Ravindra pouched a skier from India's number 11 batter Mohammed Siraj to confirm the fall of the final wicket, Ajaz went down on one knee with a clenched fist before being hugged by his team mates.
He also received a standing ovation from the Indian team in the dressing room and the sparse crowd at the ground overlooking the Arabian Sea.

""I'm very fortunate and I guess the stars have aligned for me to have an occasion like that here in Mumbai,"" Ajaz said.
""To be born here and then come back here and achieve something like that, it's pretty special.""

ATHENS (Reuters) -Pope Francis appealed on Saturday for a return to ""good politics"", saying democracy has deteriorated dangerously as discontented people are lured by the ""siren songs"" of populist politicians who promise easy but unrealistic solutions.
The pope arrived from Cyprus in Athens, often seen as the birthplace of democracy, on the second and last leg of a Mediterranean trip whose main aim is to draw attention to the plight of migrants and refugees. 
In a speech at the presidential palace, Francis quoted ancient Greek philosophers and writers such as Aristotle and Homer. He urged a return to politics that favour the common good and are not steeped in instilling fear.
""We cannot avoid noting with concern how today, and not only in Europe, we are witnessing a retreat from democracy,"" Francis said.
He called democracy a complex but essential endeavour requiring wide participation, ""whereas authoritarianism is peremptory and populism’s easy answers appear attractive"".
Francis did not name any country in his speech but in the past he has criticised the policies of a number of politicians, including former U.S. President Donald Trump and Italian far-right leader Matteo Salvini, particularly on the issue of immigration.
Francis said people should beware of politicians with ""an obsessive quest for popularity, in a thirst for visibility, in a flurry of unrealistic promises...""
The pope added that he hoped that strengthened democracy everywhere ""may be the response to the siren songs of authoritarianism; and that individualism and indifference may be overcome by concern for others, for the poor and for creation"".
'HORRENDOUS MODERN ODYSSEY'
Greece is one of the main entry points into the European Union for asylum-seekers fleeing war and poverty-stricken homelands in the Middle East, Asia and Africa.
In his address at the presidential palace he compared the plight of today's migrants and refugees, many of whom have died at sea, as a ""horrendous modern Odyssey"".
Young children in traditional Greek dress, a well as a boy from Africa and a girl from the Philippines, greeted Francis as he stepped off the plane and rode into the city in a simple Fiat 500. Since the start of his papacy in 2013, the Argentine pontiff has shunned large cars or bulletproof vehicles.
Francis will travel to the island of Lesbos https://www.reuters.com/world/popes-visit-greeces-lesbos-lays-bare-divisions-over-migrants-2021-12-01 for the second time on Sunday to visit a migrant reception center set up after the notorious Moria camp burned to the ground last year. 
During a previous visit to the island in 2016, Francis walked through Moria, a camp decried by rights groups for its squalid and overcrowded conditions, and asylum-seekers fell to his feet, wept and begged for help.

He memorably took three Syrian refugee families with him on the plane back to Rome. The pope arranged to have 50 migrants from Cyprus relocated to Italy after his trip this week.
At an emotional meeting https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/pope-calls-healing-split-cyprus-orthodox-archbishop-attacks-turkey-2021-12-03 with asylum-seekers in Cyprus on Friday, Francis, citing conditions in Libya and elsewhere, said he had a responsibility to tell the truth about the suffering of refugees, many held in conditions he compared to those in Nazi and Soviet camps.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A green massage table seized from Jeffrey Epstein's Palm Beach estate was carried into a Manhattan federal courtroom on Friday, where British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell is on trial for her alleged role in the sex abuse of underage girls.
Prosecutors have said many of Epstein's encounters with teenagers began as massages before escalating, calling the term ""massage"" a ""ruse"" to get girls to touch Epstein.
Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to eight counts of sex trafficking and other crimes for allegedly recruiting and grooming girls for Epstein to abuse.
Her attorneys argue she is being scapegoated because Epstein cannot be prosecuted, after killing himself in a Manhattan jail in 2019 at age 66 while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges. Maxwell is a former Epstein girlfriend.
Jeffrey Parkinson, a retired police officer involved in the 2005 search as part of an investigation into Epstein's conduct, testified on the fifth day of Maxwell's trial that he carried the massage table from Epstein's estate.
Prosecutor Maurene Comey also showed jurors a photo of a box labeled ""Twin Torpedos"" that a colleague of Parkinson's, Michael Dawson, said contained sex toys taken from an upstairs closet.
""We were looking for massage tables, we were looking for massage oils, we were looking for sex toys, we were looking for correspondence,"" Dawson testified on Friday afternoon.
The demonstrations came after Epstein's former house manager, Juan Alessi, completed his own testimony.
Alessi had testified on Thursday that Epstein was receiving about three massages every day by the time he left his job in 2002.
He said he sometimes found sex toys while cleaning the massage room and stored them in Maxwell's bathroom.
Alessi called Maxwell the ""lady of the house"" at the Palm Beach property, saying she often directed him to schedule Epstein's massages, and that he sometimes drove her on scouting missions to spas to find new therapists for Epstein.
A woman who identified herself as Jane testified this week that she frequently massaged Epstein at the Palm Beach home while she was a teenager in the mid-1990s.
She said Epstein often touched her sexually during their encounters, in which Maxwell sometimes participated. Epstein sometimes paid her, she added. 
Alessi testified that Jane's real name was in a directory he kept of Epstein's masseusses. He also said that before Epstein and Maxwell arrived in Florida for the weekend, the house staff was instructed to place several $100 bills in Epstein's cars.
Maxwell's attorneys on Friday sought to challenge Jane's recollection of the events when cross-examining Alessi.
They questioned his recollection of having met Jane in 1994, when she said she was first abused at 14, pointing to an earlier statement he made that he met her years later, when she might have been of legal age.

Alessi replied that he did not remember the precise year he met Jane.
Maxwell's trial is expected to resume on Monday and last into January.

DOHA (Reuters) - Several European countries are working on opening up a joint diplomatic mission in Afghanistan that would enable their ambassadors to return to the country, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday.
Western countries have been grappling with how to engage with the Taliban after they took over Afghanistan in a lightning advance in August as U.S.-led forces were completing their pullout.
The United States and other Western countries shut their embassies and withdrew their diplomats as the Taliban seized Kabul, following which the militants declared an interim government whose top members are under U.S. and U.N. sanctions.
""We are thinking of an organisation between several European countries... a common location for several Europeans, which would allow our ambassadors to be present,"" Macron told reporters in Doha before heading to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. 
The United States, European countries and others are reluctant to formally recognize the Pashtun-dominated Taliban, accusing them of backtracking on pledges of political and ethnic inclusivity and to uphold the rights of women and minorities.
""This is a different demarche than a political recognition or political dialogue with the Taliban ... we will have a representation as soon as we can open,"" he said, adding that the still needed to iron out security issues. 
In a statement following talks with the Taliban a week ago, the European Union suggested it could open a mission soon. 

""The EU delegation underlined that the possibility of establishing a minimal presence on the ground in Kabul, which would not entail recognition, will directly depend on the security situation, as well as on effective decisions by the de facto authorities to allow the EU to ensure adequate protection of its staff and premises,"" it said. 
France separately announced on Friday that it had carried out an evacuation mission in Afghanistan with Qatar's help, taking more than 300 people, mostly Afghans, out of the country.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said on Friday he is developing comprehensive initiatives to make it difficult for Russian President Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine and that he would not accept Moscow's ""red lines,"" as fears mounted that the simmering conflict could erupt into war.
A video teleconference between the two leaders is anticipated within days.
More than 94,000 Russian troops are massed https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/large-scale-russian-offensive-possible-january-ukraine-says-2021-12-03 near Ukraine's borders, said Ukraine's defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, who cited intelligence reports suggesting Moscow may be planning a large-scale military offensive for the end of January.
Moscow, in turn, has accused Ukraine and the United States of destabilizing behavior and suggested Kyiv might be preparing to launch its own offensive in eastern Ukraine, which the Ukrainian authorities deny.
""What I am doing is putting together what I believe to be the most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives to make it very, very difficult for Mr. Putin to go ahead and do what people are worried he's going to do,"" Biden said, without going into detail.
As he departed for a weekend trip to Camp David later on Friday, Biden told reporters: ""We’re aware of Russia’s actions for a long time and my expectation is we’re going to have a long discussion with Putin.""
""I don’t accept anybody’s red lines,"" he said of Russia’s demands.
U.S. and Ukrainian officials warned again this week that severe economic sanctions are on the table against Russia. 
""Since the beginning of this administration we have demonstrated that the United States and our allies are willing to use a number of tools to address harmful Russian actions,"" a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said when asked about the plan Biden is developing. ""We will not hesitate from making use of those and other tools in the future.""
White House press secretary Jen Psaki told a briefing that security assistance for Ukraine is under consideration.
BIDEN-PUTIN CALL
Ukrainian tensions set the backdrop for the first call in months between the U.S. president and his Russian counterpart as soon as next week. Officials have been negotiating terms of the call after Putin and Biden last spoke in July.
The Kremlin said on Friday that Russia and the United States had a tentative date and time for the video summit in the coming days, but that Moscow was waiting for Washington to finalize it. The White House said only that it is ""engaged"" in talks for a possible call.
Biden imposed sanctions on Russia in April https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-imposes-wide-array-sanctions-russia-malign-actions-2021-04-15 and has left open the possibility of more. But Washington hopes that continued direct engagement will lower the temperature at a time when relations are at their lowest level since the end of the Cold War and the demise of the Soviet Union.
""We want open lines of communication with the Russians,"" said one senior State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""Especially in times of tension, it's important that we have these channels of dialogue.""
A glimpse into what a Biden-Putin call might look like was offered by a meeting among lower level officials on Thursday.
In Stockholm on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/blinken-urges-russias-lavrov-take-diplomatic-exit-ukraine-crisis-2021-12-02 Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that there would be ""severe costs"" if Moscow escalates conflict, a message Biden appears prepared to reiterate. 
Blinken told the Reuters Next conference on Friday that Biden would tell Putin about the country's ""determination, not as a threat, but simply as a fact, to stand up resolutely against any reckless or aggressive actions that Russia may pursue and also to defend the territorial integrity, the sovereignty, the independence of Ukraine.""

Russian officials, meanwhile, said Putin would press his case for legally binding security guarantees from the West that NATO will not admit Ukraine as a member of the military alliance or deploy missile systems there to target Russia.
As in their past talks, including a June face-to-face meeting in Geneva, other issues likely to come up include cybersecurity, arms issues, Afghanistan, Iran, Libya and Syria.

(Reuters) - Authorities searched for the parents of a Michigan teenager accused of murdering four fellow high school students, after they were charged with involuntary manslaughter on Friday for buying their son the weapon as a Christmas gift and ignoring warning signs as late as the day of the shooting.
A fugitive warrant was issued for James and Jennifer Crumbley, who failed to appear for a court arraignment on Friday, and the Oakland County Sheriff's Office posted a Be On the Lookout notice for them on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
""If they think they're going to get away, they're not,"" Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard told CNN.
The pursuit began three days after officials accused their 15-year-old son, Ethan, of carrying out the deadliest U.S. school shooting of 2021, the latest in a long series of mass shootings at U.S. schools.
Two lawyers for the couple, Shannon Smith and Mariell Lehman, said in a statement the Crumbleys were returning for their arraignment and, ""They are not fleeing from law enforcement.""
But a scheduled 4:30 p.m. (2130 GMT) video arraignment did not take place as planned. 
Neither Smith nor Lehman responded to questions about whether they were in touch with the Crumbleys, if the pair planned to turn themselves in, or if the arraignment was going forward. Calls to the Oakland County Courthouse were not returned. 
The U.S. Marshals Service said its fugitive apprehension team from Detroit was working with the sheriff's office on the search.
Four days before the shooting, Ethan accompanied his father to a gun shop, where James Crumbley bought a semi-automatic handgun, prosecutors said.
Later that day, Ethan posted photos of the gun on social media, writing, ""Just got my new beauty today"" and adding a heart emoji. His mother posted the next day that the two of them were ""testing out his new Christmas present,"" Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald said. 
Michigan law prohibits those under age 18 from buying or possessing firearms, except in limited circumstances such as hunting with a license and a supervising adult.
McDonald told a news conference the charges were intended to ""send a message: that gun owners have a responsibility.""
Whether prosecutors could prove the parents bought the gun for their son could be crucial, one expert said.
Eric Ruben, a law professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, said it would be easier for prosecutors to prevail if they could prove the parents took some direct action that led to the deaths - for example, buying the gun. If they merely failed to act, he said, prosecutors would have to show the parents had some legal duty to the victims.
WARNING SIGNS
Prosecutors described several chilling warning signs in the days leading up to the shooting at Oxford High School, about 40 miles (60 km) north of Detroit. On one day, a teacher saw Ethan Crumbley searching for ammunition on his phone during class and alerted school officials, who left messages for his mother that went unreturned.
In a text message to her son, prosecutors said, Jennifer Crumbley wrote, ""LOL, I'm not mad at you. You have to learn not to get caught.""
The morning of the shooting, a teacher discovered a drawing that Ethan Crumbley had made depicting a handgun, a bullet, and a bleeding figure next to the words ""Blood everywhere"" and ""The thoughts won't stop - help me,"" McDonald said.
James and Jennifer Crumbley were summoned to the school, where they were instructed to get Ethan into counseling within 48 hours, McDonald said. They ""resisted"" the idea of taking their son home from school and did not search his backpack nor ask him about the gun, she said. 
""The notion that a parent could read those words and also know that their son had access to a deadly weapon that they gave him is unconscionable, and I think it's criminal,"" McDonald said.
Ethan Crumbley was returned to class and later walked out of a bathroom with the gun, killing four students and injuring seven other people, authorities said.
When news of an active shooter at the school broke, Jennifer Crumbley sent Ethan a text message, urging him, ""Don't do it,"" according to prosecutors.
James Crumbley, meanwhile, drove straight home to check whether the gun was there before calling police to report that it was missing and that his son might be the shooter, McDonald said. The gun had been stored in an unlocked drawer in the parents' bedroom.
Unlike some states, Michigan does not legally require gun owners to keep their firearms secured from children. 

Ethan Crumbley has been charged as an adult, even though he is under 18.

WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones of at least nine U.S. State Department employees were hacked by an unknown assailant using sophisticated spyware developed by the Israel-based NSO Group, according to four people familiar with the matter.
The hacks, which took place in the last several months, hit U.S. officials either based in Uganda or focused on matters concerning the East African country, two of the sources said. 
The intrusions, first reported here, represent the widest known hacks of U.S. officials through NSO technology. Previously, a list of numbers with potential targets including some American officials surfaced in reporting on NSO, but it was not clear whether intrusions were always tried or succeeded.
Reuters could not determine who launched the latest cyberattacks. 
NSO Group said in a statement on Thursday that it did not have any indication their tools were used but canceled access for the relevant customers and would investigate based on the Reuters inquiry. 
""If our investigation shall show these actions indeed happened with NSO's tools, such customer will be terminated permanently and legal actions will take place,"" said an NSO spokesperson, who added that NSO will also ""cooperate with any relevant government authority and present the full information we will have.""
NSO has long said it only sells its products to government law enforcement and intelligence clients, helping them to monitor security threats, and is not directly involved in surveillance operations. 
Officials at the Uganda embassy in Washington did not comment. A spokesperson for Apple declined to comment. 
A State Department spokesperson declined to comment on the intrusions, instead pointing to the Commerce Department's recent decision to place the Israeli company on an entity list, making it harder for U.S. companies to do business with them. 
NSO Group and another spyware firm were ""added to the Entity List based on a determination that they developed and supplied spyware to foreign governments that used this tool to maliciously target government officials, journalists, businesspeople, activists, academics, and embassy workers,"" the Commerce Department said in an announcement last month. 
EASILY IDENTIFIABLE 
NSO software is capable of not only capturing encrypted messages, photos and other sensitive information from infected phones, but also turning them into recording devices to monitor surroundings, based on product manuals reviewed by Reuters. 
Apple's alert to affected users did not name the creator of the spyware used in this hack. 
The victims notified by Apple included American citizens and were easily identifiable as U.S. government employees because they associated email addresses ending in state.gov with their Apple IDs, two of the people said. 
They and other targets notified by Apple in multiple countries were infected through the same graphics processing vulnerability that Apple did not learn about and fix until September, the sources said. 
Since at least February, this software flaw allowed some NSO customers to take control of iPhones simply by sending invisible yet tainted iMessage requests to the device, researchers who investigated the espionage campaign said. 
The victims would not see or need to interact with a prompt for the hack to be successful. Versions of NSO surveillance software, commonly known as Pegasus, could then be installed.
Apple's announcement that it would notify victims came on the same day it sued NSO Group last week, accusing it of helping numerous customers break into Apple's mobile software, iOS. 
In a public response, NSO has said its technology helps stop terrorism and that they've installed controls to curb spying against innocent targets. 
For example, NSO says its intrusion system cannot work on phones with U.S. numbers beginning with the country code +1. 
But in the Uganda case, the targeted State Department employees were using iPhones registered with foreign telephone numbers, said two of the sources, without the U.S. country code.
Uganda has been roiled this year by an election with reported irregularities, protests and a government crackdown. U.S. officials have tried to meet with opposition leaders, drawing ire from the Ugandan government. Reuters has no evidence the hacks were related to current events in Uganda.
A senior Biden administration official, speaking on condition he not be identified, said the threat to U.S. personnel abroad was one of the reasons the administration was cracking down on companies such as NSO and pursuing new global discussion about spying limits. 
The official added that the government has seen ""systemic abuse"" in multiple countries involving NSO's Pegasus spyware.
Sen. Ron Wyden, who is on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said: ""Companies that enable their customers to hack U.S. government employees are a threat to America's national security and should be treated as such.""
Historically, some of NSO Group's best-known past clients included Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Mexico.
The Israeli Ministry of Defense must approve export licenses for NSO, which has close ties to Israel's defense and intelligence communities, to sell its technology internationally.

In a statement, the Israeli embassy in Washington said that targeting American officials would be a serious breach of its rules.
""Cyber products like the one mentioned are supervised and licensed to be exported to governments only for purposes related to counter-terrorism and severe crimes,"" an embassy spokesperson said. ""The licensing provisions are very clear and if these claims are true, it is a severe violation of these provisions.""

China announced in March broad changes to the former British colony's electoral system, reducing the number of directly elected representatives and increasing the number of Beijing-approved officials in an expanded legislature.
Candidates in the election, scheduled for Dec. 19 after being postponed for more than a year due to the coronavirus, are also vetted for their patriotism.
""Just ignore them,"" Law said in an interview from London at  the  Reuters Next conference. ""We should not give any legitimacy to the election, we should not pretend we have an election - it is just a selection by Beijing.""
A spokesman for the Chinese embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Law's remarks. Hong Kong's chief executive Carrie Lam said in September that the aim of changes to the electoral system is to ensure ""patriots administer Hong Kong.""
China has said Law is a ""criminal suspect wanted by the Hong Kong police"" for national security offences.
In the interview, Law, who fled Hong Kong in 2020 and was granted asylum by the United Kingdom, cast Chinese President Xi Jinping as an ""emperor"" who tolerated no dissent.
The system of democracy in Hong Kong, he said, was dead but its spirit lived on in the hearts of the people.

""Democracy, if you are talking about a system, it is definitely not there - but if you are talking about the spirit of the people, fighting for democracy, it is still there.""

(Reuters) -The Gateway Pundit, a far-right news site, has used its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page - with more than 630,000 followers - to post bogus stories alleging the 2020 election was stolen from former President Donald Trump. Some commenters responded with threats of violence.
After Gateway Pundit posted a June story on Facebook that included debunked claims of voter fraud in Arizona, a commenter said the governor and secretary of state should be “fed feet first through a woodchipper.” A story featuring false claims of vote-rigging in Fulton County, Georgia, drew comments on Facebook calling for an election worker to be hanged or “shot for treason.”
For years, Facebook has imposed sanctions on Gateway Pundit’s account to limit the spread of its misinformation. But Gateway Pundit still uses its Facebook page to amplify its reporting and raise money: The page features a prominent appeal asking readers to buy subscriptions to support its “battle for survival.”
Gateway Pundit’s continuing presence on Facebook illustrates the platform’s worldwide struggle to stop the spread of disinformation and to balance content-policing with free-speech concerns. Facebook has taken a barrage of criticism this year from critics and a company whistleblower who say its practices stoke anger and division to increase user engagement.
In a statement to Reuters, Facebook said it seeks to label misinformation and “reduce its spread.” The company uses fact checkers and artificial intelligence to identify false or misleading material and warns readers who try to share it. Facebook partners with about 80 organizations, including Reuters, to independently fact-check content that appears on its site.
Facebook said repeat offenders, such as the Gateway Pundit, are subject to tougher sanctions, including having their posts pushed to the bottom of users’ news feeds (the lists of posts they see), and being barred from Facebook’s content-promotion services.
But Facebook almost never removes the offending posts or shuts down the pages – that happens only in rare circumstances, such as posts pushing COVID misinformation, the company says. Sites that directly threaten violence also may be shut down, but account holders are not held responsible for comments on their pages.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) has taken a more aggressive approach with Gateway Pundit, permanently suspending the @gatewaypundit account of Jim Hoft, the site’s founder and editor, as well as the account of his twin brother, Joe Hoft, a writer. 
Jim Hoft declined a request for comment; Joe Hoft did not respond to comment requests.
Facebook and Twitter both have been blasted by right-leaning politicians for what they call censorship of conservative voices. Jim Hoft testified in a 2018 congressional hearing that his site’s traffic from Facebook had tanked after the platform imposed restrictions on the spread of the Pundit’s content, saying such sanctions make “book burning” look benign.
Yet Gateway Pundit’s traffic has boomed: In the wake of the 2020 election, it peaked at nearly 50 million visits a month, according to one estimate, illustrating the power of viral disinformation. Reuters found the site’s often-debunked election-fraud claims were cited in about 100 of more than 800 threatening or harassing messages sent to election officials since last November.
Facebook has long recognized Gateway Pundit as a source of false and divisive content. A July 2019 internal report on “potential misinformation and polarization risks” listed the site as one of Facebook’s “common misinfo offenders.” The report was among a cache of documents provided to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress by Frances Haugen, a former Facebook product manager who left the company in May and has been a leading public critic of its practices.

Reuters identified a dozen Gateway Pundit stories on Facebook that contained baseless election-fraud claims, two of which Facebook labeled as containing false information. Under four of those stories, nine Facebook users called for the execution of election workers or officials. Only one of those four stories was flagged by Facebook for containing false information. 
In August, Gateway Pundit reported that a Milwaukee official had been threatened after being featured in Pundit stories alleging voter fraud. The result? Even more threats. On the site’s Facebook page, one reader commented: “There is only one punishment acceptable for traitors, being drawn and quartered.”

VIENNA (Reuters) - Indirect U.S.-Iranian talks on saving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal broke off until next week as European officials voiced dismay on Friday at sweeping demands by Iran's new, hardline government.
The seventh round of talks in Vienna is the first with delegates sent by Iran's anti-Western President Ebrahim Raisi on how to resuscitate the agreement under which Iran limited its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions.
Raisi's election in June caused a five-month hiatus in the talks, heightening suspicions among U.S. and European officials that Iran is playing for time while advancing its nuclear program.
""Iran right now does not seem to be serious about doing what's necessary to return to compliance, which is why we ended this round of talks in Vienna,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the Reuters Next Conference.
""If the path to a return to compliance with the agreement turns out to be a dead-end, we will pursue other options,"" he added, without elaborating.
Diplomats said the Iranian delegation had proposed sweeping changes to a text that was painstakingly negotiated in previous rounds and that European officials had said was 70-80% finished.
'DISAPPOINTMENT AND CONCERN'
""Over five months ago, Iran interrupted negotiations. Since then, Iran has fast-forwarded its nuclear program. This week, it has back-tracked on diplomatic progress made,"" senior officials from France, Britain and Germany said in a statement, adding that Iran was demanding ""major changes"" to the text.
It is ""unclear how these new gaps can be closed in a realistic time frame"", they added.
The three European powers expressed ""disappointment and concern"" at Iran's demands, some of which they said were incompatible with the deal's terms or went beyond them.
The 2015 agreement imposed strict limits on Iran's uranium enrichment activities, extending the time it would need to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb, if it chose to, to at least a year from around two to three months. Most experts say that period is now shorter than before the deal.
Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons, saying it only wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.
In exchange for the nuclear restrictions, the 2015 deal struck by Iran and six major powers - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States - lifted many U.S., European Union and U.N. sanctions on the Islamic Republic.
After more than two years of Iranian adherence to the core curbs, however, then-President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the deal in 2018, calling it too soft on Tehran, and reimposed painful U.S. economic sanctions on Tehran.
Tehran retaliated from 2019 by breaching many of the deal's limits on enrichment and other restrictions, and advancing well beyond them. With the deal's nuclear benefits now badly eroded, some Western officials say there is little time left before the foundation of the deal is damaged beyond repair.
French President Emmanuel Macron said he thought it likely the current round of talks would not succeed and appeared to look beyond them, hinting at involving more nations, such as Gulf Arab states, in a wider discussion if the Vienna talks fail.
""I think it's very difficult to find an agreement if the Gulf countries, Israel, all those whose security is directly affected, don't take part,"" he told reporters in Dubai.
FIRM STANCE
Iranian nuclear negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani's uncompromising stance is that since Washington left the deal, it should make the first move by lifting all sanctions imposed on Tehran since then, even those unrelated to Tehran's nuclear activities.
Bagheri Kani told Reuters on Monday the United States and its Western allies also should offer guarantees to Iran that no new sanctions would be imposed on it in future.
However, he left the door ajar for more talks by saying European nations could propose their own drafts for discussion, Iranian state media reported.

Western negotiators take a return to the original deal as their base line, meaning if Iran wants sanctions relief beyond it, Tehran should accept more nuclear restrictions.
The talks, in which others shuttle between U.S. and Iranian diplomats because Iran refuses to meet face-to-face with U.S. officials, will resume midweek.

DUBAI (Reuters) -The United Arab Emirates ordered 80 Rafale fighter jets and 12 military helicopters on Friday, deepening economic and political ties with France through an arms contract worth 17 billion euros ($19.20 billion).
The largest ever overseas sale of the French warplane was sealed as French President Emmanuel Macron began a two-day trip to the Gulf, during which he will also visit Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
""These contracts are important for the economy and create jobs in France. What is good for French men and women, I defend ardently,"" Macron told reporters, dismissing concerns by activists that French arms sales in the Gulf were fuelling conflicts in the region.
The French presidency said the deal, signed at a ceremony between Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan (MBZ) and Macron on the sidelines of the Dubai Expo 2020, is worth $19 billion.
The first French warplanes will be delivered from 2027, officials, and would create some 7,000 jobs. 
Macron's visit comes at a time when Gulf Arab states have voiced uncertainty about the United States' focus on the region even as they seek more weapons from their key security ally.
The French leader has forged a good relationship with MBZ with investments flowing between the two countries. Paris has a permanent military base in the Emirati capital.
Shares in Dassault Aviation SA , the Rafale's maker, rose more than 9%. 
It is the biggest bulk purchase of the Dassault-made Rafale, other than by the French army, and comes after deals in Greece, Egypt and Croatia this year.
Abu Dhabi also ordered 12 Caracal helicopters. It is the French code name for the H225M, the multirole military version of the Super Puma. 
The on-off negotiations for the Rafale fighter jets took more than a decade with Abu Dhabi publicly rebuffing France's offer to supply 60 Rafale jets in 2011 as ""uncompetitive and unworkable"". Abu Dhabi already has French-built Mirage 2000 warplanes.
""This French commitment in the region, this active cooperation in the fight against terrorism, the clear positions we have taken mean that we have increased our proximity to the UAE,"" Macron said.
""And at a time when they undoubtedly asked themselves more questions about other historical partners ... I think that this strengthens France's position,"" he said referring to the United States. 
Defence sources said the Rafale would replace the Mirage 2000 fleet but is unlikely to displace the American-built F-35 as the UAE continues to hedge its security with two major suppliers, France and the United States.
The deal could nonetheless be seen as a signal of impatience as the U.S. Congress hesitates on approving an F-35 deal amid concerns about the UAE's relationship with China, including the prevalence of Huawei 5G technology in the country.
""That says a lot about the extraordinary aura that Abu Dhabi has acquired over Paris' ideological and strategic thinking — It is the first time that a close U.S. partner in the Arab world will rely more on French technology than American technology,"" said Jalel Harchaoui, a senior fellow at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime.
Paris is one of the UAE's main arms' suppliers, but it has faced increasing pressure to review its sales because of the conflict between a Saudi-led coalition and the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen, which has become one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.

""France is going ahead with these sales despite the UAE playing a leading role in the atrocity-marred military operations led by the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen,"" Human Rights Watch said in a statement. ""The French president should denounce the human rights violations in these three counties.

KYIV (Reuters) - Russia has massed more than 94,000 troops near Ukraine's borders and may be gearing up for a large-scale military offensive at the end of January, Ukraine's defence minister told parliament on Friday, citing intelligence reports.
Oleksii Reznikov said Ukraine would not do anything to provoke the situation but was ready to fight back if Russia launched an attack. He said Ukraine was pressing ahead with the construction of two naval bases on its south coast.
""Our intelligence analyses all scenarios, including the worst,"" Reznikov said. ""It notes that the likelihood of a large-scale escalation from Russia exists. The most likely time to reach readiness for an escalation will be the end of January.""
Ukraine and its NATO allies have sounded the alarm about Russian troop movements near Ukraine's borders this year, sparking worries that a simmering conflict in eastern Ukraine could erupt into open war.
Moscow has in turn accused Ukraine and the United States of destabilising behaviour and suggested that Kyiv might be preparing to launch its own offensive in eastern Ukraine, which the Ukrainian authorities strongly deny. 
The deputy speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament denied Moscow was planning any offensive operation in eastern Ukraine and said Moscow would do all it could to prevent a major escalation in the region, the Interfax news agency reported.
Kremlin's foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov was also dismissive. ""It's nonsense, there is no any escalation. We have the rights to move the troops on our territory,"" he told reporters.
Ukraine has pressed its European Union and NATO allies this week to prepare a tough package of sanctions to ward off a Russia offensive. 
Reznikov said Ukraine was pressing ahead with building the naval bases as part of a defence deal with Britain. 
One base will be located in Ochakiv, to the west of the Crimea peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014, and the other in Berdyansk to the east of Crimea.
""Among the priorities are the missile programme and the development of the fleet,"" Reznikov told parliament. ""We are moving on to the practical stage of building two military bases - in Berdyansk and Ochakiv - and other contracts within the framework of agreements with the United Kingdom.""
VIDEO CALL
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Moscow on Thursday of the ""severe costs"" Russia would pay in case of an escalation, urging his Russian counterpart to seek a diplomatic exit from the crisis.
Blinken said it was likely that Presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin would speak soon. 
Work is under way to arrange a video call between them, the Kremlin said on Friday, a day after their top diplomats met to discuss Ukraine.
Ukraine's ties with Russia collapsed in 2014 after Moscow-backed forces seized territory in eastern Ukraine that Kyiv wants back. Kyiv says some 14,000 people have been killed in fighting since then.
Since the latest crisis started, Moscow has set out demands for legally binding security guarantees from the West that NATO will not admit Ukraine as a member or deploy missile systems there to target Russia.

Ukraine says Russia has no say over its ambitions to join the NATO alliance and dismissed any security guarantees as illegitimate. 
""Escalation is a likely scenario, but not inevitable, and our task is to prevent it,"" Reznikov said. ""We must make the price of escalation unacceptable for the aggressor.""

The new sanctions aim to pile pressure on Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, who is accused by Western governments of rigging a presidential election, ordering a massive crackdown on the opposition and pushing Middle East migrants towards the border with Poland. He denies the accusations.
""We have repeatedly said that all unfriendly anti-Belarusian steps will be followed by appropriate measures of response. The new round of sanctions is no exception,"" the Belarusian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
It also called for dialogue with the West. 
""Our economy is under external pressure on an unprecedented scale and depth,"" Belarus' state news agency Belta quoted Lukashenko as saying. ""Aggressive rhetoric persists.""
Lukashenko said Belarus had managed to maintain economic growth. The economy contracted by 0.9% last year, and the World Bank expects it to grow by 1.2% in 2021, according to October projections. 
Belarusian authorities need to ensure that inflation drops to 6% in 2022, Lukashenko said, down from 10.5% as of Nov. 1.
""We plan to have single-digit inflation at 6% in 2022,"" he said. 

Shares of global potash producers rose on Thursday after sanctions on Belarus Potash Company (BPC), which is the exporting arm of Belarusian state potash producer Belaruskali and Minsk's main foreign currency earner.
After the sanctions were imposed, BPC said on Friday it would work within existing legal frameworks, but did not elaborate.

BEIJING (Reuters) - As U.S. President Joe Biden prepares to host more than 100 participants in the initial ""Summit for Democracy"", China - which was not invited - has increasingly talked up the advantages of its own ""whole-process democracy"". 
Chinese state media and diplomats in recent weeks have ramped up criticism of democracy in the United States, touting what they describe as preferable outcomes in its system of ""socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics"" on measures ranging from COVID-19 management to social mobility.
Communist Party-ruled China, widely considered to have become increasingly authoritarian under President Xi Jinping, first used the phrase ""whole-process democracy"" in 2019, and the concept was enshrined in law this past March.
China was not asked to take part in the Dec. 9-10 event hosted by Biden, but Beijing-claimed Taiwan was.
Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng described the Washington event as the ""very opposite of democracy"" because, he said, it is divisive and ""points fingers"" at other countries.
""China's whole-process people's democracy is not the kind that wakes up at the time of voting and goes back to dormant afterwards,"" Le told foreign media at an event in Beijing on Thursday.
China, which will release a white paper on democracy on Saturday, defines its version as consultative, with voting permitted at the very local level and public feedback collected before any law is implemented. 
The definition does not include an independent judiciary, free media, or universal suffrage for national office.
Zhang Weiwei, director of the China Institute at Fudan University, said at the same event that it is ""too naive"" to equate democracy with elections, which can be manipulated by interest groups, money, or disinformation on social media.
China's boosterism for its own political model is intended to strengthen political legitimacy domestically while expanding its appeal to developing countries, several foreign analysts said, just as it prepares to stage the Winter Olympics in February amid Western criticism over its human rights record.

""Xi has long used the claim that party's governance is superior to that of the West in order to legitimise the party's monopoly of power,"" Charles Parton, a former British diplomat and a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, told Reuters.
Asked at Thursday's event why Beijing seems obsessed with comparing itself to Washington, Eric Li, a Chinese venture capitalist who founded a current affairs website known for its nationalistic stance, joked: ""We are just unhappy we didn't get invited to the party next week.""

193,"<span>Dec 03, 2021 06:03AM ET</span>","MOSCOW (Reuters) - The International Space Station (ISS) had to swerve away from a fragment of a U.S. launch vehicle on Friday, the head of Russia's space agency said, the latest in a series of incidents in which space debris have forced astronauts to respond.
Calls to monitor and regulate space debris, or space junk, have grown since Russia conducted an anti-satellite missile test last month. This generated a debris field in orbit that U.S. officials said would pose a hazard to space activities for years.
Dmitry Rogozin, head of Russian space agency Roscosmos, said on Friday that the ISS had been forced to move due to space junk from a U.S. launch vehicle sent into orbit in 1994.
Roscosmos said the station's orbit, in an unscheduled manoeuvre carried out by mission control, dropped by 310 metres (339 yards) for nearly three minutes to avoid a close encounter.
Rogozin added that the manoeuvre would not affect the planned launch of the Soyuz MS-20 rocket on Dec. 8 from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan and its docking at the ISS. 
Space debris consists of discarded launch vehicles or parts of a spacecraft that float around in space and risk colliding with satellites or the ISS. 
In an opinion piece published in the Financial Times on Thursday, former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Russia's destruction of the satellite last month risked turning space into a junk yard.
""Unless we change course, the opportunities of space to improve our lives on Earth could be closed off for generations,"" he wrote.

Space debris also forced NASA on Tuesday to postpone a spacewalk to replace a faulty antenna on the ISS. Last month the ISS performed a brief manoeuvre to dodge a fragment of a defunct Chinese satellite.
In separate comments on Friday, Roscosmos said it hoped NASA chief Bill Nelson would visit Russia in the first half of 2022 to discuss further cooperation on the ISS.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The migrant crisis on the Belarus-Polish border has caused logistics problems for Russian food producers, who are suffering losses and risk having to temporarily stop production if the situation worsens. 
Poland has closed several border crossings with Belarus for cargo transport as the European Union has accused Minsk of manufacturing a standoff with the West by pushing migrants, mostly from the Middle East, to illegally cross its borders. 
Long tailbacks of trucks have formed at the four functioning Poland-Belarus border crossings out of a total of six. Lithuania's six crossings are open, the Belarusian border service says.
The trucks transport goods and raw materials to Belarus and to Russia where they are used by food producers. 
At any one time there are 400-600 trucks at the crossings into Belarus from Poland, slowing down normal waiting times of 12-24 hours to 2-4 days, a Russian market source told Reuters.
That has driven up transport costs because every day spent waiting costs 500 euros. Using a different crossing route costs 300-400 euros, the source said.
The losses faced by Russian importers are so far not large, said another market source. They had been getting worse last week but improved slightly this week, the source said. 
""If the situation gets worse, it threatens to break the supply chain and factories will grind to a standstill,"" the source said. 
The tailbacks going in the opposite direction have already worsened, the source said. 
A lobby group that includes Mars, Pepsi, Danone, Nestle, CocaCola, Metro, TetraPak appealed to the Russian government on Nov. 18 to intervene, a letter seen by Reuters showed. 
""The continuation of the current situation could have a significant impact on supply chains and the availability of goods for the public, including essential goods, especially given the increased cargo volumes and heightened demand in the run-up to the New Year holidays,"" the group, the Foreign Investment Advisory Council, wrote. 
Deputy Prime Ministr Andrey Belousov's office, to whom the letter was addressed, said it would look into the situation. The Transport Ministry declined to comment. 

Around 10% of all Russia's imports pass through Belarus and Poland, the letter said. 
Similar border tailbacks have built up on the Belarusian side of the border with the European Union, data from the Belarusian border service shows. There are 400-700 vehicles waiting at the border at any one moment, the data said.

The Taliban has been under pressure from the international community, who have mostly frozen funds for Afghanistan, to commit to upholding women's rights since the hardline Islamist group took over the country on Aug. 15.
""A woman is not a property, but a noble and free human being; no one can give her to anyone in exchange for peace...or to end animosity,"" the Taliban decree, released by spokesman Zabihillah Muhajid, said. 
It set out the rules governing marriage and property for women, stating women should not be forced into marriage and widows should have share in their late husband's property. 
Courts should take into account the rules when making decisions, and religious affairs and information ministries should promote these rights, the decree said.
However, it made no mention of women being able to work or access facilities outside the home or education, which have been major concerns from the international community. 
During its previous rule from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban banned women from leaving the house without a male relative and full face and head covering and girls from receiving education.
The Taliban say they have changed and high schools for girls in some provinces have been allowed to open. But many women and rights advocates remain sceptical. 

The international community, which has frozen billions in central bank funds and development spending, has made women's rights a key element of any future engagement with Afghanistan.
The country, which is also suffering from a banking liquidity crisis as the cash flow dries up due to sanctions, is facing the risk of economic collapse since the Taliban took over.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating sexual harassment claims made against former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, according to a document made available by the state of New York on Thursday.
The document in question provides details of a contract approved by New York officials earlier in the week for legal services to assist the current governor's office in responding to multiple state and federal investigations into the Cuomo administration's affairs.
""DOJ has also undertaken an inquiry related to sexual harassment claims made against the then governor,"" the contract says.
In addition to the sexual harassment allegations, the record noted that Cuomo faced other inquiries into his administration's handling of coronavirus-related deaths in nursing homes. The DOJ decided against opening a civil rights investigation into the nursing homes matter last summer. 
Questions have also surfaced over whether Cuomo used state resources to write a book chronicling his leadership during the height of the pandemic and other matters related to the state's COVID-19 response, the document said.
The DOJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Cuomo could not be reached for comment.
The New York Post was first to report news of the contract disclosing the DOJ's probe.
Cuomo, a Democrat, resigned in August after facing mounting legal and political pressure in the wake of a damning report released by state Attorney General Letitia James. The report found he sexually harassed 11 women, tarnishing the legacy of the three-term governor.
An investigation https://www.reuters.com/world/us/cuomo-engaged-sexual-harassment-state-assembly-probe-finds-2021-11-22 by the Democratic-led state Assembly, which threatened impeachment proceedings against him, also found that Cuomo sexually harassed women, used state resources for the book and released murky numbers on COVID-19 deaths at nursing homes.
Cuomo has steadfastly denied the allegations made against him. In August he said he accepted ""full responsibility"" for what he characterized as ill-conceived attempts to be affectionate or humorous, but said he would resign for the good of the state.

The former governor contends that the investigation led by James was politically motivated. His lawyer Rita Galvin has called on James, who has declared her candidacy for governor, to recuse herself from any investigations involving Cuomo.
The current governor, Kathy Hochul, signed an agreement in October to retain the services of New York firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher. Her office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States is tracking enough indicators and warnings surrounding Russian military activity near Ukraine to trigger ""a lot of concern"" and Russian rhetoric appears increasingly strident, the top U.S. military officer said late on Thursday. 
Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, declined to speculate about the kinds of options the United States might consider in the event of a Russian invasion. But Milley, in some of his most extensive remarks on the crisis, stressed the importance of Ukraine's sovereignty to Washington and to the NATO alliance.
""There's significant national security interests of the United States and of NATO member states at stake here if there was an overt act of aggressive action militarily by the Russians into a nation state that has been independent since 1991,"" Milley said during a flight from Seoul to Washington.
Ukraine says Russia has amassed more than 90,000 troops near their long shared border. But Moscow has dismissed suggestions it is preparing for an attack on its southern neighbor and has defended its right to deploy troops on its own territory as it sees fit.
The Kremlin already annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and then backed rebels fighting Kyiv government forces in the east of the country. That conflict has killed 14,000 people, Kyiv says, and is still simmering.
Experts caution that an unchallenged Russian invasion could be destabilizing, creating ripple effects well beyond Ukraine at a time of increasing anxiety over Chinese intentions toward Taiwan.
Milley declined to state publicly his estimate of the number of Russian forces near Ukraine but suggested his concerns went beyond the raw numbers of Russian troops.
""I'm not going to tell you what we track and the indicators or warnings from an intelligence standpoint, but we track them all,"" Milley said. ""And there's enough out there now to cause a lot of concern, and we'll continue to monitor."" Russia and Ukraine have centuries of shared history and formed the two biggest republics of the Soviet Union until its 1991 collapse, so Moscow views its neighbor's ambition to join NATO as an affront and a threat.
Since the latest crisis started, Moscow has set out demands for legally binding security guarantees from the West, and for assurances that NATO will not admit Ukraine as a member or deploy missile systems there to target Russia.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Moscow on Thursday of ""severe costs"" if it invaded Ukraine, urging his Russian counterpart to seek a diplomatic exit from the crisis.
Milley declined to speculate whether Russian President Vladimir Putin might be emboldened by U.S. President Joe Biden's withdrawal from Afghanistan, saying ""You'd have to ask Putin."" The August pullout ended America's two-decade-old war in an unambiguous defeat, with the Taliban returning to power.

""I think it would be a mistake for any country to draw a broad strategic conclusion based on the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and then take that event and automatically apply it to other situations,"" Milley said.
He cited historic examples of past U.S. presidents who withdrew troops in some places but ordered military action elsewhere. ""So the United States is a difficult country for other countries to understand sometimes,"" he said.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Alec Baldwin on Thursday denied responsibility for the fatal shooting of a cinematographer on the set of his Western movie ""Rust,"" saying he would have killed himself if he believed it was his fault.
In an emotional television interview, the actor said he did not pull the trigger on the gun he was holding during a rehearsal, and that he did not think he would be criminally charged in the case.
“I feel someone is responsible for what happened, but I know it isn't me. I might have killed myself if I thought I was responsible, and I don't say that lightly,” Baldwin told ABC television's George Stephanopoulos in his first public comments about the Oct. 21 shooting on the set near Santa Fe, New Mexico. 
Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed and director Joel Souza was wounded when the gun fired off a live bullet.
The incident, including how live ammunition made its way to the set, is still being investigated by authorities in New Mexico. No criminal charges have been filed.
Baldwin had been told the gun was ""safe"" by crew members in charge of checking weapons.
""I've been told by people in the know... that it is highly unlikely I would be charged with anything criminally,"" Baldwin said.
Baldwin said he ""would never point a gun at anyone and pull a trigger at them.""
In his first public description of what happened, he said the Colt revolver went off when he was cocking the gun and rehearsing camera angles with Hutchins.
“In this scene, I am going to cock the gun. I said, ‘Do you want to see that?’ And she said yes. So I take the gun and I start to cock the gun. I’m not going to pull the trigger. I said, ‘Did you see that?’ She said, 'Well just cheat it down and tilt it down a little bit like that'. And I cocked the gun and go, ‘Can you see that? Can you see that? And I let go of the hammer of the gun and the gun goes off.” 
Baldwin said he first thought Hutchins had fainted and it wasn't until hours later that he was told she had died. He said he ""couldn't imagine"" ever making a movie that involved guns again.
The actor, best known for TV comedy series ""30 Rock,"" has been widely criticized for not checking the gun thoroughly himself. But he insisted in the interview that was not the actor's job.

“When that person who was charged with that job, handed me the weapon, I trusted them... In the 40 years I've been in this business all the way up until that day, I've never had a problem,"" he said.
Two crew members have filed civil lawsuits accusing Baldwin, the producers and others of negligence and lax safety protocols on the set. But Baldwin said he ""did not observe any safety or security issues at all in the time I was there.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Migrant shelters in northern Mexico said on Thursday they fear they will be overwhelmed by an influx of asylum seekers next week when the United States resumes a Trump-era program to return them to Mexico.
U.S. President Joe Biden had tried to end the policy as part of a more humanitarian approach to migration, but federal courts ordered a reboot of the so-called Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), which require asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for U.S. immigration hearings. Mexico said Thursday it had agreed to a restart https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-restart-trump-era-border-program-forcing-asylum-seekers-wait-mexico-2021-12-02.
The returns will likely begin Monday at a single border crossing and eventually expand to a total of seven.
Shelter directors said that could spark an influx of people to their facilities at a time of record migration from Latin America and the Caribbean.
""We are saturated with the arrival of Haitians ... Central Americans and hundreds of Mexicans displaced by violence,"" said Jose Garcia, director of the Juventud 2000 shelter in Tijuana, one of the cities where asylum seekers are expected to be sent.
The coronavirus pandemic had already forced him to reduce capacity, he added.
Local officials also expressed concern about where funding will come from to absorb migrants waiting for U.S. hearings.
""The federal government hasn't notified us that it will help out with a bigger budget,"" said Carmen Canturosa, mayor of Nuevo Laredo, a border city notorious for crime and violence.
Both U.S. and Mexican officials said the United States will address Mexico's humanitarian concerns about the revamped program. Still, rights' advocates say the policy exposes migrants to serious risks.
""They are returning them to cities that represent a danger to these families due to criminal and cartel violence,"" said Fernando Garcia, director of the Border Network for Human Rights in El Paso, Texas.
Since the program began in 2019, tens of thousands of people have been sent back to Mexican border cities, where many waited months and sometimes years in makeshift camps or bare-bones shelters without access to jobs or schools. 

Guatemalan migrant Andrea Lopez said it made her sad to think of more asylum seekers being put in her situation. She has spent the last several months in an encampment in Tijuana with her two children after requesting asylum across the border. 
""We can't even work,"" she said. ""Everything here is very dangerous.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - Beijing took umbrage on Thursday at the suspension of Women's Tennis Association (WTA) tournaments in China in solidarity with Peng Shuai after the player made a sexual assault accusation then disappeared from public view.
Foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin did not directly mention the WTA but pointedly said China ""opposes the politicization of sports"".
In an editorial, the Global Times newspaper, published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily, said the WTA was betraying the Olympic spirit and bringing politics into tennis. 
""Some forces in the West are instigating a boycott against the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics,"" it added, referring to the February event which some rights groups want boycotted over China's human rights record. 
Peng, a former world No. 1 doubles player, was unseen in public for nearly three weeks after she posted a message on social media in early November accusing China's former Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli of forcing her into sex.
Neither Zhang, who retired in 2018, nor the government have commented on Peng's accusation and the topic has been blocked on China's heavily censored internet.
The men's equivalent body, the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), weighed in on Thursday saying Peng's situation raised serious concerns within and beyond the sport.
""The response to those concerns has so far fallen short. We again urge for a line of open direct communication between the player and the WTA in order to establish a clearer picture of her situation,"" said ATP Chairman Andrea Gaudenzi.
Peng, a three-time Olympian, did appear in mid-November at a dinner with friends and a children's tennis tournament in Beijing, photographs and videos published by Chinese state media and by the tournament's organisers showed.
And the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it had held a second video call with the 35-year-old player on Wednesday following one late last month.
The IOC said it had offered her support, would stay in regular touch, and had agreed a personal meeting in January. She appeared to be ""safe and well, given the difficult situation she is in"", it added in its statement on Thursday.
'BIGGER THINGS THAN TENNIS' 
Unconvinced, however, the U.S.-headquartered WTA wants further assurances of her wellbeing and an investigation before it returns to the lucrative Chinese market.
""While we now know where Peng is, I have serious doubts that she is free, safe, and not subject to censorship, coercion, and intimidation,"" chief executive Steve Simon said on Wednesday, suggesting she was pressured to retract her allegation. 
Equality for women would suffer a setback if powerful people could suppress accusations of assault, he added. ""I am also greatly concerned about the risks that all of our players and staff could face if we were to hold events in China in 2022.""
Simon told CNN on Thursday that he had received an email from Peng but said he thought it was ""100% orchestrated"" and did not reflect her ""true position.""
From former women's greats Billie Jean King and Martina Navratilova to men's No. 1 Novak Djokovic, many in the tennis world https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/tennis-reaction-wta-suspending-events-china-over-peng-concerns-2021-12-02 applauded the WTA, which stands to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in TV and sponsorship revenue. [L4N2SN2EV]
""Really strong stance. Far bigger things in the world than a game of tennis,"" said Australian player John Millman.
The WTA had been fast expanding into China, where local interest was fuelled when Li Na won the 2011 French Open.
China hosted just two WTA events in 2008 but 11 years later was staging nine - including the WTA Tour finals - though the pandemic forced the cancellation of all but one this year and last. 
Another major global tennis body, the International Tennis Federation, also said it stood with women's rights and that Peng's allegations must be addressed. 

Peng posted in early November that Gaoli had coerced her into sex and they later had an on-off consensual relationship. The message was deleted half an hour later.
Sexual harassment and assault were for years rarely broached in public in China until a #MeToo movement began in 2018, when a student accused her professor of sexual harassment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden and his wife Jill participated in the National Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony outside the White House on Thursday, helping to usher in the holiday season.
In a program that featured performances by singers Patti LaBelle, Billy Porter, and Kristin Chenoweth, the president presided over a countdown that ended with a brightly lit tree with a shining star on top.
Biden said the evergreen tree ""reminds us that even in the coldest, darkest days of winter that life and abundance will return.""
The president, who unveiled hnew measures to fight the COVID-19 pandemic during the winter on Thursday, cited those who had lost loved ones to the deadly coronavirus and paid tribute to members of the military and their families.
""Jill and I are especially grateful to our service members and their families,"" Biden said. ""We also keep in our hearts those who lost loved ones because of this virus or any other cruel twist of fate or accident.""

The Bidens are spending their first holiday season in the White House as president and first lady. Earlier this week, holiday decorations were unveiled.
On Wednesday, Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, celebrated Hanukkah with the lighting of a menorah at the White House.

(Reuters) -The Biden administration will restart a contentious Trump-era border program that forces asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for U.S. immigration hearings, in keeping with a federal court order, U.S. and Mexican officials said on Thursday.
President Joe Biden, a Democrat, has struggled in his first year in office to reverse many hardline immigration policies put in place by his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, and is facing a record number of migrant arrests at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Biden ended https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-protocols/u-s-ends-program-sending-asylum-seekers-to-mexico-to-wait-for-court-hearings-idUSKBN29Q03X the Trump policy known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) soon after his inauguration in January as part of a promise to implement what he called a more humane approach to immigration. But a federal judge ruled Biden's rescission did not follow proper procedure and in August ordered the policy's reinstatement. The U.S. government said it had to wait for Mexico's agreement before restarting MPP. 
""The United States accepted all the conditions that we set out,"" said one Mexican official.
The United States will take steps to address Mexico's humanitarian concerns about the program, the U.S. and Mexican officials said, including offering COVID-19 vaccines to returning migrants and exempting more categories of people deemed vulnerable.
Migrants also will be asked if they have a fear of persecution or torture in Mexico before being enrolled in the program, and have access to legal representation, U.S. officials said during a call with reporters on Thursday.
Immigration advocates say MPP exposed migrants to violence and kidnappings in dangerous border cities, where people camped out as they waited for their hearings.
Any migrant from the Western Hemisphere could be placed in the reworked MPP program, one of the U.S. officials said. The number of Haitians and Venezuelans caught at the U.S.-Mexico border has jumped in the past year, adding to large numbers of Mexican and Central American crossers.
At the same time, the Biden administration is still trying to end the MPP program, issuing a new rescission memo in the hopes it will resolve the court's legal concerns. 
Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in October that the Trump program had ""endemic flaws"" and ""unjustifiable human costs.""
The U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, has called for ending the program, saying it puts asylum seekers at risk and harms their due process rights. 
""The announced adjustments to the policy are not sufficient to address these fundamental concerns,"" UNHCR representative Matthew Reynolds said in a statement.
The policy was a cornerstone of Trump's immigration crackdown. During his administration, tens of thousands of people who entered at the U.S.-Mexico land border were sent back to Mexico to wait months - sometimes years - to present their cases at U.S. immigration hearings held in makeshift courtrooms near the border. Many migrants failed to appear in court amid the long delays and dangers in Mexico.
The MPP program will restart on Monday, likely with a small number of migrants at a single U.S. border crossing, one of the U.S. officials said. Returns to Mexico will eventually take place at seven border crossings in California, Arizona and Texas, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
CONFUSING MIX
The reinstatement of MPP adds to a confusing mix of immigration policies in place at the U.S.-Mexico border, where arrests reached a record 1.7 million in the 2021 fiscal year, which ended in September.
Even as Biden tried to end MPP, his administration continued to implement a Trump-era public health order known as Title 42, which allows border authorities to rapidly expel migrants without giving them a chance to claim asylum. 
Nearly two-thirds of migrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border this fiscal year have been expelled under the Title 42 order. 
Now migrants caught at the U.S.-Mexico border will be evaluated to determine whether they can be quickly expelled under Title 42, one U.S. official said. Those who cannot be expelled will either be returned to Mexico with an MPP court date or released or detained in the United States. 
Exceptions will be made for migrants with health issues, the elderly and those at risk of discrimination in Mexico, particularly based on gender identity and sexual orientation, a different U.S. official said.
The United States and Mexico will arrange transportation for migrants waiting in Mexican shelters so that they can attend their court hearings in the United States, another U.S. official said. 
But local officials in Mexico said many border shelters are already full and overwhelmed. Mexico is also struggling https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-IMMIGRATION/MEXICO/mopankddwva with makeshift migrant encampments that have popped up along the border in the past year.
Migrants with cases in the Texas cities of Laredo and Brownsville will be placed in shelters farther away from the U.S.-Mexico border to avoid security risks in the Mexican border cities of Nuevo Laredo and Matamoros, the U.S. official said.

The Biden administration will dedicate 22 immigration judges to hear MPP cases in an effort to ensure they are completed within 180 days, a separate U.S. official said.
One Mexican official said the government expected under the revised MPP program that 10%-15% of people who cross the border will end up returning to the United States for a court hearing.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The late financier Jeffrey Epstein had ""many, many, many"" female guests at his Palm Beach estate, including two who appeared to be underage, a former employee testified at British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell's sex abuse trial on Thursday.
Juan Alessi, the Palm Beach house manager, took the stand for the prosecution on the fourth day of Maxwell's trial in Manhattan federal court. He said he repeatedly drove two girls who appeared to be 14 or 15 to Epstein's Florida estate. 
One of the girls, now a woman in her early 40s using the pseudonym Jane in court, testified earlier in the week about how Maxwell, a daughter of late media baron Robert Maxwell, groomed her for abuse by Epstein when she was 14. 
Alessi, who managed Epstein's Palm Beach property from 1991 to 2002, said Jane appeared to be 14 or 15 when she first came to the house with her mother in 1994. After that, Alessi said he would drive Jane alone to the home, where she spent time with Maxwell and Epstein. 
He said he saw Jane's name in a directory of massage therapists that he would call to schedule massages for Epstein, sometimes at Maxwell's direction. Jane testified that many of her sexual encounters with Epstein would start as massages before escalating.
Prosecutor Lara Pomerantz has said massages were a ""ruse designed to get young girls to touch Epstein."" 
""I had a Rolodex with all the massage therapists,"" Alessi said. ""Whoever they told me to call, I would."" 
He recalled that when he began working for Epstein the financier would get one massage a day, but years later he would often get three.
Prosecutors say Maxwell recruited and groomed underage girls for Epstein to abuse between 1994 and 2004 and participated in some of the sexual encounters.
Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to eight counts of sex trafficking and other charges. 
Lawyers for Maxwell say prosecutors are scapegoating her because Epstein is no longer alive.
Epstein killed himself at age 66 in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges.
Earlier on Thursday, psychologist Lisa Rocchio testified as an expert witness about how underage victims of sexual abuse are often ""groomed"" by perpetrators they know well, and that many do not disclose abuse until they reach adulthood.
KEEPING SECRETS
In eight hours of often emotional, explicit testimony, Jane said she had sexual encounters with Epstein between the ages of 14 and 16 in Palm Beach and at Epstein's ranch in New Mexico. She said Maxwell participated in many of the encounters. 
Alessi described Jane as ""strikingly beautiful."" He said he once drove Jane, who was carrying luggage, from the Palm Beach home to an airport and watched her board a plane with Epstein, Maxwell and Maxwell's dog, a small Yorkie named Max. 
Maxwell's lawyers have sought to highlight discrepancies between Jane's testimony and her earlier interviews with law enforcement, when she did not discuss Maxwell's role.
They contend that the memories of Jane and three other accusers expected to testify against Maxwell have been corrupted over time, and that they have financial incentives to implicate her. 
Alessi said he saw topless women hanging out by the pool hundreds of times. Jane also recalled seeing topless women by the pool.
He said most female guests were in their twenties, but recalled two who appeared to be underage: Jane, and Virginia Roberts, now known as Virginia Giuffre. 
Giuffre has said she was a victim of Epstein's sex trafficking and abuse from 2000 to 2002, starting when she was 16.
Alessi recalled driving Maxwell to Mar-a-Lago - former U.S. President Donald Trump's Florida property - to meet Giuffre, and that he sometimes drove her to Epstein's home.
Alessi said he found sex toys in Epstein's massage room four or five times after Epstein received massages.
He recalled cleaning one of the toys, which he said ""looked like a huge men's penis with two heads,"" and put it in a basket in Maxwell's bathroom. ""That's the place where it was kept,"" Alessi said. 

He also said he was given a booklet of detailed instructions, warning him to keep Epstein's and Maxwell's activities or whereabouts secret.
""I was supposed to be blind, deaf and dumb,"" Alessi said.

VIENNA/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -The United States and Iran both sounded pessimistic on Thursday about the chances of reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, with Washington saying it had little cause for optimism and Tehran questioning the determination of U.S. and European negotiators.
""I have to tell you, recent moves, recent rhetoric, don't give us a lot of cause for ... optimism,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters in Stockholm, saying he could judge in a day or so if Iran would engage in good faith.
Blinken made the comments after Iran provided the European powers who are shuttling between U.S. and Iranian officials in Vienna with drafts on sanctions removal and nuclear commitments, as world powers and Tehran seek to reinstate the tattered pact.
""We went to Vienna with serious determination, but we are not optimistic about the will and the intention of ⁧‫the United States ⁩and the three European parties to the deal,"" Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian was quoted by Iranian media as saying in a conversation with his Japanese counterpart.
While Blinken said ""it is not too late for Iran to reverse course and engage meaningfully,"" it appeared as if both sides might be seeking to avoid the blame if the talks break down.
The comments came on the fourth day of indirect U.S.-Iran talks on bringing both nations back into the deal, under which Iran limited its nuclear program in return for relief from U.S., European Union and U.N. economic sanctions.
Talks resumed on Monday after a five-month hiatus prompted by Iran's election of an anti-Western hardliner as president.
Sources familiar with the matter said Iran and the remaining parties to the deal - Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia - might hold a formal meeting on Friday, a step that could mark the end of this week's negotiations.
'BLAME GAME'
""The blame game has been ongoing ... and is going to continue,"" said Eurasia Group analyst Henry Rome, adding that even if the talks pause this week all sides have an interest in keeping the conversation going for now and there may be another round later this year or early next.
""Part of it is blame game, part of it is really wanting, at least from the Western side, to be sure to exhaust all options,"" Rome said.
Keeping the talks going may also help Iran in ""prolonging the period before I think there will very likely be a shift toward a more coercive Western position"" and also provide some cover to advance their nuclear program, he added.
The U.N. nuclear watchdog said on Wednesday that Iran has started producing enriched uranium with advanced centrifuges at its Fordow plant dug into a mountain, further eroding the nuclear deal.
It was unclear whether Blinken had been briefed on Iran's latest proposals when he made his pessimistic comments.
Iran's chief nuclear negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani said Iran had delivered two drafts to the Europeans, one on sanctions removal and the other on nuclear limitations.
""We want all sanctions to be lifted at once,"" Bagheri told reporters in Vienna, outlining a position unlikely to be warmly welcomed by the West, which has sought some kind of sequence under which Iran would return to the pact's nuclear limits.

Under the pact, Tehran limited its uranium enrichment programme, a potential pathway to nuclear weapons though Iran says it seeks only civilian atomic energy, in exchange for relief from the economic sanctions.
But in 2018, then-U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned the deal, calling it too soft on Iran, and reimposed harsh U.S. sanctions, spurring Tehran to breach nuclear limits in the pact.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday ordered Sidney Powell and other lawyers who sued in Michigan to overturn Democratic President Joe Biden's election victory to pay a $175,000 penalty, reiterating an earlier finding that the lawsuit was frivolous.
U.S. District Judge Linda Parker in Detroit ruled in August that Powell, Lin Wood, and other lawyers aligned with former President Donald Trump were to be sanctioned, but had not determined the dollar amount.
Thursday's order set the amount at approximately $175,000. Parker said the money should be awarded to Michigan and the City of Detroit to compensate for time government lawyers spent defending against the case.
""Plaintiffs’ attorneys filed this lawsuit without conducting the required degree of diligence as to the truth of the allegations made or the merits of the legal claims asserted,"" Parker said in Thursday's order.
In her August ruling, Parker formally requested that disciplinary bodies investigate whether the law licenses of the pro-Trump lawyers should be revoked. The judge also ordered the lawyers to attend classes on the ethical and legal requirements for filing legal claims.
Donald Campbell, a lawyer for Powell and her co-counsel, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Powell represented Trump's campaign when he tried to overturn last Nov. 3's presidential election in the courts. His campaign distanced itself from Powell after she claimed without evidence at a Nov. 19 news conference that electronic voting systems had switched millions of ballots to Biden.
In a written decision last December, Parker said Powell's voter fraud claims were ""nothing but speculation and conjecture"" and that, in any event, the Texas-based lawyer waited too long to file her lawsuit.

Powell has argued in court filings that her conduct was reasonable, saying she had vetted her election fraud claims before suing.
Starting in January 2020, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and other government lawyers asked the judge to discipline the pro-Trump lawyers, saying they had filed a frivolous lawsuit full of typos and factual errors and should be held accountable.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The month before being elected president in 2016, Donald Trump promised during a debate with his opponent Hillary Clinton to name justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who would overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.
His three appointees - Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett - may be on the verge of turning that pledge into a reality, based on their remarks during arguments over the legality of a restrictive Mississippi abortion law.
""Trump is very effective, as we saw at the Supreme Court,"" Mike Davis, who leads the Article III Project legal group that backed the Republican former president's judicial appointees during his time in office, said, referring to Wednesday's arguments. ""He delivered, as he promised he would.""
During four years in office, Trump managed to appoint one third of the current members of the highest U.S. judicial body and half of its conservative bloc, with all three of his picks coming from a list compiled by conservative legal activists.
Wednesday's arguments marked the first time that the current court has heard a case in which overturning Roe was explicitly on the table. Trump's appointees - Gorsuch in 2017, Kavanaugh in 2018 and Barrett in 2020 - may prove instrumental in how far the court may go in rolling back abortion rights. All six conservative justices indicated a willingness to dramatically curtail abortion rights and perhaps outright overturn Roe.
Then-candidate Trump said in the October 2016 debate with Democrat Clinton of overturning Roe: ""Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that ... will happen automatically in my opinion because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.""
It was a pitch that appealed to conservative Christian voters who helped put him into office and remained among his most ardent backers. Trump has not yet announced whether he will run again in 2024.
""I think it's more possible than any time that we've seen at least in my lifetime,"" Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life group that holds annual anti-abortion rallies in Washington, said of overturning Roe. 
While saying politics is just one part of the effort to stop abortion, Mancini added: ""I'm very grateful to President Trump for the decisions he made.""
Barrett's appointment in particular buoyed religious conservatives and anti-abortion activists, cementing the court's 6-3 conservative super-majority. Barrett, a devout Catholic and former legal scholar, previously had signaled support for overturning Roe in the past. 
RESPECTING PRECEDENT
Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Barrett voiced doubts during the argument either about Roe's legal underpinnings or the need to adhere to it as a decades-old major decision, a legal principle called stare decisis. Supporters of the principle have said it protects the court's credibility and legitimacy by avoiding politicization and keeping the law steady and evenhanded.
Gorsuch highlighted what abortion opponents consider a weakness in the argument to keep Roe: it has already been changed and limited by a 1992 ruling called Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey that reaffirmed the right to abortion, and the test for what restrictions states may enact has ""evolved over time, too.""
Kavanaugh emphasized American divisions over abortion, offering a view often expressed by abortion opponents that the question should be one for the ""people"" - state legislatures or the U.S. Congress - to decide. 
""The Constitution's neither pro-life nor pro-choice on the question of abortion,"" Kavanaugh said.
Barrett during her Senate confirmation hearings indicated Roe was not a ""super-precedent"" that should never be overturned. During Wednesday's arguments, Barrett raised the idea that certain precedents should be harder to overrule than others. 
She also asked whether the recent adoption in some states of ""safe haven"" laws, which let women hand over unwanted babies to healthcare facilities without penalty, undermines certain justifications for abortions because women are not forced into motherhood merely by giving birth.
The last time the Supreme Court was this close to overturning Roe was in the 1992 Casey case, when its moderates banded together and reaffirmed abortion rights. 
The outcome could be different this time in part thanks to a decades-long effort by conservative legal activists to reshape the court and remarkably effective political maneuvering by a key Republican senator, Mitch McConnell. 

Trump entered office with a Supreme Court vacancy to fill because McConnell, then Senate majority leader, refused to consider Democratic President Barack Obama's 2016 nominee. Then last year McConnell moved to have the Senate speedily confirm Barrett a week before the presidential election to replace the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an abortion rights champion.
Roe v. Wade recognized that the right to personal privacy under the U.S. Constitution protects a woman's ability to terminate her pregnancy. Mississippi's Republican-backed 2018 law, blocked by lower courts, bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. A ruling in the case is due by the end of next June.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Moscow of the ""severe costs"" Russia would pay if it invaded Ukraine, urging his Russian counterpart on Thursday to seek a diplomatic exit from the crisis.
Blinken delivered the warning to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at what he called a ""candid"" meeting in Stockholm and said it was likely that Presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin would speak soon.
""I made very clear our deep concerns and our resolve to hold Russia responsible for its actions, including our commitment to work with European allies to impose severe costs and consequences on Russia if it takes further aggressive action against Ukraine,"" Blinken told a news conference after the meeting.
""It's now on Russia to de-escalate the current tensions by reversing the recent troop buildup, returning forces to normal peacetime positions and refraining from further intimidation and attempts to destabilise Ukraine.""
Lavrov, speaking to reporters before his talks with Blinken, said Moscow was ready for dialogue with Kyiv. ""We, as President Putin has stated, do not want any conflicts,"" he said.
Ukraine says Russia has amassed more than 90,000 troops near their long shared border, while Moscow accuses Kyiv of pursuing its own military build-up. It has dismissed as inflammatory suggestions it is preparing for an attack on its southern neighbour and has defended its right to deploy troops on its own territory as it sees fit.
Russia and Ukraine have centuries of shared history and formed the two biggest republics of the Soviet Union until its 1991 collapse, so Moscow views its neighbour's ambition to join NATO as an affront and a threat.
Since the latest crisis started, Moscow has set out demands for legally binding security guarantees from the West that NATO will not admit Ukraine as a member or deploy missile systems there to target Russia.
""We're going to make sure we are heard but the main thing is our security,"" Lavrov told a news conference later.
""So if NATO still refuses to discuss this theme or the guarantees or ideas put forward by the president of Russia Vladimir Putin, of course we will take measures to ensure that our security, our sovereignty and our territorial integrity does not depend on anyone else.""
He struck a more conciliatory note, however, by proposing that Russia and the United States bring an end to a long dispute over the size of their embassies and start afresh on the issue.
SUMMIT TALK
The Kremlin has been talking up the possibility of a second summit between Putin and Biden for weeks. Their last one took place in Geneva in June, less than two months after Russia scaled back a previous build-up of more than 100,000 troops on the Ukrainian border.
Blinken said: ""I think it’s likely the presidents will speak directly in the near future"".
The American declined to spell out what economic sanctions Russia might face if it invaded its neighbour, saying only that ""Moscow knows very well the universe of what's possible"".
Russia has withstood multiple rounds of international sanctions since it seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. But Western governments have a potential new lever now, as Moscow is awaiting German regulatory approval to start pumping gas through a newly built $11 billion pipeline under the Baltic Sea.
Blinken said Moscow and Kyiv should each fulfil their obligations under the Minsk peace process, which was designed to end a war between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian government forces in the east of the former Soviet republic.
Washington was willing to facilitate this, Blinken said, but ""if Russia decides to pursue confrontation, there will be serious consequences"".
EASTERN FLASHPOINT
The Kremlin said on Thursday - before the Lavrov-Blinken meeting - that the probability of a new conflict in eastern Ukraine remained high and that Moscow was concerned by ""aggressive"" rhetoric from Kyiv and an increase in what it called provocative actions along the line of contact between government forces and the pro-Russian separatists.
Kyiv has denied any intention of trying to take back the rebel regions by force, accusing Russia of spouting ""propaganda nonsense"" in order to provide cover for its own aggressive intentions.
Russia said separately it had arrested three suspected Ukrainian intelligence agents, including one accused of planning to carry out an attack using two homemade bombs, allegations that Kyiv dismissed as trumped up.

Last week Ukraine's president said Kyiv had thwarted a Russian-backed coup plot, which the Kremlin denied.
East-West relations have sunk to their lowest level since the end of the Cold War and the demise of the USSR. The point was accidentally underlined by U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin when he said during a visit to South Korea: ""The best case... is that we won't see an incursion by the Soviet Union into the Ukraine.""

The announcement, which will be made as part of U.S. President Joe Biden's Summit for Democracy, is aimed at addressing ""the misuse of certain dual-use technologies that can lead to human rights abuses"" and ensuring ""critical and emerging technologies work for and not against democratic societies,"" the officials told reporters in a briefing call. 
The officials declined to name the countries that would join the group or the technologies or users targetted by it, but said members would develop and adopt a ""written nonbinding code of conduct or statement of principles intended to guide the application of human rights criteria to export licensing policy.""
The officials singled out China as an example of a nation that has misused technology to control its population. 

Earlier this year, the Biden administration added Chinese companies to a trade blacklist for enabling human rights abuses against Uigher Muslims and added Burmese entities following the coup there. In October, it released a rule to control the export of items used for malicious cyber activities. 
The administration invited just over 100 government leaders to the virtual Democracy event on Dec. 9 and 10, the first of its kind, which aims to help stop democratic backsliding and the erosion of rights and freedoms worldwide. The list does not include China or Russia.

In the ""Großer Zapfenstreich"" ceremony, pared back due to COVID-19 restrictions, the Bundeswehr staff music corps played a hymn, a 1960s song that includes the words ""I can't acquiesce, can't make do, I still want to win"", and a 1970s punk rock hit.
The hymn, ""Holy God, We Praise Thy Name"", is a nod to Merkel's Protestant upbringing, the '60s song ""Red roses are to rain for me"" perhaps reflects her youthful ambition, while the rock hit, ""You Forgot The Colour Film"", was first performed by East German punk artist Nina Hagen.
Born in the northern port city of Hamburg as the daughter of a Protestant pastor, Merkel grew up in Communist East Germany before taking the helm of a predominantly male, Catholic western German party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
After 16 years in office, she is due to be succeeded as chancellor https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-politics-idAFKBN2I90JS by Social Democrat Olaf Scholz next week.

Merkel, 67, leaves big shoes to fill. She has navigated Germany and Europe through multiple crises and been a champion of liberal democracy in the face of rising authoritarianism worldwide.
Her critics say she has managed rather than solved problems and leaves her successor tough decisions on many fronts.

(Reuters) - Two influential U.S. Roman Catholic Church bishops are encouraging their peers to cooperate with a federal investigation into abuses committed within the former Native American boarding school system. 
In a letter sent to all U.S. bishops in November, Archbishop Paul Coakley of Oklahoma City, who heads a church committee on domestic justice, and Bishop James Wall of Gallup, New Mexico, who leads a church committee on Native American affairs, asked fellow bishops to hand over records investigators may seek and allow access to property where the unmarked remains of Native American students may lie. 
Coakley's office confirmed in an email Wednesday that he and Wall sent the letter, which was seen by Reuters.
The U.S. Department of the Interior has said it will release a report https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-investigate-former-indian-boarding-schools-find-any-remains-2021-06-22 on its investigation in April of next year. That report ""will likely bring to light some very troubling information,"" Coakley and Wall wrote. 
For over 150 years, beginning in 1819, Native American children in the United States were forcibly removed from their tribes and sent to such schools, many operated by Catholic and other churches on behalf of the government. Many children were abused at the schools, and tens of thousands were never heard from again, activists and researchers say https://www.reuters.com/world/us/native-americans-decry-unmarked-graves-untold-history-boarding-schools-2021-06-22. 
Coakley and Wall urged bishops to reach out to Native Americans to understand ""where reconciliation is needed and what form that might take."" 
Christine Diindiisi McCleave, head of the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition and a descendant of school survivors, told Reuters that ""churches can participate in truth telling, but they do not get to lead the healing for Native people.""
Churches must use caution that any conversations do not add to trauma for survivors, she added.
Conditions at former Native American boarding schools gained global attention earlier this year when tribal leaders in Canada, which modeled boarding schools on the U.S. system, announced the discovery of the unmarked graves of 215 children at the site of the former Kamloops residential school for indigenous children.

That signaled a new phase in the investigation by the House select committee, which to date has held only three public sessions in its investigation of the attack on the Capitol by mobs of supporters of former President Donald Trump.
One was a hearing at which police officers described being beaten, taunted with racial insults and threatened during the attack, and the two others were business meetings to vote on contempt of Congress resolutions against Trump adviser Steven Bannon and former Department of Justice official Jeffrey Clark.
""We are making rapid progress. We anticipate next year, we will be conducting multiple weeks of public hearings, setting out for the American people in vivid color exactly what happened, every minute of the day on January 6th, here at the Capitol and at the White House, and what led to that violent attack,"" Cheney said at a House Rules Committee hearing on Thursday.
The Rules Committee was to have voted on the contempt effort against Clark on Thursday, but delayed its action because he invoked his privilege against self-incrimination under the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment on Wednesday and agreed to come before the Select committee on Saturday.

Democrat Bennie Thompson, chairman of the committee, said that the overwhelming majority of witnesses are cooperating with the panel, and that 250 people have testified behind closed doors.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The holiday season promises peak travel cheer in New York, with more visitors on the streets and in stores, but the emergence of the heavily mutated Omicron coronavirus variant threatens to throw a wrench into the tourism industry's recovery.
""Just when you think you got the answer, it seems like this virus is constantly changing the question,"" said Mark Williams, a New York operator at Big Bus Tours, one of the world's largest open-top sightseeing tour bus companies.
Travel website Kayak said searches related to international travel to New York have spiked 50% since the COVID-19 travel restrictions for fully vaccinated international visitors were lifted on Nov. 8.
""There is definitely a lot of pent-up demand for people wanting to get to New York City,"" said Kayak CEO Steve Hafner.
Hafner admitted the Omicron variant was a wild card, but he was confident in the allure of New York, and that travellers were starting to learn how to live with COVID-19.
""People are very resilient, and that's what we've seen in the numbers. So as soon as the government lets them do stuff, they're going to go out there and get it done, and there's no better place to do it than New York City,"" he said.
Travellers on the Big Bus Tour appeared to agree.
""They say it's not as bad as they thought it was,"" said Kevin Norman, visiting from Britain, referring to Omicron. ""More worrying is that we have to take more tests to go back to the UK.""
""I'm fully vaccinated. So what will be, will be,"" said another British tourist, Ann Heinz.
Tom Harris, president of the Times Square Alliance which works to improve and promote the famous intersection, has seen pedestrian numbers rise significantly since Nov. 8, to more than 250,000 people a day from 30,000 at the beginning of the pandemic.

Harris expects a return to pre-pandemic numbers of 365,000 people sooner than expected, but decries any notion of normalcy.
""Normal is boring,"" Harris said. ""Times Square is anything but boring. We're not going to fall back. We're going to fall forward. We're going to learn from the pandemic and we're going to create a new and exciting Times Square post-pandemic.""

(Reuters) - A Michigan teenager was ordered held without bond on Wednesday after being charged with first-degree murder in the deadliest U.S. school shooting of the year, which killed four students and wounded seven other people.
Ethan Crumbley, a 15-year-old sophomore at a high school in Oxford, Michigan, about 40 miles (65 km) north of Detroit, was charged with a slew of criminal counts in Tuesday's shooting spree, Oakland County Prosecuting Attorney Karen McDonald said. 
“I am absolutely sure after reviewing evidence that it isn’t even a close call,"" she told a briefing. ""It was absolutely premeditated.”
In addition to four counts of first-degree murder, Crumbley faces one count of terrorism causing death, seven counts of assault with intent to murder and 12 counts of possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony, she said.
The shooting spree was the deadliest on U.S. school property this year, according to Education Week. It was the latest in a decades-long string of deadly American school shootings.
Crumbley, who is being charged as an adult, appeared on Wednesday at an online arraignment where Judge Nancy Carniak ordered him held without bond at the Oakland County Jail.
At the arraignment, Lieutenant Tim Willis of the Oakland County Sheriff's Office said investigators had found videos that Crumbley recorded the night before in which he talked about shooting and killing students.
""Further, a journal was recovered from Ethan's backpack also detailing his desire to shoot up the school to include murdering students,"" Willis said.
Crumbley opened fire at Oxford High School with a semi-automatic handgun - which his father had purchased four days earlier - after emerging from a restroom shortly before 1 p.m. EST (1700 GMT) on Tuesday, authorities said.
Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard said Crumbley did not appear to be targeting any specific people during the shooting spree. 
Three students hit by gunfire - Tate Myre, 16, Hana St. Juliana, 14, and Madisyn Baldwin, 17 - died on Tuesday, the sheriff's office said. The fourth, 17-year-old Justin Shilling, died on Wednesday.
Of the six students and one teacher who were wounded, three students remained hospitalized late on Wednesday afternoon, including a 17-year-old girl in critical condition with a gunshot wound to the chest, the sheriff's office said. Four others, including the teacher, have been discharged.
MOTIVE UNCLEAR
Bouchard told a briefing that investigators have yet to determine a motive for the shooting, adding that there was no evidence Crumbley had been bullied.
But he said school officials had contact with Crumbley the day before the shooting and another meeting with him and his parents on the morning of the shooting “for behavior in the classroom that they felt was concerning.”
""The content of that meeting, obviously, is part of the investigation, but we did not learn of that meeting nor the content of that meeting until after the shooting and during this investigation,"" he said.
More than 50,000 people had signed an online petition as of Wednesday morning to rename the school's stadium after Myre, who played on Oxford High's football team, saying he tried to disarm the shooter.

""Tate is not just a hero to his fellow students at Oxford High School but a legend, his act of bravery should be remembered forever and passed down through generations,"" the petition on Change.org said.
Bouchard credited swift action by his deputies for preventing greater loss of life, saying they arrived on the scene within minutes and moved straight toward the sound of gunshots. Crumbley, who did not resist, was disarmed and taken into custody minutes after the shooting began, he said.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - NATO allies share an ""unwavering commitment"" to Ukraine's sovereignty, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday, hours before he meets Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov amid escalating East-West tensions over Ukraine.
Blinken, speaking at the start of talks with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, reiterated Washington's concerns over a build-up of Russian troops on the border that has triggered threats of fresh Western sanctions against Moscow.
Kuleba tweeted that Ukraine, which is not a NATO member but seeks closer ties with the Atlantic alliance, was working with Western countries on a ""comprehensive deterrence package including severe economic sanctions"" to stop Russian aggression.
""The unwavering commitment of the United States to Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty, its independence... that is a view that not only the United States holds but all of our NATO allies hold as well,"" Blinken told Kuleba at their talks.
""That was very, very clearly evident in the conversations that we had over the last couple of days,"" he added.
In his meeting with Lavrov, scheduled for 1015 GMT on the sidelines of the summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Stockholm, the top U.S. diplomat is expected to relay in person the threat of further sanctions, if Moscow fails to end its troop build-up on Ukraine's border.
FLASHPOINT
Ukraine has become the main flashpoint between Russia and the West as relations have soured to their worst level in the three decades since the Cold War ended. Kyiv says Russia has amassed more than 90,000 troops near their long shared border.
Moscow accuses Kyiv of pursuing its own military build-up. It has dismissed as inflammatory suggestions it is preparing for an attack on Ukraine and has defended its right to deploy troops on its own territory as it sees fit.
But President Vladimir Putin has also said Russia would be forced to act if NATO placed missiles in Ukraine that could strike Moscow within minutes.
Speaking in Riga on Wednesday after a meeting of NATO foreign ministers, Blinken expressed U.S. concerns about what he said were Russian efforts to destabilise Ukraine from within.
""We don't know whether President Putin has made the decision to invade. We do know that he's putting in place the capacity to do so in short order, should he so decide,"" said Blinken. 
Blinken will remind Lavrov in their talks that there is a diplomatic solution, a senior State Department official told reporters late on Wednesday.
""Beyond making clear the cost of Russian actions, I’m certain that the Secretary is also going to want to make clear that there is a diplomatic off-ramp,"" the official said.
The Kremlin annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and then backed rebels fighting Kyiv government forces in the east of the country. That conflict has killed 14,000 people, Kyiv says, and is still simmering.
As well as Ukraine, other issues including cybersecurity and the Kremlin's treatment of its critics have also helped drive relations between Washington and Moscow to post-Cold War lows.
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency director William Burns earlier this month raised the issue of Russian cyberattacks during a rare visit to Moscow, where he met high-ranking security officials, three sources told Reuters.

Another focal point for East-West tensions has been the refugee crisis on the borders between Belarus, a Russian ally, and NATO members Poland and Lithuania.
Western nations accuse Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko of engineering the migrant crisis in retaliation for sanctions imposed on Minsk over its human rights record. Minsk blames the West for the humanitarian crisis.

SEOUL (Reuters) -The defence chiefs of the United States and South Korea said on Thursday they would review and update ways to deter North Korea, even as they emphasised a growing regional role for Seoul.
North Korea's missile and weapons developments are increasingly destabilising for regional security, U.S. Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said after talks with his South Korean counterpart, Suh Wook, but the two sides also discussed issues beyond the Korean peninsula.
For the first time, their joint statement affirmed ""the importance of preserving peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.""
It mirrored language used for the first time by South Korean President Moon Jae-in in May when he met with U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington. It's a sensitive issue for South Korea, which has tried to balance its economic relationship with China with Washington's push for allies to counter Beijing's growing power.
The statement came the same day that South Korea's national security adviser travelled to China to meet its top diplomat. It also followed remarks on Wednesday by Japan's former prime minister, Shinzo Abe, suggesting that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would be a danger for Japan. 
Austin and senior U.S. military commanders were in Seoul for the first such annual military talks with South Korean officials since Biden took office in January, and the last before Moon leaves office in May.
North Korea has continued to rebuff U.S. entreaties for diplomacy since Biden took over from Donald Trump, who had three summits with leader Kim Jong Un.
The United States calls on the North to engage in dialogue, Austin told a news conference, saying diplomacy is the best approach to pursue with North Korea, backed up by a credible deterrent.
This week the Pentagon released a global posture review that calls for additional cooperation with allies and partners to deter ""potential Chinese military aggression and threats from North Korea,"" including a previously announced decision to permanently base an attack helicopter squadron and artillery division headquarters in South Korea.
The United States stations about 28,500 troops in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War, which ended in an armistice but not a peace treaty.
In a meeting with Austin on Thursday evening, Moon asked that the United States support his push for an ""end of war declaration"" aimed at reducing tensions with North Korea and jump-starting talks, said a spokesperson for South Korea's presidential Blue House.
Austin responded by paying tribute to Moon's efforts to improve relations with North Korea, the spokesperson said in a statement.
CHANGING SECURITY ENVIRONMENT
A changing security environment prompted the United States and South Korea to agree to update strategic guidance about how they plan for a potential conflict with North Korea, as well as review their combined military command, Suh said.
""The Strategic Planning Guidance from 2010 still remains effective, but we've shared the need for a new war plan that could reflect evolving threats from North Korea and changes from our own defence reform and a combined command structure, as well as overall strategic environment,"" he said at the news conference.
U.S. and South Korean officials cautioned that the updates to the war plans are routine and not a preparation for war.
Currently, the United States would command allied troops in the event of war, but South Korea has been seeking to gain ""operational control"" (OPCON).
Moon's goal of OPCON transfer by the time he leaves office could not be achieved, as a scheduled joint review was not conducted amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Suh said the two sides made progress on meeting conditions for OPCON transfer to South Korea and agreed to assess the future command's full operational capability next year.
The United States reaffirmed its commitment to providing extended deterrence to South Korea, including using its nuclear weapons, along with convention and missile defence capabilities.

But America's approach to nuclear deterrence could change. Biden is carrying out a review of U.S. nuclear weapons policy, with hopes for a more tailored role for nuclear arms, experts say.
It's unclear whether Biden might break precedent by declaring a ""no first use"" policy, a move that critics say would weaken U.S. deterrence.

The activists' petition is part of a flurry of complaints designed to sideline Marcos, a career politician and son and namesake of the notorious dictator who was driven from power by a 1986 people's uprising.
It was among at least six lodged with election authorities and is centred on his 1995 conviction for failing to pay income tax or file tax returns while in public office from 1982 to 1985, which carries a lifetime election ban.
""He was the son of the ruling dictator, the same dictator who imposed the penalty of perpetual disqualification,"" the 13-page petition said. 
The group was referring to a 1985 amendment to the internal revenue code permanently barring a public officer convicted of a tax crime from voting and running in any election.
""Perhaps he thought he was an exception to his father's decrees,"" the petition said. 
The Marcos family is arguably the most famous and divisive in the Philippines. 
Despite its fall from grace, it has retained vast wealth and far-reaching and powerful connections, but its prominence has been a cause of anger to thousands who suffered during the harsh 1970s martial law under the elder Marcos. 
Outside the poll body, more than a dozen people chanted ""Disqualify, BBM! Disqualify! Disqualify!"" while carrying posters bearing the same message. 
BBM refers to ""Bongbong"" Marcos, his nickname. His media group did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

Since his conviction, Marcos https://reut.rs/31kqcyI, 64, has been elected governor, congressman and senator and ran unsuccessfully for the vice presidency.
""He may have been allowed to run in 2016 but we will not allow him to run again,"" said petitioner and Akbayan youth chairperson Rj Naguit.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations appealed on Thursday for a record $41 billion to provide life-saving assistance next year to 183 million people worldwide caught up in conflict and poverty, led by a tripling of its programme in Afghanistan.
Famine remains a ""terrifying prospect"" for 45 million people living in 43 countries, as extreme weather caused by climate change shrinks food supplies, the U.N. said in the annual appeal, which reflected a 17% rise in annual funding needs.
""The drivers of needs are ones which are familiar to all of us. Tragically, it includes protracted conflicts, political instability, failing economies ... the climate crisis, not a new crisis, but one which urges more attention and of course the COVID-19 pandemic,"" U.N. aid chief Martin Griffiths told reporters.
In a report to donors, the world body said: ""Without sustained and immediate action, 2022 could be catastrophic."" 
Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, Ethiopia and Sudan are the five major crises requiring the most funding, topped by $4.5 billion sought for Taliban-ruled Afghanistan where ""needs are skyrocketing"", it said.
In Afghanistan, more than 24 million people require life-saving assistance, a dramatic increase driven by political tumult, repeated economic shocks, and severe food insecurity caused by the worst drought in 27 years.
""We are in the business in the U.N. of trying to urgently establish with support from the World Bank as well as the U.N. system, a currency swap initiative which will allow liquidity to go into the economy,"" Griffiths said.
""The absence of cash in Afghanistan is a major impediment to any delivery of services,"" he said. ""I am hoping that we get it up and running before the end of this month."" 
In Ethiopia, where a year-old conflict between government and Tigrayan forces has spread into the Amhara and Afar regions, thousands have been displaced, while fighting, drought and locusts push more to the brink, the U.N. said. 
Nearly 26 million Ethiopians require aid, including more than 9 million who depend on food rations, including 5 million in Tigray, amid rising malnutrition rates, it said.

""Ethiopia is the most alarming probably almost certainly in terms of immediate emergency need,"" Griffiths said, adding that 400,000 people had been deemed at risk of famine already in May.
Noting that heavy fighting continued, with government forces battling Tigrayan People's Liberation Front forces who have moved closer to the capital Addis Ababa, he added: ""But capacity to respond to an imploded Ethiopia is almost impossible to imagine.""

Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Hua Chunying called Abe's remarks ""erroneous"" and a violation of basic norms of relations between China and Japan in the meeting with ambassador Hideo Tarumi, according to a statement from China's Foreign Ministry.
Abe's comments ""openly challenged China's sovereignty and gave brazen support to Taiwan independence forces,"" it cited Hua as saying.
""China is resolutely opposed to this,"" it said, adding Hua had made ""stern representations"" to Japan.
Asked about the summons at a regular press briefing in Tokyo on Thursday, Japan's chief cabinet secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said Japan disagreed with China's action as the Japanese government was not in a position to comment on remarks made by people not in the government.
""Ambassador Tarumi said ... it is necessary for China to understand there are people in Japan who have such opinions and Japan cannot accept China's one-sided views on such matters,"" Matsuno said. 

On Wednesday, speaking https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/former-pm-abe-says-japan-us-could-not-stand-by-if-china-attacked-taiwan-2021-12-01 at a virtual forum organised by a Taiwanese think tank, Abe said an armed invasion of Taiwan would pose a grave danger to Japan.
Abe, who stepped down as prime minister last year, is head of the largest faction of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and remains influential within the party.

VIENNA (Reuters) -Iran has started producing enriched uranium with more efficient advanced centrifuges at its Fordow plant dug into a mountain, the U.N. atomic watchdog said on Wednesday, further eroding the 2015 Iran nuclear deal during talks with the West on saving it.
The announcement appeared to undercut indirect talks between Iran and the United States on bringing both fully back into the battered deal that resumed this week after a five-month break prompted by the election of hardline President Ebrahim Raisi. 
Western negotiators fear Iran is creating facts on the ground to gain leverage in the talks.
On the third day of this round of talks, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Iran had started the process of enriching uranium to up to 20% purity with one cascade, or cluster, of 166 advanced IR-6 machines at Fordow. Those machines are far more efficient than the first-generation IR-1.
Underlining how badly eroded the deal is, that pact does not allow Iran to enrich uranium at Fordow at all. Until now Iran had been producing enriched uranium there with IR-1 machines and had enriched with some IR-6s without keeping the product. 
It has 94 IR-6 machines installed in a cascade at Fordow that is not yet operating, the IAEA said in a statement.
A more comprehensive IAEA report circulated to member states and seen by Reuters said that as a result of Iran's move the nuclear watchdog planned to step up inspections at the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant (FFEP) that houses the centrifuges, but the details still need to be ironed out.
Iran played down the report as routine despite the fact that the IAEA, which does not explicitly give a reason for such reports, typically issues them only for significant developments such as fresh breaches of the deal's nuclear restrictions.
""The recent report of the IAEA on Iran's nuclear activities, is an ordinary update in line with regular verification in Iran,"" Iran's permanent mission to the U.N. organizations in Vienna said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
However, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi made clear he viewed the development with concern.
""This redoubles the alert. It is not banal. Iran can do it, but if you have such an ambition you need to accept inspections. It's necessary,"" Grossi told French broadcaster France 24.
Iran and major powers are trying to revive the 2015 deal under which Tehran limited its nuclear programme in exchange for relief from U.S., EU and U.N. economic sanctions.
U.S. then-President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018 and reimposed harsh U.S. sanctions, angering Iran and dismaying the other parties: Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia.
This week's indirect talks between Tehran and Washington - with others shuttling between them because Iran refuses to meet U.S. officials - have made no visible progress.
Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson on Wednesday accused Israel of ""trumpeting lies to poison"" the talks.

While it was unclear what the spokesperson was referring to, a Tel Aviv-based reporter for U.S. news organization Axios on Monday reported that Israel had shared intelligence with Washington and European allies suggesting Iran was taking technical steps to prepare to enrich uranium to 90% purity, the level needed for a nuclear weapon.
Iran says its nuclear programme is for purely peaceful purposes.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A woman who has accused British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell of grooming her for sexual abuse by financier Jeffrey Epstein when she was 14 years old said on Wednesday she is seeking ""peace and healing"" by testifying in Maxwell's criminal trial.
The woman, known by the pseudonym Jane, was pushing back on attempts by Maxwell's attorneys to paint her testimony as unreliable and to argue that she was testifying for financial incentives. 
""This is something that I have been running from my entire life up until now and I'm just tired of it,"" Jane said toward the end of around eight hours of testimony over two days. ""I was just hoping that I could help in any way to make that happen, and hopefully find some peace and healing some day.""
Jane, one of four accusers expected to take the stand at Maxwell's sex abuse trial, is a professional TV actress. Maxwell's attorney Bobbi Sternheim said in opening statements earlier this week that Jane was a ""pro at playing roles"" and was motivated to implicate Maxwell by her claim to a compensation fund for Epstein's victims.
But in follow-up questioning by prosecutor Alison Moe in federal court in Manhattan, Jane said she was not acting on the stand, and that her only motivation for testifying was to ""hopefully find some sort of closure.""
Maxwell, 59, is charged with eight counts of sex trafficking and other crimes, including two perjury charges that will be tried separately. The daughter of late British media magnate Robert Maxwell faces up to 80 years in prison if convicted. 
Upon entering the courtroom on Wednesday morning wearing a grey turtleneck sweater and black dress pants, Maxwell greeted her sister Isabel and brother Kevin, who were seated in the front row.
Maxwell has pleaded not guilty and her lawyers have said prosecutors are scapegoating her for Epstein's alleged crimes. The well-connected investment advisor died by suicide at age 66 in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on sex-abuse charges. 
Maxwell's lawyers have argued that the four accusers' memories have been manipulated over time. They say the women never mentioned Maxwell's role in their abuse until after Epstein's death.
'MOVE ON WITH MY LIFE'
Jane, now in her early 40s, said at the start of her testimony on Tuesday that she had sexual encounters with Epstein at his Palm Beach, Florida, home multiple times per month when she was 14, 15 and 16. Other people occasionally participated, including Maxwell, who touched her breasts, Jane testified.
A former romantic partner of Jane's, known by the pseudonym Matt, testified on Wednesday that she told him about abuse by Epstein in 2009, a year after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting an underage girl for prostitution and served a one-year prison term in Florida. 
Matt, an actor who dated Jane from 2006 to 2014, said under questioning by prosecutor Moe that Jane ""said that having a woman there made her feel more comfortable"" during those encounters, but did not tell him it was Maxwell until her 2020 arrest. 
During cross-examination, another Maxwell attorney, Laura Menninger, questioned Jane about apparent discrepancies between her testimony and conversations with prosecutors before Maxwell's July 2020 arrest. 
Jane said she did not recall if she told prosecutors before Maxwell's arrest that Maxwell had touched her during the encounters.
In follow-up questioning by Moe, Jane said she held back some details during her initial conversations with them because she did not yet know them well and found it ""too difficult"" to share everything. 

Jane said on Tuesday she had received $5 million from the victims' compensation fund. 
""I wish I would have never received that money in the first place,"" Jane said after a long, tearful pause. ""Hopefully this just puts it all to an end and I can move on with my life.""

TAPACHULA, Mexico (Reuters) - Several thousand Haitian migrants have camped outside a stadium in the southern Mexican city of Tapachula, pleading to be transferred to other states and given authorization to travel freely through Mexico and seek employment. 
Mexican officials last week began moving hundreds of migrants to other states after they had endured lengthy waits for asylum and visas requests in Tapachula, aiming to head off migrant caravans heading north to the U.S. border. 
Yet thousands more people remain in limbo https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/this-is-prison-mexico-struggles-hold-migrants-far-us-border-2021-09-21 in Tapachula, which is located near Mexico's southern border with Guatemala.
Many on Wednesday told Reuters they were camping out at the stadium, which had been turned into a makeshift migration processing center, to be able to land spots on buses out of town offered by migration authorities. 
Mexico's migration institute did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
""We can't leave the camp, we want to secure our place,"" said Eliot John, from Haiti, who said he has slept at the camp several nights. ""We do not want to go in a caravan because there are children and pregnant women with us, it is much more dangerous.""
Reuters photos show a ramshackle encampment of blankets hung between metal fences in a concrete parking lot under direct sun, with trash strewn about the ground. 
Inside the stadium, dozens of migrants sat on the grass or in spectator seats.
Haitian migrant Roldy, who asked to not disclose his last name, said he has been waiting in Tapachula for four months and spent the last five nights outside the stadium with his wife and daughter. 
""My family and I can't keep putting up with hunger and thirst and sleeping on the street,"" he said. 

Marceline Pierre, also from Haiti, beseeched Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to take note of the unsanitary conditions and help him and his fellow migrants get paperwork to move freely through the country and find jobs. 
""We're not animals,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The World Bank's board has backed transferring $280 million from a frozen trust fund to two aid agencies to help Afghanistan cope with a brewing humanitarian crisis after the U.S. withdrawal, two sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The 31 donors to the World Bank-administered Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) must approve the transfer before the funds could flow to the World Food Programme and UNICEF, the sources said. The donors were expected to meet on Friday, the sources said.
The World Bank board met informally on Tuesday to discuss transferring up to $500 million of the $1.5 billion in the ARTF to humanitarian aid agencies, people familiar with the plan previously told Reuters.
Afghanistan's 39 million people face a cratering economy, a winter of food shortages and growing poverty three months after the Taliban seized power as the last U.S. troops withdrew from 20 years of war.
Afghan experts have said the aid would help, but big questions remain, including how to get funds into Afghanistan without exposing any financial institutions involved to U.S. sanctions.
While the U.S. Treasury has provided ""comfort letters"" assuring banks that they can process humanitarian transactions, concern about U.S. sanctions continues to prevent passage of even basic supplies, including food and medicine.
Any decision to redirect ARTF money requires the approval of all its donors, of which the United States has been the largest.
The White House and the Treasury had no immediate comment on the World Bank board's endorsement of transferring the funds to the World Food Programme and UNICEF.

A World Bank spokesperson confirmed the bank's board had discussed the issue and that the donors were to meet on Friday.
The board ""discussed an approach to transfer out funds from the ... ARTF to humanitarian aid agencies with presence and logistics on the ground to enable basic humanitarian support directly to the people in the country,"" the spokesperson said. ""The ARTF Donors’ Steering Committee is scheduled to meet on Dec. 3 to consider transfers out from the fund.""

BOSTON (Reuters) - A California doctor and his wife have agreed to plead guilty to participating in a sprawling U.S. college admissions fraud scheme by paying $25,000 to rig their son's SAT college entrance exam, federal prosecutors said on Wednesday.
Gregory Colburn, 63, and Amy Colburn, 61, had been set to face trial in Boston in January along with another parent charged in the college admissions scandal, which has ensnared celebrities and business executives.
The Colburns will instead each plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud. Their plea deals call for each of them to be sentenced to eight weeks in prison and a $12,500 fine.
The couple reserved the right to appeal a judge's decision to not dismiss the indictment against them, according to their plea agreements filed in court. Their lawyer David Schumacher declined to comment.
Fifty-seven people have been charged in the ""Operation Varsity Blues"" investigation, which centers on a scheme in which parents conspired with California college admissions consultant William “Rick” Singer to secure their children's college admissions fraudulently.
Singer pleaded guilty in 2019 to facilitating college entrance exam cheating and using bribery to secure the admission of students as fake athletic recruits.
Fifty people have agreed to plead guilty, including actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman. Two parents were convicted in October in the first trial in the scandal.
Prosecutors said the Colburns in 2017 agreed with Singer to pay $25,000 to have an associate pose as a test proctor for their son's SAT exam and secretly correct his answers.
The associate, Florida private school counselor Mark Riddell, pleaded guilty to taking college entrance exams in place of Singer's clients' children or correcting their answers while acting as a proctor.
Prosecutors said Singer bribed a corrupt test administrator, Igor Dvorskiy, to allow Riddell's cheating. Dvorskiy has pleaded guilty.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) -A U.N. committee on Wednesday deferred a decision on who will represent Afghanistan and Myanmar at the United Nations, said the panel's chair, meaning the Afghan Taliban and Myanmar junta will not be allowed into the world body for now.
Rival claims were made for the seats of both countries with the Taliban and Myanmar's junta pitted against ambassadors appointed by the governments they ousted this year. U.N. acceptance of the Taliban or Myanmar's junta would be a step toward the international recognition sought by both.
The nine-member U.N. credentials committee, which includes Russia, China and the United States, met at U.N. headquarters to consider the credentials of all 193 members for the current session of the U.N. General Assembly.
Several diplomats had told Reuters that the committee was likely to defer its decisions on the representation of Afghanistan and Myanmar on the understanding that the current ambassadors for both countries remain in those seats.
While the committee chair, Sweden's U.N. Ambassador Anna Karin Enestrom, told reporters the decisions had been deferred, she declined to comment on whether the current ambassadors for Afghanistan and Myanmar would still represent their countries.
The committee - which also includes the Bahamas, Bhutan, Chile, Namibia, Sierra Leone and Sweden - will now send its report on the credentials of all members to the U.N. General Assembly for approval before the end of the year.
Both the committee and the General Assembly traditionally make decisions on credentials by consensus, diplomats say. 
LEVERAGE
The Taliban, which seized power in mid-August from the internationally recognized government, has nominated its Doha-based spokesman Suhail Shaheen https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/exclusive-taliban-names-afghan-un-envoy-asks-speak-world-leaders-2021-09-21 as Afghanistan's U.N. ambassador.

When the Taliban last ruled Afghanistan between 1996 and 2001, the ambassador of the government they toppled remained the U.N. representative after the credentials committee deferred its decision on rival claims to the seat.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said that the Taliban's desire for international recognition is the only leverage https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/un-aid-groups-appeal-afghanistan-funding-vow-stay-2021-08-19 other countries have to press for inclusive government and respect for rights, particularly for women, in Afghanistan.
The Taliban's nominated U.N. envoy Shaheen posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) last month: ""We have all the conditions needed for occupying the seat of Afghanistan at U.N. We hope legal requirements will supersede political preferences.""
Myanmar's junta, which seized power from Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government in February, has put forward military veteran Aung Thurein to be its U.N. envoy. 

Current Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun - appointed by Suu Kyi's government - has also asked to renew his U.N. accreditation, despite being the target of a plot to kill or injure him https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/two-myanmar-citizens-arrested-plot-kill-unambassador-2021-08-06 over his opposition to the coup.

The step, the latest in an escalating diplomatic row, comes after Russia's ambassador to the United States said last week that 27 Russian diplomats and their families were being expelled from the United States and would leave on Jan. 30.
Washington says the diplomats were not expelled but had been in the country for longer than a new three-year limit. 
""We ... intend to respond in the corresponding way. U.S. Embassy employees who have been in Moscow for more than three years must leave Russia by Jan. 31,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told a briefing.
The RIA news agency cited her as saying that new U.S. rules meant Russian diplomats who had been forced to leave the United States were also banned from working as diplomats in the United States for three years. 
""Before July 1 next year, unless Washington waives the three-year rule and compromises, more (U.S.) workers (in Russia) will leave in numbers commensurate with the number of Russians announced by the State Department,"" she said. 
Washington informed Russia over a year ago that its diplomats would only be allowed to stay for three years but could be replaced by other diplomats, according to a State Department spokesperson.
""I want to be clear, this is not an expulsion,"" the spokesperson said, adding the rule change was designed to have Russia rotate its diplomats with similar frequency to that of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.
Further reductions in U.S. Embassy staff in Moscow would put pressure on an operation that Washington has already described as being close to a ""caretaker presence"" amid tit-for-tat expulsions and other restrictions. 
The embassy is the last operational U.S. mission in the country after consulates in Vladivostok and Yekaterinburg were closed and it has shrunk to 120 staff from about 1,200 in early 2017, Washington says.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said it was not too late for Washington to stop Moscow following through on the new expulsions if it abandoned its own plans to force out Russian diplomats. 
Ties between Washington and Moscow, at post-Cold War lows for years, are under pressure due to a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine.

(Reuters) - CNN news anchor Chris Cuomo said Wednesday his suspension from the cable news network over efforts to help his brother, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, respond to allegations of sexual misconduct was ""embarrassing"" and cited an earlier apology for his actions.
Cuomo, the network's top news anchor, was suspended indefinitely on Tuesday after documents were published indicating he was more involved than the company had known in advising his brother how to respond to the allegations that ultimately led to Andrew Cuomo's resignation from the governorship. 
""I've been suspended from CNN... You know this already,"" Cuomo told listeners to a radio show he hosts on SiriusXM. ""It hurts to even say it. It's embarrassing.""
Cuomo went on to say he understood why he was suspended and why colleagues were upset with him. 
""It's the last thing I ever wanted to do was compromise any of my colleagues,"" he said. 
Cuomo, who hosts CNN's most-watched prime time news show in the United States, had admitted in May he breached some of the network's rules in advising his brother how to handle the allegations from a public relations perspective. He also pledged not to report on the case on air.
In journalism it is considered a breach of ethics to use one's position to advocate for a personal cause or to conduct investigations for personal reasons.
CNN said in a statement on Tuesday that Cuomo's suspension followed the release of new court documents on Monday.
The documents released by New York Attorney General Letitia James showed texts and other messages in which Chris Cuomo sought to use his own sources in the media to find out information on the case and the women involved in it.
""These documents point to a greater level of involvement in his brother's efforts than we previously knew. As a result, we have suspended Chris indefinitely, pending further evaluation,"" CNN said.

Andrew Cuomo stepped down as governor of New York in August after multiple allegations of sexual misconduct. He has denied any wrongdoing.
A criminal complaint charging Andrew Cuomo with a misdemeanor sex offense was filed on Oct. 29 in a New York court.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Data from an area in South Africa hard-hit by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus has shown a high number of hospital admissions of infants under 2 years old, raising concerns that the variant may pose risks to young children.
South African scientists have said they cannot yet confirm a link between Omicron and the high admissions of infants, which could be due to other factors. Here is what we do and do not know about the issue.
WHAT IS CAUSING CONCERN?
The data, released by South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), shows that 52 infants under age 2 were among 452 COVID-19 patients admitted in Tshwane - the metropolitan area that includes the capital Pretoria - in the period between Nov. 14 and 28, a higher number than for any other age group.
However, taking into account the size of the populations of the various age groups, the risk of admission was higher for people over age 60.
HAVE THE ADMISSIONS BEEN LINKED TO OMICRON?
No. Only a small percentage of positive test samples in South Africa are being submitted for genomic sequencing to detect the variant due to limited capacity. That means we cannot know for sure whether the infants in hospital were infected with Omicron, NICD scientists have said.
There is also uncertainty about whether all of the infants included in the data are infected with COVID-19, as not all are tested for the virus, scientists said.
For practical reasons, infants who present with respiratory symptoms are treated as if they had COVID-19, but they could be sick with another disease such as flu.
HOW SICK WERE THE ADMITTED INFANTS?
The data shows that 29% of COVID-19 admissions in the 0-to-4 age group had severe disease - a proportion similar to that in several other age groups, and significantly lower than the percentage of severe disease among patients over 60.
Among those age 4 or younger, 1% of admissions resulted in death, according to the data. However, the total number of admissions in that group was 70, making it unclear what the 1% figure represents. 
The NICD did not respond to a query from Reuters about that and other elements of the data, saying it would issue a new report on paediatric admissions later this week.
SHOULD WE BE WORRIED ABOUT A POTENTIAL OMICRON LINK?
Asked whether people should be alarmed by the infant admissions numbers, Professor Anne von Gottberg, clinical microbiologist at the NICD, told Reuters: ""Not yet.""
""It looks like in fact some of those admissions might have started before the emergence of Omicron,"" she said. ""We are concerned enough that we are looking at the data very, very carefully, but at the moment I'm not too sure that we can link it definitively to Omicron.""
WHAT ELSE COULD BE GOING ON?
The province of Gauteng, where Tshwane is located, has experienced an increase in flu cases in the past month.
""We need to be really careful to look at the other respiratory infections and diseases to work out why were children being admitted. Were they being tested as they were being admitted or was it precautionary?"" said von Gottberg.
NICD scientists also said that parents with sick babies and infants were quick to bring them to hospital, while patients in other age groups were less likely to rush in.
WHEN WILL WE KNOW MORE?

The NICD said it was preparing a report on paediatric admissions which should be available by the end of the week.
The World Health Organization said on Wednesday it expected to have data on Omicron's transmissibility within days, but scientists said it could take two-to-four weeks to learn more about the variant.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Hundreds of people favoring and opposing abortion rights staged dueling rallies in front of the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday as the nine justices considered a case that could overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.
The justices heard arguments in Mississippi's bid https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-consider-rolling-back-abortion-rights-2021-12-01 to revive a 2018 state law banning abortion at 15 weeks of pregnancy, with the conservatives who hold a majority signaling sympathy toward the Republican-backed statute that was blocked by lower courts.
Shortly after the arguments ended, U.S. Capitol Police arrested dozens of abortion rights supporters who sat down in a crosswalk near the courthouse, obstructing traffic. 
One of those arrested, Derenda Hancock, pumped her fist in the air as a police officer led her away from the crosswalk. Hancock serves as an escort for women entering Mississippi's sole abortion provider https://www.reuters.com/world/us/lone-mississippi-clinic-front-line-us-supreme-court-abortion-battle-2021-11-29, Jackson Women's Health Organization clinic, which attracts regular anti-abortion protests. The clinic challenged the Mississippi law in the case argued on Wednesday. 
There was a boisterous scene outside the court before, during and after the arguments.
""Roe needs to be abolished. It was one of the biggest mistakes our country ever made,"" said J.C. Carpenter, 49, who drove from Marysville, California to voice her opposition to abortion. ""I am feeling optimistic.""
Abortion opponents, some carrying Christian crosses and playing Christian music, carried a variety of signs including ""Abortion Is Murder,"" ""Love Life"" and ""Turn To Jesus Or Burn In Hell.""
U.S. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Republican from Washington state, argued against abortion using the example of her son Cole, who has Down syndrome. ""His life is worth living,"" she said. 
Abortion rights supporters carried signs saying ""Abortion Is Essential,"" ""Hands Off Roe"" and ""Abortion is Healthcare,"" and some chanted: ""What do we want? Abortion access. When do we want it? Now."" 
""Guess (NYSE:GES) what? When you make abortion illegal it does not stop abortion,"" Shannon Brewer, the director of the Jackson clinic, told the crowd. 

Jen Rudolph, 52, who drove four hours from Raleigh, North Carolina, with her 17-year-old daughter, said they were there to support Roe v. Wade.
""Republicans get abortions, Democrats get abortions. It's a healthcare right,"" Rudolph said.

RIGA (Reuters) - The United States urged Russia on Wednesday to pull back its troops from the Ukrainian border, warning that a Russian invasion would provoke sanctions that would hit Moscow harder than any imposed until now.
""We don't know whether President (Vladimir) Putin has made the decision to invade. We do know that he is putting in place the capacity to do so on short order should he so decide,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.
""Should Russia follow the path of confrontation, when it comes to Ukraine, we've made clear that we will respond resolutely, including with a range of high impact economic measures that we have refrained from pursuing in the past.""
Blinken was speaking in the Latvian capital Riga after conferring with foreign ministers from NATO and Ukraine on how to respond to what Kyiv says is a Russian build-up of more than 90,000 troops near its border.
Russia seized the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 but denies aggressive intent in the current crisis and says it is responding to threatening behaviour by NATO and Ukraine.
The Kremlin said it feared Ukraine was gearing up to try to recapture by force areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists in the Donbass region in the east of the country - something Kyiv denies - and accused it of ""very dangerous adventurism"".
It said Russia could not take any steps to de-escalate because of a large concentration of Ukrainian forces close to the border. 
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Europe faced a critical moment and Russia was trying to shift the blame onto Ukraine.
""I would like again to officially state that Ukraine does not plan any military offensive in Donbass. This is Russian propaganda nonsense in order to cover up Russia's own preparations for a potential attack.""
Blinken declined to spell out what sanctions Russia might face and encouraged both Moscow and Kyiv to return to diplomacy and revive a 2014 peace plan for eastern Ukraine.
Russia has blunted the impact of sanctions imposed over its invasion of Crimea by reducing its borrowings on foreign financial markets and maintaining large currency and gold reserves.
But the West has more potential leverage now if it were to target the newly built Nord Stream 2 pipeline under the Baltic Sea, through which Russia is keen to start pumping gas as soon as it gets the green light from a German regulator.
EAST-WEST FLASHPOINT
Ukraine has centuries of shared history with Russia and Moscow keenly resents its westward tilt since a pro-Russian president was ousted in a revolution in 2014.
It current aspiration to join both the European Union and NATO has made it the main flashpoint in Russia's deteriorating relations with the West.
Putin said on Wednesday that Moscow wanted serious negotiations with the United States and its allies to extract legal guarantees that would rule out any further NATO moves to the east and the deployment of weapons systems close to Russian territory.
A day earlier, the Kremlin leader said Russia was ready with a newly tested hypersonic weapon in case NATO crossed its ""red lines"" and deployed missiles in Ukraine.
Blinken told a news conference: ""The idea that Ukraine represents a threat to Russia would be a bad joke if things weren't so serious. NATO itself is a defensive alliance, we're not a threat to Russia.""
NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg rejected accusations the alliance was provoking Moscow with military exercises in the Black Sea.
""The problem with Russia is that they are not transparent, that they have a very aggressive rhetoric and a track record showing they have used military exercises before as a disguise for aggressive actions against neighbours,"" he told the Reuters Next online summit.
Russia said it had started regular winter military drills in its southern military district, parts of which border Ukraine, and that 10,000 troops had relocated to training grounds across the huge area. Its ally Belarus has also announced joint military drills with Russia on the Ukrainian border.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said direct talks with Moscow were needed to end the war in the east, which Kyiv says has killed more than 14,000 people.

""We must tell the truth that we will not be able to stop the war without direct negotiations with Russia, and today this has already been recognised by all, all external partners,"" Zelenskiy told parliament.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea will broach North Korea separately with two different audiences on Thursday, holding talks with Beijing's top diplomat in China and with visiting U.S. military leaders in Seoul.
In China, talks are expected to include South Korean President Moon Jae-in's hopes for a declaration to end the 1950-1953 Korean War. The conflict halted with an armistice and not a peace treaty.
In Seoul, U.S. and South Korean top brass are expected to discuss ways to strengthen a military alliance whose main goal is deterring a conflict with Pyongyang, and being prepared to fight one if that fails.
""Unfortunately, our mission to ensure peace on the Korean peninsula remains incomplete. There are piles of tasks ahead of us,"" South Korean Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum told U.S. and South Korean military leaders at a reception on Wednesday.
North Korea has so far rebuffed U.S. entreaties for diplomacy since President Joe Biden took over from Donald Trump, who had three summits with leader Kim Jong Un.
Seoul sees an ""end of war declaration"" as a way to build trust with Kim, restart stalled denuclearisation talks, and eventually move toward a lasting peace agreement. 
But Moon, who has tried to engage with North Korea throughout his presidency, is running out of time to clinch an agreement before his term ends in May. 
South Korean national security adviser Suh Hoon will have talks with China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi in the Chinese city of Tianjin on Thursday on North Korea, the presidential Blue House said.
Critics of Moon's push are also concerned about the risk of giving Pyongyang a symbolic ""end of war"" declaration without getting anything concrete in return from Kim.
UPDATING WAR PLANNING
U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met Suh in Seoul on Wednesday and in a brief address later, renewed Washington's commitment to South Korea's defence. 
On Thursday, Austin and U.S. Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will attend annual military talks with South Korea. The discussions are expected to cover an update to operational planning for a potential conflict with North Korea.
""It's needed, given the circumstances and new capabilities that the alliances possesses,"" one U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""We do this all the time.""
North Korea has tested new weapons systems in recent months, including a submarine-launched ballistic missile. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency also cautioned in August http://www.reuters.com/article/northkorea-nuclear-iaea-idINV9N2IE02B that North Korea's nuclear program was moving ""full steam ahead"" with work on plutonium separation, uranium enrichment and other activities.
In a meeting on Wednesday with General In-Choul Won, South Korea's Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, Milley emphasized the U.S. commitment to providing ""extended deterrence"" to South Korea - a reference to Washington's pledge to defend its ally with nuclear weapons if necessary. 

Another issue expected to top the agenda in Seoul is South Korea's efforts to win wartime operational control of combined military forces.
Currently, a U.S. general would command those forces during a war. Progress toward that transition has been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

SYDNEY/JAKARTA (Reuters) -China told Indonesia to stop drilling for oil and natural gas in maritime territory that both countries regard as their own during a months-long standoff in the South China Sea earlier this year, four people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The unprecedented demand, which has not previously been reported, elevated tensions over natural resources between the two countries in a volatile area of global strategic and economic importance. 
One letter from Chinese diplomats to Indonesia's foreign ministry clearly told Indonesia to halt drilling at a temporary offshore rig because it was taking place in Chinese territory, according to Muhammad Farhan, an Indonesian lawmaker on parliament's national security committee, which was briefed on the letter. 
""Our reply was very firm, that we are not going to stop the drilling because it is our sovereign right,"" Farhan told Reuters.
A spokesman for Indonesia's foreign ministry said: ""Any diplomatic communication between states is private in nature and its content cannot be shared."" He declined further comment. 
China's embassy in Indonesia's capital Jakarta did not respond to a request for comment.
Three other people, who said they were briefed on the matter, confirmed the existence of the letter. Two of those people said China made repeated demands that Indonesia stop drilling. 
Southeast Asia's biggest nation says the southern end of the South China Sea is its exclusive economic zone under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and named the area as the North Natuna Sea in 2017. 
China objected to the name change and insists the waterway is within its expansive territorial claim in the South China Sea that it marks with a U-shaped ""nine-dash line,"" a boundary found to have no legal basis by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague in 2016. 
""It (the letter) was a bit threatening because it was the first effort of China's diplomats to push their nine-dash line agenda against our rights under the Law of the Sea,"" Farhan told Reuters. 
China is Indonesia's biggest trade partner and second-largest source of investment, making it a key part of Indonesia's ambition to become a top-tier economy. Indonesian leaders kept quiet about the matter in order to avoid conflict or a diplomatic spat with China, Farhan and two of the other people who spoke to Reuters said. 
Farhan said that China, in a separate letter, also protested against the predominantly land-based Garuda Shield military exercises in August, which took place during the standoff. 
The exercises, involving 4,500 troops from the United States and Indonesia, have been a regular event since 2009. This was China's first protest against them, according to Farhan. ""In their formal letter, the Chinese government was expressing their concern about the security stability in the area,"" he said. 
TENSIONS AT SEA
Within days of the Noble Clyde Boudreaux semi-submersible rig arriving at the Tuna Block in the Natuna Sea to drill two appraisal wells on June 30, a Chinese Coast Guard vessel was at the scene, according to ship movement data. It was soon joined by an Indonesian Coast Guard vessel. 
In response to questions from Reuters, China's foreign ministry said the Chinese Coast Guard ship was ""carrying out normal patrol activities in waters under Chinese jurisdiction."" It did not respond to questions about communications with Indonesia over the drilling. 
China's defence ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
Over the next four months, Chinese and Indonesian ships shadowed each other around the oil and gas field, frequently coming within 1 nautical mile of each other, according to an analysis of ship identification data and satellite imagery by the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI), a project run by the U.S.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Data and images reviewed by AMTI and the Indonesia Ocean Justice Initiative (IOJI), a Jakarta-based independent think-tank, shows a Chinese research ship, Haiyang Dizhi 10, arrived in the area in late August, spending most of the next seven weeks moving slowly in a grid pattern of the adjacent D-Alpha Block, an oil and gas reserve also in contested waters, valued at $500 billion by Indonesian government studies.
""Based on the pattern of movement, nature, and ownership of the vessel, it looked like it was conducting a scientific survey of the D-Alpha reserve,"" said Jeremia Humolong, a researcher at the IOJI. 
On Sept. 25, the American aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan came within 7 nautical miles of the Tuna Block drilling rig. ""This is the first observed instance of a U.S. aircraft carrier operating in such proximity to an ongoing standoff"" in the South China Sea, AMTI said in a report published in November.
Four Chinese warships were also deployed to the area, according to the IOJI and local fishermen.
A spokesman for the U.S. Navy's Carrier Strike Group 5/Task Force 70 declined to disclose the carrier's distance from the rig. 
'NEVER SURRENDER'
China is in negotiations with 10 Southeast Asian states, including Indonesia, to hammer out a code of conduct for the South China Sea, a waterway rich in natural resources carrying at least $3.4 trillion in annual trade. The talks, under the auspices of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), restarted this year after being stopped due to the pandemic.
Beijing's increasingly aggressive stance in the South China Sea has sparked concern in Jakarta, four sources told Reuters. 
Indonesia has not made any formal claim to areas of the South China Sea under United Nations rules, believing the extent of its waters is already clearly set by international law. 
Chinese president Xi Jinping has tried to play down tensions between it and Southeast Asian states, telling a China-ASEAN leaders summit last month that China ""absolutely will not seek hegemony or even less, bully the small"" in the region. 
Farhan told Reuters Indonesia's government played down the tension of the standoff publicly. Its leaders wanted to be ""as silent as possible because, if it was leaked to any media, it would create a diplomatic incident,"" he said. 

The temporary rig operated until Nov. 19, after which it went to Malaysian waters. Indonesian security minister Mahfud M.D. went to the Natuna Sea last week. He said his visit had nothing to do with China, but said in a public statement that Indonesia would ""never surrender an inch"" of territory.
The drilling was completed on time, according to a spokesman for Harbour Energy, the operator of the Tuna Block. In a similar confrontation with China in 2017, Vietnam abandoned exploration activities. Harbour Energy is expected to issue an update on the drilling results on Dec. 9.

GENEVA (Reuters) -The World Health Organization (WHO) agreed on Wednesday to launch negotiations on an international pact to prevent and control future pandemics at a time when the world is gearing up to battle the new Omicron variant of coronavirus.
Such an agreement to beef up measures against pandemics is expected to be ready in May 2024, covering issues from data sharing and genome sequencing of emerging viruses to equitable distribution of vaccines and drugs derived from research.
""The adoption of this decision is cause for celebration and a cause for hope that we all need,"" WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the meeting of health ministers.
""Of course there is still a long road ahead. There are still differences of opinion about what a new accord could or should contain,"" he said, calling for continued cooperation.
In the meantime, countries should abide by the WHO's 2005 International Health Regulations, he said.
The decision, entitled ""The World Together"", was adopted by consensus at a special assembly of the 194 nations that are members of the U.N. health body, drawing applause at the end of a three-day meeting.
""The text before us is the product of extensive discussions, of frank exchanges and of compromises,"" said Australia's ambassador Sally Mansfield, who co-chaired the working group.
The European Union (EU) had pushed for agreement on an international legally binding treaty, along with about 70 countries, but Brazil, India and the United States were among those reluctant to commit to a treaty, diplomats said.
""We call for an ambitious process in developing this treaty - let us all demonstrate our multilateral commitment and engagement towards a binding instrument,"" Ambassador Lotte Knudsen, head of the EU delegation to the United Nations in Geneva, said in a statement on Wednesday.
The United States welcomed the decision saying in a statement: ""This momentous step represents our collective responsibility to work together to advance health security and to make the global health system stronger and more responsive.""
More than 262.22 million people have been reported infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, and 5.46 million killed since it emerged in China in December 2019.

The WHO says China has still not shared some of its early data that might help pinpoint the origin of the virus.
China said on Monday that it was ready to work on developing a new international agreement which it hoped would avoid ""politicisation, stigmatisation and instrumentalisation"".

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations said on Wednesday that a program to pay $300 million a year in cash to Afghan families with children, elderly or people with disabilities is the best way to target increasing poverty.
In what the U.N. Development Programme (UNDP) described as an ""alarming"" socio-economic outlook for Afghanistan for the next 13 months, it also pushed a $100 million ""cash for work"" project to boost employment and $90 million in small business payments.
""This will be probably the best shot at halting this massive collapse into near universal poverty,"" UNDP Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific, Kanni Wignaraja, told Reuters.
As Afghanistan struggles with a sharp drop in international development aid after the Taliban seized power in mid-August, an economy and banking system on the brink of collapse, the COVID-19 pandemic and severe drought, UNDP has projected that poverty may become nearly universal by mid 2022 - affecting more than 90 percent of the country's 39 million people.
The U.N. World Food Programme has said 22.8 million people are facing acute food insecurity. 
UNDP set up a special trust fund in October, with a 50 million euros ($58 million) pledge from Germany, to provide urgently needed cash directly to Afghans. So far, the fund has received pledges for $170 million. 
The UNDP report makes the case for boosting a cash payment program, known as ABADEI, which was launched in October. Since then UNDP said it has made $100,000 in ""cash for work"" payments, creating jobs for 2,300 people in Mazar, Kunduz and Herat, and is being expanded to other provinces. 
The report also warned that Afghanistan's economic growth will not turn positive in the near term unless restrictions on women working are lifted, $250 million a year in aid to combat COVID-19 continues and sanctions are eased to allow for humanitarian assistance.

It estimates that restricting female employment could cause an immediate economic loss of between $600 million and $1 billion - 3 to 5 percent of gross domestic product.
Wignaraja, who has met Taliban officials in Kabul, said a message needed to be sent that ""all capable men and women should be fully back to work and contribute to your full potential to not only mitigate the immediate economic disaster, but think about this as the future of the country.""

(Reuters) -A 15-year-old boy opened fire in a Michigan high school on Tuesday with a semi-automatic pistol his father had purchased days earlier, killing three fellow students and wounding eight other people before he was arrested, authorities said.
Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard told a news briefing hours after the rampage at Oxford High School that investigators were at a loss to explain what might have precipitated ""an unspeakable and unforgivable"" act of violence.
The suspect, disarmed and taken into custody by sheriff's deputies minutes after the shooting began, has declined to speak with investigators after his parents retained a lawyer and denied authorities permission to interview their son, Bouchard said.
""The person who's got the most insight on motive is not talking,"" the sheriff told reporters.
Bouchard said he was unaware of any previous run-ins with law enforcement by the suspect, a high school sophomore, adding there was ""nothing to suggest that there had been disciplinary issues or problems with him at school.""
The bloodshed unfolded around midday in Oxford, Michigan, about 40 miles (65 km) north of Detroit, as terrified students and teachers taking cover inside the school flooded the county emergency dispatch center with more than 100 calls for assistance, authorities said.
Bouchard credited swift action by his deputies, who he said arrived on the scene in minutes and moved straight toward the sound of gunshots, with preventing a much higher casualty toll.
They confronted the young suspect advancing down a hallway toward them with a loaded weapon, when he put his hands over his head and surrendered, Bouchard said.
The precise sequence of events during the violence remained unclear, but police believe the boy carried the weapon into the school in a backpack, the sheriff said.
""The only information I have is that he came out of a bathroom with a weapon, and I don't know where he went first,"" Bouchard said.
PLACED IN JUVENILE DETENTION
Police will ultimately turn over the findings of their investigation to prosecutors, who would decide what charges to bring and whether the suspect would be charged as an adult or a juvenile, the sheriff said.
For now, the 15-year-old suspect, whose name was withheld by authorities because he is a minor, was being detained in a special cell under suicide watch at a juvenile detention center, Oakland County Executive David Coulter said.
Three students died in the shooting spree - a 16-year-old boy who succumbed to his wounds en route to a hospital in a patrol car, and two girls, aged 14 and 17, authorities said.
Of the eight others struck by gunfire, seven were students, two of them hospitalized with gunshot wounds to the head. 
At least two girls, aged 14 and 17, were described by Bouchard as critically wounded with chest wounds, one of them placed on a ventilator.
A teacher was also treated for a shoulder wound and later discharged.
Undersheriff Michael McCabe said earlier that 15 to 20 rounds were fired during the rampage, which lasted no more than five minutes.
Bouchard said the boy was armed with a 9 millimeter semi-automatic handgun his father had purchased on Nov. 26, along with three 15-round magazines. Seven live rounds remained in the gun when the youth was arrested, the sheriff said.
The boy apparently ""had been shooting"" with the gun before Tuesday's attack and had posted pictures of the weapon and a target he was using, according to the sheriff.
'AMERICAN PROBLEM'
""My heart goes out to the families enduring the unimaginable grief of losing a loved one,"" President Joe Biden told reporters while touring a Minnesota technical college.
The latest in a long series of U.S. school shootings will likely fuel debates about gun control and mental health care, with many states allowing easy access to firearms while mental health disorders frequently go untreated.
""This is a uniquely American problem that we need to address,"" said Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who rushed to the scene and appeared with McCabe before the media.
Student Abbey Hodder told the Detroit Free Press she was in chemistry class when she heard the sound of glass breaking.
""My teacher kind of ran out and was scrambling,"" Hodder, 15, told the newspaper. ""The next thing I knew I saw he was pushing tables. It's part of school protocol to barricade, so we all knew, barricade, barricade down. And we all started pushing tables.""

Video posted on social media showed students huddled in a barricaded classroom while someone outside shouts through the door that it is safe to come out, identifying himself as being with the sheriff's office.
But the teacher responds: ""We're not taking that risk,"" and incredulous students who feared the shooter might have been trying to lure them into the hall escaped out a back window and were soon met by uniformed deputies.

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Japan and the United States could not stand by if China attacked Taiwan, and Beijing needs to understand this, former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Wednesday.
Tensions over Chinese-claimed Taiwan have risen as President Xi Jinping seeks to assert his country's sovereignty claims against the democratically ruled island. Taiwan's government says it wants peace, but will defend itself if needed.
Speaking virtually to a forum organised by Taiwanese think tank the Institute for National Policy Research, Abe noted the Senkaku islands - which China calls the Diaoyu Islands - Sakishima islands and Yonaguni island are a mere 100 km (62 miles) or so away from Taiwan. 
An armed invasion of Taiwan would be a grave danger to Japan, he added. 
""A Taiwan emergency is a Japanese emergency, and therefore an emergency for the Japan-U.S. alliance. People in Beijing, President Xi Jinping in particular, should never have a misunderstanding in recognising this,"" Abe said. 
Japan is host to major U.S. military bases, including on the southern island of Okinawa, a short flight from Taiwan, which would be crucial for any U.S. support during a Chinese attack.
The United States is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, though there is ambiguity about whether it would send forces to help Taiwan in a war with China.
The United States and its allies would take unspecified ""action"" https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-taiwan-idAFKBN2HV2PU if China were to use force to alter the status quo over Taiwan, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last month.
Abe, who stepped down as prime minister last year, is head of the largest faction of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and remains influential within the party.
On Sino-Japanese relations going forward, Abe said Japan should advance its ties with China while firmly saying to its giant neighbour what needs to be said, echoing incumbent Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
""Japan, Taiwan and all the people who believe in democracy need to keep urging President Xi Jinping and other Chinese Communist Party leaders repeatedly not to step onto a wrong path,"" Abe said. 

Japan and Taiwan must work together to protect freedom and democracy, added Abe, speaking to an audience that included Cheng Wen-tsan, mayor of the northern Taiwanese city of Taoyuan, tipped as a possible future presidential candidate. 
""A stronger Taiwan, a thriving Taiwan, and a Taiwan that guarantees freedom and human rights are also in Japan's interests. Of course, this is also in the interests of the whole world,"" Abe said.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) -Honduras' conservative ruling party candidate late on Tuesday conceded defeat in the presidential election, paving the way for his leftist rival Xiomara Castro to become the first female leader of the struggling Central American country.
Calling Castro ""president elect,"" National Party contender Nasry Asfura said he had visited his opponent at her family home to offer his congratulations for winning Sunday's vote, in a move that will end his group's 12-year hold on power.
""Now I want to say publicly, I congratulate her on her victory,"" Asfura said in a video broadcast on local television alongside photos of the two rivals hugging and smiling.
Castro has piled up a preliminary lead of almost 20 percentage points over Asfura, but the result had been held in suspense by a sluggish vote count at the electoral council.
With over 52% of votes tallied by Tuesday evening, Castro had 53.4% support, and Asfura 34.1%.
Minutes after Asfura's concession, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also congratulated Castro and said Washington looked forward to working with her.
""We congratulate Hondurans for the high voter turnout, peaceful participation, and active civil society engagement that marked this election, signaling an enduring commitment to the democratic process,"" Blinken said.
Although the electoral council has not published preliminary vote totals for congressional races, early results point to a possible majority for Castro's Libre party and its main allies.
National Party chief David Chavez said earlier that his party would assume the role of ""constructive opposition"" and was ready to work with the incoming government.
The concession brings to an end a turbulent period under the National Party, which has been dogged by scandals and corruption accusations, especially during the two terms of outgoing President Juan Orlando Hernandez.
Hernandez is deeply unpopular and has been implicated in a drug trafficking case in a U.S. federal court. He denies wrongdoing, but could face an indictment when he leaves office.
Castro's victory will see the left return to power after a 12-year hiatus that followed the ousting of her husband, former President Manuel Zelaya, in a coup in 2009.
Castro faces big challenges in Honduras, where joblessness, crime, corruption and the threat of transnational drug gangs have helped spur record migration to the United States.
She managed a strong showing in Sunday's election despite findings by the European Union vote observer mission that the National Party had used state backing to boost its campaign.
The smooth transmission of early election results had aided transparency and confidence, the EU mission said. But it criticized pre-election political violence and ""abuse of state resources,"" such as a rise in handing out of welfare vouchers.

""The state media visibly favored the ruling party and its presidential candidate,"" said the mission's head, Željana Zovko.
Castro's team is already preparing for government. Hugo Noe, head of the campaign's policy platform, told Reuters Castro will seek to negotiate a new debt deal with the International Monetary Fund when she takes office in January.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. judge sentenced the wife of imprisoned Mexican drug kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman to three years in prison on Tuesday, after she pleaded guilty to helping the Sinaloa drug cartel.
Before her sentencing in a federal court in Washington, Emma Coronel Aispuro, 32, pleaded with U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras to show her mercy.
""With all due respect, I address you today to express my true regret for any and all harm that I may have done, and I ask that you and all the citizens of this country forgive me,"" she said in Spanish through an interpreter. 
She added that she feared the judge might find it difficult to forgive her because she is Guzman's wife. ""Perhaps for this reason you feel there is a need for you to be harder on me, but I pray that you not do that,"" she added.
Coronel pleaded guilty https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/wife-drug-kingpin-el-chapo-readies-guilty-plea-washington-2021-06-10 in June to three counts of conspiring to distribute illegal drugs, conspiring to launder money and of engaging in financial dealings with the Sinaloa drug cartel. 
Federal prosecutors on Tuesday asked that a four-year prison term be imposed on Coronel, adding that she would be forfeiting $1.5 million as part of her sentence. 
""While the overall effect of the defendant's conduct was significant, the defendant's actual role was a minimal one. The defendant acted primarily in support of her husband,"" federal prosecutor Anthony Nardozzi said.
He noted that after her arrest, she ""quickly accepted responsibility for her criminal conduct.""
Coronel, a U.S.-born former beauty queen who married Guzman while she was a teenager, was arrested at Dulles International Airport outside Washington in February. She and Guzman have nine-year-old twin daughters together.
As part of her plea agreement with prosecutors, Coronel admitted to acting as a courier between Guzman and other members of the Sinaloa cartel while he was being held in Mexico's Altiplano prison following his 2014 arrest.
Guzman used those communications to plan his 2015 escape from the prison, through an underground tunnel built by the cartel leading to the shower in his cell.
The drug lord was recaptured in January 2016 and extradited one year later to the United States. 
He was convicted in February 2019 of drug trafficking, conspiracy, kidnapping, murder and other charges, and later sentenced to life in prison.
'GOOD LUCK TO YOU'
Coronel's attorney on Tuesday stressed that she was swept into the world of drug trafficking while still a minor, and deserved mercy.
""She met Joaquin Guzman when she was a minor. She was 17 years old, and she married him on her 18th birthday,"" said Jeffrey Lichtman, a defense attorney who also represented Guzman in his U.S. trial three years ago.
Lichtman added that Coronel now finds herself in danger, noting that anonymous law enforcement sources told news media that she was cooperating with the government.
""I'm not sure that she could ever go back home,"" he said.

Contreras said that he took her background into consideration when weighing the sentence, as well as the fact that she will be the sole caretaker for her children due to her husband's life sentence.
""Good luck to you,"" he told her as the hearing concluded. ""I hope that you raise your twins in a different environment than you've experienced today.""

238,"<span>Nov 30, 2021 08:46PM ET</span>",,,,,,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Authorities investigating the fatal shooting on the ""Rust"" movie last month are investigating whether recycled live ammunition may have made its way into a stash of dummy bullets on the set in New Mexico, according to court documents released on Tuesday.
The documents include a search warrant for the premises of a local supplier of ammunition and movie props.
The supplier told police he suspected that the live bullets found on the set may have been ""reloaded ammunition"" that he got previously from a friend. Reloaded ammunition is made up of recycled components, including bullets.
Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed and director Joel Souza was wounded when a gun that actor Alec Baldwin had been told was safe fired off a live bullet during a rehearsal on Oct. 21.
The key question remains how a live bullet, rather than a blank, ended up in the gun. Other live rounds were also found on the set, investigators have said.
No criminal charges have been filed.
The newly released documents said Santa Fe sheriff's deputies had spoken with Seth Kenny, who supplied some of the ammunition for ""Rust,"" and who ""advised he may know where the live rounds came from.""
""Seth described how a couple years back, he received 'reloaded ammunition' from a friend,"" the document said.
Kenny's office and storerooms in Albuquerque were the subject of a search warrant. Kenny could not be reached for comment on Tuesday.
Sheriff's deputies said they also had spoken with Thell Reed, the father of Hannah Gutierrez, the woman who was in charge of weapons on the movie set.
Thell, who is also a movie armorer, told them he worked with Kenny earlier this year on another film and supplied some additional live ammunition for training on a firearms range.
Thell said some of the live ammunition from that film was left over and remained in Kenny's possession. ""Thell stated that this ammunition may match the ammunition found on the set of 'Rust.'""

Two crew members have filed civil lawsuits over the fatal shooting, alleging negligence on the part of the producers and others.
Baldwin has said he is heartbroken and is cooperating with the law enforcement investigation. Production company Rust Movie Productions is conducting its own probe.

RIGA/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia would pay a high price for any new military aggression against Ukraine, NATO and the United States warned on Tuesday as the Western military alliance met to discuss Moscow's possible motives for massing troops near the Ukrainian border.
President Vladimir Putin countered that Russia would be forced to act if U.S.-led NATO placed missiles in Ukraine that could strike Moscow within minutes.
Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that now aspires to join the European Union and NATO, has become the main flashpoint between Russia and the West as relations have soured to their worst level in the three decades since the Cold War ended.
""There will be a high price to pay for Russia if they once again use force against the independence of the nation Ukraine,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed Stoltenberg, saying: ""Any escalatory actions by Russia would be a great concern to the United States..., and any renewed aggression would trigger serious consequences."" 
Tensions have been rising for weeks, with Russia, Ukraine and NATO all staging military exercises amid mutual recriminations over which side is the aggressor.
Putin went further than previously in spelling out Russia's ""red lines"" on Ukraine, saying it would have to respond if NATO deployed advanced missile systems on its neighbour's soil.
""If some kind of strike systems appear on the territory of Ukraine, the flight time to Moscow will be 7-10 minutes, and five minutes in the case of a hypersonic weapon being deployed. Just imagine,"" the Kremlin leader said.
""What are we to do in such a scenario? We will have to then create something similar in relation to those who threaten us in that way. And we can do that now,"" he said, pointing to Russia's recent testing of a hypersonic weapon he said could fly at nine times the speed of sound.
EU and other Western leaders are involved in a geopolitical tug-of-war with Russia for influence in Ukraine and two other ex-Soviet republics, Moldova and Georgia, through trade, cooperation and protection arrangements. 
U.S. BRIEFING
NATO foreign ministers began two days of talks in the Latvian capital Riga to debate what they say is the growing Russian threat, with Blinken due to brief his 29 alliance counterparts on Washington's intelligence assessment.
Blinken, speaking at a news conference with his Latvian counterpart, said he will have more to say on Wednesday on how to respond to Russia after holding talks with NATO allies.
""We will be consulting closely with...allies and partners in the days ahead...about whether there are other steps that we should take as an alliance to strengthen our defences, strengthen our resilience, strengthen our capacity,"" he said.
Ukraine Prime Minister Denys Shmygal accused Russia https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/exclusive-ukraine-pm-says-russia-absolutely-behind-coup-attempt-2021-11-30 of trying to topple the elected government in Kyiv, which the Kremlin denies, after Ukraine's president last week unveiled what he said was a coup attempt.
Shmygal also said Ukraine would seek more weapons from the United States - precisely the course of action that Putin has warned against.
The Kremlin annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and then backed rebels fighting government troops in the east of the country. That conflict has killed 14,000 people, according to Kyiv, and is still simmering. 
In May, Russian troops on Ukraine's borders numbered 100,000, the most since its Crimea takeover, Western officials say. Ukraine says there are more than 90,000 there now.
Moscow has dismissed as inflammatory Ukrainian suggestions that it is preparing for an attack, said it does not threaten anyone and defended its right to deploy troops on its own territory as it wishes.
Britain and Germany echoed the NATO warnings. 

""We will stand with our fellow democracies against Russia's malign activity,"" said British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. 
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said: ""NATO's support for Ukraine is unbroken...Russia would have to pay a high price for any sort of aggression.""

(Reuters) - A spacewalk planned for Tuesday to replace a faulty antenna on the International Space Station has been postponed for 48 hours, after mission control concluded that the position of orbital debris cited for the delay posed no risk to the repair operation, NASA said.
Two U.S. astronauts were originally due to venture outside the space station on Tuesday morning to begin their work, despite what NASA officials acknowledged was a slightly elevated risk level from debris scattered in low-Earth orbit by a Russian anti-satellite missile test this month.
But about five hours before the outing was to have begun, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced the spacewalk had been temporarily called off after mission control was alerted that the U.S. military's Space Surveillance Network had detected debris that could collide with the space station. The origin of the debris was not made clear in the NASA announcement.
On Tuesday afternoon, NASA said its evaluation of the situation ""determined the orbit of the debris does not pose a risk to a scheduled spacewalk"" or space station operations.
The antenna repair was rescheduled for Thursday, with astronauts Tom Marshburn, 61, and Kayla Barron, 34, set to begin their planned 6-1/2-hour spacewalk starting at 7:10 a.m. EST (1210 GMT).
A NASA spokesman, Gary Jordan, said there was no information available about the size of the debris, its proximity to the space station, which is orbiting about 250 miles (402 km) above the Earth, or whether one or more objects were involved. 
""We have no indications that this is related"" to the Russian missile test weeks earlier, Jordan added in an email to Reuters.
The planned ""extravehicular activity,"" or EVA, will mark the fifth spacewalk for Marshburn, a medical doctor and former flight surgeon with two previous trips to orbit, and a first for Barron, a U.S. Navy submarine officer and nuclear engineer on her debut spaceflight for NASA.
Their objective is to remove a faulty S-band radio communications antenna assembly, now more than 20 years old, and replace it with a new spare stowed outside the space station.
According to plans, Marshburn will work with Barron while positioned at the end of a robotic arm operated from inside the station by German astronaut Matthias Maurer of the European Space Agency, with help from NASA crewmate Raja Chari.
The four arrived at the station on Nov. 11 in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, joining two Russian cosmonauts and a NASA astronaut already aboard the space laboratory.
Four days later, Russia fired a missile into one of its own defunct satellites in an unannounced space weapons test, generating a large orbital debris field that prompted an emergency aboard the space station. All seven crew members scrambled to take shelter in their docked spaceships to allow for a quick getaway until the immediate danger passed, according to NASA.
The residual debris cloud from the blasted satellite has since dispersed, according to Dana Weigel, NASA deputy manager of the space station program.

But NASA calculates that remaining fragments continue to pose a ""slightly elevated"" background risk to the orbiting platform as a whole, and a 7% higher risk of spacewalkers' suits being punctured, as compared to before Russia's missile test, Weigel told reporters on Monday.
Although NASA has yet to fully quantify hazards posed by more than 1,700 larger fragments it is tracking around the station's orbit, the 7% higher risk to spacewalkers falls ""well within"" fluctuations previously seen in ""the natural environment,"" Weigel said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and China are engaged in an arms race to develop the most lethal hypersonic weapons, the U.S. Air Force secretary said on Tuesday, as Beijing and Washington build and test more and more of the high-speed next-generation arms. 
""There is an arms race, not necessarily for increased numbers, but for increased quality,"" Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall told Reuters during an interview in his Pentagon offices. ""It's an arms race that has been going on for quite some time. The Chinese have been at it very aggressively.""
In October, the top U.S. military officer, General Mark Milley, confirmed a Chinese hypersonic weapons test that military experts say appears to show Beijing's pursuit of an Earth-orbiting system designed to evade American missile defenses.
This year the Pentagon has held several hypersonic weapons tests with mixed success. In October, the Navy successfully tested a booster rocket motor that would be used to power a launch vehicle carrying a hypersonic weapon aloft.
Hypersonic weapons travel in the upper atmosphere at speeds of more than five times the speed of sound, or about 6,200 kilometers (3,853 miles) per hour.
Kendall noted that while the U.S. military has focused funds on Iraq and Afghanistan, it has taken its eye off the ball in terms of hypersonic weapons. ""This isn't saying we've done nothing, but we haven't done enough,"" he said.
As the Pentagon enters the 2023 annual budget cycle, Kendall hopes to raise funds with the retirement of older and expensive-to-maintain systems in favor of new systems, including hypersonic development programs.
""I love the A-10. The C-130 is a great aircraft that's been very capable and very effective for a lot of missions. The MQ-9s have been very effective for counterterrorism and so on. They're still useful, but none of these things scare China,"" Kendall said, referring to a more than 40-year-old combat aircraft, a plane for carrying cargo, and widely used drones, respectively. 
Defense contractors hope to capitalize on the shift to hypersonic weapons not only by building them, but also by developing new detection and defeat mechanisms.

Arms makers  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT),  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp have all touted their hypersonic weapons programs to investors as world focus shifted to the new arms race for an emerging class of weapon.
Still, the Pentagon wants defense contractors to cut the ultimate cost of hypersonic weapons, the head of research and development has said, as the next generation of super-fast missiles being developed currently costs tens of millions per unit.

(Reuters) -A divided U.S. appeals court on Tuesday reinstated California's ban on high-capacity magazines, calling it a reasonable means to try reducing gun violence following a spate of mass shootings nationwide.
By a 7-4 vote, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected claims by firearms owners that banning magazines with more than 10 rounds of ammunition violated their right to bear arms under the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment.
The majority opinion by Circuit Judge Susan Graber called the 2017 ban a ""reasonable fit for the important government interest of reducing gun violence"" that interfered ""only minimally"" with the right to self-defense.
Tuesday's decision is a temporary victory for gun control advocates, as they await a U.S. Supreme Court decision on a New York law imposing strict limits on carrying guns outside the home.
The Supreme Court signaled https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-supreme-court-hear-major-gun-rights-case-new-york-2021-11-03 during oral arguments on Nov. 3 it might strike down the law, while appearing open to gun limits in schools, sports stadiums and crowded public settings. It is expected to rule by June.
A lower court judge had struck down the California ban in 2019, and a divided three-judge appeals court panel upheld that decision in August 2020. The appeals court set aside https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-court-reconsider-california-ban-high-capacity-magazines-2021-02-25 that ruling in February so 11 judges could consider the dispute.
One of Tuesday's dissenters, Circuit Judge Patrick Bumatay, said high-capacity magazines have been used for centuries, with millions in use today, and deserved protection under the 2008 Supreme Court decision giving individuals a right to bear arms.
Chuck Michel, president of the California Rifle & Pistol Association, said his group will appeal to the Supreme Court. He said courts should stop treating the Second Amendment ""like a second-class gift from government.""
California Governor Gavin Newsom welcomed the decision.

""Weapons of war don't belong on our streets,"" the Democratic governor tweeted. ""This is a huge victory for the health and safety of all Californians.""
Democratic presidents appointed the seven judges in Tuesday's majority, while Republican presidents appointed the four dissenting judges. The judges issued six opinions totaling 156 pages.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A woman who says she was sexually abused by the late financier Jeffrey Epstein at 14 years old told jurors on Tuesday at Ghislaine Maxwell's criminal trial that the British socialite facilitated and participated in some sexual encounters. 
The woman, known by the pseudonym Jane, took the stand for the government on the second day of Maxwell's sex abuse trial in Manhattan federal court. 
During cross-examination, a lawyer for Maxwell questioned Jane, now in her early 40s, about how she did not report the alleged abuse until decades after it occurred.
Maxwell, 59, faces sex trafficking and other charges. Prosecutors say she recruited and groomed Jane and three other underage girls for Epstein to abuse between 1994 and 2004. Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges. 
Maxwell has pleaded not guilty, and her lawyers have said she is being scapegoated because Epstein is no longer alive.
They have said Jane and the other alleged victims, who are also expected to testify at the trial, have faulty memories and financial incentives to accuse Maxwell. 
During three hours of explicit and emotional testimony, Jane said Maxwell and Epstein first approached her and a group of friends when they were eating ice cream at an arts summer camp in Michigan in the summer of 1994.
Jane, a singer, said her family was struggling financially after her father's death the prior year. She said Epstein and Maxwell told her that they were benefactors of her camp and awarded many student scholarships. 
They remained in touch after Jane returned home to Palm Beach, Florida, where Epstein also had a home, Jane testified. She said Maxwell sometimes took her to the movies or spent time with her by Epstein's pool. She said they talked about school, including whether Jane had a boyfriend.
Jane testified that she said she did not, and that Maxwell then told her: ""'Once you fuck them, you can always fuck them again because they're grandfathered in.'
""I giggled because I didn't understand what grandfathered meant,"" Jane testified.
Prosecutors said in a 2021 indictment against Maxwell that behavior like buying girls gifts and discussing sexual topics amounted to ""grooming"" them for abuse.
As Jane spoke, Maxwell occasionally put on a pair of glasses, leaned forward and took notes on Post-its, which she passed to her attorneys. 
'I FELT ASHAMED'
Jane said she had a sexual encounter with Epstein in the pool room of his Palm Beach house while still 14.
""He pulled me on top of himself and proceeded to masturbate on me,"" Jane said. ""I was terrified and felt gross and I felt ashamed.""
On other occasions, also at age 14, Jane said Maxwell and Epstein would take her to a massage table in his Palm Beach house and demonstrate how Epstein liked to be massaged. The massages transitioned into sexual activity, and Maxwell sometimes touched her breasts, Jane said. 
Jane described Maxwell's demeanor as ""very casual"" during these interactions.
Maxwell's lawyers have said Jane and other accusers received payouts from a fund set up by Epstein's estate to compensate victims. The fund started up in mid-2020 and ended its claims process in August of 2021 after giving more than $121 million to about 138 people.
In his opening statement on Monday, Maxwell attorney Bobbi Sternheim said accusers could ""enhance"" their rewards by cooperating with prosecutors.
Sternheim called Jane a ""very successful actress"" who never accused Maxwell of wrongdoing before Epstein's death. 
""She is a pro at playing roles and as her scripts and characters change, so has the story that you will hear,"" Sternheim said.
During cross-examination, Jane confirmed she did not report the alleged incidents to law enforcement until 2019.
When Maxwell attorney Laura Menninger asked whether she told family members and close friends about Maxwell's alleged role, Jane said, ""I don't know."" 

""I was very reluctant to give details,"" Jane said. ""I didn't want to share it with them in the first place.""
Jane said in testimony that she had been employed as an actor for 22 years and was awarded $5 million by the compensation fund. She is expected to return for further cross-examination on Wednesday.

(Reuters) -The former Minnesota police officer charged in the April shooting of Daunte Wright, a Black man whose death prompted new protests against police brutality, will testify in her own defense, her attorney said on Tuesday as jury selection began in the manslaughter trial.
Kimberly Potter, a white former officer in Brooklyn Center just north of Minneapolis, has pleaded not guilty to first- and second-degree manslaughter charges. Her lawyers have said Potter, 49, mistakenly discharged her handgun instead of her stun gun at Wright, 20, during a traffic stop. 
Her lawyers also have accused the prosecution of disregarding the conduct of Wright, who they have said resisted arrest and attempted to drive away. Potter, a 26-year veteran of the police force, resigned after the incident.
While questioning a prospective juror, defense attorney Paul Engh said Potter would take the witness stand, a move that lets her tell jurors her side of the story but will expose her to prosecution cross-examination.
""Officer Potter will testify and tell you what she remembers happened. So you will know not just from the video, but from the officers at the scene and Officer Potter herself - what was occurring,” Engh said. ""We have something to say here, too.""
Two men and two women were selected on Tuesday for the 12-member panel and its two alternates. Hennepin County District Court Judge Regina Chu has said jury selection could take about a week and has set opening statements for Dec. 8.
Prosecutors used one of their three strikes to dismiss a retired fire captain after asking questions about whether he could be impartial toward a fellow first responder. Defense attorneys used one of their five strikes on a woman who once volunteered for the political campaign of Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who was in the courtroom.
Chu dismissed five potential jurors for cause. 
In Minnesota, the maximum sentences for first- and second-degree manslaughter are 15 years and 10 years, respectively.
'VICTIM BLAMING'
Wright's shooting occurred only a few miles (km) from the courthouse where Derek Chauvin, a white former Minneapolis police officer, was convicted https://www.reuters.com/world/us/jurors-resume-deliberations-derek-chauvin-murder-trial-2021-04-20 in April of murder in the death of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, during a May 2020 arrest.
Floyd's death sparked demonstrations in many U.S. cities last year against police brutality and racism. Wright's shooting triggered several nights of demonstrations in Brooklyn Center, with many calling the incident another example of police violence against Black Americans.
Wright was pulled over by police because he had an air freshener hanging from his car's rearview mirror and the license-plate tabs had expired. In addition to Potter, two other officers were on the scene as they attempted to detain Wright after finding there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest for a misdemeanor weapons violation.
Potter can be heard on police body-camera video shouting: ""I'll tase you,"" while pointing her handgun at Wright. He was attempting to get back behind the steering wheel after struggling to get away from another officer's grip. Potter then shot Wright in the chest.
Seconds later, Potter said she grabbed the wrong gun, adding: ""I'm going to go to prison,"" according to an amended criminal complaint submitted to the court in September.

Civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump and two other lawyers representing the Wright family issued a statement expressing concern that Potter's attorneys would look to focus the jury on Wright's conduct as the officers sought to arrest him. 
""This encounter was a pretextual, unnecessary stop of a young Black man for nothing more than a minor traffic infraction,"" they said. ""We must look past the shameless victim blaming that has been and will be directed towards Daunte.""

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - On Friday Nov. 19, Raquel Viana, Head of Science at one of South Africa's biggest private testing labs, sequenced the genes on eight coronavirus samples - and got the shock of her life.
The samples, tested in the Lancet laboratory, all bore a large number of mutations, especially on the spike protein that the virus uses to enter human cells.
""I was quite shocked at what I was seeing. I questioned whether something had gone wrong in the process,"" she told Reuters, a thought that quickly gave way to ""a sinking feeling that the samples were going to have huge ramifications"".
She quickly picked up the phone to her colleague at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in Johannesburg, gene sequencer Daniel Amoako.
""I didn't quite know how to break it to them,"" she recalls. She told Amoako, ""To me, it looks like a new lineage.""
The discovery of the Omicron variant in southern Africa has caused global alarm, with countries limiting travel from the region and imposing other restrictions for fear it could spread quickly even in vaccinated populations. 
Amoako and the team at the NICD spent the Nov. 20-21 weekend testing the eight samples which Viana sent them, all of which had the same mutations, he told Reuters on Tuesday.
It was so bizarre that Amoako, his colleague Josie Everatt and other colleagues also thought it must be a mistake. Then they remembered that over the week, they'd noticed a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases, of the sort that might indicate a new mutant. 
In addition, Viana had been alerted to an oddity in the sample earlier this month by a colleague - an S-gene dropout, one of the mutations that now distinguishes the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus from the globally dominant Delta one. 
The only common variant with that feature was Alpha, ""and we hadn't seen Alpha (in South Africa) since August,"" Everatt recalls thinking as they tested the samples. 
By Tuesday, Nov. 23, after testing another 32 from around Johannesburg and Pretoria, ""it was clear,"" Amoako said. 
""It was scary."" 
BURNING QUESTIONS 
On the same Tuesday, the NICD team informed the department of health and other labs across South Africa doing sequencing, which later started coming up with similar results. 
The same day, the NICD entered the data into the GISAID global science database, and found that Botswana and Hong Kong had also reported cases with the same gene sequence.
On Nov. 24, NICD officials and the department notified the World Health Organisation.
By that stage, Viana said, more than two-thirds of positive tests in Gauteng, the South African province that includes Pretoria and Johannesburg, were showing the S-gene dropout - a sign that Omicron was already becoming dominant.
Thanks to Omicron, South Africa's daily COVID-19 infection rate is expected to quadruple to more than 10,000 by the end of this week, one of the country's leading infectious disease specialists, Salim Abdool Karim, said on Monday. 
The important questions - how good is the new variant at evading immunity from vaccines or past illness, how severe are the symptoms, compared with previous versions, and how will this differ among age groups - remain to be answered.
Three scientists interviewed by Reuters who are working on those questions expect answers in about 3-4 weeks. 
In the meantime, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is considering introducing mandatory vaccination in some contexts, with the country still reeling from 3 million COVID-19 infections in total during the pandemic and over 89,000 deaths.
There is much anger in South Africa at the foreign travel bans - some of it directed at the scientists. Amoako receives some angry messages saying they should just ""stop looking"" for new variants. 
Wolfgang Preiser, a virologist at Stellenbosch University working on COVID-19, who also has received hate mail, worries that other countries might take this whole saga as a lesson not to be so transparent.

""It might encourage other countries to hide things, or rather, just not to look,"" he said.
""That's the fear. Looking is quite an investment, so maybe they will conclude, 'let's not bother'.""

BRIDGETOWN (Reuters) - Barbados ditched Britain's Queen Elizabeth as head of state, forging a new republic on Tuesday with its first-ever president and severing its last remaining colonial bonds nearly 400 years after the first English ships arrived at the Caribbean island.
At the strike of midnight, the new republic was born to cheers of hundreds of people lining Chamberlain Bridge in the capital, Bridgetown. A 21-gun salute fired as the national anthem of Barbados was played over a crowded Heroes Square.
Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, stood somberly as Queen Elizabeth's royal standard was lowered and the new Barbados declared, a step which republicans hope will spur discussion of similar proposals in other former British colonies that have the Queen as their sovereign.
""We the people must give Republic Barbados its spirit and its substance,"" Sandra Mason, the island's first president, said. ""We must shape its future. We are each other’s and our nation’s keepers. We the people are Barbados.""
Barbados casts the removal of Elizabeth II, who is still queen of 15 other realms including the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and Jamaica, as a way to finally break with the demons of its colonial history.
""The creation of this republic offers a new beginning,"" said Prince Charles. ""From the darkest days of our past and the appalling atrocity of slavery which forever stains our history, people of this island forged their path with extraordinary fortitude.""
In a message to the new president, the 95-year-old queen sent her congratulations to Barbadians who she said have held a special place in her heart.
""I send you and all Barbadians my warmest good wishes for your happiness, peace and prosperity in the future,"" she said.
After a dazzling display of Barbadian dance and music, complete with speeches celebrating the end of colonialism, Barbadian singer Rihanna was declared a national hero by Prime Minister Mia Mottley, the leader of Barbados' republican movement.
The birth of the republic, 55 years to the day since Barbados declared independence, unclasps almost all the colonial bonds that have kept the tiny island tied to England since an English ship claimed it for King James I in 1625.
It may also be a harbinger of a broader attempt by other former colonies to cut ties to the British monarchy as it braces for the end of Elizabeth's nearly 70-year reign and the future accession of Charles.
""Full stop this colonial page,"" Winston Farrell, a Barbadian poet told the ceremony. ""Some have grown up stupid under the Union Jack, lost in the castle of their skin.""
""It is about us, rising out of the cane fields, reclaiming our history,"" he said. ""End all that she mean, put a Bajan there instead.""
SLAVE HISTORY
Prince Charles' speech highlighted the continuing friendship of the two nations though he acknowledged the horrors of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.
While Britain casts slavery as a sin of the past, some Barbadians are calling for compensation from Britain.
Activist David Denny celebrated the creation of the republic but said he opposes the visit by Prince Charles, noting the royal family for centuries benefited from the slave trade.
""Our movement would also like the royal family to pay a reparation,"" Denny said in an interview in Bridgetown.
The English initially used white British indentured servants to toil on the plantations of tobacco, cotton, indigo and sugar, but Barbados in just a few decades would become England's first truly profitable slave society.
Barbados received 600,000 enslaved Africans between 1627 and 1833, who were put to work in the sugar plantations, earning fortunes for the English owners.
More than 10 million Africans were shackled into the Atlantic slave trade by European nations between the 15th and 19th centuries. Those who survived the often brutal voyage, ended up toiling on plantations.
""I'm overjoyed,"" Ras Binghi, a Bridgetown cobbler, told Reuters ahead of the ceremony. Binghi said he would be saluting the new republic with a drink and a smoke. 
Barbados will remain a republic within the Commonwealth, a grouping of 54 countries across Africa, Asia, the Americas and Europe.
Outside the lavish official ceremony, some Barbadians said they were uncertain what the transition to a republic even meant or why it mattered.

""They should leave Queen Elizabeth be - leave her as the boss. I don't understand why we need to be a republic,"" said Sean Williams, 45, standing in the shadow of an independence monument.
The last time the queen was removed as head of state was in 1992 when the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius proclaimed itself a republic.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's president on Tuesday signed into law legislation that will limit the access of aid charities and journalists to its border with Belarus as the country grapples with a simmering migrant crisis.
The law is a blow to the opposition parties that advocated for unlimited media access, an amendment approved by the upper house of parliament on Friday but rejected by the lower house.
Under the state of emergency declared in the border region in September and ending at midnight, the media and aid charities were completely banned. The opposition said the ban was intended to cover up rights abuses and had sought unfettered access.
The government said the restrictions were necessary for security reasons. 
Under the new rules, the interior minister can limit access to the border zone after consulting with the head of the Border Guard. However, journalists and NGOs may be able to enter at the discretion of local Border Guard heads.
Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski said on Tuesday night he would order a temporary ban on entering areas around the border.
The European Union accuses Minsk of engineering the migrant crisis to hit back at sanctions. Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko accuses the EU of deliberately provoking a humanitarian crisis.
Poland's Human Rights Ombudsman has criticised the new law, saying it gives the interior minister the right to limit freedom of movement and to limit access to information about what is happening on the border indefinitely.

While the situation on the border has calmed since mid-November, when Polish security forces fired water cannon at migrants throwing rocks, there are still nightly attempts by groups to force their way through barbed wire fencing on the frontier.
The Polish Border Guard said there were 134 attempts to cross the Belarus border on Monday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Prosecutors have filed felony charges against a Rhode Island man who investigators allege used a wooden table leg to attack police guarding the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 riot, according to unsealed court papers.
In an 11-page statement of facts, an unnamed Federal Bureau of Investigation agent based in Boston said video footage taken during the riot showed Timothy Desjardins, 35, of Providence, ""assaulting multiple law enforcement officers"" in a U.S. Capitol tunnel using what ""appears to be a broken wooden table leg.""
At the time, the FBI said, police guarding the Capitol were being attacked by rioters who were surging into the tunnel and throwing objects including a baton and a table.
Prosecutors filed multiple riot-related felony charges against Desjardins, a federal official said. Charges include engaging in violence in a restricted building, civil disorder and assaulting police with a dangerous weapon.
The FBI said that Desjardins' alleged participation in the riot was corroborated when, the morning after the riot, Washington police recovered a backpack which investigators believe Desjardins was wearing during the riot.
The FBI said that inside the backpack was a Desjardins identification card, two walkie-talkies and three axes.

Prosecutors said Desjardins is presently held in custody in Rhode Island on unrelated criminal charges. The Providence Journal newspaper reported that Desjardins had allegedly engaged in an hours-long armed standoff with Providence police on Nov. 11 in a barbershop he owns. 
Nearly 700 people have been charged with participating in the Jan. 6 riot, and around 210 people have been charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding police officers or employees during the attack.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Virginia Giuffre, who is suing Britain's Prince Andrew for alleged sexual abuse, accused the Duke of York of shaming her before the media by leveling ""baseless, defamatory attacks"" against her.
Giuffre made the charge in a Monday night court filing opposing Andrew's motion to dismiss her civil lawsuit stemming from their ties to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein.
Lawyers for Andrew did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests for comment.
Giuffre, 38, sued Andrew for unspecified damages in August, saying he forced her to have sex at the London home of former Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and abused her at Epstein's homes in Manhattan and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Andrew, 61, Queen Elizabeth's second son, has ""unequivocally"" denied Giuffre's claims, and accused her of seeking ""another payday"" in her drive to profit from her association with Epstein, who she says also abused her.
But in her filing with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Giuffre called Andrew's motion a bid to ""blame and shame"" her, and said her respective 2009 and 2020 settlements with Epstein and Epstein's estate did not shield the prince from her claims.
""Defendant's motion was intended to be, and was extensively used as, a press release to attack Ms. Giuffre in the media,"" lawyers for Giuffre wrote.
""Defendant dared to make his baseless, defamatory attacks on Ms. Giuffre in his motion only because doing so in a court filing insulated him from the libel lawsuit that would otherwise result,"" they added.
Giuffre also said Andrew cited no legal authority in arguing that a 2019 New York law creating a two-year window for her and others to sue over childhood sexual abuse from decades earlier deprived him of due process under that state's constitution.
Andrew's lawyers are scheduled to argue for a dismissal of Giuffre's lawsuit at a Jan. 4, 2022, hearing before U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan.
The judge has said a trial could begin in late 2022 unless the case is settled or dismissed. Andrew has not been charged with any crimes.

Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.
Ghislaine Maxwell has pleaded not guilty to U.S. criminal charges she helped Epstein recruit and abuse four underage girls. Her trial in Manhattan began on Monday, and may last six weeks.

GRANDE-SYNTHE, France (Reuters) - Police on Tuesday tore down a makeshift camp near the northern French port of Dunkirk where scores of migrants who say they are fleeing war, poverty and persecution in the Middle East were hunkered down with hopes of reaching Britain. 
Armed officers entered the camp, which runs along a disused railway line, before workers in protective suits pulled down tents and plastic shelters.
Charity workers say the 27 migrants who drowned in the Channel last Wednesday had stayed in the same area before they attempted the perilous sea crossing from France to Britain last Wednesday. Their dinghy deflated in the open sea.
The number of migrants crossing the Channel has surged to 25,776 in 2021, up from 8,461 in 2020 and 1,835 in 2019, according to tallies compiled by the BBC using Home Office data.
The spike in numbers has angered Britain, which accuses France of doing too little to stem the flow. Paris says that once migrants reach the shores of the channel, it is too late to prevent them crossing.
French police routinely tear up the camps that spring up between Calais and Dunkirk. Evictions at the Grande-Synthe site had been taking place on a weekly basis for the past few weeks, one charity worker said.
The migrants are typically transported to holding centres scattered across the country where they are encouraged to file for asylum, though many quickly make their way back to the Channel coast.
Hussein Hamid, 25, an Iranian Kurd, said it was the second time he had been evicted. On the first occasion, he was bussed to Lyon 760km to the south.
Hamid tried to leave the camp swiftly by foot, carrying a backpack, but said the police had blocked any way out. 
An Iraqi Kurd told Reuters by text message that he was hiding nearby while the police conducted their operation.

""I'll come back if the don't find me,"" he said, requesting anonymity to avoid police reprisals. 
President Emmanuel Macron on Friday told Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson to ""get serious"" in the effort to curb migrant flows, as post-Brexit relations between their governments deteriorate.

(Reuters) - NASA has indefinitely postponed a spacewalk planned for Tuesday by two astronauts outside the International Space Station, citing a ""debris notification"" for the orbiting research laboratory.
Astronauts Thomas Marshburn and Kayla had been due to venture outside the space station to replace a failed antenna, facing what NASA officials had said was a slightly elevated risk posed by debris left over from a Russian anti-satellite missile test weeks ago. It was not immediately clear whether the debris NASA referred to in its Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) announcement of the delayed spacewalk was related to the missile test.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary's parliament passed a resolution on Tuesday which will empower the government to hold a referendum on LGBT issues, raising Prime Minister Viktor Orban's anti-LGBT campaign to a new level as he heads into a tough election race next year. 
Orban, a nationalist who has been in power since 2010, this year proposed a referendum on ruling party legislation that limits schools' teaching about homosexuality and transgender issues, stepping up a culture war with the European Union.
Facing his first competitive election in more than a decade, nationalist Orban has sought to promote social policies that he says safeguard Christian values against Western liberalism, putting gender issues and what he calls LGBTQ propaganda at the centre of his campaign along with migration.
Parliament voted on four referendum questions one by one, passing them with Fidesz's ruling majority.
""The Hungarian government proposes that citizens should have a chance to express their stance on the issues of gender propaganda,"" deputy minister Balazs Orban told parliament.
""We are committed. We believe that we ...have to say no to LGBTQ propaganda in schools carried out with the help of NGOs and media, without parental consent."" 
He said holding the referendum on the same day as the parliamentary vote would save taxpayers money but it is up to President Janos Ader to set the date. Ader, an ally of the government, has not yet fixed a date for the parliamentary elections which are expected to be held in April.
In the referendum, Hungarians will be asked whether they support the holding of sexual orientation workshops in schools without parents' consent and whether they believe gender reassignment procedures should be promoted among children.

They will also be asked whether media content that could affect sexual orientation should be shown to children without any restrictions.
The law passed in June, which the government says aims to protect children, has caused anxiety in the LGBT community.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite accused of recruiting and grooming girls for deceased financier Jeffrey Epstein to abuse, got underway on Monday in New York federal court.
Here is an explanation of the charges Maxwell faces and her expected defense: 
THE MANN ACT CHARGES
Prosecutors say Maxwell between 1994 and 1997 persuaded an underaged girl to travel from Florida to New York with the intention of having her engage in sexual activity with Epstein. In 1996, prosecutors say Maxwell gave an unsolicited massage to another minor girl who flew to Epstein's New Mexico ranch from out-of-state while the girl was topless.
Maxwell is charged with two counts of violating the Mann Act, which bars transporting individuals across state lines for illegal sexual activity.
Maxwell also two faces charges of conspiring to violate those two sections of the Mann Act.
THE SEX TRAFFICKING CHARGES
Prosecutors also say that Maxwell, beginning in 2001, recruited one of the four alleged victims to engage in sex acts with Epstein and provided her with hundreds of dollars in cash after massaging Epstein, knowing she was a minor. Maxwell sent gifts including lingerie from a New York address to the girl's home in Florida, according to a 2021 indictment.
Those allegations form the basis of charges of one charge of sex trafficking of a minor and one charge of sex trafficking conspiracy. Federal law bars recruiting or transporting anyone under 18 to participate in a ""commercial sex act."" The trafficking charge does not require the child to be transported across state lines.
MAXWELL'S DEFENSE
Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. Her lawyers have argued that prosecutors are treating her as a scapegoat for Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges. 
Her attorneys say that the alleged sex trafficking victim did not mention Maxwell while cooperating with a 2007 investigation by Florida federal prosecutors into Epstein. They have argued that all four women named in the indictment have financial incentives to lie or exaggerate about Maxwell's involvement in the alleged abuse.
THE PERJURY CHARGES
Maxwell faces two charges of perjury that will be tried at a later date.
Prosecutors have accused Maxwell of lying under oath in 2016 during a deposition for a civil lawsuit brought against her by Virginia Giuffre, who says she was abused by Epstein while a minor. Giuffre alleged Maxwell had defamed her by saying Giuffre lied about the abuse. 

In the 2016 deposition, Maxwell said she did not recall the presence of sex toys in Epstein's Palm Beach house and replied ""I don't know what you're talking about"" when asked if Epstein had a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual massages. 
Prosecutors characterized these statements as ""false material declarations"" in violation of a federal statute making it a crime to lie under oath. Her lawyers said in a February 2021 court filing that the questions posed were ambiguous and that Maxwell gave truthful responses.

At least 14 people on flights from Johannesburg and Capetown arrived at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport on Nov. 26 carrying the new variant, the National Institute for Public Health (RIVM) said. 
""We have found the Omicron coronavirus variant in two test samples that were taken on Nov. 19 and Nov. 23,"" the RIVM said. ""It is not clear yet whether these people have visited Southern Africa.""
The discovery of Omicron has sparked worries around the world that it could resist vaccinations and prolong the nearly two-year-old COVID-19 pandemic. 
Some 61 out of the more than 600 passengers on the South Africa flights tested positive for COVID-19 and went into quarantine after arriving last Friday.

Dutch authorities are also seeking to contact and test some 5,000 other passengers who have travelled from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia or Zimbabwe.
In the Netherlands, tougher COVID-19 measures went into effect on Sunday to curb record daily infection rates of more than 20,000 and ease pressure on hospitals.

Official researcher Dr. Patrick Mavingui said the person was a 53-year old man who had travelled to Mozambique and made a stop-over in South Africa. 
The patient, who returned to La Reunion some two weeks ago, is in isolation, Mavingui told local French media.
French government spokesman Gabriel Attal Attal confirmed the case. ""Six of his contacts have been put in isolation, three coming from his family circle and three from his professional circle,"" he told Europe 1 radio.
Omicron, first reported in southern Africa and which the World Health Organization (WHO) said risks infection surges, has triggered global alarm, with border closures casting a shadow over a nascent economic recovery.
Attal said results concerning eight possible cases of the variant across France were expected in coming hours.

Health ministry data showed on Monday that France had registered its biggest jump in coronavirus-related hospital admissions since the spring.
The number in intensive care units (ICUs) with COVID-19 jumped by 117 to 1,749 people, the biggest rise since March-April.

MANILA (Reuters) -Philippines leader Rodrigo Duterte's preferred successor, Senator Christopher ""Bong"" Go, announced on Tuesday he was dropping out of the presidential race, leaving the administration without a candidate in next year's polls. 
Go, Duterte's long-time aide, had recently hinted he may pull out of the presidential contest and said the president respected his decision.
His withdrawal raises questions over who the popular Duterte will now support in the May 2022 election. The 76-year old leader is not eligible to seek re-election, but will be standing for a senator's seat.
""I and President Duterte are ready to support whoever will truly serve and can continue and protect Duterte's legacy towards a more comfortable and safe and prosperous life for our children,"" Go said in a speech streamed on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Analysts have said Duterte wants to ensure an ally succeeds him so he can be insulated from potential legal action at home or by the International Criminal Court, which has launched a probe into the https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/international-court-approves-investigation-into-philippines-war-drugs-2021-09-15 thousands of killings in his ""war on drugs"".

Political observers say Go's withdrawal from the race would likely benefit the Marcos/Duterte-Carpio ticket as it would consolidate the Dutertes' voter base behind the 43-year-old mayor and that support could extend to Marcos. 

""There is no more confusion in terms of administration support,"" said Aries Arugay, visiting fellow at the ISEAS Yusof-Ishak Institute and political science professor at the University of the Philippines. 
Marcos is up against other presidential aspirants, including former boxing champion Manny Pacquiao, vice president Leni Robredo, Manila mayor Francisco Domagoso, and senator Panfilo Lacson.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The World Bank is finalizing a proposal to deliver up to $500 million from a frozen Afghanistan aid fund to humanitarian agencies, people familiar with the plans told Reuters, but it leaves out tens of thousands of public sector workers and remains complicated by U.S. sanctions.
Board members will meet informally on Tuesday to discuss the proposal, hammered out in recent weeks with U.S. and U.N. officials, to redirect the funds from the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF), which has a total of $1.5 billion.
Afghanistan's 39 million people face a cratering economy, a winter of food shortages and growing poverty three months after the Taliban seized power as the last U.S. troops withdrew from 20 years of war.
Afghan experts said the aid will help, but big gaps remain, including how to get the funds into Afghanistan without exposing the financial institutions involved to U.S. sanctions, and the lack of focus on state workers, the sources said. 
The money will go mainly to addressing urgent health care needs in Afghanistan, where less than 7% of the population has been vaccinated against the coronavirus, they said.
For now, it will not cover salaries for teachers and other government workers, a policy that the experts say could hasten the collapse of Afghanistan's public education, healthcare and social services systems. They warn that hundreds of thousands of workers, who have been unpaid for months, could stop showing up for their jobs and join a massive exodus from the country.
The World Bank will have no oversight of the funds once transferred into Afghanistan, said one of the sources familiar with the plans. A U.S. official stressed that UNICEF and other recipient agencies would have ""their own controls and policies in place.""
""The proposal calls for the World Bank to transfer the money to the U.N. and other humanitarian agencies, without any oversight or reporting, but it says nothing about the financial sector, or how the money will get into the country,"" the source said, calling U.S. sanctions a major constraint.
'NOT A SILVER BULLET'
While the U.S. Treasury has provided ""comfort letters"" assuring banks that they can process humanitarian transactions, concern about sanctions continues to prevent passage of even basic supplies, including food and medicine, the source added.
""It's a scorched earth approach. We're driving the country into the dust,"" said the source. Crippling sanctions and failure to take care of public sector workers will ""create more refugees, more desperation and more extremism.""
Any decision to redirect ARTF money requires the approval of all its donors, of which the United States has been the largest.
A State Department spokesperson confirmed that Washington is working with the World Bank and other donors on how to use the funds, including potentially paying those who work in ""critical positions such as healthcare workers and teachers.""
The spokesperson said the U.S. government remains committed to meeting the  critical needs of the  Afghan people, ""especially across health, nutrition, education, and food security sectors ... but international aid is not a silver bullet.""
BYPASSING TALIBAN
Established in 2002 and administered by the World Bank, the ARTF was the largest financing source for Afghanistan's civilian budget, which was more than 70% funded by foreign aid. 
    The World Bank suspended disbursements after the Taliban takeover. At the same time, Washington stopping supplying U.S. dollars to the country and joined in freezing some $9 billion in Afghan central bank assets and halting financial assistance.
    A World Bank spokesperson confirmed that staff and executive board members are exploring redirecting ARTF funds to U.N. agencies ""to support humanitarian efforts,"" but gave no further details. The United Nations declined to comment.
Initial work has also been done on a potential swap of U.S. dollars for Afghanis to deliver the funds into the country, but those plans are ""basically just a few PowerPoint slides at this point,"" one of the sources said. That approach would deposit ARTF funds in the international accounts of Afghan private institutions, who would disburse Afghanis from their Afghan bank accounts to humanitarian groups in Afghanistan, two sources said.
    This would bypass the Taliban, thereby avoiding entanglement with the U.S. and U.N. sanctions, but the plan is complex and untested, and could take time to implement.

    One major problem is the lack of a mechanism to monitor disbursements of funds in Afghanistan to ensure Taliban leaders and fighters do not access them, a third source said.
Two former U.S. officials familiar with internal administration deliberations said that some U.S. officials contend that U.S. and U.N. sanctions on Taliban leaders bar financial aid to anyone affiliated with their government.

SAN JOSE, Calif. (Reuters) -Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes testified on Monday she was abused by her former romantic partner and Theranos executive Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani and that the relationship had a pervasive impact on her life during the time when she is accused of committing fraud.
During her fourth day on the stand, Holmes, 37, occasionally choked up as she spoke about her decade-long relationship with Balwani, Theranos' chief operating officer, whom she met when she was 18 and he was 38.
Throughout the relationship, Holmes said, Balwani forced her to have sex when she did not want to, and was verbally abusive.
Balwani has ""categorically"" denied the allegations in court filings, calling them ""false and inflammatory."" An attorney for Balwani did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Monday. 
Both Holmes and Balwani have pleaded not guilty to criminal charges for allegedly lying about the now-defunct startup's technology that supposedly could run diagnostic tests more quickly and accurately than traditional lab testing.
Prosecutors say Holmes turned to fraud after pharmaceutical companies lost interest in the Theranos technology. Her attorneys portray Holmes as a young, hardworking entrepreneur whose company failed, and, they suggested on Monday, who relied on Balwani to her detriment.
Holmes had previously testified that she left Stanford University at 19 to focus on building Theranos. On Monday, she explained that she left in part because she had been raped while at Stanford.
At that point, she decided to focus on building her company, and at the same time grew closer with Balwani, who she looked up to as a successful businessman who had worked with Bill Gates.
""He said that I was safe, now that I had met him,"" she said.
But, at the home they shared and in texts, Balwani told her she would never succeed if she did not ""kill the old Elizabeth"" by following an intense regime including waking at 4 a.m., eating certain foods and remaining laser-focused on her goals, she said.
Once valued at $9 billion, Theranos vaulted Holmes to Silicon Valley stardom. Theranos collapsed after the Wall Street Journal published a series of articles starting in 2015 that suggested its devices were flawed and inaccurate. She was indicted in 2018.
Holmes testified last week that Balwani prepared financial projections that were shared with investors. On Monday, Holmes spoke for around an hour about their personal relationship.
Holmes said she is not claiming that Balwani controlled her statements to investors, journalists or business partners. But she said she didn't question him as she should have, because he had taught her ""everything I thought I knew about business.""
""He impacted everything about who I was. And I don't fully understand that,"" she said.
A healthcare regulator's negative report in 2016 shook her positive view of Theranos, and prompted her to make changes that Balwani did not like, Holmes testified. They broke up that year, she said.
Since the trial began in September, jurors in San Jose have heard evidence that prosecutors say proves Holmes defrauded investors between 2010 and 2015 and deceived patients once Theranos began making its tests commercially available, including through a partnership with Walgreens.
At the end of her direct testimony, Holmes' lawyer, Kevin Downey, asked why she never sold any of her 50% stake in Theranos, which was worth $4.5 billion, despite opportunities to do so.

""I believed in the company and I wanted to put everything I had into it,"" she said.
Holmes is scheduled to face cross-examination by a prosecutor on Tuesday morning when the trial resumes.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Ghislaine Maxwell's criminal trial got under way on Monday, with a prosecutor saying the British socialite lured underage girls for the late financier Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse, while a defense lawyer urged jurors not to turn Maxwell into a scapegoat.
""She preyed on vulnerable young girls, manipulated them, and served them up to be sexually abused,"" Assistant District Attorney Lara Pomerantz said in her opening statement.
Maxwell, 59, is on trial for recruiting and grooming four underage girls for Epstein to abuse between 1994 and 2004. Epstein died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-abuse charges. 
She has pleaded not guilty to eight charges of sex trafficking and other crimes, including two counts of perjury that will be tried at a later date.
Maxwell faces up to 80 years in prison if convicted. 
""The charges against Ghislaine Maxwell are for things that Jeffrey Epstein did, but she is not Jeffrey Epstein,"" Maxwell's lawyer, Bobbi Sternheim, said in Manhattan federal court.
The trial comes in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which has encouraged victims of sexual abuse to speak out against powerful men such as movie producer Harvey Weinstein and R&B singer R. Kelly accused of misconduct. Maxwell's case stands out in part because she is a woman.
Prosecutors say that Maxwell, a former employee and romantic partner of Epstein's, sent gifts such as lingerie and discussed sexual topics with the girls to win their trust before encouraging them to give Epstein erotic massages. She was sometimes present and at times participated, they say.
Pomerantz began by describing how Maxwell and Epstein met a 14-year old girl named Jane - a pseudonym - at an arts summer camp in 1994. Epstein introduced himself as a donor interested in giving scholarships to talented youth and asked for Jane's phone number, Pomerantz said.
""Within that first year, when Jane was just 14 years old, Epstein started sexually abusing Jane. He did not abuse her alone,"" she said. ""Jane was not their only victim. There were other young girls."" 
Maxwell sat in the well of the courtroom, a white mask covering her face amid the COVID-19 pandemic. She wore a cream-colored sweater and black pants.
The government's first witness, Lawrence Paul Visoski Jr, a pilot for Epstein, testified that Maxwell sometimes notified him about Epstein's upcoming travel plans. Visoski described Maxwell as ""one of the assistants in the office for Mr. Epstein.""
Four accusers are expected to testify against Maxwell at the trial, which is expected to last until at least early January. Prosecutors said other witnesses will include family members of the accusers and former Epstein employees. 
Sternheim said prosecutors, unable to convict Epstein, are using the daughter of late British media magnate Robert Maxwell as a scapegoat https://www.reuters.com/world/maxwell-challenge-accusers-seek-distance-epstein-sex-abuse-trial-2021-11-23. She said the government was asking jurors to ascribe a ""sinister"" motive to legal activities such as taking teenagers shopping. 
She told jurors that the memories of Maxwell's accusers had been ""manipulated"" by lawyers who encouraged them to sue Maxwell and Epstein for damages.
A compensation fund set up after Epstein's death has been paying claims of accusers from the financier's estate. Sternheim said Maxwell's accusers received payouts and that their claims were ""enhanced"" by cooperating with the government.

""This case is about memory, manipulation and money,"" Sternheim said. ""Memories fade over time, and in this case you will learn that not only have memories faded, but they have been contaminated by outside information."" 
After testimony concluded for the day, Maxwell embraced her defense lawyers.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) -Honduran presidential candidate Xiomara Castro looked set to put the left back in power 12 years after her husband was ousted in a coup, even as the vote count for Sunday's election unexpectedly paused for hours on Monday. 
Castro https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/sundays-election-xiomara-castro-could-end-two-party-rule-honduras-2021-11-25, who would be the Central American nation's first woman president, has promised big changes in Honduras including a constitutional overhaul, United Nations support in the fight against corruption, and looser restrictions on abortion.
She has also floated the idea of dropping diplomatic support for Taiwan in favor of China, a policy proposal keenly watched in Washington, Beijing and Taipei.
With just over half the ballots counted, Castro, the wife of former President Manuel Zelaya, held a nearly 20-point lead over conservative Nasry Asfura, the mayor of capital Tegucigalpa and candidate of the ruling National Party, who won 34% according to a preliminary tally. However, the tally had not been updated for over 10 hours by Monday afternoon.
Former Costa Rican President Luis Guillermo Solis, chief of the Organization of American States' observer mission in the country, said he saw nothing untoward in the delay and expected the electoral council would clear up matters soon.
""If there isn't an explanation, the people get a little nervous,"" he told Reuters, noting he was ""pleasantly surprised"" with the record turnout and lack of political violence.
Celebrations broke out at Castro's campaign headquarters on Sunday night as her vote lead held, with supporters dancing, waving flags and chanting ""JOH out!"" in reference to two-term President Juan Orlando Hernandez of the National Party.
Hernandez is deeply unpopular and has been implicated in a drug trafficking case in a U.S. federal court. He denies wrongdoing, but could face an indictment when he leaves office. 
""We have turned back authoritarianism,"" Castro told supporters late on Sunday, surrounded by her Libre party faithful, aides and family, including her husband Zelaya, who was ousted when business and military elites allied against him, ushering in a dozen years of right-wing National Party rule.
Zelaya was also implicated by a witness in a U.S. court of having taken a drug bribe. He denied the accusation.
A self-proclaimed democratic socialist in a country where the left has rarely been popular and few women hold public office, Castro has won support of Hondurans tired of corruption and the concentration of power since 2009.
""Everyone just couldn't stand this government, too many years, too much corruption,"" said Franklin Membreño, 42, owner of a small clothing shop in Tegucigalpa. ""I think the only people supporting the National party were public employees.""
'PEACE AND JUSTICE'
Results of the presidential election initially rolled in quickly, a contrast to four years ago when a close outcome and delays with the count led to a contested result and deadly protests after widespread allegations of cheating.
But results for Congress, previously under tight control of the National Party, have not yet been released. A poor showing in Congress could complicate life for a Castro administration.
If Castro delivers on campaign pledges, she could begin to reverse a weakening of the Honduran justice system that has benefited corrupt and criminal groups, a trend seen across Central America in recent years. 
Her manifesto states that she will enlist help from the United Nations to build an agency to tackle corruption, while also creating more independence for prosecutors. 
Corporate leaders like Juan Carlos Sikaffy, head of top business lobby COHEP, quickly offered congratulations, calling Castro ""president-elect"" in a post on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR); Castro has promised to work ""hand in hand"" with the private sector.
Carlos Garcia, a 43-year-old Tegucigalpa shop worker, said on Monday he believed Castro's apparently wide victory margin was keeping a lid on post-election violence.
""Her victory was overwhelming, so they couldn't commit fraud,"" he said, referring to the ruling conservatives.
Kayla Patricia Sanchez, a 30-year-old street food vendor, was relieved there had not been a repeat of the ugly aftermath of the disputed 2017 vote.
""Thank God there wasn't a big mess so I could come out and work today,"" she said, flipping corn tortillas on a small grill.
Critics have painted Castro as a dangerous radical, recalling Zelaya's closeness to late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.
A planned referendum by Zelaya on constitutional reform including allowing a president to be re-elected for a second term was a catalyst for the coup against him, with elites uncomfortable with his alliance with Chavez. 
Despite such resistance to re-election, a top court packed with President Hernandez's allies later changed the constitution to allow him a second term.
On Monday, Castro thanked Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Twitter for a message congratulating her. 
The vote took place against a backdrop of poverty exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, adding to anger fueled by scandals - all of which helped spur a record exodus of U.S.-bound migrants.
Castro, who sought the presidency twice earlier, including a short run in 2017 before she stood down to back another candidate, seized on the unpopularity of outgoing Hernandez.

The National Party's candidate, Asfura, kept his distance from the president during the election campaign. 
Asfura urged voters to show patience in a social media post, but stopped short of conceding.

(Reuters) -On a frigid Chicago night in January 2019, actor Jussie Smollett, a star on the TV drama ""Empire,"" reported that he was the victim of a hate-motivated street attack, but police later accused him of staging the whole affair as a publicity stunt.
The case went to trial on Monday in Cook County Circuit Court, with a jury selected by late afternoon to hear evidence for six felony counts of disorderly conduct accusing Smollett of making false reports to the police. 
Smollett, 39, has denied that he faked the attack, pleading not guilty https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-jussie-smollett-idINKCN20I19I in February 2020.
The openly gay Black actor told police he had been accosted on a darkened street by two masked strangers. According to Smollett's account, his assailants threw a noose around his neck and poured chemicals on him while yelling racist and homophobic slurs and expressions of support for then-President Donald Trump.
A month later, police arrested him, accusing Smollett of paying two brothers $3,500 to stage the attack in a hoax aimed at gaining public sympathy and raising his show-business profile.
Smollett's acting career has faded since the incident. He lost his role as a singer-songwriter in the final season of ""Empire,"" a Fox television hip-hop drama that ended a five-year run in 2020.
His case took an unexpected turn in the spring of 2019 when the Cook County state's attorney's office dropped a 16-count indictment against him in exchange for Smollett forfeiting his $10,000 bond without admitting wrongdoing.
The dismissal drew criticism from then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the city's police superintendent, who called the reversal a miscarriage of justice, leading a Cook County judge to appoint Dan Webb, a former U.S. attorney, to review the case.
After a five-month investigation, Webb overruled the state's attorney's office and concluded that prosecution of Smollett was warranted, questioning the judgment of prosecutors in dropping the original case.

The current case against Smollett has been slowed by legal challenges and the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Key trial testimony is expected from the brothers, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, who prosecutors have said were paid by Smollett to participate in a phony attack. Smollett is not required to testify in his own defense.

U.S.-based surveillance research firm IPVM, which has closely tracked the network's expansion and first identified the Henan document, said the tender was unique in specifying journalists as surveillance targets and providing a blueprint for public security authorities to quickly locate them and obstruct their work. 
""While the PRC has a documented history of detaining and punishing journalists for doing their jobs, this document illustrates the first known instance of the PRC building custom security technology to streamline state suppression of journalists,"" said IPVM'S Head of Operations Donald Maye, using the initials of the People's Republic of China. 
Reuters was unable to find any documents identifying journalists or foreigners as specific targets of surveillance systems in other parts of China. 
The Henan provincial government and police did not respond to requests for comment. The Ministry of Public Security and China's Foreign Ministry also did not comment. 
""TAILED AND CONTROLLED""
The near-200 page tender document from the Henan Public Security Department does not give reasons why it wants to track journalists or international students. Another category of people it said it wants to track were ""women from neighbouring countries that are illegal residents.""
Public access to the tender document was disabled on Monday.
The tender document specified cameras must be able to build a relatively accurate file for individuals whose faces are partially covered by a mask or glasses, and those targeted must be searchable on the database by simply uploading a picture or searching their facial attributes. 
The system will be operated by at least 2,000 officials and policemen, and specifies that journalists will be divided into three categories: red, yellow, green, in decreasing order of risk, according to the tender.
Different police forces covering all of Henan, whose 99 million inhabitants makes it China's third-largest province by population, will be connected to the platform in order to spring into action in the event of a warning being set off, the tender explains.
Warnings will be set off if a journalist while in Henan registers into a hotel, buys a ticket, or crosses the provincial border, according to the tender. 
""Suspicious persons must be tailed and controlled, dynamic research analyses and risk assessments made, and the journalists dealt with according to their category,"" the tender reads.
The tender also detailed different early warning systems for the other groups.
MEDIA CONTROL
Some press freedom groups say the ruling Chinese Communist Party has tightened control over media since Chinese President Xi Jinping took office in 2012.
In February, the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China (FCCC) said China used coronavirus prevention measures https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-media-idUSKCN2AT182, intimidation and visa curbs to limit foreign reporting in 2020, citing responses to an annual survey of correspondents and interviews with bureau chiefs.
The Chinese foreign ministry at the time called the FCCC report ""baseless"" and said China always welcomed media and journalists from all countries to cover news in China according to the law. ""What we oppose is ideological bias against China and fake news in the name of press freedom,"" a spokesman said.
While most of the Henan document refers to journalists, several segments specify ""foreign journalists"". 
In October last year, the Henan government published on its procurement platform for prospective suppliers a short summary of the intended project in which it said the system would be ""centred on foreigners"" and help ""protect national sovereignty, security, and interests"".
The contract was put out for tender on July 29, days after foreign journalists from the BBC, LA Times, Agence France-Presse and others reporting on devastating floods in Henan were targeted by a nationalist campaign on China's heavily censored social media platform Weibo (NASDAQ:WB). 
The FCCC said at the time https://twitter.com/fccchina/status/1419946356995629057 it was ""very concerned to witness the online and offline harassment of journalists"" covering the floods. It described how, for instance, one Weibo account asked its 1.6 million followers to report the whereabouts of a foreign journalist who was reporting about the floods.
The tender also said the system should be able to track the movements of international students through methods such as mobile phone positioning and travel bookings - particularly during key dates such as the country's national day or annual session of parliament. 

""On...sensitive dates, launch a wartime early warning mechanism,"" it read.

VIENNA (Reuters) -EU, Iranian and Russian diplomats sounded upbeat as Iran and world powers held their first talks in five months on Monday to try to save their 2015 nuclear deal, despite Tehran taking a tough stance in public that Western powers said would not work.
Diplomats say time is running out to resurrect the pact, which then-U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018 in a move which infuriated Iran and dismayed the other powers involved - Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia.
European Union, Iranian and Russian delegates to the talks offered optimistic assessments after the new round began with a session of the remaining parties to the deal, without the United States - whom Iran refuses to meet face-to-face.
""I feel extremely positive about what I have seen today,"" Enrique Mora, the EU official chairing the talks, said after the meeting - the seventh round of talks aimed at reviving a deal under which Iran limited its disputed uranium enrichment program in return for relief from U.S., EU and U.N. economic sanctions.
Mora told reporters the new Iranian delegation had stuck to its demand that all sanctions be lifted. But he also suggested Tehran had not rejected outright the results of the previous six rounds of talks held between April and June.
""They have accepted that the work done over the first six rounds is a good basis to build our work ahead,"" he said. ""We will be of course incorporating the new political sensibilities of the new Iranian administration.""
Russia's envoy to the talks, Mikhail Ulyanov, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) they ""started quite successfully."" Asked he if was optimistic, Iran's top negotiator, Ali Bagheri Kani, told reporters: ""Yes, I am.""
However, it was not clear whether Iran had agreed to resume the talks where they had left off in June - as demanded by Western powers - or that the optimism was justified.
A European diplomat struck a pessimistic note, saying the Iranians stuck to their positions and at times toughened them, which was hardly encouraging. 
The diplomat said matters would become clearer when detailed talks on sanctions take place on Tuesday and on nuclear issues on Wednesday.
The meeting in Vienna ended a hiatus triggered by the election in June of Ebrahim Raisi, an anti-Western hardliner. The talks are effectively indirect negotiations between Tehran and Washington, with other officials shuttling between them.
Tehran's negotiating team has set out demands that U.S. and European diplomats consider unrealistic, Western diplomats say. 
Iran has adopted an uncompromising position by demanding the removal of all U.S. and European Union sanctions imposed since 2017, including those unrelated to its nuclear programme, in a verifiable process.
Bagheri Kani also said Washington and its Western allies should guarantee no new sanctions would be imposed in future. 
""All parties in the meeting accepted Iran’s demand that first the situation of illegal and unjust U.S. sanctions ... should be cleared and then (we) discuss other issues and decide on those issues,"" he told reporters. 
There was no immediate comment from the big powers on Bagheri Kani's remarks about the sequencing of topics.
During a telephone call, French President Emmanuel Macron urged Iran's Raisi ""to engage constructively"" to permit a quick return to the agreement and to keep Iran's commitments to the United Nations atomic watchdog, Macron's office said.
Iran's conflicts with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors its nuclear programme, have festered.

As Iran has advanced its uranium enrichment, the agency says its inspectors have been treated roughly and refused access to reinstall monitoring cameras at a site it deems essential to reviving the deal.
Since Trump took the United States out of the deal, Iran has breached many of its restrictions meant to lengthen the time it would need to generate enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/explainer-what-remains-of-the-iran-nucle-idUSKBN2ID0E4. Iran says it wants to enrich uranium only for civil uses.

(Reuters) -The United States has launched an auction for 32 million barrels of crude from four strategic petroleum reserves (SPR) sites to be delivered between late-December and April 2022, the Department of Energy (DOE) said.
The sale of SPR oil, which is mainly blended sour crude, is expected to depress the value of U.S. sour crude Mars and benefit buyers in Asia which processes mainly high-sulphur oil.
The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden announced on Tuesday it will release millions of barrels of oil from strategic reserves in coordination with China, India, South Korea, Japan and Britain, to try to cool prices after OPEC+ producers repeatedly ignored calls for more crude.
About 10 million barrels will be made available from Big Hill and Bryan Mound in Texas, about 7 million barrels from West Hackberry in Louisiana and another 5 million barrels from Bayou Choctaw in Louisiana, DOE said on its website.
Deliveries will take place January through April 2022, with early deliveries accepted in late December, it added.
Buyers will have to return the oil at later dates between 2022 and 2024, DOE said.
Companies are required to submit bids on Dec. 6 and contracts will be awarded no later than Dec. 14.
""Spread across four months, this equivalent to a steady 270,000 b/d stream of medium sour grades, direct competition to Mars,"" JBC Energy analyst Viktor Katona said, adding that the quality of crude to be released will have API gravity of 31 to 33 degrees.

""Overall, very good news for Asian buyers of Mars – already depressed at some -$3.50 per barrels vs WTI, Mars should weaken even further.""
DOE will also announce the sale for up to 18 million barrels of SPR crude no sooner than Dec. 17.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) -Leftist opposition candidate Xiomara Castro declared victory in Sunday's Honduran presidential election, with early results giving her a commanding lead and putting her on track to become the first female leader of the Central American country.
With 40% of votes counted, Castro, the wife of former President Manuel Zelaya, had 53.5%, while Nasry Asfura, candidate of the ruling National Party had 34%, preliminary results from the national electoral council showed.
Castro, 62, was competing in a field of more than a dozen candidates, and supporters hailed a triumph that would end a dozen years of conservative rule and return the left to power for the first time since Zelaya was deposed in a 2009 coup.
In a brief victory address, Castro vowed to form a government of ""reconciliation,"" and to strengthen direct democracy with referendums - a tool that Mexico's leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has repeatedly employed.
""There will be no more abuse of power in this country,"" said Castro, dressed in a red jacket and flanked by the 2017 presidential runner-up, popular TV host Salvador Nasralla, who joined her slate as a candidate for vice president.
Results appeared to be heading to a far clearer result than in the previous election, when irregularities in the vote count sparked deadly protests and led to incumbent President Juan Orlando Hernandez controversially securing a second term.
After polls closed, National Party officials quickly claimed victory after what the electoral council described as an historic turnout. Still, Asfura himself earlier pledged to honor voters' verdict when casting his ballot.
Castro, the opinion polls leader since tying up with Nasralla in October, sought to unify opposition to Hernandez, who has denied accusations of having ties to powerful gangs, despite an open investigation in the United States linking him to alleged drug trafficking.
""We can't stay home. This is our moment. This is the moment to kick out the dictatorship,"" Castro said just after voting in the town of Catacamas, mobbed by reporters.
She urged voters to report any problems they saw and said international observers https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/honduras-parties-flag-fears-fraud-ahead-pivotal-vote-2021-11-27 would help to ensure a fair vote. 
Asfura, a wealthy businessman https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/honduran-ruling-party-hopeful-asfura-faces-uphill-climb-2021-11-26 and two-term mayor of the capital, had tried in the campaign to distance himself from Hernandez and the controversies engulfing him.
FLASHPOINT
The election is the latest political flashpoint in Central America, a major source of U.S.-bound migrants fleeing chronic unemployment and gang violence. Honduras is among the world's most violent countries, although homicide rates have eased.
Central America is also key transit point for drug trafficking, and where concerns have also grown over increasingly authoritarian governments.
The vote prompted diplomatic jostling between Beijing and Washington after Castro said she would open diplomatic relations with China, de-emphasizing ties with U.S.-backed Taiwan.
Some voters consulted by Reuters expressed dissatisfaction with their choices. But many others had clear favorites.
""I'm against all the corruption, poverty and drug-trafficking,"" said Jose Gonzalez, 27, a mechanic who said he was voting for Castro.
'THIS IS HONDURAS'
Hernandez's disputed 2017 re-election, and its ugly aftermath, loomed large. Widespread reports of irregularities provoked protests claiming the lives of over two dozen people, but he rode out the fraud claims and calls for a re-vote. 
Alexa Sanchez, a 22-year-old medical student, lounged on a bench just after voting while listening to music on her headphones and said she reluctantly voted for Castro. 
""Honestly, it's not like there were such good options,"" she said, adding she was highly skeptical of clean vote.
""I don't think so,"" she said. ""This is Honduras.""
National and international election observers monitored voting, including the European Union's 68-member mission.
Zeljana Zovko, the chief EU observer, told reporters around midday that her team mostly saw calm voting with high turnout, although most polling stations they visited opened late.
""The campaign has been very hard,"" said Julieta Castellanos, a sociologist and former dean of Honduras' National Autonomous University, noting that Castro has ""generated big expectations.""
Castellanos said post-election violence is possible if the race ended up close, if a large number of complaints were lodged and gave rise to suspicions of wide-scale fraud.
Alongside the presidency, voters are also deciding the composition of the country's 128-member Congress, plus officials for some 300 local governments. 
In Tegucigalpa's working-class Kennedy neighborhood, 56-year-old accountant Jose, who declined to give his surname, said he would stick with the ruling party.

""I have hope Tito Asfura can change everything,"" he said, using the mayor's nickname.
""Look, here the corruption is in all the governments.""

(Reuters) - Americans flocked to parades, packed football stadiums and gathered more freely for family feasts on Thursday, grateful to celebrate Thanksgiving Day traditions again after the pandemic kept many at home last year.
The holiday dates to the early 17th century, when Pilgrims from Europe and Native Americans gathered to share the autumn bounty - a celebration of goodwill before the genocide that was to come. Nowadays, the approach of the long holiday weekend typically ignites a frenzy of travel as scattered families come together for holiday meals. 
With COVID-19 deaths and infections soaring last year, many people shared turkey dinners over Zoom. Now that vaccines have made the pandemic more manageable, an estimated 53.4 million people were expected to travel for Thanksgiving, up 13% from 2020, according to the American Automobile Association.
Air traffic rebounded strongly, with U.S. officers screening 2.31 million people at travel checkpoints on Wednesday, representing 88% of the volume screened on the same day in 2019. It was the highest checkpoint volume since the pandemic low of 87,534 set on April 13, 2020, Transportation Security Administration spokesperson Lisa Farbstein wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
President Joe Biden declared the country was ""back,"" phoning into NBC television's coverage of the 95th Macy's (NYSE:M) Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City.
""My message is after two years, you're back. America's back,"" Biden said before visiting a Coast Guard station in Nantucket, Massachusetts, to thank members of the military stationed around the world. ""There's nothing we're unable to overcome."" 
Nonetheless, COVID-19 is still infecting 95,000 people a day. More than 780,000 people have died of COVID-19 in the United States, according to a Reuters count of official data. But deaths are now measured in the hundreds per day instead of the thousands.
Midnight after Thanksgiving also marks the unofficial start of the Christmas shopping season, offering a snapshot of the state of the American economy.
Retailers started promoting online holiday ""deals"" as early as September this year because the ongoing supply chain logjam threatened to delay imported merchandise. But bargains are modest, according to Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Digital Economy Index.
An occasion to count one's blessings, typically over a turkey dinner with mounds of side dishes and desserts, Thanksgiving also prompts an outpouring of donations to the poor and hungry.
Like many organizations, the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank offered an annual free food drive this year, allowing anyone in need to pick up a free meal kit ahead of the holiday.
Victoria Lasavath, the food bank marketing manager, said the pandemic exacerbated food insecurity in Los Angeles County. The organization and its partners now serve 900,000 people a month, triple the number from before COVID-19, she said.
Thanksgiving ""can typically be a very joyous time of the year for us all. However, for our food-insecure neighbors it may bring about a different type of uncertainty,"" Lasavath said.
With hospital intensive-care units no longer overflowing, restrictions on social gatherings have eased. Fans packed Ford Field stadium in Detroit for the first of three National Football League games on Thursday, restoring a spectacle that is part of the Thanksgiving tradition. Last year there were no fans in the stands.
Likewise, spectators returned to New York's Thanksgiving Day Parade after last year's pageant was scaled down and closed to the public.

The parade featured giant, helium balloons depicting characters such as Grogu, otherwise known as Baby Yoda from the Star Wars spinoff series ""The Mandalorian,"" and Ada, the young scientist from the Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) series ""Ada Twist, Scientist.""

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) -Cambodian former prime minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the current king's half-brother, who spent his later years in the political shadow of his one-time rival Prime Minister Hun Sen, has died in France. He was 77.
The prince, whose royalist political party won elections in 1993, was ousted in a 1997 coup by coalition partner Hun Sen, who remains Cambodia's authoritarian leader.
Hun Sen said in a statement on Sunday that he and his wife were ""heartbroken"" at the news, calling Ranariddh ""a dignitary, (a) member of the royal family who was patriotic to the nation, religion, the king"".
Ranariddh was the most political member of Cambodia's royal family in recent decades, leading his Funcinpec party in elections for years after he was ousted. 
But in 2017, he dismayed https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cambodia-politics-prince-idUSKBN1CK020 Cambodia's weakened opposition by backing the dissolution of another party whose leader was jailed on treason charges. Hun Sen has since effectively sidelined all opposition and now presides over a one-party parliament.
Explaining his position, Ranariddh told Reuters that year: ""... Hun Sen, you want or you don't want, you like him or you don't like him, he brings about this national unity.""
His younger half-brother, King Norodom Sihamoni, has occupied the Cambodian throne since the abdication of their father, King Norodom Sihanouk https://www.reuters.com/article/oukwd-uk-cambodia-sihanouk-idAFBRE89D0K120121015, in 2004. Sihanouk died aged 89 in 2012 in Beijing.
Lao Mong Hay, a veteran Cambodian analyst, said Ranariddh had lacked the political savvy of his father.
""He was soon outwitted and overthrown by his far more talented rival,"" Lao Mong Hay said, citing a Cambodian proverb that 10 learned persons are less than one talented person. ""So Norodom Ranariddh happened to be one of those 10.""
Ranariddh's career reflected the way Hun Sen has neutralized rivals since defecting from the Khmer Rouge ""killing fields"" regime in the late 1970s to help drive it from power.
Hun Sen led the Vietnam-backed Communist government in Phnom Penh for more than a decade while the Khmer Rouge waged a guerrilla insurgency.
The royal family lived in exile during this time, headed by former absolute ruler Sihanouk, who had led Cambodia to independence from France and abdicated a first time to enter democratic politics and become prime minister before the Khmer Rouge takeover in 1975.
Ranariddh was working as a French law lecturer when his father called him to contest the 1993 elections organised by the United Nations as part of a peace process.
With royalist sentiment strong, Ranariddh won the elections. But when Hun Sen threatened a return to war, a political deal resulted in a coalition government making Ranariddh ""first prime minister"", Hun Sen ""second prime minister"" and returning King Sihanouk to the throne as constitutional monarch.

The uneasy coalition lasted four years before Ranariddh was overthrown by forces loyal to Hun Sen and driven into exile.
After international pressure, Ranariddh was allowed to return and contest elections a year later, but he never again came close to winning and entered into on-and-off alliances with Hun Sen.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Talks on reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal are to resume in Vienna on Monday, with Iran's atomic advances raising doubt https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/low-expectations-nuclear-talks-iran-creates-facts-grounds-2021-11-28 as to whether a breakthrough can be made to bring Tehran and the United States back into full compliance with the accord.
Since the United States under then-President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018, Iran has breached many of its deal's restrictions designed to lengthen the time it would need to generate enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb to at least a year from 2-3 months - the so-called ""breakout time"".
Iran says it only wants to enrich uranium for civil uses. But many suspect it is at least seeking to gain leverage in the indirect talks with the United States by getting closer to being able to produce a nuclear weapon.
How close is Iran to being able to do so, and what remains of the deal's restrictions?
BREAKOUT TIME
Experts generally put breakout time at around three to six weeks but say weaponisation would take longer - often roughly two years. Israel's finance minister recently said https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-minister-says-iran-could-have-nuclear-arms-within-5-years-2021-11-23 Iran could have nuclear weapons within five years.
ENRICHMENT
The deal restricts the purity to which Iran can enrich uranium to 3.67%, far below the roughly 90% that is weapons-grade or the 20% Iran reached before the deal. Iran is now enriching to various levels, the highest being around 60%.
The deal also says Iran can only produce, or accumulate, enriched uranium with just over 5,000 of its least efficient, first-generation centrifuges at one facility: the underground Fuel Enrichment Plant (FEP) at Natanz.
The deal lets Iran enrich for research, without accumulating enriched uranium, with small numbers of advanced centrifuges, which are often at least twice as efficient as the IR-1.
Iran is now refining uranium with hundreds of advanced centrifuges both at the FEP and the above-ground Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant (PFEP) at Natanz. 
It is also enriching with more than 1,000 IR-1s at Fordow, a plant buried inside a mountain, and plans to do the same with more than 100 advanced centrifuges already installed there.
URANIUM STOCKPILE
The International Atomic Energy Agency, policing Iranian nuclear activities, estimated this month https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/21/11/gov2021-51.pdf that Tehran's stock of enriched uranium is just under 2.5 tonnes, more than 12 times the 202.8-kg (446-pound) limit imposed by the deal, but less than the more than five tonnes it had before the deal.
That said, it is now enriching to a higher level and has around 17.7 kg of uranium enriched to up to 60%. It takes around 25 kg of weapons-grade uranium to make one nuclear bomb.
INSPECTIONS AND MONITORING
The deal made Iran implement the IAEA's so-called Additional Protocol, which allows for snap inspections of undeclared sites. It also expanded IAEA monitoring by cameras and other devices beyond the core activities and inspections covered by Iran's long-standing Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA.
Iran has stopped implementing the Additional Protocol and is allowing the extra monitoring to continue only in a black-box-type arrangement https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-iaea-deal-idUSKBN2AN1UU, whereby the data from cameras and other devices is collected and stored but the IAEA does not have access to it, at least for the time being.
The one exception https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iaea-chief-says-negotiations-iran-proved-inconclusive-2021-11-24 to the continued monitoring is a centrifuge-parts workshop at the TESA Karaj complex, which was hit by apparent sabotage in June that destroyed one of four IAEA cameras there, after which Iran removed all of them. Iran has not let the IAEA re-install the cameras since.
POTENTIAL WEAPONISATION

Iran has produced uranium metal, both enriched to 20% and not enriched. This alarms Western powers because making uranium metal is a pivotal step towards producing bombs and no country has done it without eventually developing nuclear weapons. 
Iran says it is working on reactor fuel.

VILNIUS (Reuters) -Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said on Sunday that the NATO military alliance needed to adjust its stance towards Belarus, whose military, he said, was becoming more integrated with Russian armed forces.
Nauseda told a news conference with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Vilnius that he was worried by the ""total military integration"" of Belarus into Russian military structures.
""This brings new challenges to NATO, and NATO should accordingly adapt its plans, strategy and tactic, to be ready to respond,"" he said.
Nauseda also said Belarus would keep testing the unity of the west after thousands of migrants arrived on the European Union's eastern frontiers. Humanitarian agencies say at least 13 migrants have died at the Polish border after crossing from Belarus.
The EU says the crisis was engineered by Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko and is part of a ""hybrid war"" Minsk is waging in retaliation for EU sanctions imposed in response to Lukashenko's crushing of protests against his disputed re-election last year.
""We can have no doubts that Lukashenko's regime and the powers that support it will continue to test the western world's unity and their ability to react and repel the hybrid attacks,"" Nauseda said.
Von der Leyen said Lithuania had been responding in a ""humane and firm way"" to the crisis and the European Union continued to support it, with 200 million euros ($226.3 million)in EU funds to be given to Latvia, Lithuania and Poland for border control this year and next.
Stoltenberg said the leaders had also discussed Russia's ""unexplained and unjustified"" military build-up near Ukraine.
""We call on Russia to be transparent, to reduce tensions and to de-escalate. NATO remains vigilant. We stand ready to defend all allies,"" he said.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's minister for overseas territories will hold crisis talks on its Caribbean islands from Sunday, an official said, as the government looks to defuse tensions after more than a week of unrest stemming from its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic there.
""I don't think we will return to Paris necessarily having resolved the whole crisis, but if we take things bit by bit and methodically, it will calm things and open a constructive dialogue with all the actors,"" an official close to Minister Sebastian Lecornu told Reuters before the delegation arrives in Guadeloupe later on Sunday.
A plan for compulsory vaccination for health workers stoked a sentiment among the majority Black population of Guadeloupe and Martinique of being excluded and marginalized from the mainland, although the same measure had already been introduced on the mainland.
The issue sparked protests and fanned longstanding grievances over living standards and the relationship with Paris. Protesters have insisted they should be allowed to make their own choices about health treatment.
On Friday, the government postponed the requirement that public sector health workers on the two islands be vaccinated, but local officials have demanded more dialogue with the central government. 
In Guadeloupe, where protests began more than a week ago, there is a historic mistrust of the government's handling of health crises after many people were systematically exposed to toxic pesticides used in banana plantations in the 1970s.
However, unions in Martinique signed on Saturday an accord with local officials and the state to begin talks on key issues ranging from health, energy prices, youth and transport.
Curfews have helped restore some calm in recent days after violence that saw stores looted and police shot at.

Lecornu said on Saturday that the government was ready to discuss autonomy for the islands.
""It's not a dirty word in the Republic. (French) Polynesia is autonomous today with its own laws, so the minister is ready to open the debate,"" the official said.

ORLA/BIALYSTOK, Poland (Reuters) - Syrian friends Anas Kanaan, 34, and Mouein al-Hadi, 36, were told by people smugglers that they would easily be able to get to Germany from Belarus. They just had to pay 3,000 euros ($3,390) each to an intermediary in Turkey.
But the safe crossings from Belarus to Poland indicated by the smugglers were closed off. Then, after more than a week spent camping in freezing forests on the border, a smuggler led them to a Polish village in broad daylight where they were easily spotted by police, arrested and returned to Belarus.
""It's like our money has just basically evaporated,"" al-Hadi told Reuters in a field near the Polish town of Orla after again managing to breach the border but now unable to walk because his feet were swollen from the cold.
His childhood mate Kanaan added: ""It's all lies. They all lead you to roads where you can die. And at the end they tell you 'we are not responsible for you. Die, whatever'. They just want your money.""
Shortly afterwards, the two Syrians - who said they want to request asylum in Poland, not move on westwards to Germany - were picked up once again by the Polish border guard who said they would be taken to a detention centre.
""More people are becoming aware that they've been led into a trap and that what they've been promised is a lie,"" said Marysia Zlonkiewicz, an activist from Polish charity With Bread and Salt.
HARDER TO CROSS
The crisis on the Belarusian border, involving thousands of migrants from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere all hoping to get into the European Union, has dragged on for months.
Poland and the EU accuse President Alexander Lukashenko of encouraging the migrants to travel to Belarus and cross the border illegally as revenge for sanctions imposed on Minsk over human rights abuses. Belarus denies the charge and says the EU is to blame for the humanitarian crisis on the border.
Migrants face a much tougher challenge now to enter the EU.
Under EU pressure, airlines have restricted flights from the Middle East to Belarus, while many travel agencies in the region have stopped selling plane tickets to the ex-Soviet republic.
Poland has deployed over 20,000 border guards, soldiers and police in a sealed-off border zone, while Belarusian authorities have taken many migrants back to Minsk with the apparent aim of letting them return to their home countries.
Poland's Border Guard says illegal border crossing attempts have dropped to around 200 attempts a day from about 500.
Around 314 smugglers have been detained in Poland since August, police data shows. They are from countries including Germany, Sweden, Ukraine and Georgia. 
As crossings have become more difficult, the people smugglers have hiked their prices to as much as $7,000, migrants told Reuters. 
'NO GOING BACK'
""With every day, things are evolving on the border. Every day, there is a (new) obstacle, there are more guards, more people,"" Syrian migrant Khaled Zein Al Deen, 45, told Reuters at an open migrant centre in the Polish city of Bialystok. 
He and his five relatives lost 18,000 euros to smugglers who promised to take them to a safe apartment, with a car driving ahead of them to make sure there were no police checks. That also proved a lie, and they were caught.
A Polish army spokesperson said the tighter security was making migrants more desperate, with many using force to push through, especially further south, with the help of Belarusians who gave them implements to break down the border fence.
Despite the falling temperatures and increased risks of being caught, the migrants are unlikely to give up trying to get cross, activist Zlonkiewicz told Reuters.
""When it comes to development, education or finding work many of these people have nothing to return to, they have no choice,"" she said.

""Families went into debt or sold their apartments and homes. There's no going back.""

PARIS (Reuters) - World powers and Iran return to Vienna on Monday for a last ditch effort to salvage a 2015 nuclear deal, but few expect a breakthrough as Tehran's atomic activities rumble on in an apparent bid to gain leverage against the West.
Diplomats say time is running low to resurrect the pact, which then-U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018, angering Iran and dismaying the other world powers involved - Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia.
Six rounds of indirect talks were held between April and June. The new round begins after a hiatus triggered by the election of a new Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, a hardline cleric.
Tehran's new negotiating team has set out demands that U.S. and European diplomats consider unrealistic. They are insisting that all U.S. and EU sanctions imposed since 2017, including those unrelated to its nuclear programme, be dropped. 
In parallel, Tehran's conflicts with the U.N. atomic watchdog, which monitors the nuclear programme, have festered. Iran has pressed ahead with its uranium enrichment programme and the IAEA says its inspectors have been treated roughly and refused access to re-install monitoring cameras at a site it deems essential to reviving the deal. 
""They are doing enough technically so they can change their basic relationship with the West to be able to have a more equal dialogue in the future,"" said a Western diplomat involved in the talks.
Two European diplomats said it seemed Iran was simply playing for time to accumulate more material and know-how.
Western diplomats say they will head to Monday's talks on the premise that they resume where they left off in June. They have warned that if Iran continues with its maximalist positions and fails to restore its cooperation with the IAEA then they will have to quickly review their options. 
Iran's top negotiator and foreign minister both repeated on Friday that full sanctions lifting would be the only thing on the table in Vienna.
""If this is the position that Iran continues to hold on Monday, then I don't see a negotiated solution,"" said one of the European diplomats. 
Several diplomats said Iran was now between four to six weeks away from the ""breakout time"" it needs to amass enough fissile material for a single nuclear weapon, although they cautioned it was still about two years from being able to weaponise it.
Should the talks collapse, the likelihood is the United States and its allies will initially confront Iran at the IAEA next month by calling for an emergency meeting. 
However, they will also want to try to keep Russia, which has political influence on Iran, and China, which provides economic breathing space to Tehran through oil purchases, on side as they initially seek alternative diplomatic options.
One scenario diplomats say Washington has suggested is negotiating an open-ended interim accord with Tehran as long as a permanent deal isn't achieved. However, they say this would take time and there is no certainty the Islamic Republic has any appetite for it.
""Iran may calculate that its unconstrained nuclear advances and unmonitored centrifuge production will put more pressure on the West to give ground in talks quickly,"" Eurasia analyst Henry Rome said in a note. 

""But it will likely have the opposite effect, signalling that the new Iranian team does not have an interest in resolving the nuclear issue and hastening the switch toward a more coercive policy next year.""

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Warnings of potential foul play are flying from all sides ahead of Sunday's presidential election in Honduras, raising fears of possible disputes and unrest if leading challenger Xiomara Castro does not win by a clear margin. 
The charged political atmosphere reflects memories of the disputed 2017 election, which the ruling National Party won after a delayed count and that the Organization of American States said was riddled with irregularities before calling for a fresh vote.
The opposition said the result was fraudulent and both sides claimed victory. More than two dozen people were killed in the ensuing riots and repression.
The current election cycle has already claimed more political violence than four years ago, with more than 30 killed so far, according to researchers at Honduras' national university.
Salvador Nasralla, the 2017 runner-up, is the current candidate for vice president for the leading opposition slate led by self-declared democratic socialist Castro. He accuses the National Party of planning a repeat of what he said was voter suppression in 2017.
""I don't have any confidence in our electoral process,"" he told Reuters.
The conservative National Party routinely uses its full control of government institutions and funds to reward supporters, punish opponents and influence elections, politicians from both sides say. 
This week, the party itself issued a statement blasting the electoral authority for already committing errors including a lack of transparency that could lead to a ""national crisis"" with delayed and suspect results.
""It creates a situation of high risk to the election,"" it said. 
Sunday's vote will mark the latest fraught political showdown in Central America, after Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega cruised to re-election this month after detaining all leading rivals.
In a sign of concerns in the final week before the election, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden took the unusual step of sending a high-level delegation to meet with the main candidates, government officials and election organizers.
After the visit, a senior U.S. State Department official said the main objective of the delegation was to encourage a fair, free and peaceful election, given what it describes as democratic backsliding in the region.
If poll leader Castro wins, she would bring the Honduran left to power for the first time since her husband, former President Manuel Zelaya, was ousted in a 2009 coup. 
If ruling party candidate Nasry Asfura prevails, he will have overcome the unpopularity of outgoing President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who is fighting accusations of corruption and links to drug smugglers.
Hernandez denies wrongdoing.
A LOOK AT THE CANDIDATE'S PHONE
During an interview, Nasralla showed Reuters a video on his phone he said was captured by his home-security cameras a few days ago. It showed someone painting slurs on a wall of his house. In the video, the person can be seen removing an outer layer of clothing to reveal a shirt bearing the logo of Castro's Libre party underneath.
Nasralla said the video was evidence that National Party agitators were disguising themselves as Libre supporters, and worried they will provoke violence or property destruction to erode opposition votes. 
""They're the ones that cause violence,"" he said.
The National Party did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
On Friday, a handful of businesses in the capital Tegucigalpa covered glass store entrances with wood and metal panels, in a sign some were taking the possibility of unrest seriously.
Rixi Moncada, the Libre Party's representative on the electoral council, said the government and the National Party have caused ""a lot of obstruction"" in its efforts to organize a fair vote.
She specifically accused the finance ministry of interfering with the council's budget and causing delayed deliveries of polling station equipment, like printers and finger-print readers. 

Moncada, a lawyer, expressed concern that any post-election dispute might reach the courts, widely seen as loyal to the ruling party.
""This country has very little faith in our system of justice,"" she said.

MADRID (Reuters) - Thousands of Spanish police officers marched through Madrid on Saturday to protest against a proposed reform of a security law which they say will hamper their ability to do their work.
Politicians from Spain's three main conservative parties joined police officers in the protest against proposed changes to the 2015 Citizens Security Law, which critics say violates the right to protest and limits free expression.
Dubbed the ""Gag Law"" by those who oppose it, the legislation allows authorities to fine media organisations for distributing unauthorised images of police, strictly limits demonstrations and imposes heavy fines for offenders.
Spain's leftist government has proposed reforms including no longer classifying the taking of photographs or making of recordings of police at demonstrations as a serious offence.
Under the changes, police will also have to use less harmful materials at protests after a number of people were seriously injured by rubber bullets fired by officers. 
The time that suspects who are arrested at protests can be held in custody will be cut from six hours to two and fines will be proportional to how much offenders earn. 
""They should either leave the current law as it is or make it better for the police and for the citizens,"" Civil Guard officer Vanessa Gonzalez told Reuters.
Ivan Espinosa de los Monteros, of the far-right Vox party, said: ""There is strong opposition against (the reform) of this law. It is against our police and we will not let it happen.""

However, Isa Serra, spokeswoman for the far-left Unidas Podemos party, said at a rally in Cantabria in northern Spain that the law had done a ""lot of damage to Spanish democracy"".
Organisers said 150,000 people took part in the Madrid demonstration but the government put the figure at 20,000.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Black Friday shoppers weren't the only ones out hunting for bargains on the day after Thanksgiving. Thieves were busy as well.
Police in Los Angeles and cities elsewhere across the country spent much of their holiday weekend patrols looking for suspects in a spate of ""flash mob"" robberies on Friday, part of a surging U.S. crime trend in which groups of thieves swarm a store, ransack the shelves and flee.
Authorities also have used the term ""smash-and-grab"" to describe the trend.
At least two such robberies were reported on Saturday by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. A local television station, KCAL-TV, counted a total of six smash-and-grab heists on the city's west side alone on Friday.
In one incident, a group of eight men entered a  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) outlet at a shopping mall in Lakewood, south of downtown Los Angeles, walked directly to the tool aisle and snatched a bunch of hammers, sledgehammers and crowbars valued at about $400 before making their getaway, the sheriff's office said.
According to L.A. television station KTTV, the Home Depot robbery on Friday night involved up to 20 suspects who pulled up to the store in as many as 10 cars and donned ski masks before raiding the tool aisle.
""We tried to stop them,"" store employee Luis Romo told KTTV. ""We closed the front entrance, and they put their sledgehammers up and whoever got in the way, they were going to hurt them.""
The Los Angeles City News Service said four suspects in that robbery were arrested on Saturday by Beverly Hills police.
In a similar incident Friday afternoon, a group of 10 men or more invaded a store in the city's Fairfax district and started grabbing merchandise without paying for it, pushing employees out of the way before fleeing the scene, according to LAPD.
Police are investigating possible ties between that incident and a flurry of other robberies and retail thefts on Friday and earlier in the week, including two smash-and-grabs reported on Wednesday, an LAPD spokesperson said.
The rash of retail crime prompted the LAPD to place its officers on a citywide tactical alert on Friday afternoon.

Mass robberies also were reported on Friday at two Best Buy electronics stores in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, one of them involving as many as 30 suspects, while a spree of pre-dawn retail burglaries were under investigation in Chicago.
In one of the biggest flash-mob robberies reported on the West Coast in recent days, police in the San Francisco suburb of Walnut Creek were seeking about 80 suspects who swarmed and ransacked a department store last Saturday.

Ukraine's military intelligence said last week that Russia had more than 92,000 troops massed around Ukraine's borders and was preparing for an attack by the end of January or beginning of February.
Russia's foreign intelligence chief said on Saturday that such suggestions were ""malicious U.S. propaganda"".
But Ukrainian forces who control the borders are prepared for any escalation between the two sides.
""If there is an attack, we have means for defence. We are well-prepared.  We're getting ready, better day by day, considering different options. We can repel an attack without big problems and we're not afraid of it,"" said Oleksander.
Ukraine, which wants to join the NATO military alliance, has blamed Moscow for supporting separatists in a conflict in its east since 2014.
Russia has said it suspects Ukraine of wanting to recapture separatist-controlled territory by force. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday that Kyiv had no such plans and Russia's rhetoric opposing Ukraine's bid to join NATO was worrying.
Ukraine received a large consignment of U.S. ammunition and Javelin missiles earlier this year and soldiers say they also have mortars and Turkish attack drones.

""It's a bad idea to be afraid when someone comes to your house and you hide in your basement. It won't work. One should get up and go to fight,"" another soldier Vlad said. 
""We're fighting here to not let them come, and then it's luck of a draw.""

(Reuters) -Broadway composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim, who helped American musical theater evolve beyond pure entertainment and reach new artistic heights with such works as ""West Side Story,"" ""Into the Woods"" and ""Sweeney Todd,"" died early Friday at the age of 91, his publicist said.
The musical great died at his home in Roxbury, Connecticut, spokesperson Kathryn Zuckerman told Reuters by email, saying she had little additional information. The news was reported earlier by the New York Times.
Sondheim's eight Tony Awards for his lyrics and music surpassed the total of any other composer. In 2008 he also won a Special Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement.
He started early, learning the art of musical theater when he was a teenager from his mentor Oscar Hammerstein II, the legendary lyricist behind ""The Sound of Music.""
""Hamilton"" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, who was in turn mentored by Sondheim, has called him musical theater's greatest lyricist.
Sondheim's most successful works included ""Into the Woods,"" which opened on Broadway in 1987 and used children's fairy tales to untangle adult obsessions; the 1979 thriller ""Sweeney Todd,"" about a murderous barber in London whose victims are served as meat pies; and 1962's ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,"" a vaudeville-style comedy set in ancient Rome.
He also wrote the lyrics to Leonard Bernstein's score for ""West Side Story,"" inspired by William Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet,"" and collaborated with fellow composer Jule Styne as lyricist for ""Gypsy,"" loosely based on the memoirs of burlesque star Gypsy Rose Lee.
""I love the theater as much as music, and the whole idea of getting across to an audience and making them laugh, making them cry - just making them feel - is paramount to me,"" Sondheim said in a 2013 interview with National Public Radio.
Several of Sondheim's hit musicals were turned into movies, including the 2014 film ""Into the Woods,"" starring Meryl Streep, and the 2007 ""Sweeney Todd"" with Johnny Depp. A new film version of ""West Side Story,"" directed by Stephen Spielberg from a screenplay by Tony Kushner, opens next month.
During a guest appearance in September on the CBS ""Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" Sondheim said he visited the set of Spielberg's adaptation, and endorsed the film ""as really first rate.""
Sondheim's songs were celebrated for their sharp wit and insight into modern life and for giving voice to complex characters, but few of them made the pop charts.
'CLOWNS' HIT
He scored a hit, however, and one of three Grammys of his career, with ""Send in the Clowns"" from his 1973 musical ""A Little Night Music."" It was recorded by Frank Sinatra, Sarah Vaughan and Judy Collins, among others. Sondheim also earned a best-song Academy Award in 1991 for ""Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man),"" sung by Madonna in the ""Dick Tracy"" movie.
In 2015, President Barack Obama presented the lyricist the Presidential Medal of Freedom at a White House ceremony.
One of Sondheim's greatest triumphs was the Pulitzer Prize he shared with composure James Lapine for the 1984 musical ""Sunday in the Park with George,"" about 19th-century French Neo-Impressionist artist Georges Seurat. The two also collaborated on ""Into the Woods.""
Actress Bernadette Peters, who played the roles of Dot and Marie in ""Sunday in the Park"" and the witch of ""Into the Woods,"" expressed sadness at the loss of a friend, tweeting, Sondheim ""gave me so much to sing about.""
Fellow actress Anna Kendrick, who starred as Cinderella in the film version of ""Into the Woods,"" called Sondheim's death ""a devastating loss.""
""Performing his work has been among the greatest privileges of my career,"" she added on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
As Sondheim collected accolades, New York City's Broadway theater industry underwent many changes. It had a key role in American culture through the 1950s, with many Broadway songs making the pop charts, but lost significance as rock music gained a hold on the public starting in the 1960s.
Increasingly, musicals borrowed material from television and movies, instead of the other way around, composer Mark N. Grant wrote in his book ""The Rise and Fall of the Broadway Musical.""
Sondheim shared the view that Broadway had experienced decline, expressing it repeatedly in interviews. 
""There are so many forms of entertainment, theater is becoming more marginalized,"" he told British newspaper The Times in 2012.
But Broadway musicals also became more artistic, and Sondheim played a key role in their evolution, critics said. He explored such weighty topics as political violence in ""Assassins,"" the human need for family and the pull of dysfunctional relationships in ""Into the Woods,"" social inequality in ""Sweeney Todd,"" and Western imperialism in ""Pacific Overtures.""
He developed new methods for presenting a play as well. Instead of telling a story from beginning to end, he would jump backward and forward in time to explore a single theme. It was called the ""concept musical.""
Broadway audiences were introduced to Sondheim with ""West Side Story"" in 1957. The story about a love affair between a Puerto Rican girl, Maria, and a white boy, Tony, in working-class Manhattan was turned into an Oscar-winning film in 1961. The central characters expressed their infatuation in the songs ""Maria,"" ""Somewhere"" and ""Tonight.""
CONFLICT WITH MOTHER
Sondheim was born March 22, 1930, in New York City to affluent Jewish parents who worked in fashion. He described his early childhood as a lonely one, with servants as his main company.
After his parents split up when he was 10 years old, Sondheim moved with his mother to rural Pennsylvania, where she bought a farm. He later said his mother took out her wrath over the divorce on him. He found a surrogate family in the nearby household of Hammerstein and his wife, Dorothy.
Hammerstein, who along with composing partner Richard Rodgers created the classic musicals ""Oklahoma!"" ""South Pacific and ""The Sound of Music,"" taught the teenage Sondheim how to write musical theater.
After Sondheim became famous, he mentored others on Broadway. When Miranda began work on a rap musical about American founding father Alexander Hamilton, Sondheim encouraged and critiqued him. The play became a smash hit on Broadway in 2015.
In box office success, Sondheim fell short of Andrew Lloyd Webber, the composer behind ""The Phantom of the Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA)"" and ""Cats"" with whom Sondheim shared a birthday.
Sondheim pushed audiences, which sometimes resulted in box office flops.
Some of his least commercially successful plays were lauded by critics. Those included the 1976 ""Pacific Overtures,"" which depicted Japan during an age of Western colonialism, and his 1990 off-Broadway production ""Assassins"" about real-life figures who each set out to kill an American president. 
Sondheim had many fans in the academic world. In 1994, a quarterly magazine called the Sondheim Review was founded to examine his work, five years after Oxford University in England named him a visiting professor of drama.

His devotees celebrated the acerbic irony of his lyrics, which they described as commenting on everything from the limits of America's melting pot to the downside of marriage.
These lines from ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" in his 1970 musical ""Company"" contained a typical slice of Sondheim's wit: ""Here's to the girls who play wife/Aren't they too much?/Keeping house but clutching a copy of 'LIFE'/Just to keep in touch.""

TAOS, N.M. (Reuters) - A plan to seed the clouds over the mountains of New Mexico to increase snowfall during a historic drought was pulled this week after accusations it could poison people and the environment.
Western Weather Consultants (WWC) of Durango, Colorado proposed siting machines near five ski resorts in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to pump silver iodide vapor into the atmosphere and increase ice crystals and snow. A state agency said WWC this week withdrew its application to deploy the 75-year-old technology that is being widely used to fight extreme drought affecting half the western United States.
WWC did not respond to requests for comment. 
Cloud seeding seeks to increase precipitation by adding small particles to the clouds that water droplets form around. These turn into snowflakes and raindrops. 
The WWC plan, which would have been paid for with state funds, got preliminary state approval, according to an October state filing.
During a public webinar on Monday, officials for WWC, which provides cloud seeding for Vail and Beaver Creek ski resorts in Colorado among other clients, said the technology was an effective way to boost snowfall and studies showed no negative effects on flora and fauna. 
The company said then that the five ski areas in the New Mexico target area were not participating in the project. 
Well over half of public comments on the webinar opposed the plan. Callers said silver was a toxic heavy metal that could get into groundwater and the soil.
""The solutions are to stop the destruction which causes us to not have rain and water, not to increase further destruction and further manipulation,"" said Marquel Musgrave, a member of the Nambe Pueblo Native American community. 
WWC withdrew its application the next day, according to a statement by the New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission.
""The reason they gave was the timeline was pushed back too far for adequate time for the program,” ISC Deputy Director Hannah Risely-White told the Santa Fe New Mexican.

New Mexico resident Mike Davis, who helped lead opposition to cloud seeding, called WWC's withdrawal a victory.
Researchers point to human-caused climate change as intensifying the most severe drought on record in the southwestern United States.

U.S., NATO and Ukrainian officials have raised the alarm in recent weeks over what they say are unusual Russian troop movements near the border with Ukraine, suggesting that Moscow may be poised to launch an attack.
Russia has repeatedly said it is free to move its troops on its own territory and that such movements should not be a cause for concern.
""I need to reassure everyone. Nothing like this is going to happen,"" Sergei Naryshkin, head of Russia's foreign intelligence agency, said in an interview broadcast on state television, referring to comments on Russia's alleged invasion plans.

While U.S. officials have voiced concerns about a possible Russian attack on Ukraine, Moscow has accused Washington, Kyiv and NATO of provocative and irresponsible behaviour near its borders.

TAPACHULA, Mexico (Reuters) - Hundreds of Central American and Haitian migrants formed a new caravan on Friday in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, near the Guatemala border, and began walking north toward the United States.
The migrants said they wanted to leave Chiapas as they had not been given humanitarian visas promised by Mexico or transferred to other parts of the country where they would have better living conditions.
About 1,000 migrants, many carrying children, early on Friday began walking from Tapachula, a city bordering Guatemala, to Mapastepec, about 100 km away (62.1 miles), where they plan to join another group of migrants, caravan organizers said.
A day earlier, Mexico's National Migration Institute (INM) began transferring hundreds of migrants to other parts of the country after they had spent months waiting in Tapachula for a response to requests for refuge or humanitarian visas.
The migrants were also offered documents for a temporary legal stay in Mexico that would allow them to look for jobs, defusing threats to start walking toward the U.S. border.
However, many migrants in Tapachula were not transferred elsewhere or did not receive humanitarian visas, and they joined those heading toward the United States.
""We need to work to support our family and that is why we decided to do this, to leave in the caravan,"" said one Haitian migrant, accompanied by his wife and family members, who declined to be identified.
Luis Garcia, one of the caravan organizers, said about 1,500 people are expected to head north from Mapastepec on Tuesday. In the past, migrants have refused to accept government aid because of the fear of being deported.

Earlier on Friday, the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) said it discovered that last year at least three Haitian asylum seekers in Mexico were deported to their country. 
The Mexican National Migration Institute did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment about the cases.

The migrants died https://www.reuters.com/world/five-migrants-drown-crossing-channel-france-britain-bfm-tv-2021-11-24 when their dinghy deflated as they made a perilous crossing of the English Channel on Wednesday, the worst tragedy on record in one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.
Maryam Nuri Mohamed Amin, 24, made the journey in order to see her fiance, the BBC reported, citing family members and a close friend. 
""When she left Kurdistan she was very happy, she couldn't believe that she was going to meet (him),"" the woman's friend Imann Hassan was quoted as saying by the British broadcaster, which said her fiance already lived in Britain. 
""She tried to live a better life, she chose the UK, but she died,"" Hassan added.

Reuters was not immediately able to verify the information. 
The tragedy has further strained ties between France and Britain, with French President Emmanuel Macron https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/french-interior-minister-cancels-meeting-with-uk-counterpart-french-media-2021-11-26 telling Britain on Friday it needed to ""get serious"" or remain locked out of discussions over how to curb the flow of migrants across the Channel.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi told officials on Saturday to review plans to ease travel restrictions as concerns rise over the new Omicron https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/japan-tighten-border-controls-s-africa-others-new-virus-variant-jiji-2021-11-26 variant of COVID-19.
The world's second-worst affected country by the pandemic had only Friday decided to resume https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-tighten-covid-19-testing-tourists-amid-new-variant-concerns-2021-11-26 international passenger flights from countries deemed ""at risk"" of the coronavirus, while ordering tightened border screening.
But after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the new variant to be ""of concern"", Modi ""highlighted the need for monitoring all international arrivals, their testing as per guidelines, with a specific focus on countries identified 'at risk',"" the government said in a statement after he met with officials to review the COVID-19 and vaccination situation.
The WHO said Omicron, initially detected in South Africa, may spread more quickly than other forms.
This week, India posted the smallest rise in new cases in one and a half years, due to increased vaccinations and antibodies in a large section of its population from previous infections. 
The nation's daily caseload has halved since September. It reported 8,318 new cases in the last 24 hours.
But the new variant, with a spike protein dramatically different from the one existing coronavirus that vaccines are based on, has raised global alarms and frightened financial markets.
Modi said people must be more cautious and take proper precautions, such as wearing masks and social distancing.
He ""spoke about the need to be proactive in light of the new variant,"" the statement said.

""He directed that intensive containment and active surveillance should continue in clusters reporting higher cases and required technical support be provided to states which are reporting higher cases presently.""
Modi told officials to accelerate second-dose coverage, it said.

Guadeloupe and the nearby French island of Martinique have seen several days of protests against COVID-19 measures that have spilled over into violence.
Lecornu, the minister for France's overseas territories, said in a YouTube video issued late on Friday that certain elected officials in Guadeloupe had raised the question of autonomy, changing its status as an overseas region.
""The government is ready to talk about this. There are no bad debates, as long as those debates serve to resolve the real everyday problems of people in Guadeloupe,"" he said.
That was one of a series of initiatives he said the government in Paris would be taking in Guadeloupe, including improving healthcare, infrastructure projects, and a scheme to create jobs for young people.
The French government this week announced that it would be postponing a requirement that public sector workers in Guadeloupe and Martinique get a COVID-19 vaccination.

That had sparked protests, fanning long-standing grievances over living standards and the relationship with Paris.
In Guadeloupe there is a historic mistrust of the French government's handling of health crises after many people were exposed to toxic pesticides used in banana plantations in the 1970s.

(Reuters) - Gun violence erupted at retail outlets crowded with post-Thanksgiving holiday shoppers in North Carolina and Washington state on Friday, sending bystanders at both locations scurrying for cover and injuring a total of seven people, police said.
At a shopping mall in Durham, North Carolina, a late-afternoon shootout between ""two groups who knew each other"" left three people struck by ricocheting gunfire and three others injured in the ensuing chaos, city Police Chief Patrice Andrews said.
One of the those wounded was a 10-year-old boy, but Andrews described the injuries sustained by all six people hurt in the melee as non-life-threatening. 
She said it was not immediately clear whether any of the victims were among the individuals who exchanged gunfire, and that the majority of those involved had fled the scene, though one was taken into custody.
""This is not a situation where someone came into the mall and indiscriminately just began firing,"" she said, adding that she expected additional arrests. One weapon was recovered, Andrews told reporters at a briefing afterward.
A department store employee who was working at the time of shooting told WRAL-TV, based in nearby Raleigh, that he counted six gunshots that rang out through the mall, triggering a stampede of Black Friday shoppers running for the nearest exit.
""A lot of people started running my way, and once I heard all six rapidly, I started to run, too,"" he told the TV station.
The Streets at Southpoint mall was locked down and evacuated as law enforcement swept through the shopping center.
A short time earlier across the country, security officer shot a man suspected of trying to steal merchandise from a Walmart (NYSE:WMT) store during an altercation in the eastern Washington town of Kennewick, police said.
The shooting occurred when the suspect, confronted as he was leaving the store, pointed a gun at the officer. The officer then drew his own weapon and opened fire at the suspect, who fled the scene but was arrested at a nearby home, according to police.
The suspect, taken to an area hospital for treatment of his wounds, was already wanted on nine outstanding warrants and now faces additional robbery and assault charges, police said in a statement. 
No one else was injured at the Walmart. Local media reported the shooting stirred panic at the discount store, which was evacuated and closed immediately after the incident but reopened hours later.

The countries are South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, the Seychelles, Malawi and Mozambique.
Effective immediately, the government will ban non-citizens who have been in those countries from entering and will require supervised 14-day quarantines for Australian citizens and their dependents returning from the countries, said Health Minister Greg Hunt.
These restrictions also apply to people such as international students and skilled migrants arriving from countries with which Australia has travel bubbles, who have been in any of the nine countries within the past 14 days.
""If the medical evidence shows that further actions are required, we will not hesitate to take them. And that may involve strengthening or expanding the restrictions,"" he said.
Anyone who has already arrived in Australia and who has been in any of those countries within the past 14 days must immediately isolate and be tested. 
The Australian government will also suspend all flights from the nine southern African countries for two weeks.
Twenty travellers from South Africa are in quarantine in the Northern Territory's Howard Springs facility, 19 of whom have returned negative coronavirus tests. It is not yet known if the one positive test result is the Omicron variant, Hunt said.
The discovery of the variant - which has a spike protein dramatically different from the one that existing vaccines are based on - triggered global alarm on Friday as countries rushed to suspend travel from southern Africa and stock markets suffered their biggest falls in more than a year.

Australia early this month eased its international border restrictions for the first time during the pandemic allowing fully vaccinated residents to return to the country without quarantine after higher vaccination levels.
Australia had largely stamped out infections for most of this year until an outbreak of the highly infectious Delta variant in late June spread rapidly across its east. About 205,000 cases and 1,985 deaths have been recorded so far, lower than many other countries in the developed world.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. diplomat for East Asia will visit Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand from the weekend after President Joe Biden pledged stepped up engagement with Southeast Asia, a key battleground in his contest for influence with China.
Daniel Kritenbrink, the assistant secretary of state for East Asia, will be in the region from Saturday until Dec. 4, a State Department statement said.
Kritenbrink would ""reaffirm the U.S. commitment to work together ... to tackle the most serious global and regional challenges"" and stress U.S. support for ""a rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific,"" it said, a reference to China's increasingly assertive behavior in the region, which Washington has repeatedly denounced as ""coercive.""
Kritenbrink will discuss human rights ""challenges,"" seek to bolster cooperation on climate change and discuss ways to pressure Myanmar's military government to cease violence and allow unhindered humanitarian access, the statement said.
He will also discuss how to strengthen economic relationships and ""build back better"" from the COVID-19 pandemic, it said. 
Biden joined leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in a virtual summit last month, the first time in four years Washington had engaged at the top level with the bloc. 
He pledged to stand with ASEAN in defending freedom of the seas and democracy, and said Washington would start talks on developing a regional economic framework, something critics say his Asia strategy has lacked since his predecessor Donald Trump quit a regional trade pact.
An Asian diplomat said regional countries were still awaiting details of this plan, recognizing Biden's focus on rebuilding domestic economic strength was a limiting factor.
Daniel Russel, a predecessor of Kritenbrink in the Obama administration, said a key question for ASEAN was ""whether the United States truly has a viable economic strategy"" for the region.
""The pledge to discuss ways to strengthen U.S. economic engagement with ASEAN countries is music to their ears, even if they may be underwhelmed by the 'economic framework' so far,"" he said.
Kritenbrink's trip announcement stressed the ""centrality"" of the 10-member ASEAN to regional affairs, but he will not visit the bloc's new chair, Cambodia, which has shifted ever closer to China.
The Asian diplomat and Russel said Kritenbrink was likely to visit other ASEAN countries before long and Russel noted Indonesia's capital Jakarta is home to the bloc's permanent headquarters.

""While it is important to discuss the ASEAN agenda with the 2022 chair, visiting ASEAN headquarters in Jakarta will afford him the opportunity to begin that conversation,"" Russel said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - All options are on the table in how to respond to Russia's ""large and unusual"" troop buildup near Ukraine's border, and the NATO alliance will decide on the next move following consultations next week, the State Department's top U.S. diplomat for European affairs said on Friday.
""As you can appreciate, all options are on the table and there's a toolkit that includes a whole range of options,"" Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Karen Donfried told reporters in a telephone briefing.
U.S. President Joe Biden said he was concerned about the situation in Ukraine, repeated Washington's support for Ukraine's territorial integrity and added that he will ""in all probability"" speak with his Ukrainian and Russian counterparts Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Vladimir Putin.
The comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is heading to Latvia and Sweden next week to attend meetings of NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Donfried said Moscow's ""large and unusual"" troop buildup would top the agenda at the NATO summit.
""It's now for the alliance to decide what are the next moves that NATO wants to take,"" Donfried said. ""Next week, we will talk about our assessment of what's happening on Russia's border with Ukraine and we will begin that conversation of what are the options that are on the table and what it is that NATO as an alliance would like to do together,"" she said.
U.S., NATO and Ukrainian officials have raised the alarm in recent weeks over what they say are unusual Russian troop movements closer to Ukraine, suggesting that Moscow may be poised to launch an attack on its neighbor, accusations Russia has rejected as fear-mongering.
Asked if Blinken was going to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov while in Stockholm, Donfried said she had no such announcements to make but added: ""Stay tuned.""
On Friday, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Ukraine's head of presidential administration, Andriy Yermak, in a call spoke about their concerns over Russian military activities near Ukraine's border.
The two discussed Russia's ""harsh rhetoric"" toward Ukraine and agreed all sides should pursue diplomatic efforts to ease tensions, National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne​​ said in a statement. ""Mr. Sullivan underscored the United States' unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Horne said.
The head of Ukraine's military intelligence told the Military Times outlet this weekend that Russia had more than 92,000 troops massed around Ukraine's borders and was preparing for an attack by the end of January or beginning of February.
Moscow has dismissed such suggestions as inflammatory and said it was not threatening anyone and defended its right to deploy its troops as it wished. 
Donfried was asked what the United States saw specifically different in Russia's troop buildup this time, but she did not elaborate aside from saying it was ""large and unusual.""
Russia's intentions remain unclear, and East-West tensions are running high with Ukraine, Russia and NATO all conducting military drills and Moscow accusing Washington of rehearsing a nuclear attack on Russia earlier this month.

Asked if recent escalation has prompted Washington to consider more seriously deploying permanent troops in NATO's eastern flank, Donfried did not elaborate on the specific point but said NATO foreign ministers next week would be discussing the wider strategy for the alliance's posturing in the 21st century.
At the OSCE meeting in Stockholm, Donfried said, Blinken will also raise Russia's occupation of Ukrainian and Georgian territories, the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and the crisis in Belarus.

Monday’s indirect talks between the United States and Iran, with the participation of major powers, aim at bringing the two countries into full compliance with a 2015 deal. Washington abandoned the accord in 2018 and reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran.
“If the opposing sides are prepared to return to their full obligations and the lifting of sanctions, a good and even immediate agreement can be reached,” Amirabdollahian said in a telephone conversation with the European Union's foreign policy chief, Joseph Borrell.
“Iran wants a good and verifiable agreement,” Iranian media quoted Amirabdollahian as saying.
Separately, the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, Mohammad Eslami, said the Vienna talks will not be about ""nuclear issues"", but rather about the United States' return to the 2015 nuclear deal, Iranian media reported.
International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi said on Wednesday following a trip to Tehran this week that he had made no progress on several disputes, the most pressing of which was getting access to the workshop at the TESA Karaj complex two months after Iran promised to grant it.
The workshop makes components for centrifuges, machines that enrich uranium, and was hit by apparent sabotage in June in which one of four IAEA cameras there was destroyed. Iran removed the cameras and the destroyed camera's footage is missing.

""We are close to the point where I would not be able to guarantee continuity of knowledge,"" Grossi said.
However, Amirabdollahian told Borrell that Iran would attend the Vienna talks in “good faith” - despite the U.S. violation of the 2015 agreement.

No decision to halt flights had yet been made, he said.
The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, said White House officials were discussing potential travel restrictions on southern African countries. Those officials were expected to meet with agency officials this afternoon to make a recommendation, the newspaper said, without specifying which agency.
The White House referred to Fauci's earlier comments when asked about the report and declined further comment.
Global authorities have reacted with alarm to the new variant, detected in South Africa, with the European Union and Britain among those tightening border controls as scientists seek to find out if the mutation is vaccine-resistant.
The World Health Organization (WHO), however, has cautioned against hasty measures and South Africa said a British ban on flights seemed rushed.
""There is always the possibility of doing what the UK has done, namely block travel from South Africa and related countries,"" Fauci said in an interview on CNN.
""That's certainly something you think about and get prepared to do. You're prepared to do everything you need to protect the American public. But you want to make sure there's a basis for doing that,"" he said.
""Obviously as soon as we find out more information we'll make a decision as quickly as we possibly can."" 

Fauci said US scientists would speak with South African counterparts on Friday about the new variant, called B.1.1.529, which has raised concern about its transmissibility and whether it might evade immune responses.
He added that there was no indication that the new variant was already in the United States.

One of the world's best selling singer-songwriters, the Grammy Award winner released her fourth studio album last week, with critics and fans praising her honesty on the record she said she made to explain her divorce to her son Angelo, 9.
First week sales for ""30"" totalled 261,000, giving it the biggest opening week of the year so far, the Official Charts Company said. The figure is the biggest for an album since Ed Sheeran’s ""Divide"" in 2017 and the biggest for a female solo album since Adele’s last record, 2015's ""25"".
""It becomes Adele’s fourth UK Number 1 album; she has now reached Number 1 on the Official Albums Chart with all of her studio albums, a record for a female act,"" the Official Charts Company said in a statement.
""All of Adele’s previous albums are also present in the chart this week; 25 (Number 15), 21 (Number 18) and 19 (Number 31).""
""30"" was also the most-streamed album this past week, recording 55.7 million plays across its 12 songs, the Official Charts Company said.
Known for her ballads about heartbreak and nostalgia, Adele also topped the UK singles charts for a sixth week with ""Easy On Me"", the first track to be released from ""30"".
The song has overtaken her 2011 mega hit ""Someone Like You"" to become her longest-running Number 1 on the Official Singles Chart. ""Oh My God"" and ""I Drink Wine"", two other singles from ""30"", also made it into the top 5.

The 33-year-old is expected to top charts elsewhere. Earlier this week, Billboard said ""30"" was the fastest-selling album in the U.S. after just three days, citing initial data.
Like her previous albums, ""30"" is named after a milestone age in Adele's life. The singer announced her split from her husband Simon Konecki in 2019.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Russia on Friday chided the United States for threatening a diplomatic escalation with Iran at the U.N. nuclear watchdog next month unless it improves cooperation with the agency, saying it risked harming wider talks on the Iran nuclear deal.
The United States threatened on Thursday to confront Iran at the International Atomic Energy Agency if it does not give way on at least one of several conflicts with the IAEA, especially its refusal to let the IAEA re-install cameras at a workshop after an apparent attack in June.
""I believe that demonstrates that our American counterparts lose patience but I believe all of us need to control our emotions,"" Russia's ambassador to the IAEA Mikhail Ulyanov told a news conference with his Chinese counterpart.
""I don't welcome this particular statement of the U.S. delegation (at the IAEA). It's not helpful."" 
Indirect talks between the United States and Iran aimed at reviving the battered 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers are due to resume on Monday after a five-month break that started after the election that brought Iranian hardline President Ebrahim Raisi to power.
The 2015 deal lifted sanctions against Iran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear activities. Then-President Donald Trump pulled Washington out of the agreement in 2018 and re-imposed sanctions against Tehran.

Iran responded by breaching many of the restrictions, reducing the time it would need to obtain enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb if it wanted to. Tehran denies that it would ever seek atomic weapons.
""The U.S. did not negotiate with the Iranians for a very long time and forgot that Iranians don't do anything under pressure. If they are under pressure, they resist,"" Ulyanov said, apparently referring to the fact that U.S. and Iranian envoys are not meeting directly.

KYIV (Reuters) -President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday said Ukraine had uncovered a plot to overthrow his government next week, involving individuals from Russia caught on tape talking about roping Ukraine's richest businessman into backing a coup.
The Kremlin denied any role in any coup plot, and the businessman called the president's account an ""absolute lie."" Zelenskiy himself gave few details and stopped short of saying whether he believed the Kremlin was behind the plot.
But the accusation raised the temperature at a time when Kyiv and its Western allies have already accused Moscow of massing troops near the Ukrainian border for a possible assault, a suggestion Moscow dismisses as false and alarmist.
Speaking at an hours-long news conference, Zelenskiy said Ukrainian intelligence had obtained audio recordings of the plotters talking about involving business magnate Rinat Akhmetov into joining their coup. 
""We have challenges not only from the Russian Federation and possible escalation - we have big internal challenges. I received information that a coup d'etat will take place in our country on Dec. 1-2,"" Zelenskiy said.
Akhmetov said in a statement: ""The information made public by Volodymyr Zelenskiy about attempts to draw me into some kind of coup is an absolute lie. I am outraged by the spread of this lie, no matter what the president's motives are.""
""As a Ukrainian citizen, the country's biggest investor, taxpayer, and employer, I will continue to defend a free Ukraine, a free economy, democracy, and freedom of speech.""
Ukraine's sovereign dollar bonds tumbled to their lowest level in more than a year on Friday and the cost of insuring exposure to the country's debt soared amid rising security concerns.
UKRAINE PREPARED FOR ESCALATION
Zelenskiy did not give full details of the coup plot. Asked explicitly whether he thought the Kremlin was involved, he said: ""I'm sorry, I can't talk about it.""
But he also spoke at length at the news conference of a threat of Russian military escalation, and said Ukraine would be ready for it.
""We are in full control of our borders and are fully prepared for any escalation,"" Zelenskiy said.
The head of Ukraine's military intelligence told the Military Times outlet last week that Russia had more than 92,000 troops massed around Ukraine's borders and was preparing for an attack by the end of January or beginning of February.
Ukraine, which wants to join the NATO military alliance, has blamed Moscow for supporting separatists in a conflict in its east since 2014. It received a large consignment of U.S. ammunition and Javelin missiles earlier this year, prompting criticism from Russia.
U.S. officials were in touch with Ukraine to get additional information on the plot, said Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Karen Donfried.
Ministers from NATO member states, including U.S. top diplomat Antony Blinken, would also meet Ukrainian officials during a summit in Latvia next week, Donfried told reporters in a telephone briefing.
Zelenskiy also said his chief of staff Andriy Yermak would soon be contacting representatives of Russia about the standoff between the two countries. Separately, Yermak said he would be contacting senior Kremlin official Dmitry Kozak.
Russia has said it suspects Ukraine of wanting to recapture separatist-controlled territory by force. Zelenskiy said Ukraine had no such plans and added that Russia's rhetoric opposing Ukraine's bid to join NATO was a worrying signal.
A former actor who once played a fictional president in a popular sitcom, the 43-year-old Zelenskiy came to power by a landslide in 2019 promising to end the war in eastern Ukraine, which Kyiv says has killed 14,000 people.

But after a lull in fighting and confidence-building measures including prisoner swaps, tensions with Russia rose this year. President Vladimir Putin said the West was taking his ""red lines"" about NATO expansion too lightly.
At his news conference, Zelenskiy said he wanted the prisoner swaps to resume. He called on Russia to state explicitly that it would not launch a new attack on Ukraine.

LONDON (Reuters) - Central London shops and businesses hoping to receive a much-needed boost from Black Friday sales were hit by disruption to the tube network as drivers held their biggest strike since 2018.
The 24-hour strike, which started at 0430 GMT, led to the suspension of the Piccadilly, and Waterloo and City lines, and delays on the Jubilee, Central, Victoria and Northern lines. 
Transport for London (TfL) said it was running 58% of its usual services.
The walkout of 2,000 Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) members came after disagreements over TfL's plans to make tube drivers take on shifts at night.
The strikes targeted the five lines where TfL used to employ dedicated Night Tube drivers, with the Waterloo and City line also suspended as it shares many of its drivers with the Central line.
The Friday and Saturday Night Tube service was suspended during the pandemic. It was due to restart with a limited service on Saturday.
Joe Swaffham, 36, who commutes from North Greenwich to Moorgate to work for a maintenance firm, said his journey took twice as long and made him 45 minutes late for work.
""Commuters were being less forgiving when trying to get on trains and I got pushed two-throw down the platform – luckily the Jubilee line has a glass wall for safety,"" he said. 
""But I think the train workers shouldn't have to be forced into hours they didn't sign up for,"" he added.
Shops in central London said the strike could hurt sales on Black Friday, one of the busiest shopping days of the year.

""The timing of the strike is particularly disappointing and is a real kick in the teeth for Central London's hospitality and retail sector,” said Ros Morgan, Chief Executive Heart of London Business Alliance, which represents 500 businesses in London's West End.
TfL said there were no plans to hold talks with RMT leaders. ""We remain open to talking but there's no concrete plans so far,"" a spokesperson said.

BRUZGI, Belarus/MOSCOW (Reuters) -Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko told migrants stranded at the border with Poland on Friday that his country would help them to return home if they wanted but would not force them. 
Thousands of migrants are stuck on the European Union's eastern frontier, in what the EU says is a crisis Minsk engineered by distributing Belarusian visas in the Middle East, flying them in and pushing them across the border. 
But Lukashenko said it was the EU that deliberately provoked a humanitarian crisis that needed to be resolved and he told the migrants he would not play politics with their fate.
In his first public appearance at the border since the start of the crisis, Lukashenko met migrants at a warehouse turned into shelter and told them they were free to head west or go home as they chose.
An Iraqi teenager told Lukashenko she could not return home and hoped to continue on to Europe. ""We won't only hope,"" Lukashenko answered. ""We will work together on your dream.""
Lukashenko said no-one would be coerced.
""If you want to go westwards, we won't detain you, choke you, beat you,"" he said as hundreds of migrants applauded. ""It's up to you. Go through. Go.""
He added: ""We won't in any circumstances detain you, tie your hands and load you on planes to send you home if you don't want that.""

Poland and other EU nations say the crisis https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/poland-says-migrants-still-crossing-belarus-despite-steps-by-minsk-2021-11-23 is part of a ""hybrid war"" Minsk is waging in retaliation for EU sanctions imposed in response to Lukashenko's crushing of protests against his disputed re-election last year and is designed to destabilise the bloc. 
The EU has agreed on new sanctions in response to the border crisis, which diplomats in Brussels say should be approved and adopted in early December.
Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, bearing the brunt of the crisis, have deployed thousands of border guards, soldiers and police to seal the border and push back migrants attempting to cross over from Belarus. 
Lithuania on Friday said it could close its border crossings if more migrants attempted to cross from Belarus in trucks. 
Belarus has begun to fly some migrants home, but has said it is waiting for an answer from the EU on its demand that Germany should accept 2,000 stranded at the border, which the EU has rejected and Germany has denied agreeing to it. 
On Friday, two planes brought hundreds of Iraqis back from Belarus to Erbil, capital of Iraq's Kurdish autonomous region. 
Two more flights were expected on Nov. 26-27, the TASS news agency reported.
Warsaw has said the repatriation of migrants marked a change of tactics rather than a genuine attempt at de-escalation and Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, touring European capitals this week to rally support for a tough response https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-aggression-against-ukraine-should-lead-eu-sanctions-merkel-2021-11-25, raised the possibility of further sanctions if the crisis escalated.
Poland and Lithuania continue to report crossing attempts by migrants who are increasingly desperate with the onset of winter conditions. Polish authorities also reported unrest at one of the detention centres set up for migrants who made their way into the country. 

The issue has exacerbated strife between Russia and the EU, whose ties have been at post-Cold War lows since Moscow's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, who helped Lukashenko ride out mass street protests after last year's election, has also backed Belarus in its most recent standoff with the EU.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - China's military carried out ""combat readiness"" patrols in the direction of the Taiwan Strait on Friday as a U.S. Congressional delegation made a surprise visit to Taipei, offering strong support to the Chinese-claimed, democratically governed island.
The five members of the U.S. House of Representatives arrived in Taiwan on Thursday night for a previously unannounced two-day trip, the second time in a month U.S. lawmakers have visited.
As with the last visit https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-opposes-us-legislators-visiting-taiwan-by-military-plane-state-media-2021-11-09, China's military announced the patrols in the vicinity of the narrow and sensitive Taiwan Strait that separates the island from its giant neighbour.
The People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theatre Command said that on Friday it ""organised naval and air forces to continue combat readiness police patrols in direction of the Taiwan Strait"". 
""The relevant actions are necessary to deal with the current situation in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan is part of China's territory, and defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity is our military's sacred mission.""
It gave no details.
Taiwan's Defence Ministry, as part of its daily update of Chinese air operations near the island, said that on Friday eight Chinese air force aircraft, including two nuclear-capable H-6 bombers, flew into Taiwan's air defence zone, though well away from mainland Taiwan and close to the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands at the top of the South China Sea.
CONGRESSIONAL VISIT 
China routinely denounces visits by U.S. politicians to Taiwan, and its foreign ministry said it had made a formal complaint to Washington about the latest trip by the bipartisan congressional group, saying playing the Taiwan card was ""a losing hand"".
Meeting Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen at her office earlier on Friday, the leader of the U.S. delegation praised the island as a ""force for good"" in the world.
""Madame President, I want to commend and praise your leadership. Under your administration, the bonds between us are more positive and productive than they have been for decades,"" said Mark Takano, chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, whose group was previously in Japan and South Korea.
""Our commitment to Taiwan is rock solid and has remained steadfast as the ties between us have deepened. Taiwan is a democratic success story, a reliable partner and a force for good in the world,"" he added.
The United States, like most countries, has no official ties with Taiwan but is the democratically-ruled island's most important international backer and arms supplier.
Congresswoman Nancy Mace, who is part of the delegation, tweeted that China's Washington embassy ""demanded we cancel the trip"" when news of it broke.

""We didn't,"" she added, and posted a picture of herself outside the U.S. Air Force jet that carried her to Taipei under the caption ""Just touched down in the Republic of Taiwan"", a term used by supporters of the island's formal independence.
China has stepped up military and political pressure on Taiwan to accept its sovereignty claims. Tsai has vowed to maintain peace with China, but that she will defend Taiwan if attacked.

The trip, which will take place between Nov. 29 and Dec. 2, comes at a time of rising tension between Russia and the Western military alliance following a build-up of Russian forces near the border with Ukraine.
While in Riga, Blinken will attend a meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and hold bilateral talks with NATO counterparts. In the Swedish capital Stockholm, ministers from members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will discuss concerns about the Europe-Eurasia region's security environment, the State Department said.

U.S., NATO and Ukrainian officials have raised the alarm in recent weeks over what they say are unusual Russian troop movements closer to Ukraine, suggesting that Moscow may be poised to launch a new attack on its neighbour, accusations Russia has rejected as fear-mongering.
Russia's intentions remain unclear, and East-West tensions are running high with Ukraine, Russia and NATO all conducting military drills and Moscow accusing Washington of rehearsing a nuclear attack on Russia earlier this month.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis, 84, joked on Friday ""I'm still alive"" when asked by French President Emmanuel Macron how things were going at the start of hour-long private talks in the Vatican.
A video released by the Vatican of the two before and after the talks in the papal library showed the two to be very friendly, with both laughing.
When the president sat at the pope's desk and asked how things were going, Francis answered in Italian ""I'm still alive."" He shortly later said ""perfect"" but it was unclear whether he was referring to the same question.
Francis was hospitalised for 11 days in July during which he underwent surgery to remove part of his colon, which had narrowed. It was the first time he had been hospitalised since his election in 2013.
A Vatican statement did not disclose what the two had discussed privately but said Macron's talks with top Vatican diplomats afterwards included climate change, Lebanon, the Middle East, Africa, and the forthcoming French Presidency of the European Union.
Shortly before the papal audience, Macron had told reporters he wanted to talk to Francis, among other things, about the equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, the Lebanon crisis and migration.
Macron earlier on Friday told Britain it needed to ""get serious"" or remain locked out of discussions over how to curb the flow of migrants escaping war and poverty across the Channel as Britain and France continued to trade blame over the death of 27 migrants at sea.
France is also taking a leading role to help Lebanon emerge from its crippling economic crisis.

The pope, meeting the prime minister of Lebanon on Thursday, compared the country to a dying person and promised to do everything in his power to help it ""rise again"".
Macron gave the pope a rare copy of a 1585 biography of St. Ignatius Loyola, the founder of the Jesuits, the religious order of which the pope is a member.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) -A Turkish court ruled on Friday that philanthropist Osman Kavala must stay in prison, extending his four-year detention without conviction in a trial which has further strained difficult relations between Ankara and its Western allies. 
The trial has been criticised as politically motivated and symbolic of a crackdown on dissent under President Tayyip Erdogan. The government rejects this and says Turkey's courts are independent.
Last month Erdogan threatened to expel the ambassadors of 10 countries, including the United States, Germany and France, after they echoed a European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruling that Kavala should be freed.
The prospect of further deterioration in Western ties added at the time to pressure on the Turkish lira, which has hit new record lows since September due mostly to interest rate cuts. The currency dipped slightly after Friday's ruling.
The court ruled by a majority of votes to keep Kavala in jail for the duration of his trial. It set the next hearing for Jan. 17, adding it would evaluate his imprisonment on Dec. 23. 
Kavala, who has been attending hearings via video link, did not participate in Friday's hearing.
His wife, opposition lawmakers, and diplomats from some of the 10 embassies involved in the row were in the packed courtroom in Istanbul. The square outside the courthouse was packed with dozens of riot police and water cannon vehicles.
NO 'FAIR TRIAL'
Deniz Tolga Aytore, Kavala's lawyer, said he supported his client's decision not to join the hearings, saying his right to a fair trial was being violated.
""We are being tried in political parties' group meetings, and judicial officials are not doing anything about this. Therefore our right to a fair trial is being violated,"" he said, referring to parties' parliamentary groups.
Kavala was acquitted last year of charges related to nationwide protests in 2013 focused on Istanbul's Gezi Park, but the ruling was overturned this year and combined with charges in another case related to a coup attempt in 2016. He has denied any wrongdoing.
Aytore said Kavala's requests to be freed had been denied over charges related to the 2013 protests, while his arrest was based on espionage charges related to the 2016 coup attempt.
He also listed inconsistencies in the allegations with reports by officials that refute the claims in the indictment.
Kavala, 64, is on trial with 51 others in a combination of three separate cases over the 2013 protests and the 2016 coup attempt against Erdogan and his government.
The ECHR called for Kavala's release in late 2019 over a lack of reasonable suspicion that he committed an offence, ruling that his detention served to silence him.

The Council of Europe has said it will begin infringement proceedings against Turkey if Kavala is not released. This could eventually lead to Turkey being expelled from the body.
Some European Union officials have said any deepening of economic ties with Ankara, including updating their customs union, is dependent on progress on human rights and the rule of law in Turkey.

PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) -French President Emmanuel Macron told Britain on Friday it needed to ""get serious"" or remain locked out of discussions over how to curb the flow of migrants escaping war and poverty across the Channel.
France cancelled an invitation to British Home Secretary Priti Patel to attend a meeting on the issue in Calais, underlining how fraught its ties with Britain have become, with post-Brexit trading rules and fishing rights https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/french-fishermen-block-boat-st-malo-brexit-protests-begin-2021-11-26 also at stake.
Boris Johnson's spokesman said the British prime minister was taking the issue ""extremely seriously"" and said he hoped France would reconsider its decision to cancel Patel's invite. 
The row erupted after the death of 27 migrants trying to cross the narrow seaway between the two countries, the worst tragedy on record in one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.
""I'm surprised when things are not done seriously. We don't communicate between leaders via tweets or published letters, we are not whistle-blowers. Come on. Come on,"" Macron told a news conference in Rome.
Macron was responding to a letter from Johnson in which the British leader told ""Dear Emmanuel"" what he reckoned should be done to stop migrants from making the perilous journey.
Johnson urged France in his letter to agree on joint patrols on its shores and consent to taking back the migrants who make it to Britain.
Infuriated by the letter, and not least by the fact that Johnson published it on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1463973204456878080/photo/3, the French government cancelled an invitation to Patel to attend a meeting on Sunday to discuss with EU ministers how to tackle immigration. 
'SPIRIT OF PARTNERSHIP'
Johnson does not regret his letter to Macron or publishing it on Twitter, his spokesman said, adding that he wrote it ""in the spirit of partnership and cooperation"" and posted it online to inform the public of what the government was doing.
Relations between the traditional allies are already strained, including by a recent submarines deal with Australia which replaced one it had with France, and they were already accusing each other of not properly managing immigration.
""We're fed up with (London's) double-talk,"" French government spokesman Gabriel Attal said, adding that Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin ""told his counterpart she was not longer welcome.""
Sunday's migration meeting will go ahead, without Patel but with ministers from Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium and European Commission officials.
""The (EU) ministers will work seriously to settle serious issues with serious people,"" Macron said. ""We will then see how to move forward efficiently with the British, if they decide to get serious.""
When Britain left the EU, it was no longer able to use the bloc's system for returning migrants to the first member state they entered.
UNHCR spokesman William Saltmarsh urged France and Britain to work together.
""Cooperation between the two countries, but also between the UK and Europe is extremely important,"" he said. ""It is important that there is a concerted efforts to try to crush the smugglers' rings, the smugglers have been very adaptive in recent months.""
The number of migrants crossing the Channel has surged to 25,776 so far in 2021, up from 8,461 in 2020 and 1,835 in 2019, according to the BBC, citing government data.

Rights groups say that while fighting people-smugglers is vital, France and Britain's migration policies are also to blame for the deaths, pointing to a lack of legal migration routes.
""The result of what happened yesterday, we can say it was because of smugglers, but it's the responsibility of these deadly migration policies above all, we see this every day,"" Marwa Mezdour, who coordinates a migrant association in Calais, said at a vigil in tribute to those who drowned.

The WHO, which has convened an experts' meeting on Friday to evaluate whether it constitutes a variant of interest or a variant of concern, will share further guidance for governments on action they can take, he said.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain said on Friday that a newly identified coronavirus variant spreading in South Africa was of huge concern, and considered by scientists to be the most significant one yet found as it could make vaccines less effective. 
The UK Health Security Agency said that the variant - called B.1.1.529 - had a spike protein that was dramatically different to the one in the original coronavirus that COVID-19 vaccines are based on.
The variant has also been found in Botswana and Hong Kong, and Britain has banned flights from South Africa and five neighbouring countries.
""There are no detected cases of this variant in the UK at this time. But this new variant is of huge international concern,"" health minister Sajid Javid told lawmakers. 
""We are concerned that this new variant may pose a substantial risk to public health. The variant has an unusually large number of mutations.""
Javid paid tribute to South African scientists for their openness and transparency. South Africa has said that Britain's decision to halt flights from the country seemed rushed.
Javid emphasised that there was much that was not yet known about the variant, but early indications suggested it might render vaccines less effective and be more transmissible, and he was concerned about a surge in cases in South Africa.
""One of the lessons of this pandemic has been the we must move quickly and at the earliest possible moment,"" Javid said.
Earlier, British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps defended a temporary ban on flights from South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Eswatini. 
""As scientists have described, (this is) the most significant variant they've encountered to date in their research,"" Shapps told Sky News. 

Flights will be halted until Sunday, when entry will be banned to all except British and Irish nationals and those with residency rights, who will have to quarantine in hotels.
Virgin Atlantic, which currently operates a London Heathrow to Johannesburg service, said flights were cancelled until Sunday and its schedule next week was under review.

The planes touched down in Erbil, capital of Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region, in the early hours carrying around 600 Iraqis, mostly Kurds, the Kurdistan government and officials at Erbil airport said.
Many of the passengers said they were relieved to be home.
""I don't want to go back along that route. It was bad, there was a lot of rain and snow,"" said 11-year-old Malak Hassan, whose family had tried to get across the Belarus border into the EU.
Awat Qader, from Kurdistan, said he had seen migrants beaten while he camped near the Belarus-Lithuania border, and that he would not try the journey again.
""We had to pay a lot of money even just to get back to Minsk"" from the border, he said.

The EU accuses Minsk of creating the crisis as part of a ""hybrid attack"" on the bloc - distributing Belarusian visas in the Middle East, flying in the migrants and pushing them to cross the border illegally. Belarus denies fomenting the crisis.

In a separate incident on Wednesday, 27 migrants died trying to cross the English Channel when their dinghy deflated, an echo of the 2015 migrant crisis when thousands of people fleeing war in the Middle East drowned on boats bound for Europe.
Iraq is no longer at war since the defeat of Islamic State in 2017, but a lack of opportunities and basic services, as well as a political system most Iraqis say is corrupt and nepotistic, mean ordinary people see little chance of a decent life at home.

Thousands of migrants are stranded on the European Union's eastern frontier, in what the EU says is a crisis Minsk engineered by distributing Belarussian visas in the Middle East, flying them in and pushing across the border, an accusation Belarus denies.
Poland has been pushing back those trying to cross from Belarus and some who have made it through are kept in detention centres such as the one in Wedrzyn where they await a decision on whether they will be allowed to stay in Poland. 
""Yesterday there was what I think it should be called a rebellion. A group of over 100 migrants began demolishing the buildings in which they live, breaking windows, tearing out bars, destroying ... equipment, stools, bedding, beds, demanding either freedom or better conditions, a transition to Germany or deportation to Iraq,"" Wasik told public radio. 
Wasik said about 600 people were in the centre and many joined the group, but the situation was quickly put under control by the police and border guards. 
Stanislaw Zaryn, a spokesperson for Poland's special services, said in a separate radio interview that most of the men were from Iraq and wanted to head to Western Europe, mostly Germany. 
Poland's Border Guard said on Friday 217 people tried to cross Poland's border illegally from Belarus on Thursday.

CANBERRA (Reuters) -A night curfew will be re-imposed in the Solomon Islands capital Honiara after witnesses said Australian police began taking control of hotspots following three days of violent protests in the South Pacific island nation. 
The Ministry of Health said in a statement that city clinics were closed and urged ""all Honiara residents involved in arson, rioting, looting to please stop immediately"" after its ambulances were stoned.
Tear gas was deployed in Chinatown where looting and the burning of buildings had continued on Friday morning, a resident told Reuters.
A night curfew will begin at 7 p.m., the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force said in a statement.
Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare, who requested help from Australia, on Friday blamed foreign countries for stoking the violent protests, but did not name any.
Many of the protesters come from the most populous province Malaita and feel overlooked by the government in Guadalcanal province and oppose its 2019 decision to end diplomatic ties with Taiwan and establish formal links with China.
Malaita premier Daniel Suidani said in a statement this week that Sogavare had ""elevated the interest of foreigners above those of Solomon Islanders"" and should resign.
""I feel sorry for my people in Malaita because they are fed with false and deliberate lies about the switch,"" Sogavare told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
""These very countries that are now influencing Malaita are the countries that don't want ties with the People's Republic of China.""
China and Taiwan have been rivals in the South Pacific for decades with some island nations switching allegiances.
China views Taiwan as a wayward province with no right to state-to-state ties, which the government in Taipei hotly disputes. Only 15 countries maintain formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan. The last two to ditch Taipei in favour of Beijing were the Solomon Islands and Kiribati in September 2019.
Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said in a statement to Reuters: “We have nothing to do with the unrest”.
China is concerned about the developments in the Solomon Islands, Zhao Lijiang, a spokesman at the Chinese foreign ministry, told a regular news conference. 
""Facts have proven that the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Solomon Islands is in line with the fundamental and long-term development of the Solomon Islands,"" Zhao said. ""Any attempt to undermine the normal development of China-Solomon Islands relations would be futile.""
'CHAOTIC'
Solomon Island resident Transform Aqorau said more than a hundred people were on Friday looting shops, before Australian Federal Police officers arrived.
""The scenes here are really chaotic. It is like a war zone,” Aqorau told Reuters by telephone on Friday morning.
""There is no public transport and it is a struggle with the heat and the smoke. Buildings are still burning.""
He said later Australian police were ""taking control of Chinatown"".
Neighbouring Papua New Guinea also sent 35 police and security officers to Honiara on Friday. 
Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said Australia was sending 100 police personnel and was ""clearly focused on stability in our region"".

Australian police were previously deployed to the Solomon Islands in 2003 under a peace keeping mission authorised by a Pacific Island Forum declaration and stayed for a decade. 
Severe internal unrest and armed conflict from 1998 to 2003 involved militant groups from Guadalcanal and the neighbouring island of Malaita, and fighting on the outskirts of Honiara.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain on Thursday said it was concerned by a newly identified coronavirus variant spreading in South Africa that might make vaccines less effective and imperil efforts to fight the pandemic.
The UK Health Security Agency said the variant, which is called B.1.1.529, has a spike protein that was dramatically different to the one in the original coronavirus that COVID-19 vaccines are based on.
""This is the most significant variant we have encountered to date and urgent research is underway to learn more about its transmissibility, severity and vaccine-susceptibility,"" UKHSA Chief Executive Jenny Harries said.
The variant was first identified at the start of this week, but Britain rushed to introduce travel restrictions on South Africa and five neighbouring countries, acting much more swiftly than with the currently dominant Delta variant.
""What we do know is there's a significant number of mutations, perhaps double the number of mutations that we have seen in the Delta variant,"" Health Secretary Sajid Javid told broadcasters.
""And that would suggest that it may well be more transmissible and the current vaccines that we have may well be less effective.""
Britain announced it was temporarily banning flights from South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Eswatini from 1200 GMT on Friday, and that returning British travellers from those destinations would have to quarantine.
Javid said more data on the variant was needed, but the travel restrictions were necessary as a precaution. 
Scientists said lab studies were needed to assess the likelihood of the mutations resulting in greatly reduced vaccine efficacy. 
Earlier on Thursday, South African scientists said they had detected the new COVID-19 variant in small numbers and were working to understand its potential implications.
The variant has also been found in Botswana and Hong Kong, but the UK Health Security Agency said no cases of it had been detected in Britain.
Imperial College London epidemiologist Neil Ferguson said that B.1.1.529 had an ""unprecedented"" number of mutations in the spike protein and was driving a recent rapid increase in case numbers in South Africa.

""The government’s move to restrict travel with South Africa is, therefore, prudent,"" he said.
""However, we do not yet have reliable estimates of the extent to which B.1.1.529 might be either more transmissible or more resistant to vaccines, so it is too early to be able to provide an evidence-based assessment of the risk it poses.""

CANBERRA (Reuters) -China's ""alarming"" actions do not match its rhetoric about promoting peace and prosperity in the region, Australia's defence minister said on Friday after a Chinese navy ship was tracked sailing through the country's exclusive economic zone.
Defence Minister Peter Dutton listed China's militarisation of the South China Sea, recent aggression towards Taiwan and the introduction of a national security law in Hong Kong as examples of China's actions being at odds with its rhetoric.
""We're all familiar with the frequent claims of the Chinese government that it is committed to peace, cooperation and development,"" Dutton said in a speech in Canberra.
""And yet we bear witness to a significant disconnect between the words and the actions. We've watched very closely as the Chinese government has engaged in increasingly alarming activities.""
The Chinese embassy in Canberra said Dutton had distorted China’s foreign policy, misled the Australian people and was ""fanning conflict and division between peoples and nations"".
""It is inconceivable that China-Australia relationship will take on a good momentum... if the Australian government bases its national strategy on such visionless analysis and outdated mentality,"" it said in a statement.
Relations between Australia and its biggest export market reached a low in 2020 when Canberra backed a United Nations inquiry into the origins of COVID-19, which was first recorded in China.
China responded by cutting off ministerial contacts and imposing hefty tariffs on Australian exports of wine, barley, beef, coal and seafood, effectively nullifying a 2015 free trade agreement. Australia and its ally the United States branded the move ""economic coercion"".
The latest exchange of barbs came as Australia confirmed it had monitored a Chinese intelligence ship sailing in August inside Australia's exclusive economic zone but not in Australian territorial waters.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the ship - the second of its type monitored off the Australian coast in as many months - was travelling legally.
""But don't think for a second that we weren't keeping our eye on them, as they were seeking to keep an eye on us,"" Morrison told reporters in Adelaide.

""What it demonstrates is now no one can be complacent about the situation in the Indo-Pacific."" 
In September, a new security pact between Australia, the United States and Britain, dubbed AUKUS, was widely viewed as an attempt to shore up regional military muscle in the face of China's growing presence. China called AUKUS a danger to world peace.

DUNKIRK, France/ZAGREB (Reuters) -France pledged on Thursday to step up surveillance of its northern shores, but migrants huddling in makeshift camps said neither that nor a tragic drowning the day before would stop them from trying to cross the Channel to Britain. 
Seventeen men, seven women and three teenagers died on Wednesday when their dinghy deflated in the Channel, one of many such risky journeys attempted in small, overloaded boats by people fleeing poverty and war in Afghanistan, Iraq and beyond.
The deaths deepened animosity between Britain and France, already at odds over Brexit. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said France was at fault and French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin accused Britain of ""bad immigration management"".
President Emmanuel Macron defended Paris's actions but said France was merely a transit country for many migrants and more European cooperation was needed to tackle illegal immigration.
""I will ... say very clearly that our security forces are mobilised day and night,"" Macron said during a visit to the Croatian capital Zagreb, promising ""maximum mobilisation"" of French forces, with reservists and drones watching the coast.
""But above all, we need to seriously strengthen cooperation ... with Belgium, the Netherlands, Britain and the European Commission."" 
Johnson later on Thursday announced that he had offered to meet Macron and other European leaders to discuss five steps that he said could reduce the crossings.
They included joint patrols to prevent more boats from leaving French beaches from as soon as next week, using sensors and radar and immediate work on a returns agreement with France and a similar deal with the European Union, Johnson said.
""This would have an immediate effect and would significantly reduce - if not stop - the crossings, saving lives, by fundamentally breaking the business model of the criminal gangs,"" Johnson said in a letter that he sent to Macron and published on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
When Britain left the EU, it was no longer able to use the bloc's system for returning migrants to the first member state they entered.
'MAYBE WE DIE'
Wednesday's was the worst such incident on record in the waterway separating Britain and France, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.
But migrants in a small makeshift camp on the outskirts of Dunkirk, near the seashore, said they would keep trying to reach Britain, whatever the risks https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/choosing-between-bad-worse-migrants-dilemma-after-channel-tragedy-2021-11-25. 
""Yesterday is sad and it is scary but we have to go by boat, there is no other way,"" said 28-year old Manzar, a Kurd from Iran, huddled by a fire alongside a few friends. 
""Maybe it's dangerous, maybe we die, but maybe it will be safe. We have to try our chance. It's a risk, we already know it is a risk."" Manzar said he had left Iran six months ago and arrived in France 20 days ago, after walking across Europe.
Britain repeated an offer to have joint British-French patrols off the French coast near Calais. 
Paris has resisted such calls and it is unclear whether it will change its mind five months before a presidential election in which migration and security are important topics. 
Migration is also a sensitive issue in Britain, where Brexit campaigners told voters that leaving the European Union would mean regaining control of borders. London has in the past threatened to cut financial support for France's border policing if it fails to stem the flow of migrants.
British interior minister Priti Patel is due to meet her counterparts from France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany on Sunday in Calais. 
Johnson said in his letter to Macron that he was ready to upgrade the meeting into a leaders' summit.
Patel was sending officials to Paris on Friday.
EU Migration Commissioner Ylva Johansson said she would offer France financial help and assistance from the bloc's border force, Frontex.

Rescue volunteers and rights groups said drownings were to be expected as smugglers and migrants take more risks to avoid a growing police presence.
""To accuse only the smugglers is to hide the responsibility of the French and British authorities,"" the Auberge de Migrants NGO said.
It and other groups https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britains-channel-graveyard-will-swallow-more-migrants-charities-say-2021-11-25 pointed to a lack of legal migration routes and added security at the Eurotunnel undersea rail link, which has pushed migrants to try the perilous sea crossing.
Johnson's spokesperson said providing a safe route for migrants to claim asylum from France would only add to the incentives for people to make dangerous journeys.

The number of migrants crossing the Channel has surged to 25,776 so far in 2021, up from 8,461 in 2020 and 1,835 in 2019, according to the BBC, citing government data.
Before Wednesday's disaster, 14 people had drowned this year trying to reach Britain, a French official said. In 2020, seven people died and two disappeared, while in 2019 four died.

315,"<span>Nov 25, 2021 09:01PM ET</span>","JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) -South African scientists have detected a new COVID-19 variant in small numbers and are working to understand its potential implications, they said on Thursday.
The variant - called B.1.1.529 - has a ""very unusual constellation"" of mutations, which are concerning because they could help it evade the body's immune response and make it more transmissible, scientists told reporters at a news conference.
Early signs from diagnostic laboratories suggest the variant has rapidly increased in the most populated province of Gauteng and may already be present in the country's other eight provinces, they said.
In a regular daily update on confirmed cases countrywide, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) later reported 2,465 new COVID-19 infections, slightly less than double the previous day's infections. The NICD did not attribute the latest resurgence to the new variant, although some leading local scientists suspect it is the cause. 
South Africa has confirmed around 100 specimens as B.1.1.529, but the variant has also been found in Botswana and Hong Kong, with the Hong Kong case a traveller from South Africa. As many as 90% of new cases in Gauteng could be B.1.1.529, scientists believe.
""Although the data are limited, our experts are working overtime with all the established surveillance systems to understand the new variant and what the potential implications could be,"" the NICD said in a statement.
South Africa has requested an urgent sitting of a World Health Organization (WHO) working group on virus evolution on Friday to discuss the new variant.
Health Minister Joe Phaahla said it was too early to say whether the government would impose tougher restrictions in response to the variant.
South Africa was the first country to detect the Beta variant last year. 

Beta is one of only four labelled ""of concern"" by the WHO because there is evidence that it is more contagious and vaccines work less well against it.
The country detected another variant, C.1.2, earlier this year, but that has not displaced the more common Delta variant and still accounts for only a small percentage of genomes sequenced in recent months.

TAPACHULA (Reuters) - Mexican officials have begun dispersing several hundred migrants gathered in the southern city of Tapachula by busing them to other states, heading off the prospect of a new caravan heading north.
The migrants, mostly from Haiti and parts of Latin America, had been in limbo in Tapachula in Chiapas state while enduring lengthy waits for asylum and visa requests to be resolved. 
Migrant rights activist Luis Carcia Villagran has called the city a ""prison"" because migrants were unable to leave without paperwork. Two groups of migrants had departed in mass caravans headed north in recent weeks, in part to raise visibility of their plight and demand a response from the Mexican government. 
The transfers out of Tapachula began Wednesday night with 120 Haitian migrants ferried to the states of Aguascalientes, Campeche and Durango, an official at Mexico's national migration institute (INM) said on Thursday.
More migrants are slated to be taken to Puebla and Guanajuato states, and will be able to continue their applications for asylum status and visas, the person added, speaking on condition of anonymity.
INM official Hector Martinez in Tapachula told migrants that 20 buses would leave the city today in total. 
Officials had begun similar transfers of migrants in the town of Mapastepec in Chiapas on Tuesday https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/caravan-migrants-accept-mexico-visa-deal-disperse-2021-11-24, dissolving a caravan that had left Tapachula several days before. The migrants agreed to leave the route and be taken elsewhere in exchange for Mexican visas.
In Tapachula, Haitian migrant Wilguens Antoine said he did not know where Mexican officials would take him, but was relieved to be leaving Tapachula, where he had no money to pay for lodging or take care of his family. 
""I'm happy, because I'm going to another city where I can work to help my family,"" he said, shortly before boarding a bus provided by migration officials. 

Villagran said some 600 people are expected to be moved out of Tapachula.
""This is a way to avoid mass movements of Haitians, Cubans and all the people who were prepared to leave tomorrow (in a caravan),"" he said.

Other U.S. cities hold parades, but New York's event has become part of the holiday tradition, televised across the country to some 50 million viewers ahead of their Thanksgiving meals, according to Macy's.
The giant, helium balloons depicting cartoon characters and toys are typically the main attraction, with this year's pageant adding newcomers such as Grogu, otherwise known as Baby Yoda from the Star Wars spinoff series The Mandalorian, and Ada, the young scientist from the Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) series Ada Twist, Scientist.
The classic Astronaut Snoopy once again appeared in this year's parade, the ninth version of the Snoopy balloon, according to the Macy's website.
In all there were 15 balloons guided by marchers holding tethers, the longest of which measured 72 feet (22 meters), Macy's said.
On the ground, between marching bands and dancers, 28 floats drove the 2.5-mile (4-km) route from Central Park West to the Macy's store on 34th Street, featuring fan favorites such as the Sesame Street Muppets, Miss America, and the rock bank Foreigner.

While strictly a television event for most of the country, in New York City it is one of the largest annual gatherings along with New Year's Eve, St. Patrick's Day, and the LGBTQ Pride parade. New York police do not give estimates of crowd sizes, but boosters of such events claim millions of in-person spectators.
Like the balloons, those numbers may be inflated, considering the entire borough of Manhattan's population is 1.6 million, in a city of 8.4 million.

Tehran is locked in several standoffs https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-still-denying-inspectors-essential-access-workshop-iaea-report-2021-11-17 with the IAEA, whose 35-nation Board of Governors is holding a quarterly meeting this week.
Then-president Donald Trump pulled Washington out of the 2015 agreement that lifted sanctions in return for restrictions on Iran's atomic activities. He re-imposed debilitating sanctions, after which Tehran progressively expanded its nuclear work and reduced cooperation with the IAEA.
Iran is denying the IAEA access https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iaea-chief-says-negotiations-iran-proved-inconclusive-2021-11-24 to re-install surveillance cameras at a workshop at the TESA Karaj complex. The IAEA also wants answers on the origin of uranium particles found at apparently old but undeclared sites, and says Iran keeps subjecting its inspectors to ""excessively invasive physical searches"".
""If Iran's non-cooperation is not immediately remedied ... the Board will have no choice but to reconvene in extraordinary session before the end of this year in order to address the crisis,"" a U.S. statement to the Board of Governors said.
It said it was referring ""especially"" to re-installing IAEA cameras at the Karaj workshop, which makes parts for advanced centrifuges that enrich uranium. 
That workshop was struck by apparent sabotage in June, which Iran says was an attack by its arch-enemy Israel.
One of four IAEA cameras installed there was destroyed and its footage is missing. Iran removed all the cameras after the incident. Israel has not commented on the incident.
IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said on Wednesday that he did not know if the workshop was operating again, and that time was running out to reach an agreement.

An extraordinary Board meeting would most likely be aimed at passing a resolution against Iran, a diplomatic escalation likely to antagonise Tehran.
That could jeopardise indirect talks https://www.reuters.com/world/us-wont-stand-idly-by-if-iran-gets-too-close-bomb-2021-11-24 between Iran and the United States on reviving the 2015 deal, which are due to resume on Monday.

The real-world data from the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in Britain support other studies around the world that the vaccines are safe to give at any stage of pregnancy, the UKHSA said.
It found that there were not substantial differences in rates of stillbirths, rates of births of babies with low birthweight and the proportion of premature births between vaccinated women and unvaccinated women.
Officials said the data were especially reassuring given that the first pregnant women to be offered the vaccine were those with underlying health conditions who would be expected to be at a higher risk of complications.
""Every pregnant woman who has not yet been vaccinated should feel confident to go and get the jab, and that this will help to prevent the serious consequences of catching COVID-19 in pregnancy,"" said Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at UKHSA.
The UKHSA data found that vaccinated women had a stillbirth rate of 3.35 per 1,000, slightly lower than the rate of 3.60 per 1,000 in unvaccinated women.
The proportion of women giving birth prematurely was 6.51% for vaccinated people, slightly higher than 5.99% for unvaccinated women.
The government is urging pregnant women who have not yet been vaccinated to get their shots.

The health ministry said catching COVID-19 came with much bigger risks than having the vaccine, adding that only 22% of women who gave birth in August were vaccinated.
It said that 98% of pregnant women in hospital with symptomatic COVID-19 were unvaccinated, and vaccine take-up was lower in deprived areas and some minority groups.

However, it will still take some time for a handover of power. Below is an overview of what happens next:
WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN AGREED AND BY WHOM?
The Social Democrats (SPD), ecologist Greens and pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) unveiled a vision of how to push through a green transition in Europe's biggest economy, speed up digitalisation and bring in some liberal social policies. 
The leadership teams presented the 177-page document on Wednesday after the agreement was hammered out by working groups in the last few weeks.
WHEN IS THE DEAL FINALISED?
All three parties have to ratify the deal. This is essentially a formality, as it is highly unlikely that members and delegates will reject it. 
SPD delegates are due to vote on it at an extraordinary party conference on Dec. 4.
The FDP plans to vote on it on Dec. 5.
The Greens are consulting their 125,000 members on the deal in a digital or postal voting process that will take 10 days.
WHAT ABOUT CABINET POSTS?
So far, only these posts are clear: 
The SPD'S Scholz will be chancellor
Greens Co-leader Robert Habeck will be vice-chancellor and lead a beefed-up economy ministry with responsibility for climate policy
FDP leader Christian Lindner will be finance minister
Remaining ministers are still to be named but the coalition deal states that the SPD will control a further seven cabinet posts, the Greens four more and the FDP a further three.
WHEN WILL GERMANY GET ITS NEW CHANCELLOR?

Scholz is expected to be voted in as chancellor by the Bundestag during the week of Dec. 6, some 10 weeks after the federal election.
This would mean Merkel falling just short of the record number of days in office held by Helmut Kohl of 5,870 days.

MOSCOW/KYIV (Reuters) - Russia staged military drills in the Black Sea, south of Ukraine, on Wednesday and said it needed to sharpen the combat-readiness of its conventional and nuclear forces because of heightened NATO activity near its borders.
Ukraine, which says it believes Russia may be preparing an invasion, held exercises of its own near the frontier with Belarus. An independent Russian investigative group posted photos and videos it said showed movements of tanks and other military vehicles in southern Russia in the past few days. 
The increase of military activity on both sides follows weeks of rising tension that have raised the risk of war https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/qa-what-is-risk-war-between-russia-ukraine-2021-11-23 between the two ex-Soviet neighbours, even though Russia denies aggressive intent and Western intelligence sources have told Reuters they do not see any invasion as imminent.
Ukraine is not a NATO member but the United States and the alliance have signalled their backing for Kyiv in ways that Moscow considers provocative, including through warship manoeuvres this month in the Black Sea and a delivery of U.S. patrol boats to the Ukrainian navy.
British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told Reuters it would be ""a grave mistake from Russia"" to attack Ukraine.
Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said the European Union must make it clear to Russia that there would be a high price to pay if it acted against Ukraine, urging the EU to quickly agree on how to deter Moscow.
In Wednesday's exercises in the Black Sea, Russian fighter planes and ships practiced repelling air attacks on naval bases and responding with air strikes, Interfax reported.
Separately, the news agency quoted Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu as saying the need for Russia to further develop its armed forces was dictated by ""the complicated military and political conditions in the world and the growing activity of NATO countries near Russia's borders"".
He said raising the armed forces' capabilities, supporting the combat preparedness of nuclear forces and strengthening the potential of non-nuclear deterrence are among the priorities.
Shoigu complained on Tuesday that U.S. bombers had rehearsed a nuclear strike on Russia from two different directions earlier this month, and that the planes had come too close to the Russian border. The Pentagon said these drills adhered to international protocols.
UKRAINIAN 'SPECIAL OPERATION'
Ukraine, which has tilted towards the West since a popular uprising ousted a pro-Russian president in 2014, on Wednesday held what it called a ""special operation"" at the border with Belarus, including drone exercises and military drills for anti-tank and airborne units.
It has deployed 8,500 extra troops to its boundary with Belarus, saying it fears being drawn into a migrant crisis which has seen the European Union accuse Minsk of flying in people from the Middle East and pushing them to enter neighbouring Poland. Belarus denies fomenting the crisis.
Kyiv also worries that the border with Belarus, a close Russian ally, could be used by Moscow to stage a military assault.
The head of Ukraine's military intelligence told the Military Times outlet last weekend that Russia had more than 92,000 troops massed around Ukraine's borders and was preparing for an attack by the end of January or beginning of February.
Moscow has dismissed such suggestions as inflammatory, said it was not threatening anyone and defended its right to deploy its troops as it wished.
The Conflict Intelligence Team, an independent Russian investigative group, posted video and photos on its website showing movements of tanks, infantry combat vehicles and howitzers this month near Voronezh, about 190 km (120 miles) from the Ukrainian border, and a new concentration of army vehicles at a training ground to the south of the city.
It also posted what it said was video evidence of military trains carrying infantry fighting vehicles and armoured personnel carriers in the past two days to Valuyki, 23 km from the Ukrainian border. 
The group said Russian troops had been arriving as well in Crimea, the peninsula seized by Russia from Ukraine in 2014.
It said its assessment was that Russian troops would be ready for potential operations inside Ukraine no earlier than the start of next year.
Intelligence sources, diplomats and analysts have told Reuters that Moscow may be using the escalation as part of a wider strategy to exert pressure in Europe, including by backing Belarus in the migrant crisis and parlaying its influence as the continent's top gas supplier into pressure for quick regulatory approval of its new Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany.

""It feels... more like another piece of coercive leverage that the Russians are heaping onto this strategic situation in Eastern Europe,"" said Samir Puri, senior fellow in hybrid warfare at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
""It may well have value in that alone, rather than having to be followed through with a full-scale invasion which would be politically disastrous for Putin.""

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Sweden's first female prime minister, Social Democrat Magdalena Andersson, resigned on Wednesday after less than 12 hours in the top job after the Green Party quit their two-party coalition, stoking political uncertainty.
But Andersson said she had told the speaker of parliament she hoped to be appointed prime minister again as the head of a single-party government, and the prospects of that happening appeared fairly strong given support from other parties.
The Green Party quit after parliament rejected the coalition's budget bill.
""I have asked the speaker to be relieved of my duties as prime minister,"" Andersson told a news conference. ""I am ready to be prime minister in a single-party, Social Democrat government.""
The Green Party said it would support her in any new confirmation vote in parliament, while the Centre Party promised to abstain, which in practice amounts to the same as backing her candidacy. The Left Party has also said it would back her.
While these parties were unable to agree a budget, they are united in the goal of keeping the Sweden Democrats, a populist, anti-immigration party, from having a role in government.
""The Centre Party will open the door for her (Andersson) to be prime minister,"" its leader, Annie Loof, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
""We will make sure, again, that Sweden can have a government that is not dependent on the Sweden Democrats.""
The opposition right-wing Moderates and Christian Democrats are backed by the Sweden Democrats, but cannot command a majority in parliament.
CHALLENGES
Andersson took over as prime minister from Stefan Lofven as head of a minority two-party coalition supported by the Left and Centre parties. But that alliance collapsed when the Centre Party refused to back the new government's finance bill.
Parliament then passed spending plans on Wednesday drawn up by three opposition parties, prompting the Green Party to quit the coalition and leaving Andersson no option but to resign.
The speaker of parliament will now decide the next step in the process of finding a new government, but will most likely put Andersson forward for a new vote in coming days.
""We expect the Left, Green and Centre parties to abstain in the upcoming vote and therefore effectively approve Andersson as Prime Minister again,"" banking group Nordea said in a note. ""In other words, the political chaos is over as long as nothing more unexpected happens.""
Whoever becomes prime minister faces major challenges, and a national election is due next September.
Gang violence and shootings blight life in many major cities.
The COVID-19 pandemic exposed gaps in the much-vaunted welfare state and the government needs to speed up the shift to a green economy if it is to meet its climate change goals.
The centre-left and centre-right blocs are basically deadlocked in polls.

The fact that it has taken this long for Sweden to get a woman prime minister is embarrassing for many in a country that introduced universal suffrage 100 years ago and has long championed gender equality.
Neighbouring Norway got its first woman leader 40 years ago. Sri Lanka was the first country to elect a woman premier in 1960.

PARIS (Reuters) -British and French officials traded blame on Wednesday after 27 migrants died when their dinghy deflated as they made a perilous crossing of the English Channel.
The accident was the worst disaster on record involving migrants in the narrow seaway separating the two countries.
The Channel is one of the world's busiest shipping lanes and currents are strong. Human traffickers typically overload the dinghies, leaving them barely afloat and at the mercy of waves as they try to reach British shores.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""shocked and appalled"" by the deaths and called on France to do more to deter people from attempting the crossing. People trafficking gangs were ""literally getting away with murder"", he said.
President Emmanuel Macron said Britain needed to stop politicising the issue for domestic gain, while his interior minister, Gerald Darmanin, said Britain too had to be a part of the answer.
France had earlier stated 31 people lost their lives, but the number was later revised down to 27, government officials said.
Two migrants were critically ill in hospital with severe hypothermia, Darmanin said.
French police arrested four human traffickers suspected of involvement in the accident. Darmanin said the nationalities and identities of the migrants were not known.
Regaining control of Britain's borders was a totem for Brexit campaigners ahead of the 2016 referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union and the flow of migrants, though relatively low in absolute terms, is a point of friction between London and Paris.
French President Emmanuel Macron said the EU's border agency Frontex should get more financial means to protect the bloc's external borders, thereby helping prevent migrants from gathering on France's northern shores.
Britain has in past weeks accused the French authorities of standing by while thousands of migrants leave their shores. France rejects the allegation. 
""France will not let the Channel become a graveyard,"" Macron said. 
FRIGID WATERS
More migrants than usual had left France's Channel coastline to take advantage of calm sea conditions on Wednesday, according to fishermen, although the water was bitterly cold.
At dawn on Wednesday, Reuters witnessed one group of migrants emerging from the sand dunes near Wimereux before piling into an inflatable dinghy. The same group was seen landing hours later in Dungeness, southern England, having safely crossed the 30 km stretch of water.
Before Wednesday's disaster, 14 people had drowned this year trying to make it to Britain, a local maritime prefecture official said. In 2020, a total of seven people died and two disappeared, while in 2019 four died.
Fisherman Nicolas Margolle told Reuters he had seen two small dinghies earlier on Wednesday, one with people on board and another empty.
He said another fisherman had called rescue services after seeing an empty dinghy and 15 people floating motionless nearby, either unconscious or dead.
Darmanin said the migrants' dinghy had deflated, and when rescuers had arrived it was ""deflated like an inflatable garden pool."" 
While French police have prevented more crossings than in previous years, they have only partially stemmed the flow of migrants wanting to reach Britain - one of many sources of tensions between Paris and London.
In his statement, Johnson said he and Macron had agreed to step up efforts to prevent the crossings.
Calais Mayor Natacha Bouchart blamed Britain for the problem, saying it should change its immigration policies. 

Some rights groups said tighter surveillance was pushing migrants to take greater risks as they sought a better life in the West.
""To accuse only the smugglers is to hide the responsibility of the French and British authorities,"" said l'Auberge des Migrants, an advocacy group that supports refugees and displaced people.

WIMEREUX, France (Reuters) -Bundled from the cold in black woolly hats and puffy coats, some in red life jackets, the migrants hauled the rubber dinghy on their shoulders and heads under a steely November sky, over the dunes towards the beach.
France says it is working hard to stop illegal crossings of the English Channel, which separates continental Europe from Britain, but there was no stopping the group of more than 40, including six children, who cast off from near Wimereux in northern France at daybreak on Wednesday.
Ahead lay frigid waters and some of the world's busiest shipping lanes. Twenty seven people drowned off the coast of northern France when their dinghy capsized in the worst disaster on record involving migrants in the Channel on Wednesday. But later in the day, Reuters witnessed the group that cast off near Wimereux being helped ashore in southern England by rescuers. 
The group launched their bid for Britain shortly after dawn. About 15 men carried the dinghy, walking towards the sea. Families trailed after with their children. Behind them men lugged an outboard motor.
One man held a young boy by the hand. Two others carried smaller children on their shoulders, while women carried belongings.
A French police truck headed towards the group, flashed its lights and circled the migrants in an apparent attempt to block their path to the sea.
A woman carrying a small child stepped in front of the vehicle and let out a wail. The police vehicle stopped. Soon after, it left to patrol another part of the beach.
With the police gone, the migrants scrambled over the sand to the shore, loaded the children onto the dinghy and pushed it out to sea. As a woman waded into the bitingly cold water, she confirmed where they were headed: ""Go UK,"" she shouted back to Reuters, before swinging a plastic bag containing belongings onto her head to keep it dry.
Waist-high in the surf, more people pulled themselves onto the dinghy, helped by those already on board. At last, the tiny boat was packed. Some of the migrants waved as they left the shoreline.

Hours later, they landed near Dungeness, guided by a rescue boat. 
A Border Force official helped one young child wearing a distinctive tartan-patterned coat seen earlier in France. The child sucked on a sweet as he walked slowly up the beach.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Even as Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai appeared on a video call with the Olympics chief, the former vice premier she accused of sexual assault has stayed silent and out of sight - maintaining the veil of secrecy that shrouds China's political elite. 
Zhang Gaoli, who turns 75 this month, was accused by the former Olympian in a Nov. 2 social media post of coercing her into sex three years ago. Peng said she and Zhang, who was vice premier when Beijing was awarded the upcoming Winter Games, had conducted an on-off consensual relationship until he broke up with her. 
Her post was deleted soon after it was published and the topic has been blocked online in China. But when she vanished from public view for nearly three weeks, international concern for her safety was ignited, accompanied by the #WhereIsPengShuai hashtag. 
Peng, 35, made a series of appearances over the past weekend, including a video call with International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach, but they have failed to dispel doubts among fellow athletes and global organisations over her welfare. Amnesty International accused the IOC and Bach of taking part in a ""whitewash of possible human rights violations"" by China ahead of the Games in February. 
Less attention has focused on Zhang, who retired in 2018 and like nearly all top Chinese leaders stays out of the public eye in retirement. He and the Chinese government have not directly commented on Peng's claims, which Reuters has been unable to verify. 
China's State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and has not commented on Peng's post or made Zhang available for comment. 
""Letting Zhang come out to speak will result in a reputational loss that it doesn't want just before the Winter Games,"" said Alfred Wu, associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore.
""Even if the party does decide to take internal disciplinary action against Zhang, they won't announce it right away, but will wait for the storm to blow over first, so as to show strength,"" he added.
TIANJIN BOSS
Zhang's last appearance was on July 1, when he was seated on the southern ramparts of the Forbidden City in Beijing for the 100th anniversary of the founding of China's ruling Communist Party. The site is not far from the Great Hall of the People where six years earlier he made a ""solemn commitment"" to a successful Winter Games at the Beijing Olympic Organising Committee's launch ceremony.
From 2007 to 2012，Zhang was the top political leader in the city of Tianjin. Under his watch, the once run-down provincial-level metropolis southeast of Beijing became China's fastest growing region in 2011.
As ranking vice premier from 2013 to 2018, he was in charge of economic matters, including President Xi Jinping's signature Belt and Road initiative, and headed a ""leading small group"" overseeing the Winter Olympics before handing over to current vice premier Han Zheng in 2018.
In 2016, he met with Bach himself, telling the IOC boss that work was being done to ""make sure the 2022 Beijing Winter Games are fantastic, extraordinary and excellent,"" according to a report on the English-language website of the Chinese government.
Peng alleged in her Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) post that she first met Zhang and had sex with him in Tianjin. She said that soon after Zhang retired, he got in touch again through a sports doctor and rekindled the relationship. 
""You stopped contacting me after you were promoted to Beijing. I had wanted to bury everything inside my heart. Since you don't intend to take responsibility, why did you still look for me, and force me to have sex with you at your house?"" she wrote. 
Peng also alleged in her post that Zhang's wife, Kang Jie, knew about the relationship. As with wives of most of China's political leaders, very little is known about Kang, including her age. The couple have a son. 
HISTORY OF SILENCE
Zhang's silence is consistent with how party leaders have dealt in the past with allegations ranging from corruption accusations in the Panama Papers to rumours of extramarital affairs, experts say. 
Making a sweeping campaign to root out corruption a hallmark of his nine-year tenure, Xi has demanded that party officials ""be able to pass the toughest tests"" of political, professional and family morals.
Zhang's only option is silence, according to Chen Daoyin, formerly an associate professor at Shanghai University of Political Science and Law and now based in Chile, where he has been closely following the case.
""If he denies, he won't be credible, because as a result of Xi's anti-corruption campaign, now everyone in China knows it is common for Chinese officials to use power for sex,"" Chen said.
Typically, accusations of sexual misconduct by officials are only mentioned after an investigation for political or economic crimes, almost added as an aggravating factor.
Having struggled to gain traction, China's #MeToo movement has come under fresh focus following the Peng case. No high-level party official has been similarly accused as Zhang. 
""The party sees itself as above the law and is not accountable to anyone other than its leaders,"" said Wu Qiang, a Beijing-based author, formerly with Tsinghua University. 

""If he admits to Peng's allegation, then Peng could become a symbol that China's feminist movement can rally around, which can potentially pose a challenge to the power of the party,"" said Chen, the former associate professor at Shanghai University of Political Science and Law.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The FBI said on Wednesday that dealing with the issue of ""anomalous health incidents"" - widely known as Havana Syndrome - is a top priority and that it will keep investigating the cause and how to protect staff.
About 200 U.S. diplomats, officials and family members overseas are believed to have been struck by the mysterious ailment - with symptoms including migraines, nausea, memory lapses and dizziness. It was first reported among U.S. officials in the Cuban capital in 2016.
""The issue of anomalous health incidents is a top priority for the FBI, as the protection, health and well-being of our employees and colleagues across the federal government is paramount,"" the agency said in a statement. 
It added that it would keep working with the intelligence community to ""identify the cause of these incidents and determine how we can best protect our personnel."" 
Sufferers and lawmakers have complained that U.S. agencies have not taken the illness seriously enough. 
""The FBI takes all U.S. government personnel who report symptoms seriously,"" the FBI statement said, adding it had messaged its staff on how to respond if they experience an incident, and where they can receive medical treatment.
Lawyer Mark Zaid, who represents Havana Syndrome victims, said historically the FBI had ""been less than helpful, particularly by claiming victims are suffering psychosomatic symptoms even though they never interviewed the individuals. ... I suspect that is about to change.""
To lead an agency task force on Havana Syndrome, CIA Director William Burns recently chose a career undercover spy who participated in the search that led to the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
A CIA spokesperson said: ""Director Burns made it a top priority to ensure officers get the care they need and that we get to the bottom of this. We’ve strengthened efforts to determine the origins of these incidents, including assembling a targeting team of our very best experts - bringing an intensity and expertise to this issue akin to our efforts to find Bin Laden.""

The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that during a recent visit to Moscow, Burns stressed to leaders of Russian spy agencies that it would be ""beyond the pale"" for foreign intelligence agencies to cause brain injury and other ailments to U.S. personnel and family members. 
A U.S. government source said agencies do not currently have a solid view of the syndrome's cause.

BRUNSWICK, Ga. (Reuters) -Three white men were convicted of murder on Wednesday for chasing and shooting Ahmaud Arbery as the Black man ran through their neighborhood, with a Georgia jury rejecting a self-defense claim in a trial that once again probed America's divisive issues of race and guns.
The verdicts were delivered by the jury of one Black man and 11 white men and women on its second day of deliberations after about a two-week trial of Gregory McMichael, 65, his son Travis McMichael, 35, and their neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52, in the coastal city of Brunswick (NYSE:BC).
The case hinged on whether the defendants under a now-repealed Georgia law permitting citizen arrests had a right to confront the unarmed 25-year-old avid jogger last year on a hunch he was fleeing a crime. Defense lawyers also argued self-defense centered upon a contested claim by Travis McMichael, who fired the fatal shots, that Arbery moments earlier had grabbed the pump-action shotgun that was used to kill him.
All three defendants were convicted of murder, aggravated assault, false imprisonment and criminal intent to commit a felony. They face a minimum sentence of life in prison with the possibility of parole. Defense lawyers said they will appeal.
President Joe Biden said the convictions showed that America's criminal justice system is ""doing its job,"" though the killing was ""a devastating reminder of how far we have to go in the fight for racial justice in this country.""
""Instead, we must recommit ourselves to building a future of unity and shared strength, where no one fears violence because of the color of their skin,"" Biden said in a statement.
There was never any dispute that the younger McMichael fired his shotgun three times at Arbery at close range on Feb. 23, 2020, in the suburban community of Satilla Shores. It was captured on a graphic cellphone video made by Bryan, stoking outrage when it emerged more than two months later and the public learned that none of the three men had been arrested.
Lawyers for the McMichaels argued that the killing was justified after Arbery ran past the McMichaels' driveway in a neighborhood that had experienced a spate of property thefts. Both McMichaels grabbed their guns and jumped in their pickup truck in pursuit, with Bryan, unarmed, joining moments later.
Prosecutors said the defendants had ""assumed the worst"" about a Black man out on a Sunday afternoon jog. He was chased by the defendants for about five minutes around the looping streets. A law cited by the defense had allowed anyone to make a citizen's arrest of individuals they have reasonable suspicion are fleeing a serious crime they committed. 
Arbery's name was added to those invoked in nationwide anti-racism protests in 2020 that erupted after the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, both of whom were Black.
""It's been a long fight. It's been a hard fight. But God is good,"" Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, said outside the courthouse. ""He will now rest in peace.""
Earlier, her head sunk into her chest as she wept upon hearing the verdict, with civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton gripping her hand. Arbery's father Marcus Arbery leapt up and cheered before sheriff's deputies told him he had to leave.
In reacting to the verdict, Marcus Arbery later told reporters, ""We conquered the lynch mob.""
There was jubilation outside the courthouse when the verdicts were rendered as a crowd of more than 100 people cheered and yelled ""justice,"" some waving flags including one for the Black Lives Matter movement.
""A jury of 11 whites and one Black stood up ... in the Deep South and said, 'Black lives do matter,'"" Sharpton said.
'I'M FLOORED'
Travis McMichael, looking red-faced, turned as he stood to leave the courtroom and mouthed ""love you"" to his mother, Leigh.
""I'm floored, floored with a capital 'F,'"" Laura Hogue, one of Gregory McMichael's lawyers, said in the courtroom.
The three men face a federal trial next year on hate-crime charges, accused in an indictment of violating Arbery's civil rights by embarking on the fatal chase because of his ""race and color.""
Wednesday's verdict followed a jury's Nov. 19 acquittal https://www.reuters.com/world/us/jury-rittenhouse-murder-trial-deliberate-fourth-day-2021-11-19 in another closely watched trial of an 18-year-old named Kyle Rittenhouse who fatally shot two men during racial justice protests in Wisconsin. Both cases highlighted the broader issue of U.S. gun violence that Biden has called a national embarrassment https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-house-faces-increased-pressure-act-guns-after-indianapolis-shooting-2021-04-16. In both, defendants claimed self-defense.
Travis McMichael, a former U.S. Coast Guard mechanic and the only defendant to take the witness stand, tearfully testified that he fired in self defense as Arbery grabbed the shotgun he was carrying while chasing him in the truck. Under cross-examination by a prosecutor, he conceded he told the police hours after the shooting he could not say for sure if Arbery actually grabbed the gun.
The trial represented another test case in how the U.S. justice system handles instances of unarmed Black people killed by white people. A nearly all-white jury was selected, and one of the defense lawyers repeatedly, but unsuccessfully, sought the removal of Black pastors and civil rights leaders including Sharpton and the Rev. Jesse Jackson from the courtroom.

The elder McMichael's lawyer, Hogue, told jurors during the trial that the defendants had a duty to catch Arbery, who she portrayed as a frightening burglar with ""long dirty toenails,"" using a description from the autopsy report.
Lead prosecutor Linda Dunikoski during the trial said the defense aimed to ""malign the victim,"" calling that ""offensive."" No evidence ever emerged connecting Arbery to any Satilla Shore thefts.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Biden administration and Mexico have not yet agreed to restart a Trump-era program obliging asylum seekers to await U.S. court hearings in Mexico, because certain conditions must first be met, two Mexican officials said on Wednesday.
News outlet Axios reported earlier that returns under the program officially known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) could restart as soon as next week. But one of the Mexican officials said agreement was unlikely to be reached this week.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement it was working to resume the program ""as promptly as possible"" but could not do so without Mexico's agreement.
The two Mexican government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said talks were ongoing to determine under what terms the United States could begin returns. 
Mexico is insisting Washington provide more support against COVID-19 for migrants, such as vaccinations, more legal aid for asylum seekers, and acceleration of hearings for those taking part in the returns program, one senior Mexican official said.
The administration of President Joe Biden, who vowed to undo some of the hardline immigration policies of his predecessor, Donald Trump, ended MPP. The scheme makes asylum seekers wait in Mexico for hearings before U.S. immigration judges.
But a federal judge ordered the administration to restart the program, saying it had failed to follow proper regulatory procedure. The U.S. Supreme Court in August rejected an administration appeal against the lower court's ruling.
Late last month, the administration tried again to end the program, hoping to address the judge's concerns. But it also said it was moving to comply with the court's order.
Biden has been under political and humanitarian pressure on the immigration issue because of an increase in migrants at the U.S. border.
Immigration advocates argue the MPP program exposed migrants to violence and kidnappings in dangerous border cities, where people camped out for months or years waiting for U.S. hearings.
During bilateral negotiations, Mexico has sought to ensure that new returns are carried out in a more controlled fashion, and that particularly vulnerable migrants and unaccompanied minors are excluded, the Mexican officials said.
The two officials also said Mexico's government is trying to secure a U.S. commitment to provide additional support for international organizations that help look after migrants and shelters along the U.S.-Mexico border. When MPP was in place under Trump, a sprawling camp arose in the border city of Matamoros in a violence-plagued region of Mexico. 
In its report, Axios cited a Homeland Security official as saying the policy would initially be reinstated in El Paso, Texas, Brownsville, Texas, opposite Matamoros, and San Diego.
Axios said the Biden administration would give asylum seekers the option of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.

Although Biden has sought to reverse some Trump-era immigration measures, he has kept in place a sweeping expulsion policy initiated at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.
That policy turns most migrants caught crossing the border away without giving them a chance to apply for asylum at all.

330,"<span>Nov 24, 2021 04:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - A Georgia jury convicted three white men of murder on Wednesday for chasing and shooting Ahmaud Arbery as the Black man ran through their mostly white neighborhood in February 2020.

The prosecution was widely watched as another test case of how the U.S. justice system handles the killing of unarmed Black people by white people.
Here are some initial reactions: * U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement: ""Nothing canbring Mr. Arbery back to his family and to his community, butthe verdict ensures that those who committed this horrible crimewill be punished. While the guilty verdicts reflect our justicesystem doing its job, that alone is not enough.

As legal efforts continue to hold accountable allwho may be responsible, we hope the Arbery family, the Brunswickcommunity, our state, and those around the nation who have beenfollowing his case can now move forward down a path of healingand reconciliation."" * Stacey Abrams, former Georgia gubernatorial candidate,said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR): ""A jury believed the evidence of their eyes andsaw the meanness in the killers’ hearts. May this verdict bringa small measure of peace to #AhmaudArbery’s family and lovedones."" * Chris Carr, attorney general of Georgia, said on Twitter:""The loss of Ahmaud Arbery was a tragedy that should have neveroccurred. Today’s verdict brings us one step closer to justice,healing and reconciliation for Ahmaud’s family, the community,the state and the nation."" * Benjamin Crump, attorney for Arbery's father, said in astatement: ""After nearly two years of pain, suffering, andwondering if Ahmaud’s killers would be held to account, theArbery family finally has some justice."" * U.S. Senator Raphael Warnock, a Democrat from Georgia,said on Twitter: ""This verdict upholds a sense ofaccountability, but not true justice. True justice looks like aBlack man not having to worry about being harmed—or killed—whileon a jog, while sleeping in his bed, while living what should bea very long life."" * Congressional Black Caucus Chair Joyce Beatty said in astatement: ""This story - although devastating - is not new;we’ve seen this play out repeatedly. Vigilantes acting withracial animus take the lives of Black men and boys, and claimself-defense when confronted with the consequences of theiraction. Justice has been served. However, there is still much towork to be done."" * Andrea Young, executive director of ACLU Georgia, said ina statement: ""With their verdict, the jury rejected the vestigeof Jim Crow and the assertion of white supremacy that was at thecenter of this case."" * Congresswoman Nikema Williams, chair of the DemocraticParty of Georgia, said in a statement: ""While these verdicts areone step towards accountability, they will not bring back Ahmaudor the countless other lives we’ve lost at the hands of whitesupremacy.

BRUNSWICK, Ga. (Reuters) - The three white men found guilty on Wednesday of murdering Ahmaud Arbery as he ran through their Georgia neighborhood still face another reckoning: a federal trial in February that charges the men with targeting Arbery because he was Black.
It was a question that was only glancingly discussed in the state trial of Gregory McMichael, his son Travis McMichael and their neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan, at least when the jury was in the courtroom.
Benjamin Crump, a civil rights lawyer representing the Arbery family, said the federal trial represented a final opportunity to get to the ""crux"" of what he called a lynching.
""This was predicated on the color of Ahmaud Arbery's skin,"" he said outside the courtroom before the verdict was read in Glynn County Superior Court in Brunswick (NYSE:BC).
The courthouse stands just a few miles from where the three men chased Arbery on Feb. 23, 2020 and killed him with a shotgun. The men face life in prison at sentencing for the state murder conviction.
The family hopes that evidence of racist language allegedly used by Travis McMichael, none of which was shown to the Glynn County jury, will finally be considered by the justice system, Crump said.
In pre-trial motions, state prosecutors told the court that they had evidence of ""racial animus"" motivating the defendants. At a bond hearing, they said Travis McMichael, 35, had used racial slurs on social media and in a text message.
At a pre-trial hearing, an investigator recounted Bryan telling him he heard McMichael used a slur as he stood over Arbery's body, although McMichael's lawyers raised doubts about Bryan's reliability.
Prosecutors also decided against showing the jury the vanity license plate the younger McMichael affixed to his pickup truck in 2020. The plate includes the old Georgia state flag, which prominently incorporates the Confederate battle flag.
Americans are divided over whether such symbols of those who fought against the abolition of slavery are a display of Southern pride or of white supremacy. 
But none of that emerged in the trial's two weeks of testimony, even as race shaped public perception of the case, fueled in part by the repeated unsuccessful efforts of Kevin Gough, Bryan's attorney, to get Black pastors banned from the courtroom.
EVIDENCE IN FEDERAL TRIAL 
At least some of this evidence, however, may feature in the federal trial.
""You better believe that a federal judge is going to be willing to hear evidence of racial animus, including specific text messages, when racial animus is a key element of the charge,"" said Ayesha Bell Hardaway, a director of Case Western Reserve University's Social Justice Institute. 
The federal indictment charges the three men with hate crimes, saying they infringed Arbery's civil rights by chasing and killing him because he was Black, among other charges. It does not show what evidence prosecutors might present to convince a jury that racism played a role. 
The U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement that there may be some overlap in witnesses between the two cases but they were otherwise independent of each other.
The lawyers representing the three men in the federal trial either declined or did not respond to requests to comment.
There was a mix of reasons that the state prosecutors from the Cobb County district attorney's office ended up not showing the ""racial animus"" evidence to the jury. 
In one of its pre-trial motions, the prosecutors wrote they had made a ""strategic decision"" to not introduce some of the communications the defendants had with others that they indicated included racist language. 

Some legal observers noted that Georgia did not have a hate crime statute in place at the time of the crime. Given that none of the charges hinged on proving a racist motivation, prosecutors may have decided it was simpler not to try, especially after defense lawyers succeeded in striking all but one Black person from the jury.
""The prosecution in that community is not going to alienate that nearly all-white jury,"" Hardaway said. Knowing the federal trial was still to come may have given state prosecutors a ""level of comfort in terms of this isn't a one-shot deal,"" she said.

TAPACHULA, Mexico (Reuters) - Thousands of migrants in southern Mexico have accepted a government offer to quit a U.S.-bound caravan in exchange for Mexican visas, officials said on Tuesday night.
The caravan is one of two large groups of migrants, many from Central America and the Caribbean, that left the southern city of Tapachula in recent weeks to embark on foot on the long journey north toward the U.S. border with families including young children.
The caravan migrants who left Tapachula last week accepted a government proposal to ""begin the process that will allow them to regularize their legal status,"" according to a joint statement from the interior ministry and national migration institute.
By Tuesday, this group had progressed as far as the town of Mapastepec in the southern state of Chiapas, under the guidance of caravan organizer Luis Garcia Villagran from advocacy group Pueblo Sin Fronteras.
Garcia told Reuters that most of the migrants in the caravan had accepted the offer and officials would eventually bus them out of Chiapas, distributing them across 10 states. The government statement, however, listed nine states.
In exchange for the deal, the organizers agreed not to assemble more caravans in future, a Mexican migration official said later, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Caravan organizer Garcia denied that such a deal had been made, and the statement made no mention of it.
Migrants have repeatedly expressed skepticism about receiving documentation regularizing them in Mexico, and organizers say another caravan is already about to depart from Tapachula, a major migrant massing point close to the border with Guatemala.

Earlier, Garcia said the decision to offer transportation and visas to migrants was positive, after Tapachula had turned into a ""prison"" for migrants left stranded while waiting for paperwork that would let them freely transit the country. 
The Mexican migration official said an earlier group of migrants from Haiti and Honduras were taken to Guanajuato state about 1,000 km (620 miles) away on Tuesday.

333,"<span>Nov 24, 2021 03:11PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Three white men were convicted of murder on Wednesday in the shotgun slaying of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man who was chased while on a Sunday run in a mostly white neighborhood in Georgia on Feb. 23, 2020.
The jury found Travis McMichael, 35; his father Gregory McMichael, 65, and a neighbor, William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52, guilty of murder and other charges. 
All three defendants pleaded not guilty to the same nine counts: one count of malice murder, four counts of felony murder, two counts of aggravated assault, one count of false imprisonment and one count of criminal intent to commit a felony.
* Travis McMichael was convicted on all nine counts, including one count of malice murder and four counts of felony murder. 
* His father was found not guilty of malice murder but guilty on all other counts, including felony murder. 
* Bryan was found not guilty of malice murder but guilty of three counts of felony murder, one count of aggravated assault and one count each of false imprisonment and criminal intent to commit a felony.
Malice murder (one count each)
Malice murder is when a person unlawfully and with malice aforethought causes the death of another person. The decision to commit malice murder can come in a spilt second or be planned long before.
A malice murder conviction carries a sentence of life in prison with the possibility of parole, life imprisonment without the possibility of parole or the death penalty. In this case, the prosecution is not seeking the death penalty.
Felony murder (four counts each)
Felony murder occurs when someone commits a serious or inherently dangerous felony and someone else dies during the crime, even if that murder was not planned.
The classic example is when two people rob a bank and a teller is shot dead. Even if only one person actually shot the teller, all those involved in the crime, even if unarmed, are considered equally guilty.
It is punished in Georgia by either life in prison with parole or without parole or the death penalty. 
Aggravated assault (two counts each)
Aggravated assault in Georgia is defined as being an assault with the intent to commit another crime such as murder, robbery or rape and a weapon is used. It can be punished by one year in prison to a maximum of 20 years for each count.
False imprisonment (one count each)
A person commits the offense of false imprisonment when he or she violates the personal liberty of another, illegally arrests, confines, or detains such person without legal authority. False imprisonment is punished by one to 10 years in prison.

Criminal attempt to commit a felony (one count each)
It is a substantial effort to commit a specific felony crime. It is punished by one year in prison or up to half of the maximum period of time for which he or she could have been sentenced if the crime was successful.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -A spacecraft that must ultimately crash to succeed was launched late on Tuesday from California on a NASA mission to demonstrate the world's first planetary defense system, designed to deflect an asteroid from a potential doomsday collision with Earth.
The DART spacecraft soared into the night sky at 10:21 p.m. Pacific time on Tuesday (1:21 a.m. Eastern/0621 GMT Wednesday) from Vandenberg U.S. Space Force Base, about 150 miles northwest of Los Angeles, carried aboard a SpaceX-owned Falcon 9 rocket.
The launch was shown live on NASA TV.
The DART payload, about the size of a vending machine, was released from the booster a few minutes after launch to begin a 10-month journey into space, some 6.8 million miles (11 million km) from Earth.
Moments later the rocket's reusable lower stage flew back to Earth and safely touched down on a landing vessel floating in the Pacific in what has become a routine part of the cost-cutting launch sequence pioneered by SpaceX.
DART will fly under the guidance of NASA's flight directors until the last hours of its odyssey, when control will be handed over to an autonomous on-board navigation system. 
The mission's finale will test spacecraft's ability to alter an asteroid's trajectory with sheer kinetic force, plowing into it at high speed to nudge the space boulder off course just enough to keep our planet out of harm's way.
Cameras mounted on the impactor and on a briefcase-sized mini-spacecraft to be released from DART about 10 days beforehand will record the collision and beam images of it back to Earth. 
The asteroid that DART is aiming for poses no actual threat and is tiny compared with the cataclysmic Chicxulub asteroid that struck Earth some 66 million years ago, leading to extinction of the dinosaurs. But scientists say smaller asteroids are far more common and of greater theoretical concern in the near term. 
DART's target is an asteroid ""moonlet"" the size of a football stadium that orbits a chunk of rock five times larger in a binary asteroid system named Didymos, the Greek word for twin.
The team behind DART, short for Double Asteroid Redirection Test, chose the Didymos system because its relative proximity to Earth and dual-asteroid configuration make it ideal for observing the results of the impact. 
BUMPING ASTEROID MOONLET
The plan is to fly the DART spacecraft directly into the moonlet, called Dimorphos, at 15,000 miles per hour (24,000 kph), bumping it hard enough to shift its orbital track around the larger asteroid.
Cameras on the impactor and on a briefcase-sized mini-spacecraft released from DART about 10 days beforehand will record the collision and beam images back to Earth. Ground-based telescopes will measure how much the moonlet's orbit around Didymos changes.
The DART team expects to shorten Dimorphos' orbital track by 10 minutes but would consider at least 73 seconds a success. A small nudge to an asteroid millions of miles away would be sufficient to safely reroute it.
DART is the latest of several NASA missions of recent years to explore and interact with asteroids, primordial rocky remnants from the solar system's formation 4.6 billion years ago. 
Last month, NASA launched a probe on a voyage to the Trojan asteroid clusters orbiting near Jupiter, while the grab-and-go spacecraft OSIRES-REx is on its way back to Earth with a sample collected last October from the asteroid Bennu.
The Dimorphos moonlet is one of the smallest astronomical objects to receive a permanent name and is one of 27,500 known near-Earth asteroids of all sizes tracked by NASA.
Although all none poses a foreseeable hazard to humankind, NASA estimates many more asteroids remain undetected in the near-Earth vicinity.

The DART spacecraft, cube-shaped with two rectangular solar arrays, is due to rendezvous with the Didymos-Dimorphos pair in late September 2022.
NASA put the entire cost of the DART project at $330 million, well below that of many of the space agency's most ambitious science missions.

BRUSSELS/PRAGUE (Reuters) - Coronavirus infections broke records in parts of Europe on Wednesday, with the continent once again the epicentre of a pandemic that has prompted new curbs on movement and seen health experts push to widen the use of booster vaccination shots.
Slovakia, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Hungary all reported new highs in daily infections as winter grips Europe and people gather indoors in the run-up to Christmas, providing a perfect breeding ground for COVID-19.
New cases have jumped 23% in the Americas in the last week, mostly in North America, in a sign that region might also face a resurgence of infections.
The disease has swept the world in the two years since it was first identified in central China, infecting more than 258 million people and killing 5.4 million.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the EU public health agency, recommended vaccine boosters for all adults, with priority for those over 40, in a major shift from its previous guidance which suggested the extra doses should be considered for older frail people and those with weakened immune systems.
""Available evidence emerging from Israel and the UK shows a significant increase in protection against infection and severe disease following a booster dose in all age groups in the short term,"" the ECDC said on Wednesday.
Many EU countries have already begun giving booster doses but are using different criteria to prioritise them and different intervals between the first shots and boosters.
ECDC head Andrea Ammon said boosters would increase protection against infection caused by waning immunity and ""could potentially reduce the transmission in the population and prevent additional hospitalisations and deaths"".
She advised countries with low vaccination levels to speed up rollouts and warned of high risks of a further spike in deaths and hospitalisations in Europe in December and January if the recommended measures are not introduced.
World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, acknowledging that Europe was again at the epicentre of the pandemic, warned against a ""false sense of security"" over the protection offered by vaccines.
""No country is out of the woods,"" he told reporters, adding that he hoped a consensus can be found at a World Trade Organization ministerial meeting next week for an IP waiver for pandemic vaccines.
Sweden will begin gradually rolling out boosters to all adults, government and health officials said. Booster shots of mRNA vaccine have been offered to people aged 65 or above, with an eye to eventually extending the shots to other groups.
""We are faced with an uncertain winter,"" Health Minister Lena Hallengren told a news conference. ""You can contribute by staying home if you're sick or by getting vaccinated if you haven't already, and taking your booster when you're offered it.""
Slovakia reported its highest daily rise in cases on Wednesday when the government approved a two-week lockdown to curb the world's fastest surge in infections.
Restaurants and non-essential shops will close and movement will be limited to trips for essential shopping, work, school or medical visits.
""The situation is serious,"" Prime Minister Eduard Heger said, ""We got here because the (existing) measures were not observed.""
VACCINATION RESERVATIONS
Neighbouring Austria has already locked down this week for at least 10 days, becoming the first to reimpose such restrictions. It will also require the whole population to be vaccinated from Feb. 1, infuriating many in a country where scepticism about state curbs on individual freedoms runs high.
The Czech Republic reported its highest daily rise in infections, with cases surpassing 25,000 for the first time. The government is looking to institute mandatory vaccines for people over 60 and some professions, like healthcare workers.
Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on Wednesday the cabinet would debate more measures on Friday.
The Netherlands recorded more than 23,700 coronavirus infections in 24 hours, the highest number since the start of the pandemic, and the government will announce new measures on Friday.
Hungary reported a record 12,637 new daily COVID-19 cases.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, which opposes further lockdowns for fear of stifling the economy, launched a vaccination campaign this week, offering shots without prior registration.
Authorities in Russia, where daily coronavirus-related deaths are near record highs, said they were scouring social networks and media websites to find people spreading false claims about the dangers of vaccination.
France will announce new COVID measures on Thursday, while Italy is tightening curbs on people who have not been vaccinated, preventing them from going to cinemas, restaurants and sports events in new restrictions that come in from Dec. 6. 

Portugal, one of the world's most vaccinated countries, will give booster shots to a quarter of its population by end-January. Cases there reached a four-month daily high Wednesday.
Deaths remain far below January levels, however, and the infection rate is far lower than in most of Western Europe.

(Reuters) - Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, was running through a mostly white neighborhood on Feb. 23, 2020, when he was chased by three white men in two trucks and shot to death. The killing took place about two miles (3.2 km) from his mother's house near Brunswick (NYSE:BC), Georgia.
Here is the timeline of the case:
FEB. 23, 2020
Arbery left his mother's house before 1 p.m. on Sunday for a jog just outside coastal Brunswick, Georgia, his aunt, Thea Brooks said.
He crossed a four-lane highway into the Satilla Shores subdivision, lined with saw palmettos, old oaks draped with Spanish moss, and ranch-style homes with boat docks along the Little Satilla River.
About two miles (3.2 km) into his run, he passes Greg McMichael, who is in his driveway working on boat cushions. McMichael later tells police he thought Arbery might have been running from a crime. He yells to his son Travis McMichael to get a gun and they both give chase in a pickup truck, police reports say. They are then joined by a neighbor, William ""Roddie"" Bryan, in his own pickup truck, who videos part of the encounter on his cellphone.
After being boxed in by the trucks, Arbery is seen on video reaching for a shotgun leveled at him by Travis McMichael. Arbery is fatally shot three times, turns to run one last time, and falls prone on the street.
Glynn County police officers interview the McMichaels and Bryan, but do not file charges, following directions from Jackie Johnson, Brunswick Judicial Circuit's district attorney, a grand jury later found. 
Greg McMichael, a former Glynn County policeman, also worked as an investigator for Johnson.
Feb. 24, 2020
Johnson recuses herself from the case because of her connection with McMichael and informally hands it over to the Waycross Judicial Circuit. 
FEB. 27, 2020
Waycross Judicial Circuit's District Attorney George Barnhill formally takes the case, at the behest of Johnson, court records show.
April 7, 2020
Barnhill recuses himself from the case, telling his boss, Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, that he didn't realize his son had previously worked with Greg McMichael in Johnson's office.
Carr transfers the case to the Atlantic Circuit's District Attorney Tom Durden.
May 5, 2020
A Brunswick radio station, WGIG, is given a copy of Bryan's video of the shooting by an attorney and posts it online. It becomes widely distributed on the internet, sparking a national uproar. Within hours, Durden announces a grand jury investigation. The same day, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp orders the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) to take the case.
May 7, 2020
GBI investigators arrest the McMichaels, charging them each with murder and other crimes. This is 74 days since the shooting.
May 11, 2020
Durden steps aside and Georgia Attorney General Carr appoints Cobb County's District Attorney Joyette Holmes to lead the prosecution. Cobb is the fourth district attorney to take the case.
May 21, 2020
GBI agents arrest Bryan and charge him with murder.
On June 24, 2020
A grand jury formally indicts all three men on charges of murder, aggravated assault and false imprisonment. 
Nov. 3, 2020
Johnson, who had been the Brunswick Judicial Circuit's district attorney for 10 years, loses her re-election bid, following a grassroots campaign against her spurred by the Arbery case.
Sept. 2, 2021
Johnson is indicted by a grand jury, which accused her of ""showing favor and affection"" to the McMichaels. She is charged with violation of oath of office and obstructing a law enforcement officer.
She has told the media that she did nothing wrong and is currently out on $10,000 bond.
Oct. 18, 2021
The trial starts. It takes 13 days to seat a jury of 11 white people and one black person. All three men are being tried jointly.

Nov. 24, 2021
The trial ends with all three men being convicted of murder and lesser charges. Travis McMichael is convicted of both malice murder and felony murder. His father and Bryan are convicted of felony murder but found not guilty of malice murder.

Gregory McMichael, 65; his son Travis McMichael, 35, who killed Arbery with a shotgun; and neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52, have pleaded not guilty to charges of murder, aggravated assault and false imprisonment. The three white men told police they thought Arbery was running from a crime as he ""hauled ass"" past the McMichaels' home in the Satilla Shores subdivision.
They wanted to make a citizen's arrest, they told police. Arbery's family and their supporters say he was targeted because he was Black.
Here are some highlights of the trial before Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley of Georgia's Eastern Judicial District: 
Nov. 3: 
A jury of 11 white people and one Black man is selected in Glynn County Superior Court. It took almost three weeks because many potential jurors told the court they personally knew https://www.reuters.com/world/us/small-town-problem-arbery-trial-jury-selection-everyone-knows-everyone-2021-10-28 Arbery or know some or all of the defendants.
During jury selection, Kevin Gough, who represents Bryan, complained that the potential jury pool didn't contain enough white men over 40 without a college degree - people he called ""Joe Six-pack"" and ""Bubba.""
Prosecutors tried unsuccessfully to argue that defense lawyers rejected many potential jurors because they were Black, which the U.S. Supreme Court has long deemed unconstitutional.
Nov. 5:
The jury is seated, and opening statements https://www.reuters.com/world/us/murder-or-self-defense-jury-begin-hearing-case-killing-ahmaud-arbery-2021-11-05 were made. Cobb County prosecutor Linda Dunikoski told the jury that the defendants had deadly intent. She pointed to something the elder McMichael told police he shouted at Arbery: ""Stop or I'll blow your fucking head off!""
Defense attorney Rob Rubin, representing the younger McMichael, told the jury that the men were trying to make a citizen's arrest.
""It is a citizen's job to help the police, and the law authorizes that,"" Rubin said. ""When seconds count, the police are often minutes away.""
Nov. 10:
Glynn County Police Detective Roderic Nohilly told the jury that Greg McMichael said Arbery realized he was not going to get away.
""He was trapped like a rat,"" the elder McMichael told the detective a few hours after the deadly pursuit, according to an interview transcript read aloud in court.
Nov. 11
The jury heard recorded police calls and saw surveillance videos of Arbery walking around a vacant, half-built house, over the weeks and months before his death. The final visit was just minutes before he was shot.
The McMichaels told police they were aware of reports of an unidentified Black man wandering around the property.
Outside of the jury's presence, defense attorney Kevin Gough complained to the court that civil rights leader Al Sharpton, a nationally known Black preacher, was in the courtroom with the Arbery family.
Gough said his team did not want ""any more Black pastors coming"" into the Georgia courtroom, saying it might influence the jury.
Judge Walmsley said, ""I am not going to blanketly exclude members of the public.""
Nov. 16
After eight days of testimony and 23 witnesses, the prosecution rested its case after presenting evidence it said showed the defendants wrongly assumed the worst about a Black man jogging through the mostly white Satilla Shores neighborhood.
The state rested after the jury was shown graphic photos of Arbery's body and hearing testimony from the medical examiner.
Nov. 17
Travis McMichael, who shot Arbery, took the stand https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ahmaud-arbery-could-have-asked-defendant-help-defense-tells-georgia-jury-2021-11-17 in his own defense and testified, at times on the verge of tears, that he thought Arbery was a burglar and said Arbery tried to take his weapon.
""I shot him. He had my gun,"" Travis McMichael said. ""It was a life-or-death situation.""
He testified about his Coast Guard training on apprehending suspects in the line of duty, protecting high-value ships, and intercepting drug dealers or helping immigration officials.
Nov. 18
A prosecutor questioned Travis McMichael over apparent inconsistencies in the accounts he gave police of how he chased and shot Arbery.
McMichael said his statements to police that day were ""choppy"" because he was nervous and under stress.
""I just killed a man,"" he said. ""I had blood on me still. It was the most traumatic event of my life."" 
The defense teams rested their cases and jurors were told to return on Monday morning for closing arguments.
Nov. 22
In closing statements by the prosecution and the defense, the jury heard dueling accounts of whether the three defendants had any right to chase the unarmed Black man through their mostly white Georgia neighborhood and shoot him.

Nov. 23
Jurors heard final closing arguments from the prosecution, were given lengthy instructions by the judge and began deliberating on whether the three men were guilty of murder and other charges.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria is considering a transport subsidy for its poorest families to cushion the effects of an ""eventual"" removal of a petrol subsidy, Finance Minister Zainab Ahmed said on Wednesday.
Ahmed said on Tuesday the government planned to remove the petrol subsidy by the middle of next year and replace it with 5,000 naira monthly payments to the poorest families.
""I think the next set of questions are in the 5,000 naira transport subsidy that we are trying to work out to provide succour for the eventual removal of the (petrol) subsidy,"" she said.
The transport intervention will be for between 20 to 40 million people, for a period of six to 12 months, she told reporters after a cabinet meeting in Abuja.
The petrol subsidy was meant to end this June as per the country's 2020 budget. At the last revenue count this month, the subsidy cost the government 243 billion naira per month, which has been increasing consistently, Ahmed said.
Failure to end petrol subsidy will cost Nigeria 3 trillion naira ($7 billion) a year, she said, adding that the country is getting to a point where state-oil company, NNPC will remit virtually nothing to the government after subsidy payments.
""We are still in negotiation because it's still money that would have to come from the federation account,"" Ahmed said.
On Tuesday, the World Bank urged Nigeria to end its costly petrol subsidy within the next three-to-six months, improve exchange-rate management and speed up other reforms to boost growth.
Nigeria has fallen behind on implementing reforms started at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the bank said, adding that growth rates will lag those of other emerging economies, unless momentum is restored.
It projected Nigeria's GDP to grow 2.4% this year, after the economy grew just over 4% in the third quarter, its fourth consecutive quarterly rise, following the COVID-19-induced recession in 2020. 

The finance minister said the government wanted to expand the economy to a point where growth exceeds population growth. She said annual economic growth this year averaged to 3.3%, slightly higher than population growth of 3.2%.

VERSAILLES, France (Reuters) -France and Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema was found guilty of complicity in the attempted blackmail of a former international team mate over a sex tape on Wednesday and sentenced to a one-year suspended jail term.
The Versailles court also fined him 75,000 euros ($84,170) and ordered him to pay former team mate Mathieu Valbuena 80,000 euros to cover legal costs and 150,000 euros in damages together with his three other co-accused. 
Benzema's lawyer said he would appeal against the verdict.
Benzema, who had denied any wrongdoing, was not in court. He is due to play for Real Madrid against Moldovan side Sheriff Tiraspol later in the day.
""This outcome in no way corresponds with the reality of events,"" lawyer Antoine Vey told reporters afterwards.
Real Madrid declined to comment.
Earlier this month, the president of the French Football Federation, Noel Le Graet, said Benzema would not be excluded from the national team were he to be convicted and given the suspended sentence prosecutors wanted.
""The coach will always be responsible for his selection and Benzema will not be left out because of an eventual judicial sanction,"" Le Graet told Le Parisien. 
Prosecutors had argued that Benzema had encouraged Valbuena to pay a suspected group of blackmailers in order to keep the sexually explicit tape out of the public eye.
They said Valbuena received the first of several phone calls threatening to expose the tape in June 2015. Valbuena told the court it was clear the caller wanted money and that the blackmail attempt left him fearing for his career and place in the national squad.
Benzema was recruited by the alleged blackmailers to encourage Valbuena to pay as his teammate stalled, the prosecution had added.
Benzema had shown no goodwill to Valbuena and pretended to be have his best interests at heart, the judges said in their written ruling. Benzema had ""deliberately helped the authors of the attempted blackmail of Valbuena"", they added. 
Benzema and Valbuena both lost their places in the national team in the wake of the scandal, dubbed the ""sex tape affair"". 

Benzema, 33, who has played more than 90 times for his country, was recalled to the France squad for this year's European Championship.
Among Benzema's co-defendants were childhood friend Karim Zenati, who acted as an intermediary, and Mustapha Zouaoui, one of the suspected architects of the scam. All four defendants were found guilty in connection with the attempted blackmail.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration has invited Taiwan to its ""Summit for Democracy"" next month, according to a list of participants published on Tuesday, a move that infuriated China, which views the democratically governed island as its territory.
The first-of-its-kind gathering is a test of President Joe Biden's assertion, announced in his first foreign policy address in office in February, that he would return the United States to global leadership to face down authoritarian forces led by China and Russia.
There are 110 participants on the State Department's invitation list for the virtual event on Dec. 9 and 10, which aims to help stop democratic backsliding and the erosion of rights and freedoms worldwide. The list does not include China or Russia. 
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said the government would be represented by Digital Minister Audrey Tang and Hsiao Bi-khim, Taiwan's de facto ambassador in Washington.
""Our country's invitation to participate in the 'Summit for Democracy' is an affirmation of Taiwan's efforts to promote the values of democracy and human rights over the years,"" the ministry added. 
China's Foreign Ministry said it was ""firmly opposed"" to the invite.
""U.S. actions only go to show democracy is just a cover and a tool for it to advance its geopolitical objectives, oppress other countries, divide the world and serve its own interests,"" ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters in Beijing. 
The invite for Taiwan comes as China has stepped up pressure on countries to downgrade or sever relations with the island, which is considered by Beijing to have no right to the trappings of a state.
Self-governed Taiwan says Beijing has no right to speak for it.
Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) differences over Taiwan persisted during a virtual meeting earlier this month between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping. 
While Biden reiterated long-standing U.S. support for the ""One China"" policy under which it officially recognizes Beijing rather than Taipei, he also said he ""strongly opposes unilateral efforts to change the status quo or undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,"" the White House said.
Xi said that those in Taiwan who seek independence, and their supporters in the United States, were ""playing with fire"", according to state news agency Xinhua.
Rights groups question if Biden's Summit for Democracy can push those world leaders who are invited, some accused of harboring authoritarian tendencies, to take meaningful action.

The State Department list shows the event will bring together mature democracies such as France and Sweden but also countries such as the Philippines, India and Poland, where activists say democracy is under threat. 
In Asia, some U.S. allies such as Japan and South Korea were invited, while others like Thailand and Vietnam were not. Other notable absentees were U.S. allies Egypt and NATO member Turkey. Representation from the Middle East will be slim, with Israel and Iraq the only two countries invited.

The drills come at a time of high tension over Ukraine, with Ukrainian and U.S. officials voicing concerns about a possible Russian attack on its southern neighbour, a suggestion the Kremlin has dismissed as false. 
""About 10 aircraft crews and ships of the Black Sea fleet's Novorossiysk naval base... took part in this combat training event,"" Interfax cited Russia's Black Sea fleet as saying. 
Sukhoi fighter jets were among the planes rehearsing how to respond to enemy air attacks with training flights over Black Sea waters in cooperation with the Black Sea fleet, it said. 

Russia's Black Sea Fleet is based in Crimea, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Kyiv wants Russia to hand it back.
Ukraine, which has accused Russia of massing troops nearby and says Belarus could send migrants over its borders, on Wednesday launched an operation to strengthen its frontier, including military drills for anti-tank and airborne units.

The formation of the group comes after the government released a report in June, encompassing 144 observations, which said there was a lack of sufficient data to determine the nature of mysterious flying objects.
The new group, Airborne Object Identification and Management Synchronization Group, will be overseen by the Under Secretary Of Defense for Intelligence, the director of the Joint Staff and officials from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.
Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks said in a separate statement the presence of unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAP) in restricted airspace poses a potential safety of flight risk to aircrews and raises potential national security concerns. 

The new group which will succeed the U.S. Navy's Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force, will work to detect, identify and attribute objects, assess and mitigate any associated threats, the Pentagon said. 
The U.S. military have spent decades deflecting, debunking and discrediting observations of unidentified flying objects and ""flying saucers"" dating back to the 1940s.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) -New Zealand will keep its borders closed to most international travellers for a further five months, the government said on Wednesday, outlining a cautious easing of coronavirus border curbs that have been in place for nearly two years.
Along with its geographic isolation, the South Pacific country enforced some of the tightest pandemic restrictions among OECD nations, limiting the spread of COVID-19 and helping its economy bounce back faster than many of its peers.
But an outbreak of the highly contagious Delta variant earlier this year has forced a shift in strategy, with the main city of Auckland now only gradually opening up as vaccination rates climb. 
Fully vaccinated international travellers will be allowed to enter the country from April 30, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins told a news conference. The travellers will have to self-isolate for seven days on arrival.
Vaccinated New Zealanders and residence visa holders in neighbouring Australia can travel to New Zealand from Jan. 16, while vaccinated New Zealanders and residence visa holders most from other countries will be allowed in from Feb. 13. 
""A phased approach to reconnecting with the world is the safest approach to ensure risk is carefully managed,"" Hipkins said.
""This reduces any potential impacts on vulnerable communities and the New Zealand health system."" 
Travellers will no longer be required to stay at state quarantine facilities, he said, but other measures will be put in place including self-isolation, a negative pre-departure test, proof of being fully vaccinated, and a COVID-19 test on arrival. 
Pressure has been mounting on Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to reopen international borders ahead of the Christmas holidays so that expatriate New Zealanders could return home. 
Air New Zealand said last week it had cancelled about 1,000 flights to Australia due to border uncertainty.

Many industries have also campaigned to reopen borders more quickly as they struggle to fill job vacancies https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/new-zealand-unemployment-rate-drops-record-low-q3-2021-11-02.
New Zealand has recorded just over 10,000 COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began, and 40 deaths - far fewer than most comparable countries.

DUBAI (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates has held talks with the Taliban to run Kabul airport, going up against Gulf rival Qatar in a diplomatic tussle for influence with Afghanistan's new rulers, according to four sources with knowledge of the matter.
UAE officials have held a series of discussions with the group in recent weeks to discuss operating the airport that serves as landlocked Afghanistan's main air link to the world, the foreign diplomats based in the Gulf region told Reuters.
The talks demonstrate how countries are seeking to assert their influence in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan even as the hardline Islamist group largely remains an international pariah and its government not formally recognised by any country.
The Emiratis are keen to counter diplomatic clout enjoyed there by Qatar, according to the sources who declined to be name due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The Qataris have been helping run the Hamid Karzai International Airport along with Turkey after playing a major role in evacuation efforts following the chaotic U.S. withdrawal in August, and have said they are willing to take over the operations.
Yet the Taliban has not yet formalised an arrangement with Qatar, the four diplomats said. 
A senior Emirati foreign ministry official said the UAE, which previously ran Kabul airport during the U.S.-backed Afghan republic, ""remains committed to continuing to assist in operating"" it to ensure humanitarian access and safe passage.
Abu Dhabi also aided recent evacuation efforts.
The Taliban and Qatari authorities did not respond to requests for comment.
Two of the diplomats said the Taliban has also sought financial assistance from the UAE, though they added it was not clear if this was related to the airport discussions. 
The Emirati foreign ministry official, Salem Al Zaabi, director of international security cooperation, did not respond to a question on whether the UAE was considering providing financial help to the Taliban. 
AIRPORT INTELLIGENCE
One key issue that's still to be resolved between the Taliban and potential airport operators is who would provide security at the site, the four diplomats said. The Taliban say they do not want foreign forces in the country following their return to power after two decades of war.
Still, Qatari special forces are presently providing security within the airport's perimeter, the diplomats added, while Taliban special forces were patrolling areas outside.
So far countries have been reluctant to formally recognise the Taliban's government, accusing the group of backtracking on pledges to uphold the rights of women and minorities.
Yet Qatari officials have urged greater international engagement with the Taliban to prevent impoverished Afghanistan from falling into a humanitarian crisis. Gulf states have also voiced concern https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/gulf-arabs-jittery-about-taliban-takeover-may-seek-pragmatic-ties-2021-08-20 that the U.S. withdrawal would allow al Qaeda to regain a foothold in Afghanistan.
While there is little commercial benefit for any operator, the airport would provide a much-needed source of intelligence on movements in and out of the country, according to the four diplomats, who said that since the withdrawal many countries have lacked real-time information.
REGIONAL RIVALRIES 
Qatar and the UAE have had strained relations for years as they competed for regional influence.
The UAE, Saudi Arabia and their allies boycotted Qatar for over three years, cutting off political, trade and transport ties, accusing Doha of supporting terrorism - a charge that it denies. The dispute was resolved in January this year. 
Qatar has long been the gateway to the Taliban, with Doha hosting the group's political office since 2013 and negotiations with the U.S. in early 2020 that led to the withdrawal.
Last week, Qatari officials strengthened their position by signing an accord https://www.reuters.com/world/exclusive-qatar-act-us-diplomatic-representative-afghanistan-official-2021-11-12 to represent American diplomatic interests in Afghanistan.
The UAE has maintained ties with the Taliban too, according to two of the diplomats. They said the country had been home to some members of the group in recent years, including Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, who they added lived in the Sharjah emirate with his family from at least 2013. Stanikzai is now deputy foreign minister in the Taliban administration. 

Al Zaabi did not respond to questions on the UAE's relationship with Stanikzai. The Taliban did not immediately respond to queries on Stanikzai living in the UAE.
The Taliban said this month that the UAE had reopened its embassy in Kabul. The UAE has not commented.

(Reuters) -Russian troop movements near Ukraine have drawn concern from Kyiv and the United States that it might be considering attacking its neighbour. Here is a look at some of the questions that raises.
WHAT ARE THE TWO SIDES SAYING ABOUT THE RISK OF CONFLICT?
Russia denies threatening anyone and says it can deploy its troops on its own territory as it pleases. It has accused Ukraine and NATO of whipping up tensions and suggested Kyiv might be preparing to try to seize back two eastern regions controlled by pro-Russian separatists since 2014. Russia's foreign spy agency this week compared the situation with the build-up to a 2008 war in which Russia's forces crushed those of neighbouring Georgia.
Ukraine denies planning any such offensive and says Russia has more than 92,000 troops massed near its borders for a possible attack.
HOW LIKELY IS A RUSSIAN INVASION?
Reuters spoke to more than a dozen sources, including Western intelligence officials and Russians familiar with Kremlin thinking, and nearly all agreed that an invasion is unlikely to be imminent. A more plausible scenario, they said, was that President Vladimir Putin is using the credible threat of military force to signal that Russia is serious about defending its ""red lines"" on Ukraine. It has stated numerous times in recent weeks that it is not prepared to accept the supply of NATO weapons to Ukraine or any NATO military presence there, let alone the prospect of eventual Ukrainian membership of the alliance. Putin, these sources added, is adept at escalating and de-escalating crises - as he did in the spring, when more than 100,000 Russian troops gathered near Ukraine's border and subsequently pulled back. In this way, he is keeping Russia's opponents guessing about his intentions and reminding the West that Russia is a force to be reckoned with.
IF IT DID COME TO WAR, WHAT MIGHT THAT LOOK LIKE?
Russia's armed forces have 900,000 active personnel compared with 209,000 for Ukraine, an advantage of more than four to one, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). But Samir Puri, senior fellow in hybrid warfare at the IISS, said the real advantage for Russia was that it already has proxies fighting in the separatist war in eastern Ukraine, giving it the option to link up with them and extend the area already under their control. Were it to go for a broader invasion, he said, it could contemplate attacking from the north (from Russia and its ally Belarus), from the east or from the south (via Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014), with a naval assault on the cities of Odessa and Mariupol.
HOW PREPARED IS UKRAINE TO DEFEND ITSELF?
Ukraine is significantly stronger militarily than in 2014, when it lost Crimea to Russia without a real fight. It has advanced anti-tank missiles supplied by Washington, and could draw on U.S. intelligence support. But it would still face an overwhelming adversary - the Russian advantage in battle tanks, for example, is more than three to one.
""For Ukraine, the issue would be ... to resist as much as they can, pray for assistance from the West, and ultimately fight back,"" said Mathieu Boulegue, a research fellow at London's Chatham House think-tank. ""If Russia invades in full, the question for Kyiv will be to mount counter-insurrection-style warfare to make the cost of invasion tremendous for Russia.""
WHAT ELSE MIGHT DETER MOSCOW?
The West imposed sanctions on Russia after the seizure of Crimea and could add painful new measures, such as preventing it from pumping Russian gas through the newly built Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany. Putin would risk a complete rupture of relations with the West if he invaded. It is unclear how far NATO might come to the defence of Ukraine, something that would be fraught with risk for all sides. Ukraine is not a member of NATO, but doing nothing would leave the alliance looking irrelevant.

""This is the brinkmanship game that is playing out. Both in NATO in Brussels and in Moscow there will be calculations around where the escalatory steps could lead. If NATO was to deploy to fight ... the Russians would see this as an unbelievable escalation,"" said Puri. 
""Whether (Ukraine) ends up as a battleground I think is unlikely - but really that's the issue that Russia and NATO are fencing around at the moment in Ukraine.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Barbados, a former British colony, will next week ditch Queen Elizabeth as head of state, breaking its last remaining imperial bonds with Britain nearly 400 years since the first English ship arrived at the Caribbean island.
Barbados casts the removal of Elizabeth II, who is queen of Barbados and 15 other realms including the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and Jamaica, as a sign of confidence and a way to finally break with the demons of its colonial history.
""This is the end of the story of colonial exploitation of the mind and body,"" said Professor Sir Hilary Beckles, a Barbadian historian. He said this was a historic moment for Barbados, the Caribbean and all post-colonial societies.
""The people of this island have struggled, not only for freedom and justice, but to remove themselves from the tyranny of imperial and colonial authority,"" said Beckles, vice-chancellor of The University of the West Indies. 
The birth of the republic, 55 years to the day since Barbados declared independence, finally unclasps almost all the colonial bonds that have kept the tiny island in the Lesser Antilles tied to England since an English ship claimed it for King James I in 1625.
It may also be a harbinger of a broader attempt by other former colonies to cut ties to the British monarchy as it braces for the end of Elizabeth's nearly 70-year-old reign and the future accession of Charles, who will attend the republican celebrations in Bridgetown. 
Barbados's move is the first time a realm has removed the queen as head of state in nearly 30 years: Mauritius, an island in the Indian Ocean, proclaimed itself a republic but remained in the Commonwealth, an association of mostly former British colonies which is home to 2.5 billion people.
Buckingham Palace says the issue is a matter for the people of Barbados.
SUGAR AND SLAVES
Originally populated by waves of Saladoid-Barrancoid and Kalinago migrants, Spanish slaver raids forced Amerindians to flee. Barbados was unpopulated when the English first arrived.
The English initially used white British indentured servants to toil on the plantations of tobacco, cotton, indigo and sugar, but Barbados in just a few decades would become England's first truly profitable slave society.
Barbados received 600,000 enslaved Africans between 1627 and 1833, who were put to work in the sugar plantations, earning fortunes for the English owners.
""Barbados under English colonial rules became the laboratory for plantation societies in the Caribbean,"" said Richard Drayton, a professor of imperial and global history at Kings College, London who lived in Barbados as a child. 
""It becomes the laboratory for slave society, which is then exported to Jamaica and the Carolinas and Georgia after that.""
More than 10 million Africans were shackled into the Atlantic slave trade by European nations between the 15th and 19th centuries. Those who survived the often brutal voyage, ended up toiling on plantations.
While full freedom was finally granted in 1838, the plantation owners preserved considerable economic and political power might into the 20th Century. The island gained full independence in 1966.

Prince Charles, the 73-year-old heir to the British throne, will travel to Barbados for the ceremonies marking the removal of his 95-year-old mother as head of state.
Barbados will remain a republic within the Commonwealth, a grouping of 54 countries across Africa, Asia, the Americas, Europe and the Pacific that has always been a priority for Elizabeth, who heads it. 
Though its name will remain simply Barbados, its removal of the queen may well sow the seeds of republicanism further across the Caribbean, according to Drayton. 
""This will have consequences particularly within the English-speaking Caribbean,"" said Drayton, who pointed to talk of a republic in both Jamaica and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.
""The queen has had an enormous personal relationship to many of these countries and has shown her own commitment to the Commonwealth vision which she inherited from that imperial moment of the 1940s and 1950s, so I do think that in the wake of the queen's passing that some of these questions would become more urgent in places like Canada and Australia.""
The queen has made many visits to Barbados and, according to Buckingham Palace, has had ""a unique relationship with this, the most easterly of the Caribbean islands"".
The republic of Barbados will be declared at a ceremony which begins late in the evening on Monday, Nov. 29 at the National Heroes Square in Bridgetown. 

""The time has come to fully leave our colonial past behind,"" Prime Minister Mia Mottley said in a 2020 speech prepared for Governor General Sandra Mason, who will replace Elizabeth as Barbados' head of state after being elected president. 
""This is the ultimate statement of confidence in who we are and what we are capable of achieving.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's defence minister won a defamation lawsuit on Wednesday against a refugee advocate who described him as a ""rape apologist"" in a tweet, a small advance in the conservative government's effort to curb damaging commentary on social media.
Peter Dutton, an outspoken cabinet minister, experienced ""hurt and distress"" when shown the Feb. 25 Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post by a staff member, although his public profile would have meant most people viewed it as opinion rather than a fact, a federal court judge ruled.
The lawmaker was awarded A$35,000 ($25,000) in damages, a fraction of the maximum amount possible, after the judge found that Dutton had been defamed but his day-to-day life was not impacted by the now-deleted tweet.
The ruling marks another milestone in a campaign by the government to rein in what it has called a ""coward's palace"" of vindictive shared on social media. Earlier this year, former attorney general Christian Porter settled a defamation action against the Australian Broadcasting Corp over Twitter posts about a historic rape allegation which he denied.
Dutton's lawsuit against activist Shane Bazzi was over a midnight tweet on a day when the politician, who was then immigration minister, defended in media appearances his handling of a complaint about sexual assault inside parliament house.
Bazzi tweeted a link to a 2019 article in which Dutton suggested some refugees claiming to be rape victims were ""trying it on"" to be allowed into Australia, coupled with the sentence ""Peter Dutton is a rape apologist"".
Dutton was accustomed to the ""rough-and-tumble of politics"" but ""deeply offended by the tweet"", noting that Bazzi's account had a blue tick, indicating that he was a verified user, said the judge, Richard White in his published ruling.
The ""description of Mr Dutton as a person who excuses rape was no doubt a serious defamation"" but ""he did not claim to have suffered more serious consequences by reason of the publication of the Tweet or even that his hurt and distress had continued to the date of trial"", the judge added.

A representative for Dutton was not immediately available for comment. Bazzi said in a tweet that was he ""very disappointed with the outcome"" and would consider his options.

WAUKESHA, Wis. (Reuters) -The man accused of driving his vehicle into a traditional Christmas parade near Milwaukee made his first court appearance on Tuesday since the weekend rampage and was charged with homicide, as the death toll rose to six.
The death toll was raised after prosecutors said an 8-year-old boy had died, marking the first death of a child in the incident.
Darrell Brooks, 39, appeared in Waukesha County Circuit Court and the court commissioner set bail at $5 million. Authorities said Brooks deliberately drove an SUV through police barricades on Sunday and the annual parade in the city of Waukesha, about 20 miles (32 km) west of Milwaukee.
The high bail comes after Brooks was released from custody in another case after posting $1,000 cash bond on Nov. 11, an amount that the Milwaukee County district attorney's office now says was ""inappropriately low in light of the nature of the recent charges"" against him. 
Brooks on Tuesday was charged with five counts of first-degree intentional homicide, according to prosecutors, who said he has a criminal history in three states. The charges were set before the death of the 8-year-old was disclosed. Prosecutors said more charges were pending.
In addition to those killed, more than 60 people were injured.
Brooks, a Milwaukee resident, was arrested near the scene of the carnage on Sunday. Police have ruled out terrorism as a motive and said Brooks, who was out on bail from a domestic abuse case, acted alone.
Police were not pursuing Brooks when he drove his car through the parade route, but one officer fired shots to try to stop the sport utility vehicle, Waukesha police Chief Daniel Thompson said. 
The victims killed ranged in age from 8 to 81, and included some members of the ""Milwaukee Dancing Grannies"" parade group.
The injured included at least 18 children, who suffered facial abrasions, broken bones and serious head injuries and were taken to Wisconsin Children's hospital in Milwaukee. Some were listed in critical condition, officials said. At least two of the children have been discharged from the hospital.
""Our hearts are heavy over the loss of our grannies and volunteer,"" the Dancing Grannies said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Tuesday, adding that some of the injured members were in stable condition and one has been released from a hospital.
The incident drew the attention of President Joe Biden, who called the attack ""horrific,"" and Pope Francis. The Vatican sent a condolence message https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pope-sends-condolences-car-attack-us-christmas-parade-2021-11-23 to the Roman Catholic bishop of Milwaukee on Tuesday.
""The pope ""commends the souls of those who died to almighty God's loving mercy and implores the divine gifts of healing and consolation upon the injured and bereaved,"" the message said.
At one of several vigils and services on Monday, Jeremy Wittig, 39, an information technology professional, said, ""Waukesha is strong. That’s why we are out here.”
Video of the incident posted on social media showed a red SUV racing alongside the parade route and then into the procession, appearing to run over more than a dozen people before bystanders raced from sidewalks to help.
""I saw children who were run over,"" Brian Hoffman, 33, a Waukesha resident, recounted on Monday. ""I am still totally shocked.""

The $1,000 bail in the previous case was set after Brooks was charged on Nov. 5 with obstructing an officer, reckless endangerment, disorderly conduct and felony bail jumping in a domestic abuse case, prosecutors and state court records show.
Shortly before Sunday's attack on the parade, police received a domestic disturbance complaint involving Brooks and a knife, Thompson said.

(Reuters) - The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) has become the world's ""most effective"" human rights organization over its leadership on the Peng Shuai case and willingness to lose money to stand by its principles, said Kelley Eckels Currie, former U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues.
The whereabouts of Peng, a former tennis doubles world number one, became a matter of international concern for nearly three weeks after she posted a message on social media alleging that a former top Chinese government official had sexually assaulted her. She re-appeared over the weekend in Beijing.
The WTA, the main organizational body for women's tennis internationally, has called for a transparent investigation and assurances about Peng's safety and well-being, and has threatened to pull out of tournaments in China over the matter.
""If you had told me a week-and-a-half ago that the Women's Tennis Association was going to be the most effective and bravest human rights organization in the world I would have thought you were bananas but here we are,"" Currie told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday. 
""The WTA is essentially putting more than a billion dollars on the line over the life of a single member of the Women's Tennis Association.""
In 25 years of working in human rights, she had never seen any group ""actually put something on the line like this for human rights,"" said Currie, the former U.S. Representative at the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, nominated by then-President Donald Trump.
On Sunday, Peng held a video call with International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach, but the WTA has said this did not address or alleviate its concerns about her wellbeing.
The United States, France, Britain and prominent tennis players have all expressed concerns over Peng, a former Olympian.
It comes as Beijing is preparing to host the Winter Olympics next February. Global rights groups and others have called for a boycott of the Games over China's human rights record.

""The tennis season goes all year,"" said Currie. ""As long as players continue to express concern for her and this continues to be an issue with the WTA and they continue to raise her case, it will continue to remain in some kind of spotlight.
""It will be an issue at the Olympics and before that the Australian Open, and then Roland Garros and Wimbledon. Every time tennis does something and has an audience she will be there.""

BRUNSWICK, Ga. (Reuters) -A Georgia jury deliberated for more than six hours on Tuesday without reaching a verdict on murder and other charges against three white men who chased and shot Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man who ran through their mostly white neighborhood.
Jurors are weighing evidence from the more than two dozen witnesses called since the panel was sworn in two weeks ago. These included Travis McMichael, the only defendant to take the witness stand, who said he fired his shotgun at Arbery in self defense.
McMichael, 35, his father Gregory McMichael, 65, and their neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52, have pleaded not guilty to charges including murder, aggravated assault and false imprisonment for the killing in the coastal suburb of Satilla Shores on Feb. 23, 2020.
The jurors worked through lunch as they deliberated then asked to break for the night soon after 6 p.m. ET. The judge said they would resume on Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. ET.
Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley instructed the jury of 11 white men and women and one Black man in the law governing the case after lead prosecutor Linda Dunikoski delivered a final two-hour rebuttal to defense lawyers' closing arguments. 
Before deliberations began, Dunikoski asked jurors to find the defendants guilty of all charges and argued that the defense was seeking to blame the 25-year-old Arbery for his own death. 
""Standard stuff: Malign the victim. It's the victim's fault,"" Dunikoski told the jury. ""I know you're not going to buy into that. It's offensive.""
Explaining the citizen's-arrest law at the heart of the defense, Walmsley told jurors that someone can make a citizen's arrest of a person only if a crime has occurred ""in his presence or within his immediate knowledge."" 
The judge said such a warrantless arrest must occur ""immediately after the perpetration of the offense or, in the case of felonies, during escape."" Outside that timeframe, the citizen's ""power to do so is extinguished,"" Walmsley said.
The defense has argued that the defendants had a right and a neighborly obligation to jump in their pickup trucks and chase Arbery to detain him because they had reason to believe he may have been connected to previous property crimes that had left the neighborhood on edge.
The law was repealed after Bryan's cellphone video of the shooting caused outrage. No evidence emerged that Arbery ever stole anything on his frequent runs through Satilla Shores, a leafy cluster of homes outside Brunswick (NYSE:BC). He was killed with nothing on him besides his jogging clothes and sneakers.
Dunikoski said the men simply did not have reasonable suspicion of a crime necessary to detain Arbery, and that Arbery had a constitutional right not to answer the questions the men shouted from their trucks.
""You can't hold somebody so the police can show up, and go, 'Well he must have done something,'"" Dunikoski said. 
Dunikoski read from Gregory McMichael's interviews with police in which he said he had no idea what Arbery had been doing before running past the McMichaels' driveway.
Outside the courthouse, Arbery's parents said they expected jurors to convict the defendants. ""God has brought us this far and he's not going to fail us now,"" his mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, told reporters. 
The trial has underscored divisions among Americans over guns. A jury's acquittal in an unrelated case last week of a teenager who fatally shot two men during 2020 racial-justice protests in Wisconsin threw these differences into stark relief. In both trials, defendants claimed self-defense in fatal shootings.
'DIRTY TOENAILS'
In closing arguments, Laura Hogue, the elder McMichael's lawyer, sought to paint Arbery as a frightening, disgusting criminal with ""long dirty toenails."" The comments upset Arbery's parents, who said they were gratuitously rude, and angered scores of Arbery supporters who have rallied beneath the grand oak trees outside the courthouse.
Travis McMichael testified last week that Arbery tried to fight him by grabbing his pump-action shotgun. McMichael said he was in fear of his life.

Prosecutors noted that he told the police on the afternoon of the shooting he could not say for sure whether Arbery actually grabbed his gun. Dunikoski told the jury that inconsistencies in his accounts and with video evidence showed he lied on the witness stand. 
She said McMichael's pointing a shotgun at Arbery amounted to aggravated assault, and someone cannot claim self defense if they are committing a felony, nor can anyone use excessive force in their own defense.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Jon Batiste led the Grammy nominations on Tuesday in a best album field that spanned rap to jazz music and embraced newcomers like teen sensation Olivia Rodrigo and veteran Tony Bennett alike.
Batiste and Justin Bieber will compete for the top prize - album of the year - along with Rodrigo, Billie Eilish, R&B artist Doja Cat, singer-songwriter H.E.R, rapper Kanye West, Bennett's collaboration with Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift and rapper Lil Nas X. 
The Grammys, the highest honors in the music industry, will be handed out at a ceremony in Los Angeles on Jan. 31.
Nominees in each of the top three categories - album, song and record of the year - were increased to 10 from eight for the first time.
""Adding more nominees is a way to cast a wider net for more music, more artists and more genres,"" Recording Academy chief executive Harvey Mason Jr. said, announcing the change on Tuesday.
Eilish (""Happier Than Ever""), Rodrigo (""Drivers License""), Bieber (""Peaches"") and Batiste (""Freedom"") were among the 10 nominees for record of the year, along with Swedish band Abba's new comeback single, ""I Still Have Faith in You."" 
Swift, an 11-time Grammy winner, snagged a best album nod for her best-selling ""Evermore"" but was shut out of the other races, disappointing fans who felt she had been snubbed.
""NO PROBLEMS TODAY JUST CHAMPAGNE,"" Swift tweeted. ""SO stoked evermore has been honored like this.""
Rodrigo, 18, who burst onto the U.S. charts in January when her single ""Drivers License"" went viral, got seven nods, including best new artist and album (""Sour"").
Batiste, who also leads the band on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" scored nominations across the board, ranging from classical composition and American roots to his music video ""Freedom"" and album ""We Are,"" which was inspired by the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020. 
""WOW!! Thank you God!! I love EVERYBODY! I’m so grateful to my collaborators and to my ancestors,"" Batiste wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Rapper Jay-Z became the most Grammy-nominated artist of all time when he took his total to 83, surpassing the previous record held by music producer Quincy Jones. Paul McCartney added two nods to take second place with 81.
The Recording Academy earlier this year changed the way nominations and winners are chosen after allegations that the process was open to rigging and Canadian artist The Weeknd received zero nods.
Nominees this time were selected by all 11,000 voting members of the Recording Academy, instead of smaller committees whose names were not revealed. Winners are also chosen by the musicians, producers and songwriters who belong to the academy.
K-pop band BTS, which has yet to win a Grammy despite dominating the U.S. music charts for almost two years, scored a single nod on Tuesday for the performance of their top-selling single ""Butter"" in the pop group field.
West, who's had a contentious relationship with the Grammys, got five nods from his hit album ""Donda,"" which was dedicated to his late mother.

Bennett, 95, who has Alzheimer's disease, and Gaga got five nods for their Cole Porter duets album ""Love for Sale,"" which is expected to be Bennett's last.
The eligibility period for the Grammys ran from September 2020 to September 2021, meaning the new album by Adele will have to wait until next time.

OXFORD, Miss. (Reuters) - Just months before she was set to start law school in the summer of 1973, Barbara Phillips was shocked to learn she was pregnant.
Then 24, she wanted an abortion. The U.S. Supreme Court had legalized abortion nationwide months earlier with its landmark Roe v. Wade ruling recognizing a woman's constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy. But abortions were not legally available at the time in Mississippi, where she lived in the small town of Port Gibson.
Phillips, a Black woman enmeshed in the civil rights movement, could feel her dream of becoming a lawyer slipping away. 
""It was devastating. I was desperate,"" Phillips said, sitting on the patio of her cozy one-story house in Oxford, a college town about 160 miles (260 km) north of Jackson, Mississippi's capital.
At the time of the Roe ruling, 46 of the 50 U.S. states had some sort of criminal prohibitions on abortion. Access often was limited to wealthy and well-connected women, who tended to be white.
With a feminist group's help, Phillips located a doctor in New York willing to provide an abortion. New York before Roe was the only state that let out-of-state women obtain abortions. She flew there for the procedure. 
Now 72, Phillips does not regret her abortion. She went on to attend Northwestern (NASDAQ:NWE) law school in Chicago and realize her goal of becoming a civil rights lawyer, with a long career. Years later, she had a son when she felt the time was right.
""I was determined to decide for myself what I wanted to do with my life and my body,"" Phillips said.
U.S. abortion rights are under attack unlike any time since the Roe ruling, with Republican-backed restrictions being passed in numerous states. The Supreme Court on Dec. 1 is set to hear arguments in a case in which Mississippi is seeking to revive its law, blocked by lower courts, banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Mississippi has raised the stakes by explicitly asking the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, to overturn Roe v. Wade. 
Such a ruling could turn back the clock in Mississippi, which currently has just one abortion clinic, and other states to the kind of environment on abortion access that Phillips experienced nearly a half century ago. 
Large swathes of America could return to an era in which women who want to end a pregnancy face the choice of undergoing a potentially dangerous illegal abortion, traveling long distances to a state where the procedure remains legal and available or buying abortion pills online.
Mississippi's abortion law is not the only one being tested at the Supreme Court. The justices on Nov. 1 heard arguments in challenges to a Texas law banning abortion at about six weeks of pregnancy, but have not yet ruled. 
TRIGGER LAWS
Mississippi is one of a dozen states with so-called trigger laws that would immediately ban abortion in all or most cases if Roe is overturned, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.
Many are in the South, so a Mississippi woman would be unable to obtain an abortion in neighboring Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee or Alabama. The nearest states where abortion would remain legal, at least in the short term, would be Illinois and Florida.
The average distance a Mississippi woman would need to drive to reach a clinic would increase from 78 miles to 380 miles (125 to 610 km) each way, according to Guttmacher.
While some abortion rights advocates fear a return to grisly illegal back-alley abortions, there has been an important development since the pre-Roe era: abortion pills. Mississippi is among 19 states imposing restrictions on medication-induced abortions. 
Mississippi officials are cagey on what a post-Roe world might look like. Republican Attorney General Lynn Fitch, who asked the court to overturn Roe, declined an interview request, as did Republican Governor Tate Reeves.
Mississippi Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce Andy Gipson, who as a Republican state legislator helped shepherd the 2018 passage of the 15-week ban, called Roe v. Wade ""antiquated, old law based on antiquated and old science.""
Gipson in an interview declined to answer questions about what Mississippi - or the southeastern United States - would be like without abortion rights, focusing on the specifics of the 15-week ban.
""It's a false narrative to paint this as a picture of an outright ban throughout the southeast,"" Gipson said, noting that the Supreme Court does not have to formally overturn Roe to uphold Mississippi's law.
In court papers, Fitch said scientific advances, including contested claims that a fetus can detect pain early in a pregnancy, emphasize how Roe and a subsequent 1992 decision that reaffirmed abortion rights are ""decades out of date.""
Abortion rights advocates have said any ruling upholding Mississippi's law would effectively gut Roe, giving states unfettered power to limit or ban the procedure.

Phillips worries about a revival of dangerous, unregulated abortions that imperil women's lives.
""I'm afraid that many more women and girls will be in back alleys,"" Phillips said. ""I'm worried we are going to find them in country roads, dead.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A 19-year-old man has been arrested and charged with assault and other counts related to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol for allegedly attacking police officers with bear spray and breaking through a U.S. Capitol window with a baseball bat, the Justice Department said on Tuesday.
A criminal complaint filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., accused Aiden Bilyard of Cary, North Carolina, with seven riot-related criminal offenses, including felony charges of civil disorder and assaulting a police officer with a dangerous weapon. 
Bilyard was arrested Monday in Raleigh, North Carolina, and released after an initial court appearance in federal court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. Court records on Tuesday afternoon did not list a defense lawyer for Bilyard.
A mob of supporters of Republican former President Donald Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 in a failed attempt to prevent formal congressional certification of his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. 
According to a statement of facts by prosecutors, video shot by a Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police officer's body-worn camera on Jan. 6 shows Bilyard, wearing a gray Harvard sweatshirt and spraying a line of uniformed police outside the Capitol with an orange-colored liquid spray that investigators believe was bear spray.
Investigators said video taken later that day shows Bilyard with a group of rioters in front of a large Capitol window. After being handed a baseball bat by a fellow demonstrator, Bilyard shatters the window and ""then turns to face the crowd and appears to clap and shout"" to encourage rioters to enter the Capitol building.

Investigators said Bilyard then entered a Senate room through the broken window.
Nearly 700 people have been charged with participating in the Jan. 6 riot, and around 210 people have been charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding police officers or employees during the attack.

Afghanistan's Ministry of Vice and Virtue set out nine rules this week, a Taliban administration spokesman said on Tuesday, largely centred on banning any media that contravened ""Islamic or Afghan values"". 
Some edicts were targeted specifically at women, a move likely to raise concerns among the international community.
""Those dramas...or programmes in which women have acted, should not be aired,"" the rules said, adding that female journalists on air should wear ""Islamic hijab"" without defining what that meant.
Though most women in Afghanistan wear headscarves in public, the Taliban's statements that women should wear ""Islamic hijab"" have often in the past worried women's rights activists who say the term is vague and could be interpreted conservatively. 
The rules drew criticism from international rights watchdog Human Rights Watch (HRW), which said media freedom was deteriorating in the country. 
""The disappearance of any space for dissent and worsening restrictions for women in the media and arts is devastating,"" said Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director at HRW, in a statement. 

Though Taliban officials have sought to sought to publicly assure women and the international community that women's rights will be protected since they took over Afghanistan on Aug. 15, many advocates and women have remained skeptical. 
During the Taliban's previous rule, strict curbs were placed on women's ability to leave the house, unless accompanied by a male relative, or to receive education.

WAUKESHA, Wis. (Reuters) - Four of the five people killed by an SUV racing through a Wisconsin Christmas parade on Sunday were affiliated with the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies, a beloved pompom-thrusting dance troupe, according to a local newspaper.
Ginny Sorenson, 79, LeAnna Owen, 71, and Tamara Durand, 52, were members, while Wilhelm Hospel, 81, helped the group, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. 
The fifth victim, Jane Kulich, 52, worked at Citizens Bank, according to her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) profile. Her page included posts about the birth of a granddaughter, as well as pictures of family, nature and cats. 
The five were killed when a man out on bail from a domestic abuse case and suspected in another violent altercation earlier that Sunday rammed a red SUV through the parade in the city of Waukesha, roughly 20 miles (32 km) west of Milwaukee.
Tributes began to flow in for the victims on Monday, with the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies paying homage on Facebook. 
""Those who died were extremely passionate Grannies. Their eyes gleamed.....[with the] joy of being a Grannie,"" read the message. ""Our hearts are heavy at this most difficult time.""
Sorenson, a registered nurse, was the group choreographer and had been working with Grannies for some 19 years, according to a feature on the group published by CBS 58 over the summer. 
""She's like the heart and soul, honest to God,"" one dancer said of the grandmother of six. ""She keeps us on our toes."" 
In a photo posted in 2019, Sorenson, decked out in a fluffy white hat and thick blue winter skirt and coat, grins as she thrusts pompoms to one side and walks down a street. 
""Being an instructor, that's a really important part of my life, especially now where I can't dance,"" Sorenson told CBS 58, explaining that she had had surgery, without going into details. ""I love it. And I love the ladies. They're my family, they're my friends."" 
Footage showed the group practicing in a parking lot, wearing red skirts and wide-brimmed hats. ""You're all in sync,"" Sorenson called out. ""I told you, just like the Rockettes!"" 
Owen was another member of the group, which practiced once a week and performed at holiday events like July 4 or Christmas parades. 
""It keeps us young,"" Owen said with a laugh in the CBS 58 interview.
The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that Durand, 52, was also a member. 
""Tammy was a mother of 9, grandmother of 4, and an emergency, critical care, and hospice Chaplain. She was a shining light for Jesus and strong in her faith,"" wrote a Facebook user from the account of a Texas-based magazine, Neighbors of Lakeway & Bee Cave. 

The post said Durand's husband Dave Durand was the CEO and founder of Best Version Media, which specializes in local news outlets. The post was later edited to say Durand was formerly CEO. A spokesperson for the company told Reuters Durand is a co-founder and currently executive chairman.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives committee probing the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol issued five subpoenas on Tuesday to far-right extremist groups that have backed former President Donald Trump and to individuals associated with those groups.
The Select Committee said it sent subpoenas seeking testimony and documents to the Proud Boys group and to Henry ""Enrique"" Tarrio, who was its chairman, as well as to the Oath Keepers and its president, Elmer Stewart Rhodes.
The Democratic-led committee also issued a subpoena to Robert Patrick Lewis, chairman of 1st Amendment Praetorian, a lower-profile organization known for wearing black shirts and providing security at pro-Trump events.
""We believe the individuals and organizations we subpoenaed today have relevant information about how violence erupted at the Capitol and the preparation leading up to this violent attack,"" Representative Bennie Thompson, the panel's chairman, said in a statement.
The committee ordered the groups and individuals subpoenaed to produce documents and appear for testimony by mid-December.
The groups and individuals sent the subpoenas did not respond or could not be reached for requests for comment.
Thousands of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 in a failed attempt to prevent formal congressional certification of his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. The committee is scrutinizing Trump's actions relating to those events. 
Nearly 700 people have been charged with taking part in the riot at the Capitol. It was the worst attack on the seat of the U.S. government since the War of 1812. The Jan. 6 Select Committee has sent subpoenas to at least 45 people linked to the attack.
The committee said at least 34 individuals associated with the Proud Boys have been indicted by the Department of Justice in relation to the Jan. 6 attack. A federal grand jury indicted 18 members of the Oath Keepers for allegedly planning a coordinated attack to storm the Capitol, including by traveling to Washington with paramilitary gear and supplies.

The 1st Amendment Praetorian group provided security at multiple rallies leading up to Jan. 6 that the committee said amplified Trump's unsupported claim that his defeat by Biden was the result of fraud. It said Lewis tweeted on Jan. 6: ""Today is the day that true battles begin.""
Tarrio is serving a five-month sentence at a jail in Washington. He pleaded guilty in July to two crimes, including setting fire to a stolen Black Lives Matter banner late last year during a tumultuous demonstration after Trump’s election defeat.

Envoy Jeffrey Feltman briefed reporters in Washington after returning on Monday from Ethiopia, where he met Prime Minster Abiy Ahmed and discussed a potential diplomatic solution to the year-old conflict, which has killed thousands and displaced millions in Africa's second most populous nation.
Both Abiy and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), the political party controlling the northern region of Tigray, seem to believe they are on the cusp of military victory, Feltman said. 
""There is some nascent progress in trying to get the parties to move from a military confrontation to a negotiating process,"" Feltman said. ""What concerns us is this fragile progress risks being outpaced by the alarming developments on the ground that threaten Ethiopia's overall stability and unity."" 
Abiy's spokesperson, Billene Seyoum, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. TPLF spokesperson Getachew Reda could not immediately be reached for comment.
War broke out in November 2020 in Tigray between Ethiopian federal troops and the TPLF. In July, the conflict spread into two neighboring regions in northern Ethiopia.
Feltman said both sides were talking to the United States about beginning a discreet peace process, and said that the key desires of both sides were not mutually exclusive.
The TPLF wants what the U.N. calls a ""de facto government blockade"" to be lifted and humanitarian aid to be allowed into Tigray, where 400,000 people are living in famine; Abiy wants the Tigrayan forces to withdraw from captured territory. 
But the TPLF has also called on Abiy, who won a landslide victory in national elections this year, to step down. 
Although Feltman said he discussed diplomatic solutions with Abiy, the Ethiopian leader expressed confidence he could achieve his goals militarily.
Abiy had posted a statement on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Monday promising to lead from the frontlines on Tuesday. 
""I will head to the frontline to lead the defense forces personally,"" he wrote. ""Let's meet at the war front ... the time has come to lead the country with sacrifice.""
Tigrayan forces and their allies have threatened to march on the capital, but have also been fighting fiercely to try to cut a transport corridor linking landlocked Ethiopia with the region's main port Djibouti. 
Feltman said the Ethiopian military and regional militias had been able to ""more or less stem"" the Tigrayan moves to cut the corridor but Tigrayan forces had been able to move south towards Addis. 
Ethiopia's military spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.
""For a while the lines were static, and then about a week ago the ...(Tigrayan forces) started to move again,"" Feltman said. ""It alarms us for several reasons.""
If Tigrayan forces move closer to Addis, they might increase their demands, Feltman said. 
""We are absolutely opposed to the (Tigrayan forces) threatening Addis by cutting off the road to Djibouti or threatening Addis by actually entering Addis,"" Feltman added.

Also on Tuesday, Germany joined France and the United States in urging its citizens to leave Ethiopia immediately. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric also told reporters in New York that a few hundred family members of international staff would be relocated from Ethiopia. 
""Staff will remain in Ethiopia to deliver on our mandates,"" he said.

The Sunday vote was the first time in four years the country's opposition has run candidates, though it suffered a resounding defeat with the ruling party winning at least 18 out of 23 governorships.
The socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro has long faced accusations of anti-democratic practices from the United States and other critics, although the presence of the EU observers was seen by some as conferring a modicum of legitimacy on the process. 
Maduro has said the observers carried out their mission ""very well"" so far, while other senior members of the ruling party referred to observers as ""peepers"" and accused them of arriving in the country with a pre-written report.
""The elections were implemented in better conditions in comparison with previous electoral processes,"" Isabel Santos, the head of the mission, told journalists, while still faulting aspects of the way they were carried out. 
""There have been arbitrary bans on candidates for administrative reasons, there have been suspensions, or the most recognized leaders or members of some parties have been withdrawn,"" Santos said.
Observers witnessed the use of banned ""control points,"" meant to track which government supporters cast ballots, she said, and structural deficiencies remain.
Santos declined multiple times to say whether the vote was free and fair and called for the observers' eventual final report not to be used as a political instrument.
Some polling places suffered delays in opening and closing times, she said, though voting machines were trustworthy.
The national electoral authority is more politically balanced than it has been in 20 years, Santos said, and balance is key to building public trust.
""The campaign was also marked by the extended use of state resources,"" Santos said, and ""unequal access to media outlets.""
Opposition figures had questioned the fairness of constant coverage of government candidates on state television and sales of subsidized food ahead of voting.

Santos lamented the murder of one voter in Zulia state who was killed while waiting in line and said one electoral observer and two human rights workers had suffered ""aggressions"" in Lara state.
More than 1,000 polling places in 23 states were visited by 136 observers, Santos said, and her team will release a final report in late January or early February.

SOFIA/SKOPJE (Reuters) - A bus carrying tourists from North Macedonia crashed in flames on a highway in western Bulgaria before daybreak on Tuesday, killing at least 45 people, including 12 children, Bulgarian officials said.
The cause of the accident was unclear but the bus appeared to have hit a highway barrier either before or after it caught fire, authorities said.
Seven people who leapt from the burning bus were rushed to the Pirogov emergency hospital in the Bulgarian capital Sofia and were in a stable condition, hospital staff said. They had burns and one had a leg injury.
Bulgaria's interior ministry said 45 people had died, making it the deadliest bus accident in the Balkan country's history.
Interior Minister Boyko Rashkov said bodies were ""clustered inside and are burnt to ash"".
""The picture is terrifying, terrifying. I have never seen anything like that before,"" he told reporters at the site. 
The accident happened on the Struma highway about 30 km (19 miles) west of Sofia around 2 a.m. (0000 GMT). 
The coach party had been returning to Skopje, capital of North Macedonia, after a weekend holiday trip to Istanbul in Turkey, a trip of about 800 km (500 miles). A passenger list released by media in Skopje carried 51 names suggesting most victims were from North Macedonia's ethnic Albanian minority. 
Bulgarian investigative service chief Borislav Sarafov said four buses from a North Macedonian travel agency had entered Bulgaria late on Monday from Turkey. 
""Human error by the driver or a technical malfunction are the two initial versions for the accident,"" Sarafov told reporters. 
""THERE WAS A BLAST"" 
""There was a blast. The question is whether this blast was caused from a blast in the bus, or was caused by the collision of the bus in the road barrier.""
Officials said they would look at the condition of the highway, where accidents have often been reported.
North Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said one of the seven survivors had told him the passengers were sleeping when they were woken by the sound of an explosion.
""This is a huge tragedy,"" he told reporters in Sofia.
He said people sitting at the back of the bus were able to break a window and jump out.
Chamuran Feizulovski, 35, a relative of one of the injured travellers, told Reuters another of the survivors said he had first felt the bus hit an obstacle and then a blast.
At daybreak the bus was standing upright but charred and gutted by fire in the middle of the highway, which was wet from rain. 
CRYING AND IN SHOCK
In front of the Ismail Qemali elementary school in Skopje, pupils cried after hearing news that five of their schoolmates, all from one family, had been killed.
""Ergin was my friend. He was a very good boy. Very nice. I am so sorry that they died,"" Blerim Bushi, 11, told Reuters.
In Sofia, Adnan Yasharovski, 45, said his 16-year-old daughter Zuleikha called him to say she had survived the crash, and he travelled to see her in hospital.
""She was crying. Her hands were burnt but otherwise fine,"" he told Reuters outside the hospital. ""She didn't say much, she was crying and she was in shock. I only saw her through the door as due to COVID, they did not let me into the room.""
Some relatives gathered outside the Besa Trans agency in Skopje, whose Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page advertised trips to Istanbul. ""Deepest condolences to relatives of those who died and speedy recovery for those injured,"" Besa said in a statement. 
Zaev said the passengers were all from North Macedonia but appeared to include a Serbian citizen and a Belgian citizen. It was unclear whether the two were among the victims or injured.
Zaev said the passengers were from various communities in North Macedonia, a country of 2 million that borders Bulgaria.
In Skopje, ethnic Albanian Osman, 31, told Reuters he had come to the office of the travel agency with his brother and sister seeking information about their parents.
""We do not know if they were on the bus that crashed or not. We have no information about them. The agency is not answering the phone. Perhaps we will need to go to Bulgaria,"" he said.

Albanian Foreign Minister Olta Xhacka said the passengers were from the ethnic Albanian community. ""Great grief for the 45 lost lives of Albanians from Northern Macedonia during the tragic accident in Bulgaria,"" he said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Flags flew at half-mast in Skopje and the North Macedonian government said it was declaring three days of mourning. Bulgaria declared a day of mourning for Wednesday to remember the victims of the crash as well as nine people killed in a fire https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/fire-nursing-home-bulgaria-kills-9-people-2021-11-22 at a nursing home.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell's defense in her sex abuse trial will focus on undermining her accusers and distancing her from Jeffrey Epstein, the financier for whom she is charged with recruiting underage girls, according to legal experts and court filings. 
In what is viewed by some legal experts as a risky strategy in the post-#MeToo era, Maxwell's lawyers will question the credibility of four women who say she groomed them as teenagers for Epstein to abuse from the 1990s to the early 2000s, arguing that their memories are faulty or that they are lying because of financial incentives. They have said in a court filing that one woman was motivated by a ""desire for cash.""
Epstein died by suicide at 66 in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges.
""[Maxwell's lawyers] want to say the real villain is no longer around to be prosecuted, so they're using her as a scapegoat,"" said Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.
Jury selection is underway in Manhattan federal court for Maxwell's trial, with opening statements scheduled for Nov. 29.
Maxwell has pleaded not guilty to eight charges including sex trafficking. 
Her lawyers have argued that prosecutors, unable to convict Epstein because of his death, are seeking to ""substitute"" Maxwell in order to hold someone responsible.
""Left with no fish to attempt to fry, the government belatedly turned to Ms. Maxwell,"" her lawyers wrote in a Feb. 4 filing. 
The office of U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in Manhattan, which is prosecuting the case against Maxwell, declined to comment. Maxwell's lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. 
Jeffrey Pagliuca, a lawyer for Maxwell, said at a Nov. 10 hearing that the defense would question the women who say they were abused about why they waited so many years to come forward. 
Two of the women - Annie Farmer and another who will testify under a pseudonym - did not accuse Maxwell of wrongdoing until long after Epstein's alleged abuses, according to Maxwell's defense.
A diary Farmer kept in the 1990s describing interactions with Epstein did not mention Maxwell, and the unidentified witness said nothing about Maxwell until June when prosecutors showed her a photograph, the lawyers said.
PSYCHOLOGIST TESTIMONY
The defense will in part rely on the expert testimony of Elizabeth Loftus, a psychologist who studies how memories can become distorted over time. 
There are risks for the defense team, some lawyers said, particularly since the #MeToo movement in which women accused powerful men of sexual harassment and abuse.
""Victim shaming ... doesn't work especially now in 2021, and it usually hurts you,"" said Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma, a New York defense attorney who specializes in sex crimes cases. ""You have to show the utmost empathy in my opinion to people who have been victimized."" 
Maxwell's defense also has indicated that they intend to argue the women are belatedly accusing Maxwell because of the possibility of a payout.
All four accusers have accepted payment from a victims' compensation fund established by Epstein's estate, Maxwell's attorneys said in a court filing.
""The motive for fabrication could not be clearer,"" Laura Menninger, another Maxwell lawyer, wrote in connection with a civil lawsuit Farmer filed against Epstein's estate. Farmer dropped that case when she sought compensation from the victims' fund.
""Her newly asserted memories of abuse - without corroboration - are not based on the truth or a desire for 'justice' so much as her desire for cash.""
Lawyers for Farmer did not reply to a request for comment.

Legal experts said that the prosecution would not have brought the case unless they had believed the women could withstand attacks on their credibility.
""I don't think they go after her unless they have these women able to really put her in the crosshairs, and to situate her at the center of this,"" said Deborah Tuerkheimer, a professor at Northwestern (NASDAQ:NWE) University's Pritzker School of Law in Chicago.

SEOUL (Reuters) -Former South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan, whose iron-fisted rule of the country following a 1979 military coup sparked massive democracy protests, died on Tuesday at the age of 90, his former press aide said. 
A former military commander, Chun presided over the 1980 Gwangju army massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators, a crime for which he was later convicted and received a commuted death sentence.
Chun passed away at his Seoul home early in the morning and his body was moved to a hospital for a funeral later in the day. 
He was sufferig from multiple myeloma, a blood cancer which was in remission, and his health had deteriorated recently, his former press secretary Min Chung-ki told reporters.
President Moon Jae-in's office offered condolences to Chun's family but expressed regret over his failure to reveal the truth and provide apologies. It had no plan to send flowers or an official to his funeral home, Moon's spokeswoman said. 
Chun's death came about a month after coup co-conspirator and succeeding President Roh Tae-woo https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-koreas-former-president-roh-tae-woo-dies-88-yonhap-2021-10-26, who played a crucial but controversial role in the country's troubled transition to democracy, died at age 88. 
An aloof, ramrod-straight Chun during his mid-1990s trial defended the coup as necessary to save the nation from a political crisis and denied sending troops into Gwangju.
""I am sure that I would take the same action, if the same situation arose,"" Chun told the court.
Chun was born on March 6, 1931, in Yulgok-myeon, a poor farming town in the southeastern county of Hapcheon, during Japanese rule over Korea.
He joined the military straight out of high school, working his way up the ranks until he was appointed a commander in 1979. Taking charge of the investigation into the assassination of President Park Chung-hee that year, Chun courted key military allies and gained control of South Korea's intelligence agencies to headline a Dec. 12 coup.
""In front of the most powerful organisations under the Park Chung-hee presidency, it surprised me how easily (Chun) gained control over them and how skilfully he took advantage of the circumstances. In an instant he seemed to have grown into a giant,"" Park Jun-kwang, Chun's subordinate during the coup later told journalist Cho Gab-je.
Chun's eight-year rule in the presidential Blue House was characterised by brutality and political repression. It was, however, also marked by growing economic prosperity.
Chun resigned from office amid a nationwide student-led democratic movement in 1987 demanding a direct electoral system.
In 1995, he was charged with mutiny, treason and was arrested after refusing to appear at the prosecutors' office and fleeing to his hometown.
At what local media dubbed the ""trial of the century"", he and Roh were found guilty of mutiny, treason and bribery. In their verdict, judges said Chun's rise to power came ""through illegal means which inflicted enormous damage on the people"".
Thousands of students were believed to have been killed at Gwangju, according to testimonies by survivors, former military officers and investigators. 
Roh was given a lengthy jail term while Chun was sentenced to death. However, that was commuted by the Seoul High Court in recognition of Chun's role in the fast-paced economic development of the Asian ""Tiger"" economy and the peaceful transfer of the presidency to Roh in 1988.
Both men were pardoned and freed from jail in 1997 by President Kim Young-sam, in what he called an effort to promote ""national unity."" 
An association of survivors' groups said at a news conference on Tuesday that it was lamentable that Chun died without apologising for the coup and Gwangju ""massacre,"" vowing to continue seeking the truth and ""justice of history."" 
Chun made several returns to the spotlight. He caused a national furore in 2003 when he claimed total assets of 291,000 won ($245) of cash, two dogs and some home appliances - while owing some 220.5 billion won in fines. His four children and other relatives were later found to own large swaths of land in Seoul and luxurious villas in the United States.
Chun's family in 2013 vowed to pay off the bulk of his debt, but his unpaid fines still totalled some 100 billion won as of last December. Seoul city said last week that his unpaid taxes exceeded 980 million won. 
In 2020, Chun was found guilty and received an eight-month suspended sentence for defaming a late democracy activist and Catholic priest in his 2017 memoirs. Prosecutors have appealed, and Chun had faced a trial next week.

Chun had wished to be cremated and buried near the border with North Korea, but his family would make a final decision when his youngest son, living in the United States, arrives, Min said.

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's foreign ministry said on Tuesday that ""certain people"" should stop the ""malicious hyping"" and ""politicization"" of the issue of tennis star Peng Shuai, as foreign governments and organisations continue to raise questions around her wellbeing. 
The whereabouts of Peng, a former doubles world number one, became a matter of international concern for nearly three weeks after she posted a message on social media alleging that China's former Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli had sexually assaulted her.
She re-appeared over the weekend in Beijing and held a video call with International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach on Sunday but the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) has said this did not address or alleviate concerns about her wellbeing. 
Amnesty International's China researcher Alkan Akad also told Reuters the video call did little to ease fears over Peng's wellbeing and that the IOC was entering ""dangerous waters"".
An Amnesty International spokesperson said the organisation works ""independently and impartially on the basis of facts, and we hold all states to the same standards.""
""This is not a diplomatic matter,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular press briefing on Tuesday, adding that Amnesty held ""anti-China"" views.
""I believe everyone will have seen she has recently attended some public activities and also held a video call with IOC President Bach. I hope certain people will cease malicious hyping, let alone politicization,"" Zhao added. 
On Nov. 2, Peng posted on Chinese social media that Zhang had coerced her into sex and they later had an on-off consensual relationship. The post was deleted soon after it was posted.
Neither Zhang nor the Chinese government have commented on Peng's allegations. The topic has been blocked from direct discussion on China's heavily censored internet.

The United States, France, Britain and tennis players including Naomi Osaka, Serena Williams and Billie Jean King have all expressed concerns over Peng, a former Olympian.
It comes as Beijing is preparing to host the Winter Olympics next February. Global rights groups and others have called for a boycott of the Games over China's human rights record.

BRUNSWICK, Georgia (Reuters) - Henry Johnson, 60, can often be found weightlifting in the garage of his home near Brunswick (NYSE:BC), Georgia. When people walk by his house and ask, ""Did you see today? Do you know what happened?"" he knows immediately what they are talking about.
At church services, at neighborhood cookouts and on morning walks, conversation is dominated by one topic: the murder trial of three white men who saw a Black man, Ahmaud Arbery, running through their neighborhood in February 2020, chased him in their trucks and shot him dead after a brief struggle.
In the mostly white community of Satilla Shores on the outskirts of Brunswick where the three men lived and Arbery was shot, many people support their neighbors going free, arguing that the shooting was tragic but not criminal.
Arbery was shot three times after grappling with one of the defendants for his shotgun. The defendants have pleaded not guilty and said the shooting was self defense.
In the mostly Black neighborhood of Boykin Ridge that Arbery called home, Johnson, a former neighbor, said most of the people he speaks to keep their opinions about the men to themselves. But in interviews other residents were more blunt: The three defendants should go to jail, they said.
The Boykin Ridge neighborhood is on edge ahead of the verdict, which could come this week. Residents know the world is closely watching the case and judging the outcome.
""People are nervous,"" said Johnson, an aviation technician who was benchpressing close to 300 pounds (136 kg) on Monday. Arbery would often support him when he was lifting heavier weights, he said.
""He was a good kid,"" Johnson said. ""We jokingly called him the 'running man' because was always running by, doing sprints.""
Prosecutors say Arbery, 25, was on a Sunday afternoon jog when Gregory McMichael, 65 and his son Travis McMichael, 35, saw him pass their driveway and assumed the worst - that he was a criminal. Their neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52, joined them in chasing Arbery in an attempt to carry out a citizen's arrest.
Deborah Ray, 72, a retired florist who lives in a cul-de-sac on Boykin Ridge Road, said Arbery would start his sprint training in the street next to her driveway.
""It's a shame about what happened to that young man,"" she told Reuters. ""He'd call me Ms. Ray and wave as he went by. He loved everybody.
""Of course we all talk about it,"" Ray, who is white, said of the trial. ""When I'm on my walks I stop and chat and what-not with everyone. It's friendly here. Everyone wants to know what you think will happen. I can't judge anyone, but it was a terrible thing,"" she said.
Camisha Bowers, 24, a close friend of Arbery's who grew up down the street from him on Boykin Ridge Drive, said the whole neighborhood is anxious about the verdict, which will be rendered by a jury of 11 white people and one Black person.
""All the attention of the world is on this. I just hope they do the right thing, you know,"" she said, adding that she wanted justice for her friend.
'NO TRESPASSING'
In the Satilla Shores neighborhood, there is a sense of a community under siege. ""No trespassing"" signs have proliferated on trees and doors in recent weeks. ""Go home,"" a number of residents said when approached for interviews. People said they were exhausted by the media attention.
""The jury should send them home,"" one resident said of the three defendants before telling a Reuters reporter to leave.
Jay Wells, 61, who lives just around the corner from the shooting, said like most of his neighbors he feels bad about what happened but doesn't believe ""three men should have their lives ruined.""
""It's a tragedy any which way you look at it,"" Wells said. ""I know a man is dead, but there are three men who might be locked up forever. And I can't say that is right for the way this happened.""
Audra Favre, 53, a mortgage underwriter who moved to Satilla Shores just after the shooting, said that at neighborhood cookouts or when people are talking around their shared boat docks, the trial is ""the topic.""

At the gatherings, she said almost everyone is in favor of not guilty verdicts for all of the men. ""That's not how I feel. I think they took the law into their own hands,"" she said.
But she added, ""You have to understand, so many people around here know them, are friends with them.""

(Reuters) - Travis McMichael, a defendant in the Ahmaud Arbery murder trial, says he followed firearms training when he fatally shot the 25-year-old Black man. Many U.S. gun instructors disagree.
McMichael testified last week that he drew on his U.S. Coast Guard training by levelling a shotgun at Arbery to make him ""back off."" But gun professionals interviewed by Reuters said he broke a basic tenet: Never point a gun at anyone, let alone shoot them, unless you are in imminent danger of serious bodily harm or death.
""There's just not enough evidence that these guys had to use deadly force,"" said Rodney Smith, CEO and director of training at the Georgia Firearms and Security Training Academy.
McMichael also testified that Arbery never threatened him verbally or brandished a weapon.
McMichael, 35, his father Gregory McMichael, 65, a former police officer and investigator with the local district attorney's office, and their neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52, have pleaded not guilty to charges that include murder, aggravated assault and false imprisonment. 
They said they did nothing wrong in jumping into their pickup trucks to chase Arbery, whom they suspected of burglary, as he jogged through their mostly white neighborhood in Georgia. The younger McMichael was the only defendant to take the stand. He testified he fired his pump-action shotgun at close range at Arbery in self defense, saying Arbery had grabbed his gun. 
Both the Arbery case, in which the jury was set to begin deliberations on Tuesday, and the Wisconsin murder trial of Kyle Rittenhouse that ended Friday with an acquittal, have revolved around armed white men claiming self defense before nearly all-white juries.
Reuters interviewed around a dozen firearm instructors, gun shop owners and arms makers. Some saw parallels between the two.
Michael Cargill said Arbery should be seen as Rittenhouse was - a man in fear of his life.
""Those cases are the same,"" said Cargill, 52, owner of the Central Texas Gun Works firing range and gun shop in Austin, Texas. ""Kyle Rittenhouse was trying to get away from people that were trying to kill him. And he had a rifle and he used it to defend himself. Ahmaud Arbery was trying to get away from people who were trying to kill him. He didn't have a gun. He was shot and killed.""
In a trial that divided America, Rittenhouse was charged with murdering two men and wounding another during racial justice protests in the Wisconsin city of Kenosha last year. Rittenhouse testified he had gone to Kenosha to help protect property during the protests. Supporters called him a hero for shootings they saw as justified while opponents said he provoked violence by aiming a rifle at people.
Clifford Wallace, 36, said both cases showed the need for verbal warnings before pointing and discharging firearms. 
""I can't just shoot you because you appear to be a threat, right? It has to be imminent. I have to know that you're a threat,"" said Wallace, owner of firearms training, retail and manufacturing company Democratic Arms in Berrien Springs, Michigan.
Louis Evans, 75, a former Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputy and owner of Evans Security Training & Range in Compton, California, took issue with the defense argument that gun safety protocols were followed in the shooting of Arbery.
""Everything they did was messed up. People who are not following the rule of law; they violated everything,"" Evans said of the McMichaels and Bryan.

Cargill said if Americans supported Rittenhouse, they should support the case against Arbery's killers. 
""Both cases are the same, and if you're not looking at it in the same way, then you're racist,"" Cargill said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The former leader of Hong Kong pro-independence group Studentlocalism was sentenced on Tuesday to a total of 43 months in prison for trying to separate the city from China, and for money laundering.
Tony Chung, 20, was charged with secession, under a sweeping national security law, and money laundering in October 2020 and was denied bail. Local media reported at the time that he was detained along with two others at a coffee shop close to the U.S. consulate by unidentified men and was believed to be preparing for an asylum application.
Chung had entered a plea bargain, admitting guilt on the charge of secession and one count of money laundering and pleading not guilty to a sedition charge and another money laundering accusation.
The plea led to a 25% reduction in his sentence, to 40 months for secession and 18 months for money laundering. Only three months of the latter will be served separately, resulting in a total sentence of 43 months.
""He actively organised, planned and implemented activities to separate the country,"" District Court Judge Stanley Chan said. 
Prosecutor Ivan Cheung has said the defendant acted as an administrator for the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) pages of the U.S. branch of Studentlocalism and an organisation called the Initiative Independence Party.
Pro-independence T-shirts, flags and books were also seized from his home, the prosecutor said. The money laundering charge was related to donations he received via PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL).
Like other anti-government organisations, Studentlocalism disbanded before Beijing imposed the security law in June 2020, to punish anything it deems as subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
The vast majority of Hong Kong people do not support independence, but any mention of the idea is anathema to Beijing.
Since the enactment of the security law, Hong Kong has taken a swift authoritarian turn, with most democratic politicians now in jail or in self-exile. Dozens of civil society organisations have folded, and some international rights groups have left the city.
Chinese and Hong Kong authorities deny the security law tramples individual rights and say the legislation was necessary to restore stability after mass street protests in 2019.

The former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of a high degree of autonomy. Democracy activists and some Western governments say China broke that promise -- an allegation that Beijing vehemently denies.

WAUKESHA, Wis. (Reuters) - The man accused of deliberately driving his car into a Christmas parade near Milwaukee, killing five people and injuring dozens, was out on bail from a domestic abuse case and was suspected in another violent altercation earlier that day, officials said on Monday.
The suspect, Darrell Brooks, 39, was arrested near the scene of Sunday's vehicular attack in Waukesha, Wisconsin, and faces five counts of first-degree homicide, Waukesha Police Chief Daniel Thompson said.
In addition to the five people killed - ranging in age from 52 to 81 - 48 were injured, including six children who remained hospitalized in critical condition on Monday, authorities said. 
Among the victims were members of a parade group calling themselves the ""Dancing Grannies,"" according to a statement posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Monday. 
Thompson said the motive for the attack was still a mystery but that it was clear the suspect had acted intentionally.
""He drove right through the barricades and the officers,"" Thompson told a briefing, adding authorities had ruled out terrorism as a motive. Waukesha County District Attorney Sue Opper said the suspect acted alone.
Police were not pursuing Brooks when he plowed into the parade, but one officer fired shots to try to stop the sport utility vehicle, the police chief said. 
""Minutes after the incident occurred, I responded to the scene,"" Thompson said. ""And what I saw out of chaos and tragedy was heroes - first responders in the community coming together and working together on triaging victims.""
The FBI was assisting local police in their investigation.
Brooks has a criminal history and was last released from custody after posting $1,000 cash bond on Nov. 11, an amount the Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office said was ""inappropriately low in light of the nature of the recent charges"" against him. 
Brooks had been charged on Nov. 5 with obstructing an officer, battery, reckless endangerment, disorderly conduct and felony bail jumping in a domestic abuse case, prosecutors and state court records show.
Around the time of Sunday's carnage, police also had received a complaint of a domestic disturbance involving Brooks and a knife but were unable to respond because they were preoccupied with the parade, Thompson said.
""Was there an initial complaint of a knife being involved? Yes,"" he said. ""Do we know if there actually was one there? We don't."" 
The chief said investigators had no information suggesting Brooks, a resident of Milwaukee, knew anyone in the parade.
'STILL TOTALLY SHOCKED'
Police identified the five dead as Virginia Sorenson, 79; LeAnna Owen, 71; Tamara Durand, 52; Jane Kulich, 52; and Wilhelm Hospel, 81.
Several vigils and prayer services were held on Monday for the victims, including a memorial service attended by hundreds in a park near the scene.
“Waukesha is strong. That’s why we are out here,” said Jeremy Wittig, 39, an information technology professional, as he stood in the crowd around sunset. 
Brian Hoffman, 33, a Waukesha resident, who was present when the vehicle rammed through parade attendees, described the moment as ""terrifying.""
""I saw children who were run over,"" he recounted early on Monday, sitting on a stoop near the scene. ""I am still totally shocked.""
Video of the incident posted on social media showed a red SUV racing alongside the parade route and then into the procession, appearing to run over more than a dozen people before bystanders ran from sidewalks to help.
Officials at Children's Wisconsin hospital in Milwaukee told a briefing they treated 18 children, including six who remained in critical condition and three in serious condition on Monday. 
The rest were in fair condition or released. The hospital made no mention of any fatalities. 
A message posted on Monday by the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies Facebook page paid tribute to those who lost their lives as ""the glue ... (that) held us together."" 
""Those who died were extremely passionate Grannies. Their eyes gleamed.....(with the) joy of being a Grannie,"" read the message https://www.facebook.com/Milwaukeedancingrannies. ""Our hearts are heavy at this most difficult time."" 
Waukesha schools were closed on Monday, and additional counselors were to be made available for students, the school district superintendent said. Waukesha authorities said a fund for the affected families https://wccf.fcsuite.com/erp/donate/create?funit_id=3559 had been set up. 

President Joe Biden said his administration was monitoring the situation in Waukesha ""very closely.""
""The entire community is struggling, struggling to cope with these horrific acts of violence,"" Biden told reporters on Monday.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai's video call with International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach did not address or alleviate concerns about her well-being, the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) said on Monday.
The whereabouts of Peng, a former doubles world number one, became a matter of international concern https://www.reuters.com/world/china/tennis-peng-shuai-appears-china-tennis-event-organiser-photos-show-2021-11-21 for nearly three weeks after she posted a message on social media alleging that China's former Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli had sexually assaulted her.
She appeared at a dinner with friends on Saturday and a children's tennis tournament in Beijing on Sunday, photographs and videos published by Chinese state media journalists and by the tournament's organisers show. But they have done little to quell concerns.
""It was good to see Peng Shuai in recent videos, but they don't alleviate or address the WTA's concern about her well-being and ability to communicate without censorship or coercion,"" a WTA spokeswoman said in an e-mail. 
Asked about the call with the IOC, the spokeswoman said: ""This video does not change our call for a full, fair and transparent investigation, without censorship, into her allegation of sexual assault, which is the issue that gave rise to our initial concern.""
The IOC said in a statement that Peng held a 30-minute call https://www.reuters.com/world/china/tennis-peng-shuai-appears-china-tennis-event-organiser-photos-show-2021-11-21 with Bach on Sunday during which she said she was safe and well at home in Beijing and wanted to have her privacy respected for now.
Amnesty International's China researcher Alkan Akad told Reuters the video call did little to ease fears over Peng's wellbeing.
""The International Olympic Committee is entering dangerous waters,"" Akad said. ""In the past we have seen various similar cases where people had no option but to say what they had been told to."" 
The Chinese Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to an email request on Monday for comment on the Amnesty statement.
DIPLOMATIC BOYCOTT
The White House, weighing a possible diplomatic boycott https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/biden-says-us-considering-diplomatic-boycott-beijing-olympics-2021-11-18 of next year's Winter Olympics over what Washington says is China's genocide against minority Muslims, something that Beijing denies, said last week it was concerned about Peng and joined calls for Beijing to provide proof of her whereabouts https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/white-house-concerned-by-reports-about-chinese-tennis-star-peng-2021-11-19. 
Asked if there were concerns about the safety of U.S. athletes at the Beijing Games and if Peng's disappearance meant it was time to call for a diplomatic boycott, U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said the United States was closely monitoring her situation.
""We share the concern that has been expressed around the world as we all want her of course to be safe,"" he told a regular briefing, adding that individuals should be allowed to speak freely and seek accountability for sexual assault.
Price said China had ""a zero tolerance approach for criticism and a record of silencing or attempting to silence those who do attempt to speak out."" 
French sports minister Roxana Maracineanu ""is partly reassured by the video but remains concerned and wants the light to be shed on the accusations of sexual assault"", her office told Reuters.
France's foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Sunday that Chinese authorities should let Peng speak publicly.
""I'm expecting only one thing: that she speaks,"" Le Drian told LCI television, adding that there could be unspecified diplomatic consequences if China did not clear up the situation. 
Global rights groups and others have called for a boycott of the Winter Olympics over China's human rights record.
The WTA has also threatened to pull tournaments out of China https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/china-editor-says-he-does-not-think-peng-faces-retribution-2021-11-19 over the matter.
Hu Xijin, the editor of China's state-owned Global Times who has in recent days posted videos and photographs of Peng in Beijing, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Monday that her appearance should be enough to ease worries of ""those who truly care about (the) safety of Peng Shuai.
""But for those aiming to attack China’s system and boycott the Beijing Winter Olympics, facts, no matter how many, don't work for them,"" he said. 
On Nov. 2, Peng posted on Chinese social media that Zhang had coerced her into sex and they later had an on-off consensual relationship. The post was deleted about half hour after it was posted. 
#WhereIsPengShuai?
Neither Zhang nor the Chinese government have commented on Peng's allegations. China’s State Council Information office did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent on Monday. 
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, when asked on Monday about the concerns over Peng expressed by France, Britain and the United States, said it was not a foreign ministry matter but noted that Peng had recently attended public activities.
Current and former tennis players, including Naomi Osaka, Serena Williams and Billie Jean King, have also joined the calls seeking to confirm she was safe, using the social media hashtag #WhereIsPengShuai?
Men's singles world No.1 Novak Djokovic said it would be strange to hold tournaments in China unless the ""horrific"" situation was resolved. 
The topic has been blocked from discussion on China's heavily censored internet and the comments sections on all remaining posts on Peng's official Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) account, and on numerous old posts by users about her, have been locked. 

Some Weibo users have found ways around the censors by leaving comments on accounts belonging to foreign tennis players or sports commentators. While a number expressed relief to see her re-appear at the weekend, others said they were sceptical.
""I hope it's not staged,"" said one.

The U.S. Navy said the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer Milius conducted a ""routine Taiwan Strait transit"" through international waters in accordance with international law.
""The ship's transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the U.S. commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. The United States military flies, sails, and operates anywhere international law allows,"" it added.
There was no immediate response from China.
Last month, the Chinese military condemned the United States and Canada for each sending a warship through the Taiwan Strait, saying they were threatening peace and stability in the region.
China claims democratically ruled Taiwan as its own territory, and has mounted repeated air force missions into Taiwan's air defence identification zone (ADIZ) over the past year or so, provoking anger in Taipei.
The United States like most countries has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is its most important international backer and arms supplier.

Beijing calls Taiwan the most sensitive and important issue in its relations with Washington.
U.S. Navy ships have been transiting the strait roughly monthly, to the anger of Beijing. U.S. allies occasionally also send ships through the strait, including Britain in September.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lawyers for U.S. Capitol rioter nicknamed the ""QAnon Shaman"" bickered on Monday over who will now represent him, a week after he was sentenced to more than three years in prison for his role in the deadly Jan. 6 attack.
John Pierce, a Los Angeles-based attorney who represents about 25 Jan. 6 defendants, said he and Honolulu-based lawyer William Shipley have taken over as lawyers for Jacob Chansley, well-known for the horned headdress he wore while in the Capitol. A court filing confirms that they represent Chansley.
Their claim was immediately disputed by Chansley's original attorney, Albert Watkins, who represented the 34-year-old through his guilty plea and sentencing https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-seeks-four-years-prison-capitol-rioter-qanon-shaman-2021-11-17 to 41 months in federal prison.
A press release said Pierce and Shipley ""are now counsel of record for Mr. Chansley in all further legal matters regarding his attendance at the January 6 protests.""
Chansley ""will be pursuing all remedies available to him,"" including ""a possible direct appeal of his conviction ... as well as claims of 'Ineffective Assistance of Counsel,'"" it said.
Watkins told Reuters that he not been fired.
""I am choosing to take the high road here and wait until such time as I have the opportunity to get some insight into what is really going on,"" he added.
In a later statement, Watkins said he had spoken with Chansley who had confirmed his continuing representation.

At a hearing last week, Watkins unsuccessfully asked U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth to sentence his client to jail time he already served since his arrest in January. 
Pierce also was the first lawyer to represent acquitted Kenosha shooting defendant Kyle Rittenhouse but was fired by the Rittenhouse family in January.

BRUNSWICK, Ga. (Reuters) -A jury heard dueling accounts of whether the three white men charged with murdering Ahmaud Arbery had any right to chase and shoot the unarmed Black man in their mostly white Georgia neighborhood in closing arguments on Monday.
Gregory McMichael, 65; his son Travis McMichael, 35; and their neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52, have pleaded not guilty to murder, aggravated assault and false imprisonment, saying they did nothing wrong in jumping into pickup trucks to chase Arbery.
Prosecutors said the men ""assumed the worst"" about a 25-year-old Black man running by their homes and attacked him in a five-minute pursuit through Satilla Shores, a coastal Georgia suburb, on Feb. 23, 2020. 
In contrast, the elder McMichael's lawyer, Laura Hogue, said the defendants had a duty to catch Arbery, whom she painted as a frightening burglar with ""long dirty toenails,"" using a description from the autopsy report.
At that comment, Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, was heard exclaiming ""Wow!"" as she rose to leave the room.
Lead prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said the defendants killed Arbery, an avid jogger, ""not because he's a threat to them, but because he wouldn't stop and talk to them."" Arbery had nothing on him but his jogging clothes and shoes.
""They made their decision to attack Ahmaud Arbery in their driveways because he was a Black man running down the street,"" she said, the prosecution's most direct assertion so far of a racist motivation in a case which mentioned race only in passing before the jury.
The younger McMichael was the only defendant to take the stand, testifying he fired his shotgun at close range at Arbery in self defense, saying Arbery had grabbed the gun.
In his closing argument, Jason Sheffield, one of McMichael's lawyers, pointed to the law-enforcement training McMichael got during his nine years as a U.S. Coast Guard mechanic.
Sheffield showed jurors parts of Bryan's widely seen cellphone video, freezing it at the moment Arbery ran towards Travis McMichael, who had just aimed his shotgun at Arbery.
""There's no question that Ahmaud's hands are on this gun,"" he said. ""You are allowed to defend yourself. You are allowed to use force that is likely to cause death or serious bodily injury if you believe it's necessary. At that moment, Travis believed it is necessary.""
'A GOOD NEIGHBORHOOD'
Dunikoski suggested McMichael lied on the stand, deriding his testimony as self-serving and inconsistent with initial accounts to police.
McMichael testified that he thought Arbery might have been behind local thefts and that he briefly saw Arbery 12 days before the shooting outside a nearby empty, half-built house after dark. 
No evidence ever emerged that Arbery, who was saving money to return to technical college, took anything on his frequent runs through Satilla Shores. The property owner said through a lawyer he believed Arbery was stopping for a drink from a water faucet on the site.
Nonetheless, Hogue argued, Arbery had an intent to steal in his repeated visits to the construction site at night, which can be prosecuted as burglary even if nothing is taken. Her argument sometimes drew shocked muttering from Arbery's supporters. 
""A beautiful teenager with a broad smile and a crooked baseball cap can deteriorate and lose his way,"" Hogue said, referring to a photograph of Arbery that prosecutors showed jurors. ""Years later he can end up creeping into a home that is not his own and running away.""
The defendants have argued that they had a right to detain Arbery under Georgia's citizen's arrest law, which was repealed in the wake of outrage over the killing. 
""A good neighborhood is always policing itself,"" Hogue said. 
The citizen's arrest law allowed anyone to detain a person if there is reasonable and probable suspicion that the person is fleeing a serious felony crime they committed.
But trespassing is a misdemeanor, Dunikoski noted, and none of the defendants knew where Arbery had been or what he was doing before running past their driveways.
Kevin Gough described his client, Bryan, as a simple, ineloquent hardware store worker who was the only one of the three men not to grab a gun before chasing Arbery.
""Roddie Bryan is no vigilante,"" Gough said. He evoked the ""hand of God"" as he argued that Bryan was being ""guided by divine providence"" to the scene so that the jury could have the most important evidence in the case: Bryan's cellphone video.

For the felony murder charges, the prosecution does not have to show that anyone intended to kill Arbery. They only need to prove that the men falsely imprisoned him or assaulted him using the shotgun and their trucks, and that one of those underlying felonies caused Arbery's death.
The prosecutors are due to make their final rebuttal on Tuesday before the jury begins deliberations.

SAN JOSE, Calif. (Reuters) -Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes defended her leadership at the now-defunct blood-testing startup on Monday, telling jurors at her fraud trial she had confidence in the company's technology and had seen positive results from early studies.
Holmes' second day of testimony was part of the defense strategy of showing that she believed Theranos' technology worked, and was not trying to overstate its prospects when raising money from investors.
Holmes, 37, stands accused of lying about Theranos, which had touted technology that could run diagnostic tests faster and more accurately than traditional lab testing with a drop of blood from a finger prick.
Once valued at $9 billion, Theranos collapsed after the Wall Street Journal published a series of articles starting in 2015 that suggested its devices were flawed and inaccurate.
In Monday's testimony, Holmes compared a traditional testing machine to a much smaller Theranos device, which she referred to as the 3.0, whose aim was to remove human involvement in blood sample processing.
""If we had the ability to automate much of that process we could reduce the error associated with traditional lab testing,"" Holmes said.
She also testified about studies in 2008 and 2009 in which she believed Theranos devices performed well, including studies run under agreements with drug companies such as Novartis AG.
Holmes' decision to testify is risky as it exposes her to a potentially tough cross-examination by prosecutors.
The trial has shone a spotlight on Silicon Valley start-ups, which often attract high valuations based on promises of future success rather than actual revenue and profit streams.
Holmes' lawyers have tried to portray her as a young entrepreneur who underestimated Theranos' obstacles.
More than 50 journalists and spectators arrived at the courthouse early Monday morning to await Holmes' testimony, which began nearly two hours late.

Over the two-month trial, jurors have heard testimony from more than two dozen prosecution witnesses, including patients and investors whom prosecutors say Holmes deceived.
Holmes has pleaded not guilty to nine wire fraud counts and two conspiracy counts. Her testimony is scheduled to resume on Tuesday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government has reached a settlement valued at about $130 million with the families of students and faculty who were killed and injured during the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, a source familiar with the talks said on Monday.
The settlement, once finalized, would resolve litigation seeking to hold the FBI accountable for its handling of tips involving the teenage shooter.
Justice Department representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The massacre, one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history, left 17 students and staff members dead.
The accused gunman, former Parkland student Nikolas Cruz, pleaded guilty in a Florida courtroom last month to 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted murder. Cruz, 23, still faces a possible death sentence.
Cruz was 19 and an expelled student at the time of the mass murder.
""Although no resolution could ever restore what the Parkland families lost, this settlement marks an important step toward justice,"" said Kristina Infante of Podhurst Orseck, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, in a press release.

Some survivors of the Parkland shooting formed March for Our Lives, a gun safety organization that advocates for stricter firearm controls, including stronger background checks and a ban on the type of assault-style rifle that Cruz legally purchased and used in the assault.
Parents of Parkland victims alleged in a 2018 lawsuit that FBI tip line employees acted negligently in their handling of tips regarding Cruz's stated desire to carry out a school shooting and his growing collection of assault-style rifles and ammunition.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York appeals court judge has rejected the New York Times' request to lift an order temporarily blocking it from publishing or seeking various documents related to the conservative activist group Project Veritas.
Friday's order from Justice Leonard Austin of the state Appellate Division in Brooklyn means the Times cannot use the documents, which Project Veritas said are protected by attorney-client privilege, until a Nov. 23 hearing on whether to extend the prohibition.
The Times had been appealing a Thursday order https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/judge-temporarily-blocks-new-york-times-publishing-project-veritas-materials-2021-11-19 by a trial judge, Justice Charles Wood of the Westchester County Supreme Court, that the newspaper called an unconstitutional prior restraint, a view shared by some First Amendment advocates.
""Today's decision to allow the injunction is deeply disappointing,"" Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha said in an email. ""We look forward to explaining our position in court.""
Project Veritas did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Wood's order was part of Project Veritas' defamation lawsuit against the Times over a September 2020 article https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/us/politics/project-veritas-ilhan-omar.html describing a video the group released alleging voter fraud in Minnesota.
It followed a Nov. 11 https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/11/us/politics/project-veritas-journalism-political-spying.html Times article discussing Project Veritas' journalism practices, and a U.S. Department of Justice probe into the group's possible role in the reported theft https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/05/us/politics/project-veritas-investigation-ashley-biden-diary.html of a diary from President Joe Biden's daughter Ashley.
That article discussed memos by Benjamin Barr, a lawyer for Project Veritas. The group has said those memos were privileged, and the Times wrote about them to harm and embarrass a litigation adversary.
Wood's order blocks the Times from reporting on or trying to obtain privileged Project Veritas materials until the Nov. 23 hearing.
The judge will also consider whether the newspaper must remove references to Barr's memos from the Nov. 11 article.

The Times has said Wood's order ran afoul of the U.S. Supreme Court's 1971 decision rejecting the Nixon administration's bid to halt publication of the Pentagon Papers, which described U.S. military involvement in Vietnam.
The case is Project Veritas v New York Times Co et al, New York State Supreme Court, Westchester County, No. 63921/2020.

GENEVA (Reuters) -A United Nations human rights expert said on Monday that electoral laws in some parts of the United States including Texas may undermine democracy by depriving millions of citizens who belong to minority groups of the equal right to vote.
Fernand de Varennes, the U.N. special rapporteur on minority issues, speaking on the final day of a two-week visit to the United States, decried a Texas law that he said resulted in ""gerrymandering"" and dilution of voting rights of minorities in favour of white Americans.
""There is in fact what could be described as an undermining of democracy with a phenomenal number of legislative measures in different parts of the country...which certainly have the effect of making the exercise of the right to vote more difficult for certain minorities,"" he told a news briefing. 
""It is becoming unfortunately apparent that it is almost a tyranny of the majority where the minority right to vote is being denied in many areas,"" he added.
De Varennes called for a ""New Deal"" to overhaul legislation. There was no immediate U.S. reaction to his preliminary observations which de Varennes said he had shared with U.S. State Department officials earlier in the day.
Democrats have made election reform https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-democrats-return-voting-rights-with-eye-filibuster-2021-11-03 a priority in light of Republican state-balloting restrictions passed in response to former President Donald Trump's false claims of massive voter fraud in the 2020 election. 
At least 19 states have passed laws making it harder to vote, according to the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice. Republicans in Congress have blocked proposed legislation multiple times this year.

The U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Texas this month over its law that curbs voting by mail, in the latest effort by the Biden administration to combat new voting restrictions.
De Varennes is a law professor who has served in the independent post since 2017.

""This has been a profoundly sad chapter in New York’s history,"" said state Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, who in March asked the Assembly's judiciary committee to investigate allegations against Cuomo.
In a statement on Monday a spokesman for Cuomo called the report ""revisionist"" and said Cuomo's team had not been given the opportunity to review evidence in the Assembly's possession. 
Cuomo has denied wrongdoing in the past, though he said in August https://www.reuters.com/world/us/new-york-governor-cuomo-resigns-after-sexual-harassment-findings-2021-08-10 when he resigned that he accepted ""full responsibility"" for what he called clumsy attempts to be affectionate or humorous.
Heastie initially asked the judiciary committee to determine whether Cuomo should be removed from office, after two women who worked for Cuomo went public with complaints of sexual harassment. 
The impeachment effort was mooted by Cuomo's resignation following the release of a report by New York Attorney General Letitia James that concluded Cuomo broke federal and state laws by sexually harassing women who worked for him.
Shortly after Cuomo resigned, his successor, New York Governor Kathy Hochul, revealed https://www.reuters.com/world/us/new-york-governor-reveals-12000-more-covid-19-deaths-than-previously-counted-2021-08-25 that 12,000 more people died of COVID-19 than was reported under Cuomo.
The state Assembly report released on Monday acknowledged ""ongoing law enforcement interests into several of the matters covered in this report,"" and said the report had been prepared ""with those interests in mind.""

The first prosecution to arise from the misconduct scandal that led to Cuomo's resignation was a criminal complaint charging him with the misdemeanor sex offense of forcible touching, which was filed https://www.reuters.com/world/us/misdemeanor-complaint-related-sex-crime-filed-against-ex-ny-governor-cuomo-court-2021-10-28 in October in a court in Albany, the state capital.

(Reuters) - A U.S. judge has granted British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell permission to call a psychologist who specializes in how memories can become distorted over time to testify at her trial on sex abuse charges.
Lawyers for Maxwell, who is accused by prosecutors of recruiting and grooming underage girls for the late financier Jeffrey Epstein to abuse, have said they planned to call American psychologist Elizabeth Loftus to testify about ""false memories https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ghislaine-maxwell-challenge-claims-she-groomed-underage-girls-epstein-2021-11-08"" of sexual abuses that people may describe with confidence without deliberately lying.
Loftus, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, has testified at hundreds of trials, including as a defense witness in real estate heir Robert Durst's murder trial and former movie producer Harvey Weinstein https://www.reuters.com/article/people-harvey-weinstein-idUKL1N2A71QC's trial on rape and sexual assault charges. Both were convicted. 
U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan said she would allow Loftus' testimony in an order released on Monday. Opening statements in the trial begin on Nov. 29.
Federal prosecutors had asked Nathan to restrict Loftus' testimony, calling some of her opinions ""unreliable.""
In particular, they cited her opinion that information people hear about an event can alter their memories of that event.
Nathan said she would admit some testimony from Loftus and Park Dietz, another psychologist the defense has offered as an expert, without saying which testimony was admissible.
Dietz is expected to rebut the testimony of prosecution witness Lisa Rocchio, a psychologist expected to discuss how underage sexual abuse victims are ""groomed"" by their predators.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -While Wall Street banks cheered the renomination https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/biden-renominates-powell-fed-chairman-brainard-vice-chair-2021-11-22 of U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell on Monday, Democratic progressives were frustrated that the White House did not announce a tough new regulatory chief to crack down on banks on issues such as climate change and fair lending. 
""President Biden’s renomination of Jerome Powell...is a major disappointment to those of us who have fought for tougher regulation of Wall Street as a key tool for protecting financial stability and building a more just and sustainable economy,"" progressive group Americans for Financial Reform said in a statement. 
The Fed's current head of supervision Randal Quarles https://www.reuters.com/world/us/feds-randal-quarles-resign-end-december-2021-11-08 stepped down in October from that powerful role overseeing the country's largest lenders, and is due to leave the central bank next month. Biden said that and other Fed picks would be announced in early December. 
Washington insiders had seen Lael Brainard https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/brainard-influential-fed-governor-expand-role-vice-chair-2021-11-22, a fellow Fed governor and Treasury official under former President Barack Obama's administration, as the leading candidate to replace Quarles due to her vocal stance on the Fed's regulatory agenda. 
But Brainard, who had opposed Quarles' efforts to ease rules introduced following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, did not want the supervision post and was looking for a more senior role, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. 
Instead, she will step up to become Fed Vice Chair, the White House said. 
A Fed spokesman for Brainard did not provide comment. 
Progressive groups, eager for the Fed to reverse its Wall Street-friendly stance and accelerate efforts to tackle climate change and overhaul community lending rules, criticized the reappointment of Powell, a Republican appointee who had backed Quarles' changes, and called for a tough new regulation chief.
""This position must be filled by a strong regulator with a proven track record of tough and effective enforcement - and it needs to be done quickly,"" Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said in a statement. 
Whoever gets the supervision role faces a packed agenda, which will also include reviewing new capital rules and how banks are able to handle cryptocurrencies. 
“It’s problematic,” said Todd Phillips, director of financial regulation at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. Following an announcement, it could take until February for the new supervision chief to be confirmed by the Senate, at which point the post would have been empty for around five months, he said. 
“It's going to be a long time until that position is filled.”
Brainard voted against many of Quarles' changes, arguing they would increase systemic risk. Among the most contentious were revisions to the “Volcker Rule” curbing speculative bank investments; scrapping a requirement for big banks to hold capital against certain swap trades; and easing the Fed's annual “stress tests."" 
Brainard acted as a moderating influence on the Fed's deregulatory agenda, Reuters has previously reported https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-brainard/how-an-obama-fed-appointee-is-scuttling-wall-streets-bid-to-ease-rules-idUSKCN1TF14E, winning applause from progressive Democrats.
The S&P 500 bank index rose 2.8% on news of Powell's reappointment, but progressives said they hoped to win a more left-leaning supervision pick. They have voiced frustration that the White House has been slow to fill key regulatory posts, and have said the administration is not moving quickly enough to address climate https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-regulatory-panel-unveil-blueprint-tackling-financial-climate-risks-2021-10-21 financial risks.

Other names floated for the role according to Washington insiders include: Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former Fed governor; Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic; acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu; U.S. Treasury under-secretary Nellie Liang; and law professor Mehrsa Baradaran.
Raymond James analyst Ed Mills said the supervision pick will likely have ""very progressive views"" but that ""Powell’s leadership likely softens the impact.”

WARSAW/VILNIUS (Reuters) -Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki warned on Sunday that the migrant crisis on the Belarus border may be a prelude to ""something much worse"", and Poland's border guard said Belarusian forces were still ferrying migrants to the frontier.
The European Union accuses Belarus of flying in thousands of people from the Middle East and pushing them to cross into EU and NATO members Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, in response to European sanctions.
Minsk, which denies fomenting the crisis, cleared a migrant camp near the border on Thursday and started to repatriate some people to Iraq, while Poland and Lithuania reported lower numbers of attempts to cross their borders in recent days. 
But Morawiecki warned the crisis was far from over as he toured Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia on Sunday to discuss the situation.
A poll published by Poland's Rzeczpospolita daily on Sunday said 55% of Poles are worried the crisis on the border could escalate into an armed conflict.
""I think that the things that unfold before our eyes, these dramatic events, may only be a prelude to something much worse,"" Morawiecki said in Vilnius.
He pointed to increased Russian military presence close to Ukraine, as well as in Belarus and Russia's Kaliningrad enclave which borders Poland and Lithuania, as ""an instrument which could be used directly for a direct attack"".
The situation in Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover ""may be used as the next stage of the migration crisis,"" said Morawiecki.
CALLS FOR SUPPORT
Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte warned European partners to not ignore Belarus' neighbours, after German Chancellor Angela Merkel twice called Lukashenko looking for solution of the humanitarian crisis.
""For us, it is very important that any talks (with Belarus) are coordinated with Lithuania, Poland and Latvia, which are at the forefront of the hybrid attack, and no decisions are taken which do not solve the situation fundamentally"", she said after meeting with Morawiecki on Sunday.
France's foreign minister said on Sunday that Russia had to exert pressure on its ally, Belarus, to end the migrant crisis.
FORCIBLY BROUGHT TO BORDER
Poland says Minsk continues to truck hundreds of foreigners to the frontier, where about 10 migrants are believed to have died with a frigid winter setting in.
""On Saturday ... a group of about 100 very aggressive foreigners, brought to the border by Belarusian servicemen, tried to enter Poland by force,"" the border guard said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Sunday.

A dozen migrants from Iraq, speaking with Lithuanian news portal DELFI over the border with Belarus on Saturday, said they were forcibly brought there in military trucks by Belarus officials, who ignored their wish to go back to Iraq.
Hundreds of Poles took part in protests on Saturday to demand help for the migrants. The Catholic church organised a fundraiser on Sunday to collect money for those in need at the border and support the integration of refugees who will stay in Poland.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Michael Cohen, the onetime personal lawyer and fixer for former U.S. President Donald Trump, walked out of federal court a free man on Monday at the end of his three-year sentence for campaign finance violations and other crimes. 
Cohen, 55, told reporters outside the U.S. District Court in Manhattan that he remained under supervised release for three years and intended to work with law enforcement to ""ensure that others are held responsible for their dirty deeds and no one is ever believed to be above the law"".
Minutes later he tweeted a photograph of himself grinning as he displayed his release paperwork. 
""This is what freedom finally looks like!"" Cohen said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) alongside a photograph of himself, his hair greying and wearing a black winter jacket and blue jeans. He was seated behind the steering wheel of a car.
Cohen, who represented himself throughout the criminal proceeding, pleaded guilty in December 2018 to campaign finance wrongdoing, tax evasion and other violations.
COVID-19's devastating effects on the U.S. prison population resulted in Cohen's early release from a federal facility in New York state. He had spent a little over one year in the Otisville, New York, prison before being sent back to his luxury Park Avenue apartment to serve the rest of his term.

He had sought to end his home confinement on May 29, about six months early, saying he had completed hundreds of hours of work and courses while locked up with many other white collar inmates in Otisville, about 75 miles (120 km) northwest of his apartment.
But a federal judge rejected his request, ordering that he remained confined to his home until Nov. 22, reflecting more than five months of credits for good behavior.

BRUZGI, Belarus/WARSAW (Reuters) -Europe must not be blackmailed into accepting thousands of migrants stranded on its border with Belarus, Austria said, after Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko pressed the bloc to let them in after months of growing tension.
Lukashenko, who denies European Union allegations he fomented the crisis, said he did not want a cross-border clash as that could lead to war, while reiterating that the EU should accept some migrants while Belarus repatriates others.
Poland's border guard said Belarusian forces were still ferrying migrants flown in from the Middle East to the EU frontier, despite clearing camps near the border last week and moving many of the migrants to a warehouse.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, whose country, like other EU neighbours of Belarus, has sent armed reinforcements to the border, said on Sunday that the crisis might be a prelude to ""something much worse"". On Monday Lukashenko said an escalation could be catastrophic.
""We don't want confrontation. We don't need it. Because we understand that if we go too far, war is unavoidable,"" Lukashenko was quoted as saying by state-owned Belta news agency. ""And that will be a catastrophe. We understand this perfectly well. We don't want any kind of flare-up.""
Exiled Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya urged the bloc to get tougher on Minsk, which the EU says flies people in and pushes them to cross via Poland, Lithuania and Latvia in response to sanctions over Lukashenko's crushing of protests against his disputed re-election last year.
""NO BLACKMAIL""
The plan proposed by Belarus last week would entail EU countries taking in migrants, while Minsk would send another 5,000 back home, and Lukashenko said Belarus was preparing a second migrant repatriation flight at the end of this month.
Faced with an initial rebuff from the bloc, Lukashenko said on Monday he must insist Germany - the preferred destination of many migrants - take in a number of them.
Germany, and others, quickly rejected his renewed call. 
""The idea of having a humanitarian corridor to Germany for 2,000 migrants is not a solution that is acceptable to Germany or the EU,"" a government spokesman said on Monday, which Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg echoed in a joint news conference with Tikhanouskaya.
""The EU must not give in to blackmail from Lukashenko. We have to respond united and very clearly to this state-sponsored hybrid attack on the European Union,"" Schallenberg said.
LANGUAGE OF POWER
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, speaking to reporters after meeting with Lithuanian troops deployed at the border with Belarus, said he was reassured that Germany was not trying to agree any separate deals with Minsk.
""I think the time has come for bilateral contacts to be dropped in favour of multipolar contact, to avoid any suspicions that something happens behind someone's back,"" he said.
Belarus opposition leader Tsikhanouskaya said she could understand that German Chancellor Angela Merkel was trying to help the migrants when she talked with Lukashenko - who had long been shunned by EU leaders - on the phone last week. But she said it still looked ""very strange"" to break his isolation.
""Lukashenko's regime only understands the language of power, they don't understand diplomatic language,"" Tsikhanouskaya said, telling the EU the sanctions it had slapped on Minsk were not effective because there are too many loopholes.
THREAT TO CUT TRAIN LINK
Poland has threatened to sever a train link with Belarus if the situation does not improve, and Lukashenko was quoted as saying that threat could backfire, with rail traffic diverted to run through a conflict zone in eastern Ukraine instead.
Poland's government spokesman said no decision had been taken on the closure, though that option was on the table.
Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Marcin Przydacz said what happened next was up to Lukashenko. ""The EU...can find a way to trade with eastern European and Asian partners without Belarus,"" he told Reuters.
The Polish Economic Institute (PIE) said any closure of the border to train freight would be more costly for Belarus as exports account for up to 70% of its gross domestic product.

Humanitarian agencies say as many as 13 migrants have died at the border, where many have suffered in a cold, damp forest with little food or water as a frigid winter sets in.
A group of around 150 migrants tried to break through the border fence near the Polish village of Dubicze Cerkiewne on Sunday, the Polish border guard said.

The poll of more than 1,100 Germans, conducted by Kantar Public for the Koerber Foundation in September and October, also revealed that for the first time in many years, a majority sees China's growing influence on the world stage as negative.
Under outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel, Germany has benefited from strong business ties with China. But officials are becoming increasingly uneasy about a growing dependency on the world's second-largest economy.
Asked about Germany's relations with the United States, 71% said they viewed transatlantic ties as good or very good, according to ""The Berlin Pulse"" survey.
This marked a surge from the previous year's 18% when Donald Trump was still president.
The United States was described as Germany's most important ally by 44% in the survey, followed by France with 27%.
Germans would like to see closer cooperation with the United States on the world stage especially in security and defence (73%), free trade (64%) and human rights (63%).
""It is encouraging to see that the Trump years have not caused an irreversible alienation between Germans and Americans,"" said Nora Mueller, foreign policy expert at the Koerber Foundation.
""However, it remains to be seen whether the positive trend will continue, not least because a number of transatlantic issues are still unresolved,"" Mueller added.

For the first time since 2017, a majority of 55% viewed China's growing influence as negative, the survey showed.
Compared to Russia, China was seen as a bigger threat for the values of Germany's democratic order and its social-market economy.

WAUKESHA, Wis. (Reuters) - Five people were killed and more than 40 injured when an SUV sped through a Christmas parade in the small town of Waukesha, Wisconsin, on Sunday, plowing into dozens of people including young children.
Waukesha Police Chief Dan Thompson told reporters that one person was in custody and a vehicle had been recovered after the incident in the town of around 72,000 people, 20 miles (32 km) west of Milwaukee. 
Police said the number of dead and injured could change.
Thompson said it was not clear whether the incident was terrorist in nature, but that there was no further danger and police had lifted an order urging people to shelter.
A video posted online showed a red sport utility vehicle driving at speed alongside and into the parade, appearing to run over more than a dozen people before crowds ran from sidewalks to offer assistance. 
Thompson said an officer fired shots at the vehicle in an attempt to stop the carnage. Another video on social media appeared to show police firing on the vehicle as it crashed through street barriers. Police did not believe shots had been fired from the vehicle, Thompson added, contrary to earlier reports. 
Nurse Jodi Singsime, 42, took shelter in a store with members of her family before going out to help the injured.
""I heard and saw the people being hit, but what you could do more than seeing is hearing, and just that sound was insane,"" she said.
She choked up as she described coming across a small boy in the road:
""I felt his neck for a pulse and he had one but his eyes were barely open and his face - all I can remember is his sweet little innocent face was purple. He wasn't really with us.""
Belen Santamaria, her husband, and their three-year old daughter were planning to join the parade with their Catholic church. But Santamaria, a 39-year-old Mexican factory worker, woke up on Sunday with a backache, so the family watched the procession from the sidewalk instead. 
""The SUV came by at full speed,"" she said. ""Then I started to hear people screaming.""
She hid in a restaurant with their daughter while her husband, 39-year-old delivery worker Jesus Ochoa, ran to try to help injured people. He said he heard through other members of their church that roughly 10 members of the congregation, mostly Latinos and both adults and children, were injured.
""I was going to be there, walking,"" Santamaria said. ""The SUV would have hit us too.""
'DANCING GRANNIES'
Another woman told Milwaukee's Fox6 TV station that the SUV had hit a dance team of girls between 9 and 15 years old. Video on social media showed small groups surrounding injured girls with white pompoms scattered around.
One witness said the driver also hit a group of ""Dancing Grannies"" and at least one person flipped over the hood of the SUV, according to Milwaukee's WISN-TV, an ABC affiliate. 
""Please keep the Grannies, all those injured, and all those who witnessed this horrible event in your thoughts and prayers,"" the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies said on their Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. 
Another witness estimated the SUV was going about 40 mph (64 kph) when it hit the parade, the TV station said.
""As we were walking back in between the buildings ... we saw an SUV cross over, just put the pedal to the metal and just zooming full speed along the parade route. And then we heard a loud bang, and just deafening cries and screams from people who are struck by the vehicle,"" Angelito Tenorio, an alderman in nearby West Allis, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
The local CBS affiliate later showed a picture on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) of what appeared to be the red SUV involved with its hood crumpled and front fender hanging off, parked in a driveway.
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said President Joe Biden had been briefed on the ""tragic situation"" and federal officials were in contact with local authorities to offer assistance.
""Our hearts are with the families and the entire community,"" she said in a post on Twitter on Monday.
Photos and videos of Waukesha circulating on Twitter showed police cars and ambulances crowding a street decked out with Christmas lights in the aftermath of the incident, which occurred shortly after 4:30 p.m. (2230 GMT). People bundled up against the cold huddled on sidewalks as dusk fell.
The Children's Wisconsin hospital said it had received 15 patients as of 8 p.m., with no reported fatalities at that time.

Schools will remain closed on Monday for grades 4K-12 and additional counselors will be available for students, the district superintendent of schools said.
In 2015, four people were killed and 46 injured in Stillwater, Oklahoma, when a woman drove into a crowd watching the homecoming parade for a football team.

China, which claims democratically-ruled Taiwan as its own territory, has heaped pressure on the island to accept Beijing's rule. It said earlier this month it would hold those who support the island's formal independence, including companies, criminally liable.
China's official Xinhua news agency said early on Monday that law enforcement agencies across China had punished Taiwan's Far Eastern Group, which has interests ranging from hotels to petrochemicals, for a series of problems, from tax to fire safety, and that the investigation was continuing.
In a statement late on Monday answering a question on whether the move was linked to the government's targeting of ""stubbornly pro-Taiwan independence"" forces, China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not draw a direct link, repeating Xinhua's accusations against the company.
But it added in a separate sentence that those who support Taiwan independence threatened peace and stability and harmed the interests of the Chinese people.
""They and their connected companies and financiers must be punished in accordance with the law,"" it said.
China welcomes Taiwanese companies, but does not allow those who support Taiwan independence to earn money in China, the office added.
""The majority of Taiwanese businessmen and enterprises must distinguish right from wrong, stand firm, draw a clear line with the Taiwan independence separatist forces, and take practical actions to maintain the peaceful development of cross-strait relations,"" it said.
While the Far Eastern Group has not responded to requests for comment, one of its listed units, Far Eastern New Century Corp, said its textile operations in China had been inspected by law enforcement in the second quarter, who did find problems over tax, fire safety and environmental protection.
It added it had made almost all the changes that had been required, having been fined 36.5 million yuan ($5.72 million).

Taiwan's government has yet to comment. Taiwan says it is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name, and that Beijing has no right to speak for it or pressure its elected representatives.

(Reuters) -Ahmaud Arbery was a 25-year-old Black man running through a mostly white neighborhood on Feb. 23, 2020, when he was chased by three white men in two trucks, and shot and killed about 2 miles (3.2 km) from his mother's house near Brunswick (NYSE:BC), Georgia.
Here is the timeline of the case:
FEB. 23, 2020
Before 1 p.m. on Sunday Arbery left his mother's house, for a jog just outside coastal Brunswick, Georgia, his aunt, Thea Brooks said.
He crossed a four-lane highway into the Satilla Shores subdivision, lined with saw palmettos, old oaks draped with Spanish moss, and ranch-style homes with boat docks along the Little Satilla River.
About 2 miles (3.2 km) into his run, he passes Greg McMichael, who is in his driveway working on boat cushions. McMichael later tells police he thought Arbery might have been running from a crime. He yells to his son Travis McMichael to get a gun and they both give chase in a pickup truck, police reports say. They are then joined by a neighbor, William ""Roddie"" Bryan, in his own pickup truck, who videos part of the encounter on his cellphone.
After being boxed in by the trucks, Arbery is seen on video reaching for a shotgun leveled at him by Travis McMichael. Arbery is fatally shot three times, turns to run one last time, and falls prone on the street.
Glynn County police officers interview the McMichaels and Bryan, but do not file charges, following directions from Jackie Johnson, Brunswick Judicial Circuit's district attorney, a grand jury later found. 
Greg McMichael, a former Glynn County policeman, also worked as an investigator for Johnson.
Feb. 24, 2020
Johnson recuses herself from the case because of her connection with McMichael and informally hands it over to the Waycross Judicial Circuit. 
FEB. 27, 2020
Waycross Judicial Circuit's District Attorney George Barnhill formally takes the case, at the behest of Johnson, court records show.
April 7, 2020
Barnhill recuses himself from the case, telling his boss, Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, that he didn't realize his son had previously worked with Greg McMichael in Johnson's office.
Carr transfers the case to the Atlantic Circuit's District Attorney Tom Durden.
May 5, 2020
A Brunswick radio station, WGIG, is given a copy of Bryan's video of the shooting by an attorney and posts it online. It becomes widely distributed on the internet, sparking a national uproar. Within hours, Durden announces a grand jury investigation. The same day, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp orders the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) to take the case.
May 7, 2020
GBI investigators arrest the McMichaels, charging them each with murder and other crimes. This is 74 days since the shooting.
May 11, 2020
Durden steps aside and Georgia Attorney General Carr appoints Cobb County's District Attorney Joyette Holmes to lead the prosecution. Cobb is the fourth district attorney to take the case.
May 21, 2020
GBI agents arrest Bryan and charge him with murder.
On June 24, 2020
A grand jury formally indicts all three men on charges of murder, aggravated assault and false imprisonment. 
Nov. 3, 2020
Johnson, who had been the Brunswick Judicial Circuit's district attorney for 10 year, loses her re-election bid, following a grassroots campaign against her spurred by the Arbery case.
Sept. 2, 2021
Johnson is indicted by a grand jury, which accused her of ""showing favor and affection"" to the McMichaels. She is charged with violation of oath of office and obstructing a law enforcement officer.
She has told the media that she did nothing wrong and is currently out on $10,000 bond.

Oct. 18, 2021
The trial starts. It takes 13 days to seat a jury of 11 white people and one black person. All three men are being tried jointly.

LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) -Flushed with victory after Prime Minister Narendra Modi caved into demands for agricultural reform laws to be repealed, Indian farmers held a mass rally on Monday to demand minimum support prices be extended to all produce, not just rice and wheat.
The protest movement launched by farmers more than a year ago became the most serious political challenge to the government, and resulted in Modi making a surprise commitment on Friday to roll back the reforms.
Thousands gathered for the latest rally in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, where Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party will seek to hold onto power in state elections due early next year. They turned their attention to minimum support prices (MSP), which were a side issue in the agricultural reform laws.
""Our battle is only half won,"" Joginder Singh Ugrahan, a prominent farmers' leader, said in an address to about 5,000 farmers waving flags of various farmer and labour organisations. 
""Ensuring that the government makes a law MSP is a big issue for all of us,"" he said. ""Our protests will end once the government passes the law on MSP.""
Currently, the government mainly buys rice and wheat at minimum support prices or guaranteed prices, but the safety net benefits barely 6% of India's millions of farmers.
In a letter addressed to Modi on Sunday, the main farmers' body said: ""Minimum Support Price, based on the comprehensive cost of production, should be made a legal entitlement of all farmers (and) for all agricultural produce . . .""

Farmers also asked in the letter for the federal government to withdraw a draft electricity bill, which they fear would lead to state governments withdrawing their right to free or subsidised power, used mainly for irrigation.
Farmers have also asked the government to drop fines and other penalties for burning their fields after harvesting to remove stalk and chaff. The smoke has become a major source of air pollution in Delhi and satellite towns bordering the crop growing northern states.

Gregory McMichael, 65; his son Travis McMichael, 35, who shot Arbery with a shotgun; and neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52, have pleaded not guilty to charges of murder, aggravated assault and false imprisonment. They told police they thought Arbery was running from a crime as he ""hauled ass"" past the McMichaels' home in the Satilla Shores subdivision.
They wanted to make a citizen's arrest, they told police. Arbery's family and their supporters say he was targeted because he was Black.
Here are some highlights of the trial before Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley of Georgia's Eastern Judicial District: 
Nov. 3: 
A jury of 11 white people and one Black man is selected in Glynn County Superior Court. It took almost three weeks because many potential jurors told the court they personally knew Arbery or know some or all of the defendants.
During jury selection, Kevin Gough, who represents Bryan, complained that the potential jury pool didn't contain enough white men over 40 without a college degree - people he called ""Joe Six-pack"" and ""Bubba.""
Prosecutors tried unsuccessfully to argue that defense lawyers rejected many potential jurors because they were Black, which the U.S. Supreme Court has long deemed unconstitutional.
Nov. 5:
The jury is seated, and opening statements were made. Cobb County prosecutor Linda Dunikoski told the jury that the defendants had deadly intent. She pointed to something the elder McMichael told police he shouted at Arbery: ""Stop or I'll blow your fucking head off!""
Defense attorney Rob Rubin, representing the younger McMichael, told the jury that the men were trying to make a citizen's arrest.
""It is a citizen's job to help the police, and the law authorizes that,"" Rubin said. ""When seconds count, the police are often minutes away.""
Nov. 10:
Glynn County Police Detective Roderic Nohilly told the jury that Greg McMichael said Arbery realized he was not going to get away.
""He was trapped like a rat,"" the elder McMichael told the detective a few hours after the deadly pursuit, according to an interview transcript read aloud in court.
Nov. 11
The jury heard recorded police calls and saw surveillance videos of Arbery walking around a vacant, half-built house, over the weeks and months before his death. The final visit was just minutes before he was shot.
The McMichaels told police they were aware of reports of an unidentified Black man wandering around the property.
Outside of the jury's presence, defense attorney Kevin Gough complained to the court that civil rights leader Al Sharpton, a nationally known Black preacher, was in the courtroom with the Arbery family.
Gough said his team did not want ""any more Black pastors coming"" into the Georgia courtroom, saying it might influence the jury.
Judge Walmsley said, ""I am not going to blanketly exclude members of the public.""
Nov. 16
After eight days of testimony and 23 witnesses, the prosecution rested its case after presenting evidence it said showed the defendants wrongly assumed the worst about a Black man jogging through the mostly white Satilla Shores neighborhood.
The state rested after the jury was shown graphic photos of Arbery's body and hearing testimony from the medical examiner.
Nov. 17
Travis McMichael, the man who shot Arbery, took the stand in his own defense and testified, at times on the verge of tears, that he thought Arbery was a burglar and said Arbery tried to take his weapon. 
""I shot him. He had my gun,"" Travis McMichael said. ""It was a life-or-death situation.""
He testified about his Coast Guard training to apprehend suspects in the line of duty, protecting high-value ships and intercepting drug dealers or helping immigration officials.
Nov. 18
A prosecutor questioned Travis McMichael over apparent inconsistencies in the accounts he gave to police of how he chased and shot Arbery.
McMichael said his statements to police that day were ""choppy"" because he was nervous and under stress.

""I just killed a man,"" he said. ""I had blood on me still. It was the most traumatic event of my life."" 
The defense teams rested their cases and jurors were told to return on Monday morning for closing arguments.

Netanyahu, now opposition leader, smiled under his black face mask as he walked into the Jerusalem District courtroom to hear the testimony of his former spokesman and close adviser Nir Hefetz, one of a small group of ex-aides to turn state's witness against the country's first premier to be criminally charged while still in office. 
""Netanyahu spends at least as much as his time on media as he spends on security matters, including on matters an outsider would consider nonsense,"" Hefetz told the court. 
Netanyahu, 72, is not required to attend the trial hearings and he has made few court appearances. He made no comment to reporters as slogans shouted outside in the street by a cluster of his supporters wafted into the courtroom who faced off with a small group of anti-Netanyahu protesters. 

Netanyahu's trial has been a polarising issue for Israelis. His loyal supporters bemoan it as a left-wing witch-hunt that targeted a popular right-wing leader, while his staunch critics hail it as the triumph of law over grave government corruption that had plunged Israel into two years of political turmoil. 
After four inconclusive elections, Netanyahu's former right-wing ally Naftali Bennett in June unseated Israel's longest- serving leader by forming a patchwork coalition government of rightist, centrist, left-wing and Muslim Arab parties.

392,"<span>Nov 22, 2021 04:56AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Sudan's military has announced a deal to reinstate Abdalla Hamdok as prime minister, just under a month after dissolving his government in a coup.
The agreement faces opposition from protesters who previously saw Hamdok as a symbol of resistance to military rule but viewed his signature of the deal as a betrayal. 
WHAT'S IN THE AGREEMENT? 
The agreement signed on Sunday says Hamdok will lead a government of technocrats during a political transition expected to last until 2023, and that all political detainees are to be freed.
It is meant to be based on an earlier deal struck between the military and civilian political forces in the wake of the overthrow of Omar al-Bashir in 2019, under which they agreed to share power until elections - though that partnership was halted by the coup.
It provides for the investigation of casualties during recent demonstrations, and for the completion of a peace process signed by some Sudanese rebel groups in Juba last year.
WHAT'S CHANGED?
The military says its takeover was a ""correction"" to move beyond political infighting, and that the transition towards elections can now continue. 
Opponents argue the agreement provides legal cover for the coup and allows the military to bolster its position by replacing democrats with loyalists in positions of authority, thereby subverting the transition and the goals of the 2019 uprising that toppled Bashir. 
HOW DID WE GET HERE? 
Sudan's power sharing arrangement had come under increasing strain as civilians pressed for reform of the military, justice for protesters killed in 2019, and the delivery of Bashir and others wanted over crimes in Darfur to the International Criminal Court.
The military accused political factions of incitement against the army, while civilian groups said the military was manoeuvring to grab power. On Oct. 25 it did so, arresting its most prominent critics and placing Hamdok under house arrest. 
Much of the international community condemned the coup and pro-democracy groups in Sudan began a campaign of mass rallies and civil disobedience. Local mediation efforts backed by the United Nations sought a return to power sharing as the military moved to consolidate its position.
HOW MUCH SUPPORT DOES THE DEAL HAVE?
Hamdok, who had resisted military pressure to dissolve his government immediately before the coup, said he signed the deal in order to prevent further bloodshed after a crackdown left several dozen protesters dead. 
The military has the support of some former rebel factions that signed the Juba peace deal and social leaders prominent under Bashir. The United Nations, the Arab League, the African Union and Western states cautiously welcomed the agreement.
However, the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) political coalition that had been sharing power with the military, as well as pro-democracy activists who have led protests since the 2019 uprising, have rejected it. 
Angered by the coup and protester deaths, they are demanding that the military exit politics and be held to account in the courts, raising the prospect of continued demonstrations. 
WHY DOES IT MATTER?
The fate of the deal will determine the balance of power in Sudan, a country of 46 million people in which a popular uprising had carved a way out from decades of autocracy, internal conflict and economic isolation under Bashir.
Hamdok's government had secured agreement for relief on more than $56 billion in foreign debt - a step thrown into doubt by the coup. It had carried out painful economic reforms that it said were starting to bear fruit against a backdrop of shortages and widespread poverty. 

It had also agreed to take steps to follow other Arab states in normalising ties with Israel.
Sudan's course will have a bearing on a volatile region bordering the Sahel, the Red Sea and the Horn of Africa where international powers are vying for influence. The conflict in Ethiopia's Tigray region sent tens of thousands of refugees into Sudan one year ago, and renewed tensions over farmlands on the neighbours' disputed border.

CARACAS (Reuters) -Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE) awarded victory to the ruling Socialist party in 20 governorships and three to opposition politicians in an initial announcement on Monday following local and regional elections.
Shortly after the first results were published, leftist President Nicolas Maduro celebrated the government's triumph.
""The victory is impressive,"" Maduro said, surrounded by supporters, adding that ""good wins must be celebrated.""
The results are a setback for the opposition https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuelan-opposition-calls-change-campaign-wraps-up-2021-11-18 leaders who returned to the fray after boycotting presidential polls in 2018 and congressional elections in 2020, arguing that a fair vote was impossible due to rigging and intimidation by violent gangs loyal to Maduro. 
This year, the opposition politicians decided to contest the elections as they were frustrated by the failure of U.S. sanctions to dislodge Maduro, as well as emboldened by the presence of election observers from the European Union https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/back-venezuela-eu-observers-plead-patience-ahead-elections-2021-11-15.
Only 41.8% of registered voters turned out to cast their ballot on Sunday, equivalent to some 8.1 million people, the South American country's top electoral authority said.
""Small and isolated problems"" were registered during the course of voting, the CNE said earlier in the day. 
In 2017's regional elections the ruling party won 19 governorships, while opposition politicians took four.
The only mayoral result announced in the CNE's first bulletin came from the capital Caracas - where the ruling party was also declared the victor. 
Citizens cast their votes for over 3,000 state governors, mayors and city councils across the country, with 21 million Venezuelans registered to take part in the elections. 
'LAMENTABLE FOR THE OPPOSITION'
The poor performance by the opposition could hurt its ability to contest the presidential elections in 2024.
""This result is lamentable for the opposition,"" Luis Vicente Leon, director of local consulting firm Datanalisis, said in a post on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Opposition leader and former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles, who led the opposition campaign, said via Twitter that an assessment will be made when all the results are in and did not give further details.

""The takeaway from these results is that we must rethink our strategy so far,"" Tomas Guanipa, the opposition candidate for the mayor of Caracas, said. 
""What is undeniable is that the vast majority of this country wants change, and that is why we have to fight.""

Beijing's territorial claims over the sea clash with those of several Southeast Asian nations and have raised alarm from Washington to Tokyo.
But Xi said China would never seek hegemony nor take advantage of its size to coerce smaller countries, and would work with ASEAN to eliminate ""interference"".
""China was, is, and will always be a good neighbour, good friend, and good partner of ASEAN,"" Chinse state media quoted Xi as saying. 
China’s assertion of sovereignty over the South China Sea has set it against ASEAN members Vietnam and the Philippines, while Brunei, Taiwan and Malaysia also lay claim to parts.
The Philippines on Thursday condemned https://www.reuters.com/world/china/philippines-condemns-chinese-coast-guards-action-south-china-sea-2021-11-18 the actions of three Chinese coast guard vessels that it said blocked and used water cannon on resupply boats headed towards a Philippine-occupied atoll in the sea.
The United States on Friday called the Chinese actions ""dangerous, provocative, and unjustified,"" and warned that an armed attack on Philippine vessels would invoke U.S. mutual defence commitments.
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte told the summit hosted by Xi that he ""abhors"" the altercation and said the rule of law was the only way out of the dispute. He referred to a 2016 international arbitration ruling which found China's maritime claim to the sea had no legal basis.
""This does not speak well of the relations between our nations,"" said Duterte, who will leave office next year and has been criticised in the past for failing to condemn China's conduct in the disputed waters.
ASEAN groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
MYANMAR NO SHOW
Xi told the summit that China and ASEAN had ""cast off the gloom of the Cold War"" - when the region was wracked by superpower competition and conflicts such as the Vietnam War - and had jointly maintained regional stability.
China frequently criticises the United States for ""Cold War thinking"" when Washington engages its regional allies to push back against Beijing's growing military and economic influence. 
U.S. President Joe Biden joined ASEAN leaders for a virtual summit in October and pledged greater engagement with the region.
The summit was held without a representative from Myanmar, Malaysia's Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah said on Monday. The reason for the non-attendance was not immediately clear, and a spokesperson for Myanmar's military government did not answer calls seeking comment.
ASEAN sidelined Myanmar junta leader Min Aung Hlaing, who has led a bloody crackdown on dissent since seizing power on Feb. 1, from virtual summits last month over his failure to make inroads in implementing an agreed peace plan, in an unprecedented exclusion for the bloc. 

Myanmar refused to send junior representation and blamed ASEAN for departing from its non-interference principle and caving to Western pressure.
China lobbied for Min to attend the summit, according to diplomatic sources.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) -Chile is headed for a polarized presidential election runoff next month after hard-right former congressman Jose Antonio Kast finished on top in the first-round vote on Sunday, ahead of leftist lawmaker and former protest leader Gabriel Boric.
With nearly 97% of the vote counted, Kast had won 27.94% of ballots versus 25.75% for Boric, with a sizeable gap between them and the rest of the field, although both were well short of the majority needed to win outright.
More moderate, center-right candidates performed well, a potential boost for Kast, who appears to be in pole position heading into the Dec. 19 runoff.
""It was a better night for the right-wing than anyone expected,"" said Gonzalo Cordero, a political consultant and columnist. 
""Today, the likelihood of Kast winning the presidential election is very high. Kast would have to commit very significant errors in the next three weeks to lose.""
The election, the copper-producing Andean country's most divisive since its 1990 return to democracy, has split voters between those seeking a shake-up of Chile's free-market model and those demanding a harder line against crime and immigration.
It comes after two years of sometimes violent https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chile-protests-idUSKBN1X81N4 protests by Chileans demanding quality-of-life improvements. The demonstrations helped bring about an ongoing rewrite of the nation's Pinochet-era constitution and propelled the candidacy of Boric, who for much of the race held a comfortable lead.
But increasing fatigue among Chileans fed up with political violence, combined with a widespread perception that crime is on the rise, has boosted Kast https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/burning-metro-chile-election-divides-voters-between-protest-order-2021-11-20.
""Today, Chile's people have spoken,"" Kast said in a long speech to supporters after the results came in, targeting crime and disorder as he has done for much of the campaign, helping tap into fears over protest violence and immigration.
He said the election was a choice between ""liberty and communism"", a dig at Boric's wide leftist alliance, which includes the Communist Party.
Boric, facing a fight to close the ground on Kast over the next month, touched upon crime and the drug trade in his own speech, something he did rarely ahead of the vote, and admitted the need to widen his support base.
""The crusade is that hope wins over fear,"" he said. ""We have to look further afield and go out to bring people in from beyond our boundaries.""
Kast, a 55-year-old father of nine, has praised the neo-liberal ""economic legacy"" of former dictator Augusto Pinochet https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/pinochets-ghost-haunts-divisive-chilean-election-2021-11-21. His frank talk, across-the-board conservatism and sometimes idiosyncratic policy ideas, such as digging a ditch to curb illegal immigration, have drawn frequent comparisons https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/chiles-bolsonaro-hard-right-kast-rises-with-frank-talk-crime-focus-2021-11-16 with former U.S. President Donald Trump and Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro.
Boric, a 35-year-old lawmaker who led student protests in 2011 demanding improvements to Chile's education system, has pledged to scrap the nation's laissez-faire economic model https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/former-protest-leader-boric-seeks-bury-chiles-neoliberal-past-2021-11-17, while strengthening environmental protections and indigenous rights.
KINGMAKERS?
In a surprise, economist Franco Parisi, who is living in the United States and did not set foot in Chile during the campaign, was in third place as of the late evening with some 13% of the vote. That could bode well for Kast, who, while more to the right on social and cultural issues, shares many of Parisi's conservative economic beliefs.
Center-right candidate Sebastian Sichel and center-left Yasna Provoste were just behind, with 12.7% and 11.65% of the vote, respectively.
The current center-right president, Sebastian Pinera, is constitutionally barred from seeking re-election. 
Kast and Boric will be scrambling to pick up Sichel, Parisi and Provoste voters in a second round, making the more moderate contenders potential kingmakers https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/chiles-centrists-overshadowed-election-could-yet-play-kingmaker-2021-11-19.
""I am not going to vote for Gabriel Boric's candidacy, and I have programmatic differences with Kast, but I will communicate any decision later,"" Sichel said as the results came in, adding he had congratulated Kast on making it to a second round.
""I don't want the extreme left to win in Chile.""

Also up for grabs on Sunday night were all 155 seats in Chile's lower house, 27 of the 50 seats in the country's upper house and all positions in the nation's 16 regional councils.
Lawmakers from hard-right and conservative coalitions looked on course to finish the night with 23 seats in the Senate, while lawmakers from center-left and hard-left coalitions seemed set to finish with 22 seats. The remaining five seats went to independents unaffiliated with any major political coalition.

MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - Manchester United sacked manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on Sunday, a day after a 4-1 defeat by promoted Watford left the Old Trafford club seventh in the Premier League.
Former player Michael Carrick, a member of Solskjaer's coaching staff, will take charge of the United team for Tuesday's Champions League match away to Villarreal with the club saying they will then look to appoint an interim manager to lead the side until the end of the season.
Norwegian Solskjaer, 48, had signed a three-year contract extension until 2024 in July but he was dismissed after United lost five of their last seven league games, including defeats by Aston Villa, Leicester City, Liverpool and Manchester City.
""Manchester United announces that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has left his role as manager. Ole will always be a legend at Manchester United and it is with regret that we have reached this difficult decision,"" United said in a statement.
""While the past few weeks have been disappointing, they should not obscure all the work he has done over the past three years to rebuild the foundations for long-term success.""
Solskjaer played for United as a striker from 1996-2007, scoring the stoppage-time winning goal in the 1999 Champions League final against Bayern Munich to ensure he would always hold a special place in the club's history. 
That triumph in Barcelona completed an unprecedented treble of major trophies for United in the 1998-99 season and Solskjaer netted 91 goals in 235 Premier League appearances for the club, many after coming off the substitutes' bench.
""This club means everything to me and together we’re a good match, but unfortunately I couldn’t get the results we needed and it’s time for me to step aside,"" Solskjaer said in an interview with the club's MUTV channel.
""I’m so honoured and privileged to have been trusted to take the club forward, and I really hope that I leave it in a better state than when I came,"" he added.
United have not won the Premier League since Alex Ferguson's last season in charge in 2013. 
The club signed Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo in August but after a good start to the campaign they have slipped to seventh in the standings after 12 games, 12 points behind leaders Chelsea.
INTERIM BASIS
Solskjaer took over from Jose Mourinho in December 2018, initially on an interim basis, but after guiding United to 14 wins in 19 matches in all competitions he was given the job permanently in March 2019.
United showed signs of progress to finish third in the league in 2019-2020 and second the following season but their form has imploded in this campaign.
A 4-2 defeat at Leicester City on Oct. 16 was followed by a humiliating 5-0 hammering at home by arch-rivals Liverpool and although a 3-0 win at Tottenham Hotspur raised the possibility of a revival, United's last two displays sealed Solskjaer's fate.
A 2-0 home loss to champions Manchester City was hardly a shock but they were utterly outclassed by Pep Guardiola's side who toyed with United throughout the game.
The shambolic 4-1 defeat by lowly Watford left United's board with little choice but to make a change.
The club's hierarchy, including owner Joel Glazer and outgoing executive vice-chairman Ed  Woodward  (NASDAQ:WWD), have long faced opposition from fans and the unusual decision to make Carrick a ""pre-interim"" manager will raise eyebrows.

It is standard practice for clubs to place a member of the coaching staff in temporary charge while they search for a new permanent boss but not for a club to announce they are looking for an interim short-term manager as their next appointment.
Bookmakers have installed former Real Madrid coach and France midfielder Zinedine Zidane as favourite to be the next permanent manager of the club.

While the flood situation in Canada's westernmost province remains serious, there have been some improvements as water levels drop and roads and highways reopen, Bill Blair, minister of emergency preparedness, told a media conference. But more potentially damaging weather is forecast for the province this week.
Blair said the exemption would allow people living in a border community who travel to the United States for essential goods to return without the requirement of a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test.
British Columbia declared a state of emergency after a phenomenon known as an ""atmospheric river"" brought a month's worth of rain in two days, paralyzing parts of the province, leading to food and fuel shortages.
The flooding has killed at least four people and could become one of Canada's worst natural disasters.
The province has imposed an 8-gallon (30-litre) limit for fuel purchases for non-essential vehicles.
More rain, wind and snow are forecast for the province's North Coast regional district, which includes Haida Gwaii, an archipelago off the northern Pacific coast, through Monday, potentially causing flooding and landslides. 
Last week's flooding washed out roads and railways, cutting off Vancouver, Canada's third-biggest city, and the lower mainland region from the rest of the country, and blocking access to some towns entirely.

Canadian Transport Minister Omar Alghabra said he is optimistic that the rail corridor will be reopened by midweek, based on feedback from rail operators.
Some 500 Canadian troops will be in the province by Sunday night to help with rescue efforts.

(Reuters) - The woman who was engaged to marry Jamal Khashoggi has asked singer Justin Bieber to cancel his scheduled Dec. 5 performance in Saudi Arabia's second-largest city Jeddah, urging him to not perform for the slain Saudi journalist's ""murderers.""
Hatice Cengiz wrote an open letter to the singer published on Saturday in the Washington Post in which she urged Bieber to cancel the performance to ""send a powerful message to the world that your name and talent will not be used to restore the reputation of a regime that kills its critics.""
President Joe Biden's administration released a U.S. intelligence report in February implicating Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Khashoggi's 2018 murder in Istanbul but spared him any direct punishment. The crown prince denies any involvement. 
""Do not sing for the murderers of my beloved Jamal,"" Cengiz wrote. ""Please speak out and condemn his killer, Mohammed bin Salman. Your voice will be heard by millions.""
Bieber, who is Canadian, is among a group of artists scheduled to perform as Saudi Arabia hosts the Formula One Saudi Arabian Grand Prix in Jeddah. 
""If you refuse to be a pawn of MBS, your message will be loud and clear: I do not perform for dictators. I choose justice and freedom over money,"" Cengiz wrote, using the crown prince's initials.
Human rights groups have urged the performers to speak out against human rights issues in the kingdom.
""Saudi Arabia has a history of using celebrities and major international events to deflect scrutiny from its pervasive abuses,"" Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday.

The advocacy group urged the performers, who also include rapper A$AP Rocky, DJs David Guetta and Tiesto and singer Jason Derulo, ""to speak out publicly on rights issues or, when reputation-laundering is the primary purpose, not participate.""

Photos and videos of Peng at a children's tournament in Beijing published earlier in the day had done little to quell that unease, following a nearly three-week public absence after she alleged that a former senior Chinese official sexually assaulted her. 
In a statement, the IOC said Peng began the 30-minute call with its president Thomas Bach by thanking the Olympic organization for its concern. 
""She explained that she is safe and well, living at her home in Beijing, but would like to have her privacy respected at this time,"" the IOC's statement said. 
""That is why she prefers to spend her time with friends and family right now. Nevertheless, she will continue to be involved in tennis, the sport she loves so much.""
France's foreign minister had earlier called on the Chinese authorities to provide more reassurance, echoing a statement by the Women's Tennis Association that the images of Peng at the tournament were ""insufficient"" proof.
""I'm expecting only one thing: that she speaks,"" France's Jean-Yves Le Drian told LCI television, adding that there could be unspecified diplomatic consequences if China did not clear up the situation. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the IOC's statement. 
The United States and Britain had also called for China to provide proof of Peng's whereabouts. 
Current and former tennis players, from Naomi Osaka to Serena Williams to Billie Jean King, had joined the calls seeking to confirm she was safe, using the social media hashtag #WhereIsPengShuai? World No.1 Novak Djokovic said it would be strange to hold tournaments in China unless the ""horrific"" situation was resolved.
The concern over Peng came as global rights groups and others have called for a boycott of the Winter Olympics in Beijing in February over China's human rights record. 
On Nov. 2, Peng posted on Chinese social media that former Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli had sexually assaulted her several years ago. 
Neither Zhang nor the Chinese government have commented on her allegation. Peng's social media post was quickly deleted and the topic has been blocked from discussion on China's heavily censored internet. 
Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the state-backed Global Times, posted a 25-second video on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Sunday that showed Peng smiling, waving and autographing giant tennis balls for children at the Fila Kids Junior Tennis Challenger Finals tournament. The Global Times is published by the People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party.
The event's official WeChat page showed photos of her at the tournament. Peng, 35, was the world No.1 doubles player in 2014, the first Chinese player to achieve a top ranking, after winning the doubles titles at Wimbledon in 2013 and the French Open in 2014.
On Saturday night, Peng visited a popular restaurant in downtown Beijing, according to a video posted by Hu that a restaurant manager confirmed to Reuters on Sunday.
Seven people including Peng were at the Sichuanese restaurant, said the manager, Zhou Hongmei, adding that they ate in a private room and were joined by the restaurant's owner. 
""It was crowded at the restaurant as usual,"" Zhou said, showing a bill that included noodles and bamboo shoots. ""They didn't have much. I think they mostly chatted.""
A spokesperson for the Women's Tennis Association (WTA), which has threatened to pull tournaments out of China, had said earlier that the photos and video were ""insufficient"" and did not address the WTA's concerns.
The International Tennis Federation (ITF) said it would continue to seek confirmation from Peng that she was safe.

Chinese state media outlet CGTN on Wednesday released what it said was an email Peng had sent to the WTA's chairman denying she had been sexually assaulted.
WTA chairman Steve Simon said he had a hard time believing that Peng herself had written the email.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan's military reinstated Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok on Sunday and promised to release all political detainees after weeks of deadly unrest triggered by a coup, although large crowds took to the streets to reject any deal involving the army.
Under an agreement signed with military leader General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Hamdok, first appointed after the overthrow of autocrat Omar al-Bashir in a 2019 uprising, will lead a civilian government of technocrats for a transitional period.
The deal faces opposition from pro-democracy groups that have demanded full civilian rule since Bashir's ouster and have been angered by the deaths of dozens of protesters since the Oct. 25 coup.
A hero for the protest movement, Hamdok quickly became the villain for some. 
""Hamdok has sold the revolution,"" protesters chanted after the deal was announced. The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), a leading protest group, called it ""treacherous"". 
Tens of thousands of people joined scheduled rallies in the capital, Khartoum, and its twin cities of Omdurman and Bahri. Security forces fired bullets and tear gas to disperse them, witnesses said. A 16-year-old protester in Omdurman died from a bullet wound, the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors said.
""Hamdok has disappointed us. Our only option is the street,"" said Omar Ibrahim, a 26-year-old protester in Khartoum.
The United States, Britain, Norway, the European Union, Canada and Switzerland welcomed the reinstatement of Hamdok and in a joint statement urged the release of other political detainees. The United Nations also welcomed Sunday's deal 
Western powers had condemned last month's takeover and suspended economic assistance to Sudan, which has been trying to recover from a deep economic crisis.
The coup triggered mass demonstrations against the military, and medics aligned with the protest movement say security forces have killed 41 civilians in increasingly violent crackdowns. 
Hamdok said he agreed to the deal to prevent more casualties. 
""Sudanese blood is precious. Let us stop the bloodshed and direct the youth's energy into building and development,"" he said at a signing ceremony broadcast on state television.
Burhan said the deal would be inclusive. ""We do not want to exclude anyone except, as we've agreed, the National Congress Party,"" he said, referring to Bashir's former ruling party. 
But the agreement made no mention of the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC), the civilian coalition that shared power with the military before the coup. A number of people at the signing ceremony had political ties to Bashir.
'NO LEGITIMACY' 
The FFC said it did not recognise any agreement with the military. The Sudanese Congress Party, a leading FFC member, several of whose leaders are detained, described Hamdok joining the deal as ""illegitimate and unconstitutional"" and providing political cover for the coup.
Several of the resistance committees that have been organising protests also put out statements rejecting any deal with the military. 
Hamdok was placed under house arrest when the military seized power, derailing a transition towards elections in 2023.
The military dissolved Hamdok's Cabinet and detained a number of civilians who held top positions under the power-sharing deal agreed after Bashir was toppled.
Politicians Omer Eldigair, Yasir Arman, Ali Alrayah Alsanhouri and Siddig al-Mahdi would be released on Sunday night, a government source said. Only Arman is among the former sitting officials, many of whom had engaged in a war of words with military leaders before the coup.

Under Sunday's deal, a constitutional declaration struck between the military and civilians in 2019 will remain the foundation in further talks.
""The next government will focus on limited issues, chiefly the democratic transition,"" Al Jazeera quoted Hamdok as saying in an interview. Hamdok said elections would take place before July 2023, the channel added.

Populist politics, the use of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions to silence critics, a tendency of countries to mimic the anti-democratic behaviour of others, and disinformation used to divide societies are mainly to blame, the Stockholm-based intergovernmental organisation said in a report.
""More countries than ever are suffering from 'democratic erosion',"" IDEA said in its 2021 study on the state of democracy, relying on data compiled since 1975.
""The number of countries undergoing 'democratic backsliding' has never been as high,"" it said, referring to the regressive turn in areas including checks on government and judicial independence, as well as media freedom and human rights.
Afghanistan, which was taken over by Taliban militants in August after international troops withdrew, is the most dramatic case this year, while Myanmar's Feb. 1 coup marked the collapse of a fragile democracy. Other examples include Mali, which has suffered two coups since 2020, and Tunisia, where the president has dissolved parliament and assumed emergency powers.
Large democracies such as Brazil and the United States have seen presidents question the validity of election results, while India has witnessed the prosecution of groups of people critical of government policies.
Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Serbia are the European countries with the greatest declines in democracy. Turkey has seen one of the largest declines between 2010 and 2020. 
""In fact, 70 per cent of the global population now live either in non-democratic regimes or in democratically backsliding countries,"" the report said.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in authoritarian behaviour by governments. The study said that there was no evidence that authoritarian regimes were better at fighting the pandemic, despite Chinese state media reports to the contrary.
""The pandemic provides additional tools and justification for repressive tactics and silencing of dissent in countries as diverse as Belarus, Cuba, Myanmar, Nicaragua and Venezuela,"" the report said.

PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Two of the 17 American and Canadian Christian missionaries taken hostage in Haiti last month have been released, the group that arranged for their trip to the Caribbean nation said on Sunday, without giving further details.
""We have learned that two of the hostages in Haiti were released,"" Ohio-based Christian Aid Ministries said in a statement.
The 16 Americans and one Canadian, including five children, were abducted in October after visiting an orphanage. The incident has highlighted Haiti's dire kidnapping problem, which has worsened amid economic and political crises and escalating violence.

Reached by Reuters, the spokesperson of the Haitian National Police, Gary Desrosiers, confirmed that two hostages had been released Sunday.
The officials have previously said a gang known as 400 Mawozo was demanding $1 million per person ransom. A man identifying himself as the leader of the gang said in a video posted on YouTube last month that he was willing to kill hostages if he did not get what he wanted.

Payet fell to the ground as he was getting ready to take a corner kick after five minutes, and both teams were sent to the dressing room by referee Ruddy Buquet, who then decided to abandon the match after a suspension of almost two hours. 
Payet, who according to the French League (LFP) was also subject to ""discriminatory insults"", left the pitch with an ice pack on his head.
The stadium's announcer had initially said that the game would restart, following a decision made by local Lyon authorities. 
This was immediately criticised by the LFP in a statement, in which the body also said it was summoning an emergency meeting of its disciplinary commission on Monday.
In chaotic scenes, Lyon players took to the pitch to warm up, but Jorge Sampaoli's Marseille stayed in the dressing room and the match was eventually called off.
""The referee believes safety conditions are not met,"" the stadium announcer said.
Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas criticised the decision to abandon the match.
""The referee first said that the game could restart and he changed his mind after the violent reaction of Marseille, notably that of their coach,"" Aulas said.
""I believe the conditions were met to resume the game after the individual had been arrested. He is in police custody.""
His Marseille counterpart Pablo Longoria said Payet was ""psychologically affected"" by the incident and explained that the club had asked Buquet to check on their players before potentially resuming the game.
""We asked him to check on our players' psychological state. He did not wish to go and see the players.""
The referee said that his ""sporting decision"" was to not restart the game, but there were other elements to take into account. ""It's a full stadium, players to evacuate,"" he said.
""My decision was to call off the game. We have to take our responsibilities and that's what I did tonight.""
Ligue 1 has been marred by crowd trouble this season. 
Nice were docked two points, one of them suspended, after serious incidents during their game against Marseille, whose players clashed with home fans who pelted them with missiles and stormed onto the pitch in August.
The northern derby between RC Lens and Lille was also hit by crowd problems in September, with the start of the second half being delayed by about half a hour after rival fans threw objects at each other before people ran on to the pitch, prompting riot police and stewards to intervene.

There has also been crowd trouble in Montpellier, Angers, Marseille and St Etienne.
""We now have to sit down all together and discuss so that these incidents do not happen again,"" said Longoria.

(Reuters) - Beto O'Rourke, the Democratic former U.S. congressman who is running for governor of Texas, on Sunday criticized President Joe Biden for a lack of urgency on pursuing a revamp of immigration laws, indicating he will distance himself from the White House in his underdog campaign.
O'Rourke announced last Monday he will seek to unseat Republican Governor Greg Abbott in next year's election, aiming to become the first Democrat to win a statewide race in Texas, the second most populous U.S. state, in three decades.
""I do not think we have seen enough urgency when it comes to rewriting our immigration laws to match the needs and the reality that we see, especially in our border communities,"" O'Rourke told CNN's ""State of the Union"" program on Sunday. ""So, yes, we expect more of our president and those who represent us in Congress.""
The Democratic president has made other issues such as infrastructure, social spending and COVID-19 relief higher legislative priorities than immigration reform. Democrats narrowly control Congress. 
O'Rourke also took aim at Abbott, saying the governor is ""using the border right now as a photo opportunity, scapegoating and vilifying immigrants, asking Texans to, quote, 'defend themselves' and take matters into their own hands from this 'invasion,' as he describes it.""
Biden has faced criticism from Democrats and Republicans over immigration and border issues. Arrests at the U.S.-Mexico border have reached record levels in recent months. 
Asked whether he would welcome Biden to Texas to help him campaign, O'Rourke suggested he would not, saying: ""This campaign in Texas is not going to be about Joe Biden. It's not going to be about Donald Trump. It's not going to be about anyone from outside of our state.""
Trump, known for a hardline approach on immigration, last year defeated Biden in Texas while losing the presidential election nationally.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and Biden have pledged to create a working group on arms trafficking and related transborder crime and border security, the White House said on Friday.
Biden has kept in place a controversial order, first implemented by his Republican predecessor Trump last year, that allows migrants to be immediately expelled without an opportunity to seek asylum in light of the pandemic.

Police arrested 38 people as shops were broken into and cars set ablaze.
Special police forces were due to arrive from mainland France to the Caribbean archipelago on Sunday to restore order.
""This situation cannot be accepted nor tolerated,"" government spokesman Gabriel Attal told Europe 1 radio.
In a sign unrest could spread to other overseas territories in the Caribbean, trade unions called for a general strike on the island of Martinique from Monday, French media reported.
The strike notice demands an end to the mandatory vaccination of health workers as well as support to deal with high fuel prices.
Guadeloupe's prefect, Alexandre Rochatte, who represents the French government, said in a statement that armed groups had tried to loot stores in Pointe-a-Pitre, Basse-Terre and Lamentin and battled police. 
Shots were fired at police and firefighters trying to put out blazes. Four pharmacies were broken into and cars set on fire while barricades were erected to stop security forces from intervening, the prefect added.
Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said on Saturday that France would send to the territory about 50 members of the GIGN and RAID elite tactical forces of the gendarmerie and police.
Prime Minister Jean Castex is also due to meet on Monday in Paris with Guadeloupe officials to discuss the situation.
Rochatte on Friday had imposed a curfew from 6 p.m. to 5 a.m following five days of civil unrest during which barricades burned in the streets and firefighters and doctors walked out on strike. 
Trade unions in Guadeloupe started an indefinite strike last Monday to protest the compulsory vaccination of health workers against COVID-19 and health pass requirements.
Guadeloupe and Martinique have a deep-rooted history of vaccine hesitancy amid distrust of the Paris government.

Health ministry data show that so far 38% of the population had received a first COVID shot in Martinique and 36% in Guadeloupe, compared with 77% of the French population.
In August the Paris government was forced to appeal to doctors and nurses from metropolitan France to volunteer in Guadeloupe and Martinique, as a wave of infections overwhelmed hospitals.

Three people were arrested at the scene of the ""organized theft"" reported shortly before 9 p.m. local time on Saturday in suburban Walnut Creek, about 15 miles (25 km) east of Oakland, police said.
""The remaining participants in this criminal mob fled from the area in cars at high speeds,"" Walnut Creek police said in a statement on Sunday.
The robbery followed another brazen mob-heist of high-end stores on Friday night in San Francisco's Union Square, about 25 miles (40 km) to the west. 
Video posted by a KNTV television reporter showed several people running out of the store with merchandise and climbing into about 25 parked cars that ringed the building and jammed traffic on the streets.
""It was crazy for a second,"" said Brett Barrette, a manager of a restaurant across the street, who told KPIX-TV that the thieves wore ski masks and were armed with crow bars and weapons. ""All the guests inside were getting concerned.""

Police said the suspects assaulted two Nordstrom employees and pepper-sprayed another. They said they are reviewing surveillance footage in an effort to identify them.
Arrested at the scene were Dana Dawson, 30, and Joshua Underwood, 32, of San Francisco, and Rodney Robinson, 18, of Oakland, police said. Charges brought in the arrests included robbery, burglary, conspiracy, possession of stolen property and illegal possession of a firearm by a felon, police said.

SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgarian President Rumen Radev won a second term in office by a wide margin on Sunday as voters in the European Union's poorest country backed his strong anti-corruption message, exit polls showed.
Radev, 58, defeated his challenger Anastas Gerdzhikov, also 58, winning 66% to 32% in the presidential run-off after nearly winning outright in the first round on Nov 14, according to exit polls that also registered a record low voter turnout.
The election comes amid widespread discontent against high level graft that ended the decade-long rule of former premier Boyko Borissov in April and led a new anti-corruption party to victory in last week's parliamentary elections.
""An unprecedented political month with two types of elections ended that clearly highlighted the desire of the people for change, to break with corruption, robbery and unlawfulness and remove the mafia from power,"" a jubilant Radev told reporters after the vote.
The presidential post is largely ceremonial but provides a powerful platform to influence public opinion. The president comes to prominence in times of political crisis, when the head of state can appoint interim cabinets.
Radev, a former air-force commander gained popularity for his open support of massive anti-graft protests against Borissov in 2020 and for appointing interim governments that brought to light murky public procurement deals of Borissov's last centre-right cabinet. Borissov has denied any wrongdoing.
""Radev's win re-confirms the desire for change in Bulgaria. His re-election will facilitate the formation of a coalition government,"" said Daniel Smilov, political analyst with Centre for Liberal Strategies.
Gerdzhikov, the Sofia University rector backed by Borissov's GERB party, conceded defeat and expressed regret for failing to convince Bulgarians he could unite the nation. 
Two Harvard-educated entrepreneurs Radev appointed in May as interim ministers have since set up the We Continue The Change party (PP), which won Bulgaria's third national election this year on Nov. 14, pledging ""zero corruption"".
Radev is supported by Borissov's political opponents - PP, the Socialists and the anti-elite ITN party which, along with another anti-graft faction, are holding talks to form a coalition government. 

In his first words after the vote, Radev addressed the parties, urging them to forge a ruling government and kick-start judicial reforms, combat the coronavirus pandemic and take measures to protect the vulnerable from high energy costs.
Radev's second five-year term will start on Jan. 22.

410,"<span>Nov 21, 2021 03:02PM ET</span>","MOSCOW (Reuters) -The Kremlin on Sunday accused the West of artificially whipping up tensions around Ukraine with repeated statements suggesting Russia was poised to launch an attack on its neighbour and told Washington and its allies to stop a military build-up nearby. 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Saturday his country has real concerns, widely shared with partners in Europe, over Russian activities at the Ukrainian border, after Ukraine said it feared Russia might be preparing an attack.
U.S., NATO and Ukrainian officials have been making similar statements for nearly two weeks, referring to what they say are unusual Russian troop movements in the proximity of Ukraine.
The head of Ukraine's military intelligence told the Military Times outlet this weekend that Russia had more than 92,000 troops amassed around Ukrainian borders and is preparing for an attack by the end of January or beginning of February.
Kyrylo Budanov said such an attack would likely involve air strikes, artillery and armoured attacks followed by airborne assaults in the east, amphibious assaults in Odessa and Mariupol and a smaller incursion through neighboring Belarus,
Moscow has dismissed such suggestions as inflammatory and complained about what it says is increasing activity in the region by the NATO alliance.
In comments due to be broadcast later on Sunday on state TV, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said ""a provocation"" in the area could not be ruled out given all the U.S. rhetoric. 
""This hysteria is being artificially whipped up. We are being accused of some kind of unusual military activity on our territory by those who have brought in their armed forces from across the ocean. That is, the United States of America,"" Peskov said.
""It's not really logical or polite.""
Peskov suggested Ukraine was probably looking for a way to solve its own problems by force.
Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014 and Russian-backed separatists seized a swath of eastern Ukraine that same year.
Peskov said Russia wanted NATO to stop ""concentrating a military fist"" near Russia's own borders and to stop arming Ukraine with modern weapons.
The Kremlin said in September that NATO would cross a Russian red line if it expanded its military infrastructure in Ukraine.

A ship carrying two refitted former U.S. Coast Guard patrol boats designed to beef up the Ukrainian Navy transited the Dardanelles strait on Saturday.
Ukraine, which strives to become a NATO member, received a large consignment of U.S. ammunition earlier this year and Javelin anti-tank missiles, prompting criticism from Moscow.

Buckingham Palace had no comment on the report.
The queen spent a night in hospital for the first time in years last month for what the palace called ""preliminary investigations"" into an unspecified ailment, and doctors have advised her to cancel most engagements since then.
She pulled out of a Remembrance Day Ceremony on Nov. 14 with a sprained back which a palace source said was unrelated to the condition which has required rest and was an unfortunate coincidence.
On Nov. 17, she was pictured standing and smiling at her Windsor Castle home as she chatted to the chief of defence staff.

Sunday's private ceremony, which took place at the Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park, was to celebrate two family christenings, according to the PA report.
One was of the baby son of Princess Eugenie, daughter of the queen's third child Prince Andrew. The other was of the third child, a son, of Zara Tindall, daughter of the queen's second child Princess Anne.

BEIJING/VILNIUS (Reuters) - China downgraded its diplomatic ties with Lithuania on Sunday, expressing strong dissatisfaction with the Baltic State after Taiwan opened a de facto embassy there, escalating a row that has sucked in Washington.
China views self-ruled and democratically governed Taiwan as its territory with no right to the trappings of a state and has stepped up pressure on countries to downgrade or sever their relations with the island, even non-official ones.
Lithuania expressed regret over China's move but defended its right to expand cooperation with Taiwan, while respecting Beijing's ""One China"" policy, and said its foreign minister would go to Washington to discuss trade and investment projects.
Taiwan, meanwhile, reported that two Chinese nuclear-capable H-6 bombers had flown to the south of the island on Sunday, part of a pattern of what Taipei views as military harassment designed to pressure the government.
Beijing had already expressed its anger this summer with Lithuania - which has formal relations with China and not Taiwan - after it allowed the island to open an office in the country using the name Taiwan. China recalled its ambassador in August.
Other Taiwan offices in Europe and the United States use the name of the city Taipei, avoiding reference to the island itself. However, the Taiwanese Representative Office in Lithuania finally opened on Thursday.
China's Foreign Ministry said in a brusque statement that Lithuania had ignored China's ""solemn stance"" and the basic norms of international relations.
Beijing said relations would be downgraded to the level of charge d'affaires, a rung below ambassador.
The move ""undermined China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and grossly interfered in China's internal affairs"", creating a ""bad precedent internationally"", it said.
""We urge the Lithuanian side to correct its mistakes immediately and not to underestimate the Chinese people's firm determination and staunch resolve to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" China's foreign ministry said.
No matter what Taiwan does, it cannot change the fact that it is part of China, it said.
WASHINGTON VISIT
Lithuania's Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte said on Sunday that the opening of the representative office, which does not have a formal diplomatic status, should not have come as a surprise to anyone.
""Our government's programme says Lithuania wants a more intense economic, cultural and scientific relationship with Taiwan,"" she said. ""I want to emphasise that this step does not mean any conflict or disagreement with the 'One China' policy.""
The prime minister of Lithuania's larger EU neighbour Poland said on Sunday that it supported the stance taken by Vilnius.
The European Commission spokesperson said the EU executive ""has stood by Lithuania in the face of sustained coercive measures from China"" since the summer.
Taiwan says it is an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name, and that the People's Republic of China has never ruled it and has no right to speak for it.
Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council denounced China's ""rudeness and arrogance"", saying Beijing had no right to comment on something that was not an internal Chinese affair and purely a matter between Taiwan and Lithuania.
Taiwan has been heartened by growing international support in the face of China's military and diplomatic pressure, especially from the United States and some of its allies.
Washington rejects attempts by other countries to interfere in Lithuania's relationship with Taiwan, U.S. Under Secretary of State Uzra Zeya told a news conference in Vilnius on Friday.
Lithuania Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis will go to Washington on Tuesday where he expects to discuss the opening of the U.S. market to Lithuanian goods and developing common investment projects, the ministry said in a statement on Sunday.
Landsbergis will meet U.S. Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment Jose W. Fernandez ""to discuss possibilities to expand and deepen mutually beneficial economic ties"", it said.
Washington has offered Vilnius support to withstand Chinese pressure and Lithuania will sign a $600 million https://www.reuters.com/business/lithuania-get-us-trade-support-it-faces-china-fury-over-taiwan-2021-11-19 export credit agreement with the U.S. Export-Import Bank on Wednesday.
Only 15 countries have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.

Taipei could lose another ally to Beijing after the Honduran presidential election later this month, where a candidate backed by main opposition parties is leading in opinion polls.
If elected, Xiomara Castro has vowed to establish official relations with China.

The Polish Border Guard said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that there were 195 attempts to cross the frontier on Friday, down from 250 on Thursday and 501 the day before, though Warsaw warned that the migrant crisis was far from over.
Europe accuses Belarus of flying in thousands of people from the Middle East and pushing them to cross into the EU, which has been at odds with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko since a disputed election last year.
Belarus, which denies fomenting the crisis, cleared a migrant camp near the border on Thursday and started to repatriate some people to Iraq, but Poland said on Friday that Minsk was still trucking https://reut.rs/3CujCCI hundreds of migrants to the frontier.
""Yesterday ... there were several attempts to forcefully cross the border. The largest group consisted of about 200 foreigners, the others of tens of people. The foreigners were aggressive - they threw stones, firecrackers and used teargas,"" the Border Guard said on Twitter on Saturday. 
Polish police said that during one crossing attempt on Friday near the village of Starzyna, Belarusian servicemen threw stones towards Polish border guards, policemen and soldiers, resulting in police cars being damaged.
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS
Rights groups have criticised Poland's nationalist government over its treatment of migrants, with accusations of multiple pushbacks and failure to provide medical support as well as adequate food and shelter.
About 10 migrants are believed to have died in woods along the border with frigid winter setting in, according to local authorities, and many more have sustained injuries or suffered without food or water for days.
Poland has imposed a state of emergency close to the border and does not let journalists or NGOs operate in the area. It says its uniformed services provide adequate care to migrants who make it into Poland when necessary.
Hundreds of Poles took part in two separate protests in Warsaw and the town of Hajnowka close to the Belarusian border on Saturday to express their support for migrants and demand help for them.
""We are here to strongly oppose this, because we want no one in our country to die in the forest, no one to be starving in the forest, and no one to be detained in the forest"", said Adrianna Klimaszewska, a social activist from Wroclaw who took part in the ""Mothers to the border"" protest in Hajnowka. 
""We demand this of our country. We demand access for medics to the border area, we demand access for humanitarian organizations.""
'GO TO POLAND'
Despite the fall in the number of attempts to cross the border, Polish officials said they expected further tensions. 
""No, this political crisis is not coming to an end. Belarus is still interested in escalating and continuing operations against Poland,"" Stanislaw Zaryn, spokesman for Poland's security services, wrote on Twitter. 
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki will visit Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia on Sunday to discuss the crisis, a government spokesman said on Saturday. 
Migrants in a so-called 'safe place' run by locals on the Polish side of the border told Reuters that even after the camp was dismantled, Belarusian security forces kept pushing them to cross the border. One of them succeeded on Thursday night. 

""We came through the forests, they (Belarusian forces) were telling us every day 'Go to Poland' and we could not cross, so they tried making us cross by force,"" a Syrian migrant said.
""It was very tiring, cold, with no food, no water, no warmth or anything. I came looking for a peaceful country, I just want to live,"" he added.

VILLA COMALTITLAN, Mexico (Reuters) - Hundreds of Venezuelans are in a migrant caravan that departed this week from Mexico's southern border with Guatemala, according to organizers, just as Mexico is mulling tighter restrictions on their access to the country.
Reuters spoke with a dozen Venezuelans who said they had left in the caravan of around 3,000 people from the city of Tapachula on Thursday after fleeing poverty and hardship in their homeland, where elections are due this weekend.
Luis Garcia, one of the caravan's organizers, said Venezuelans made up between 20% and 30% of the group. A number related harrowing episodes on their journey from South America, particularly in Panama's Darien region.
""I don't want to stay in Mexico, we want to go to the United States, we just want them to let us pass,"" said Daysi, a 63-year-old Venezuelan from the city of Maracaibo who joined the caravan with six relatives, including two of her children.
""Nobody leaves their country because they want to, but there are days when you eat once, others not even that, there's no medicine, there's nothing, we're dying.""
The government's National Migration Institute, which has tried to break up caravans, could not say how many Venezuelans were in the group, which also featured Central Americans.
The number of Venezuelans crossing Mexico has leapt in 2021, and Reuters last week reported the government is considering setting stricter entry requirements to stem the flow.
The caravan, the second large one to depart Tapachula within a month, has made slow progress and on Saturday reached the village of Villa Comaltitlan in the state of Chiapas.
Another 34-year-old Venezuelan woman from Caracas, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals, told Reuters by telephone she was beaten and raped by two hooded men in Darien, but resolved to continue ""through the power of God.""

""They put a gun in my mouth,"" she said. ""I couldn't say no because there were dead women there who resisted.""
Reuters could not independently verify her story, but she shared a document showing she had registered the sexual assault with doctors. She too planned to reach the United States so she can send money back to her baby and mother in Venezuela.

Former doubles world number one Peng has not been seen or heard from publicly since she said on Chinese social media on Nov. 2 that former vice-premier Zhang Gaoli coerced her into sex and they later had an on-off consensual relationship.
Neither Zhang nor the Chinese government have commented on her allegation. Peng's social media post was quickly deleted and the topic has been blocked from discussion on China's heavily censored internet.
""In the past few days, she stayed in her own home freely and she didn't want to be disturbed. She will show up in public and participate in some activities soon,"" Hu wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
The Global Times is published by the People's Daily, the official newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party.
Hu said he had confirmed through his sources that photos shared on Twitter by a journalist working for Chinese state media, purportedly showing Peng at home, depicted her ""current state"".
He also posted a video later on Saturday that appeared to show Peng at a restaurant.
Reuters was not able to verify the authenticity of the pictures or video independently.
""I am glad to see the videos released by China state-run media that appear to show Peng Shuai at a restaurant in Beijing,"" Women's Tennis Association (WTA) chairman Steve Simon said in a statement.
""While it is positive to see her, it remains unclear if she is free and able to make decisions and take actions on her own, without coercion or external interference. This video alone is insufficient. 
""As I have stated from the beginning, I remain concerned about Peng Shuai's health and safety and that the allegation of sexual assault is being censored and swept under the rug. I have been clear about what needs to happen and our relationship with China is at a crossroads.""
GROWING CONCERN
Amid growing concern about her whereabouts, the WTA has threatened to pull tournaments out of China and the men's ATP has demanded clarity from the Chinese authorities. The United States has called for proof of Peng's whereabouts and safety. 
The International Olympic Committee could be pushed into taking a hard line with the 2022 Beijing Olympic hosts, senior IOC member Dick Pound has told Reuters.
Thus far the IOC has declined to comment, saying it believed ""quiet diplomacy"" offered the best opportunity for a solution.
The IOC's Athletes Commission, made up of athletes elected by their peers, said it was ""very concerned"" for Peng and hoped contact with her and fellow athletes could be established soon.
Wimbledon organisers the All England Lawn Tennis Club said in a statement: ""We are united with the rest of tennis in the need to understand that Peng Shuai is safe. We have been working in support of the WTA's efforts to establish her safety through our relationships behind the scenes.""
Swiss tennis great Roger Federer also joined the chorus of athletes expressing concern for Peng.

(Reuters) -Authorities searched for a gun owner who fled after his weapon fired by accident at Atlanta's airport, sending terrified travelers bolting onto the tarmac on Saturday, halting flights during the busy Thanksgiving holiday period. 
Three people suffered non-life-threatening injuries after the 1:30 p.m. shot in the security screening area at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) said in a statement. 
Some two hours later, officials gave an ""all-clear"" and flights resumed, the airport said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
An arrest warrant was issued for the 42-year-old gun owner, named by police as Kenny Wells. 
He was being sought on charges of carrying a concealed weapon at a commercial airport, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, discharging a firearm and reckless conduct, Atlanta Police Major Reginald Moorman told a news conference. 
The gun discharge occurred when a screening checkpoint employee was conducting a bag search ""due to a prohibited item identified by the X-Ray,"" the TSA said in a statement. 
""He advised the passenger not to touch the property, and as he opened the compartment containing the prohibited item, the passenger lunged into the bag and grabbed a firearm, at which point it discharged,"" the TSA said. 
The gun owner fled from the airport, although ""he was not allowed to go,"" airport spokesman Andrew Gobeil told CNN.
""Because he was in the process of being screened, we have all his information,"" Gobeil said.
Immediate fear that an active shooter had opened fire panicked the crowd, which rushed out of the terminal onto the tarmac.
""More and more people started running - there was screaming,"" said traveler Erika Zeidler, who sent photographs to CNN showing dozens of people scrambling onto the tarmac, some pulling suitcases.
Police said one person requested EMS after experiencing a fall ""in the atrium of the airport, which is not in the same area of the security check point, and two others complained of a shortness of breath.""
Hartsfield-Jackson was the world's busiest airport in 2021, according to aviation analytics provider Official Airline Guide (OAG).
The Atlanta airport was expected to be particularly busy during the Thanksgiving travel period, with prepandemic-size crowds expected at security checkpoints from Friday, Nov. 19 through Sunday, Nov. 28, the TSA said.
""Officials have given an all-clear for #ATLAirport and normal operations are beginning,"" the airport tweeted at 3:24 p.m. 
A record number of firearms were seized at U.S. airport checkpoints in just the first nine months of 2021, the TSA said.

Nationwide, TSA officers have stopped 4,495 airline passengers from carrying firearms onto their flights, surpassing the 4,432 firearms caught throughout 2019. 
In Atlanta alone, there were 450 firearms detected at airport checkpoints in 2021.

ABBOTSFORD, British Columbia (Reuters) - Searchers located three bodies swept away by landslides in British Columbia, officials said on Saturday, after record rainfall that paralyzed parts of the province, leading to food and fuel shortages.
Canada's westernmost province declared a state of emergency after a phenomenon known as an ""atmospheric river"" brought a month's worth of rain in two days. The rainfall washed out roads and railways, cutting off Vancouver and the lower mainland region from the rest of the country, and blocking access to some towns entirely.
Another similar weather system is forecast to hit northern British Columbia on Sunday and bring heavy rains to the lower mainland, according to Environment Canada.
The province imposed temporary restrictions on fuel and non-essential travel on Friday to ease supply chain disruptions and aid recovery work.
Three more bodies were found, in addition to one located on Monday, and efforts to reach a fifth person caught in a mudslide have been unsuccessful, the province's chief coroner said on Saturday.
""This has been an incredibly difficult year for all of us in B.C., and my heart goes out to the many families and communities who have suffered tragic losses,"" Lisa Lapointe said in a statement.
The storms, which started last Sunday, forced the closure of the Trans Mountain pipeline and cut two critical east-west rail lines owned by  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Railway and Canadian National Railway (TSX:CNR) Co that lead to Canada's busiest port of Vancouver, impeding the supply of fuel and goods.

CP said work to repair damaged infrastructure would continue non-stop and service should be restored in the middle of next week.
About 14,000 people remain under evacuation orders in several communities in the Pacific province.

420,"<span>Nov 20, 2021 05:12PM ET</span>","VIENNA (Reuters) -Tens of thousands of people, many of them far-right supporters, protested in Vienna on Saturday against coronavirus restrictions a day after Austria's government announced a new lockdown and said vaccines would be made compulsory next year.
Whistling, blowing horns and banging drums, crowds streamed into Heroes' Square in front of the Hofburg, the former imperial palace in central Vienna, in the early afternoon, one of several protest locations. 
Many demonstrators waved Austrian flags and carried signs with slogans such as ""no to vaccination"", ""enough is enough"" or ""down with the fascist dictatorship"".
By mid-afternoon the crowds had swelled to roughly 35,000 people, according to the police, and were marching down Vienna's inner ring road before heading back towards the Hofburg.
A police spokesman said there had been fewer than 10 arrests, for breaches of coronavirus restrictions and the ban on Nazi symbols.
Roughly 66% of Austria's population is fully vaccinated against COVID-19, one of the lowest rates in western Europe. Many Austrians are sceptical about vaccines, a view encouraged by the far-right Freedom Party, the third-biggest in parliament.
With daily infections still setting records even after a lockdown was imposed on the unvaccinated this week, the government said on Friday it would reintroduce a lockdown https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/austria-reimposes-full-lockdown-makes-vaccination-compulsory-2021-11-19 on Monday and make it compulsory to get vaccinated as of Feb. 1.
The Freedom Party (FPO) and other vaccine-critical groups had already been planning a show of force in Vienna on Saturday before Friday's announcement, which prompted FPO leader Herbert Kickl to respond that ""As of today, Austria is a dictatorship"".

Kickl could not attend because he has caught COVID-19. 
""We are not in favour of our government's measures,"" said one protester, who was part of a group wearing tin foil on their heads and brandishing toilet brushes. Like most protesters who spoke to the media, they declined to give their names, though the mood was festive.

(Reuters) - A Georgia judge denied a motion for a mistrial on Friday in the Ahmaud Arbery murder case from a defense lawyer who claimed that Black pastors outside the courthouse were a ""woke left mob"" that influenced the jury in the trial of three white men.
More than 200 pastors gathered on Thursday outside the Glynn County courthouse in coastal Brunswick (NYSE:BC), Georgia. Organizers said it was a response to defense attorney Kevin Gough's previous comments that he ""didn't want any more Black pastors"" in the courtroom.
Several nationally known Black clergy and civil rights leaders including Rev. Al Sharpton, Rev. Jesse Jackson and Martin Luther King III have sat with Arbery's family in the courtroom at various times.
Gough's client, William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52, along with Greg McMichael, 65, a former policeman, and his son Travis McMichael, 35, are charged with the 25-year-old Black man's murder. Prosecutors say they chased and shot Arbery to death as he took a Sunday afternoon jog on Feb. 23, 2020.
The three men have all pleaded not guilty and have said they were trying to make a citizen's arrest of a man they thought was a burglar. They face life in prison if convicted by the jury of 11 white people and one Black man.
Gough showed the court photographs of the large gathering on Thursday and said it was an unfair influence or perhaps intimidated the jury. ""This is a trial that's been infected by mob violence of a woke left mob,"" he said.
""This is what a public lynching looks like in the 21st century,"" Gough said. ""There is pressure being exerted on the jury."" 
Prosecutor Linda Dunikoski countered that Gough, a ""brilliant"" and ""calculating"" lawyer, made the courtroom comment about Black pastors with the intention of provoking the gathering. 

Closing arguments in the case are expected to begin Monday.

KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) - Richard McGinniss saw Kyle Rittenhouse gun down the first of three men he shot the night of Aug. 25, 2020, making him a critical witness for the prosecution at the trial of the U.S. teenager. However, his testimony may also have helped persuade the jury to acquit Rittenhouse on Friday.
McGinniss, a journalist, got emotional on the stand as he talked about trying to save the life of a man Rittenhouse had just shot four times with a semi-automatic rifle during racial justice protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
McGinniss described taking Joseph Rosenbaum to the hospital and his efforts to comfort him on the drive there even though the man was unresponsive. He promised to get a beer together once it was all over.
His testimony served two objectives for the prosecution: shining a light on the violence wreaked by Rittenhouse's weapon and the humanity of Rosenbaum, whose erratic behavior that night had become a major focal point for the defense.
But under cross-examination by Rittenhouse's defense counsel, the narrative began to shift.
McGinniss, a video director for the Daily Caller, a conservative media outlet, told defense attorney Mark Richards that Rosenbaum appeared ""very angry"" as he screamed an expletive and lunged for the barrel of the teen's gun.
Kenosha County Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger then began to question his own witness aggressively, suggesting McGinniss had engaged in ""complete guesswork"" in speculating as to Rosenbaum's intent.
The question hit a nerve.
""Well, he (Rosenbaum) said 'Fuck you,' and then he reached for the weapon,"" McGinniss responded before bristling again at a question implying that he had offered a view on why Rosenbaum had lunged for the teenager's gun.
""When did I say that I gave a reason? I just said what he was trying to do,"" McGinniss said. ""I will say that as many times as you want me to, but I have no clue why he was doing what he did, but I saw him go for the front portion of the weapon.""
The exchange highlighted the challenge prosecutors faced throughout two weeks of testimony, with witness after witness offering evidence largely supporting the teenager's assertion that he only fired when he was attacked.
The jury on Friday acquitted the teenager on all charges including the killing of Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and the wounding of Gaige Grosskreutz, 28. 
The prosecution contended that Rittenhouse provoked Rosenbaum by raising his rifle and that the other two men he shot had been trying heroically to disarm an ""active shooter"" who posed a deadly threat to people around him. 
The exchange between Binger and McGinniss was one of a handful of dramatic moments that legal experts said almost certainly stuck with the jury as they deliberated on Rittenhouse's fate.
Patrick Cafferty, a criminal defense attorney in Wisconsin, said McGinniss ""got away"" from Binger as a witness, coming across to the jury as traumatized from what he had experienced that night but never blaming Rittenhouse for it.
""He appeared to be oriented toward justifying what Rittenhouse did,"" Cafferty said. ""I think he helped Rittenhouse more than he helped the state.""
The Daily Caller did not respond to requests to make McGinniss available for an interview.
'OH MY GOODNESS' MOMENT 
Prosecutors also struggled to put a serious dent in Rittenhouse's testimony when he took the stand in a risky legal maneuver to offer his account of what had happened that night.
Rittenhouse held firm that he had been in Kenosha to provide medical aid, had only used his weapon to protect himself and had not wanted to harm anyone that night.
Assistant District Attorney James Kraus acknowledged in court that the teen's testimony was problematic for the prosecution, saying a reasonable juror could believe Rittenhouse had not intended to kill anyone, a state of mind required by the three homicide charges lodged against him.
But even before Rittenhouse took the stand, another critical witness had already weakened the state's case, legal observers said.
Grosskreutz was viewed as a crucial witness for the state because he was the only person to have survived the shootings and could speak to the perceived threat he and others felt as they chased the teen down the street. 
Under examination by prosecutors, Grosskreutz testified that he believed Rittenhouse needed to be stopped and he had never intended to use the handgun he was holding, only moving toward the teen because he thought Rittenhouse was preparing to fire. 
Then defense attorney Corey Chirafisi elicited a major concession. Using still images of the seconds before Rittenhouse fired a bullet into Grosskreutz's arm, Chirafisi pressed the witness twice on what triggered the shot.
""When you were standing three to five feet from him with your arms up in the air, he never fired, right?"" Chirafisi asked.
""Correct,"" Grosskreutz responded.
""It wasn't until you pointed your gun at him, advanced on him, with your gun, now your hands down pointed at him, that he fired, right?"" Chirafisi continued.
""Correct,"" Grosskreutz said.
Benjamin Van Severen, a defense attorney in Milwaukee, said it was an ""Oh my goodness"" moment for prosecutors, playing right into Rittenhouse's self-defense argument.
The prosecution was also hurt by Grosskreutz, a trained paramedic, testifying that he feared for Rittenhouse's safety when he saw a crowd chasing the teenager, yelling at him. 

""Him being the paramedic in fear for (Rittenhouse's) safety,"" Van Severen said. ""That's another one of those 'Oh crap' moments.""

423,"<span>Nov 20, 2021 11:26AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BERLIN (Reuters) -Germany's next cabinet is taking shape as coalition negotiations near a deal, with chancellor-in-waiting Olaf Scholz determined to deliver on his campaign pledge to have as many women as men in his team, sources said on Saturday.
Scholz's centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), who narrowly won the federal election in September by beating Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, are trying to form a three-way ruling coalition with the pro-spending Greens and the fiscally conservative Free Democrats (FDP).
The SPD is set to nominate at least three women for cabinet posts: outgoing Environment Minister Svenja Schulze, outgoing Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht and Scholz's former running mate in the race for party co-leadership Klara Geywitz, three people familiar with the decision told Reuters.
Schulze is expected to become economy or transformation minister, Lambrecht will likely be in charge of the interior portfolio including migration and Geywitz could get the science and education ministry, the sources said.
Depending on the coalition horse trading, the SPD could also nominate lawmaker and human rights expert Baerbel Kofler for the economic cooperation and development portfolio.
Among the SPD men, Scholz will lead the next government as chancellor, his right-hand man Wolfgang Schmidt is expected to become his chief of staff and Labour Minister Hubertus Heil is set to keep his job thanks to his strong performance during the COVID-19 pandemic, the sources said.
Coalition officials have repeatedly said that cabinet posts will be decided at the very end of coalition negotiations. Party officials have hinted that an agreement could be reached in the coming week, possibly as early as Monday or Tuesday.
FDP leader Christian Lindner is pushing to become finance minister, though Greens co-leader Robert Habeck was also keen on the post to guarantee enough public resources to pay for Germany's faster shift towards a climate-friendly economy.
On Friday, Lindner said fears he would be a fiscal hawk as finance minister were overblown despite his repeated calls for solid public finances and debt reduction after the coronavirus crisis.

If Lindner get his way, Habeck is likely to lead a beefed-up climate ministry while Greens co-leader Annalena Baerbock is expected to become Germany's first female foreign minister.
During the election campaign, Baerbock has called for a tougher approach towards Russia and China.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - For many Chileans, Plaza Baquedano, a broad rotary in central Santiago that for decades served as a center of social protest, has become a powerful symbol of hope.
For two years, city residents have regularly gathered here https://graphics.reuters.com/CHILE-PROTESTS/0100B32527X/index.html to protest pensions that are too low, public transit fees that are too high and, more generally, an old-guard political class that just does not get it. 
The statue of a nineteenth-century general that sat at the plaza's center has been removed https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chile-protests-idUSKBN2B3255, and its plinth is now covered in left-wing political literature.
Most credit the protests - known collectively as the ""estallido social"" or ""social outbreak"" - for bringing about an ongoing rewrite of the nation's Pinochet-era constitution https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/chile-begins-down-uncertain-road-writing-new-constitution-2021-05-17. The ""estallido"" has also helped propel the candidacy of 35-year-old leftist Gabriel Boric, a relative newcomer who has become a serious contender in this Sunday's presidential election https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/former-protest-leader-boric-seeks-bury-chiles-neoliberal-past-2021-11-17.
But not everyone is so enthralled.
Among the detractors is Ramon Zambrano, a doorman at a nearby apartment building.
""You can protest, but peacefully. They're making a mess, burning cars, burning the metro. What are they doing?"" he asks, while pointing out the damage done to the now graffiti-covered building where he works. 
In a sense, the situation around Plaza Baquedano represents the central paradox of the election here. While Chile's Left gained significant traction via dozens of massive marches that began in 2019, two years of sometimes-violent protests have made many voters wary.
That - combined with a widespread perception among Chileans that crime is on the rise - has created an opportunity for the Right to gain ground by hammering home a law-and-order message.
While Boric, who rose to fame heading student protests in 2011, had been leading for most of 2021, José Antonio Kast, an ultra-right-wing former congressman who draws comparisons to Donald Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/chiles-bolsonaro-hard-right-kast-rises-with-frank-talk-crime-focus-2021-11-16, has risen in the polls dramatically in recent weeks.
Most recent polls show Kast drawing the largest vote share on Sunday. A Nov. 6 survey by consultancy Activa Research has Kast narrowly winning a likely runoff https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/chile-conservative-kast-maintains-lead-final-pre-election-opinion-polls-2021-11-06 in December.
BURNED OUT
For Kenneth Bunker, director of political consultancy Tresquintos, a particularly violent round of protests in late October helped boost the Right. 
A series https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chile-mapuche-conflict-idUSKCN25230C of recent confrontations https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/freight-train-derailed-burned-southern-chile-amid-indigenous-conflict-2021-11-02 in the southern Araucania and Bio Bio provinces - where police and separatist indigenous groups have long feuded - has also played into Kast's hands.
""I think there is a very important part of the country that's tired, they don't want any more of this,"" said Gonzalo Cordero, a political consultant and columnist for the national La Tercera newspaper.
Boric's supporters point out that almost 80% of Chileans, many fed up with the nation's ultra-free-market economic model, voted last year to rewrite the nation's constitution https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/freight-train-derailed-burned-southern-chile-amid-indigenous-conflict-2021-11-02. A conservative like Kast would do little to quell discontent, they argue.
""I think that if Kast is elected, there will be an 'estallido 2.0',"" said Pedro Muñoz, an elected member of the body re-writing Chile's constitution.
Still, the Kast campaign is leaning in to the law-and-order message, as are his supporters.
At his campaign's closing event on Thursday night, he pledged repeatedly to crack down on crime. The strongest applause came when he spoke in favor of police officers, many of whom have been accused by the public and prosecutors of using violence against protestors.
Several supporters insisted without evidence in interviews that the ""estallido"" was the product of foreign provocateurs, such as the Venezuelan or Cuban governments. 
Banners in favor of Trump were common, as were anti-crime banners such as ""Orden con Kast,"" or ""Order with Kast.""

Boric, for his part, is leaning in, too. While for Kast's supporters the protests are a symptom of decline and disorder, for Boric, they are a sign the previous order was not worth saving.
""We're going to do our politics from the streets,"" Boric said at his own campaign event on Thursday night.

MANAMA (Reuters) -U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin sought on Saturday to reassure allies in the Middle East that President Joe Biden's administration was committed to the region despite Washington increasingly turning its attention towards countering China.
It was unclear how much impact Austin's speech would have with Washington's allies in the Middle East, since it was not backed by any announcements of further deployments or new weapon sales in the region. 
Gulf Arab states, heavily reliant on the U.S. military umbrella, have expressed uncertainty about Biden's focus on the region, especially after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. They are now closely watching efforts to revive a global-powers nuclear pact with Iran.
In a speech in Bahrain during a trip to the Gulf, Austin acknowledged concern in the region and globally that the United States was solely focussed on China's challenge. 
""Let's be clear: America's commitment to security in the Middle East is strong and sure,"" Austin said. 
He said the United States was committed to countering Iran, even as Washington works to revive the 2015 nuclear deal.
""We remain committed to a diplomatic outcome of the nuclear issue. But if Iran isn't willing to engage seriously, then we will look at all the options necessary to keep the United States secure,"" Austin said.
The Pentagon chief said that Washington would be coming to the indirect negotiations on reviving the deal starting on Nov. 29 in Vienna in good faith. 
""But Iran's actions in recent months have not been encouraging - especially because of the expansion of their nuclear programme,"" he Austin said. 
Gulf states have asked for any deal to address what they call Iran's ballistic missile programme and destabilising behaviour in the region.
'IMPENDING AMERICAN ABANDONMENT'?
While a number of U.S. administrations have tried to move the focus away from the Middle East and towards the Pacific, Biden in August ended the longest U.S. war, in Afghanistan.
""There's dismay that the United States is on its way out the door. I'm not sure messaging addresses that sense of impending American abandonment,"" said Jon Alterman of the Washington CSIS think-tank.
A senior U.S. defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Austin was not expected to make new commitments in the region during his trip.
Saudi Arabia, one of Washington's closest regional allies, has been frustrated by the approach of Biden's White House, which has pressed Riyadh to improve its human rights record and end the war in Yemen. 
Former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal, attending the Manama security forum, welcomed verbal assurances but said ""demonstrative actions are equally important"".

He cited the need to prevent Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis from obtaining arms. Washington is pressing Riyadh to lift a coalition blockade on Houthi-held areas, a condition from the group for ceasefire talks.
Austin was set to visit Saudi Arabia in September but the trip was postponed at the last minute. He will not be visiting Riyadh on this trip.

KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) - A jury acquitted https://www.reuters.com/world/us/states-own-witnesses-laid-path-rittenhouse-acquittal-2021-11-19 teenager Kyle Rittenhouse on Friday of murder in the fatal shooting of two men during racial justice protests in a decision that re-ignited fierce debate about gun rights and the boundaries of self defense in the United States.
Jurors found Rittenhouse, 18, not guilty on all charges: two counts of homicide, one count of attempted homicide for wounding a third man, and two counts of recklessly endangering safety in protests marred by arson, rioting and looting on Aug. 25, 2020 in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
Rittenhouse broke down sobbing after the verdict and collapsed to the floor before being helped back into his chair, his hands shaking. His mother also wept.
Amid a heavy law enforcement presence, several dozen protesters lined the steps outside the courthouse after the verdict was read, some carrying placards in support of Rittenhouse and others expressing disappointment. By early evening, the crowd had thinned to a handful of people and there was no sign of disturbances in the city.
""We are all so very happy that Kyle can live his life as a free and innocent man, but in this whole situation there are no winners, there are two people who lost their lives and that's not lost on us at all,"" David Hancock, a spokesperson for the Rittenhouse family, told Reuters.
Rittenhouse shot and killed Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and fired a bullet that tore a chunk off the arm of Gaige Grosskreutz, 28. Rittenhouse claimed self defense. 
U.S. President Joe Biden, who during last year's election campaign tweeted a video that appeared to link Rittenhouse to white supremacists, said on Friday he supported the jury's decision and urged Americans to react with calm.
""While the verdict in Kenosha will leave many Americans feeling angry and concerned, myself included, we must acknowledge that the jury has spoken,"" Biden said.
Elsewhere reactions showed the country's deep partisan divisions. The verdict was greeted with outrage by many on the political left and celebrated by gun rights supporters.
""It is unconscionable our justice system would allow an armed vigilante ... to go free,"" the Congressional Black Caucus said in a statement.
The thorny issue of race also hung over the case, although Rittenhouse and the men he shot were all white. Some Black activists said on Friday the U.S. police and courts would have treated the teenager more harshly if he had been Black.
But conservatives saw the verdict as a validation of the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment, which grants Americans the right to bear arms.
U.S. congressman Madison Cawthorn, a Republican representative from North Carolina, said on Instagram: ""Kyle Rittenhouse is not guilty my friends. You have a right to defend yourselves. Be armed, be dangerous and be moral.""
REPEATEDLY ATTACKED
In reaching its verdict after more than three days of deliberations, the jury contended with dueling narratives https://www.reuters.com/world/us/takeaways-most-dramatic-moments-rittenhouse-murder-trial-2021-11-19 from the defense and prosecution that offered vastly different portrayals of the teenager's actions on the night of the shootings.
The defense argued that Rittenhouse had been repeatedly attacked and had shot the men in fear for his life. They said he was a civic-minded teen who carried a medical kit in addition to his gun and was in Kenosha to protect private property after several nights of unrest in the city south of Milwaukee.
The violence followed the police shooting of a Black man named Jacob Blake, who was left paralyzed from the waist down. 
The prosecution portrayed Rittenhouse as a reckless vigilante who provoked the violent encounters and showed no remorse for the men he shot with his AR-15-style rifle.
Wisconsin criminal defense lawyer Daniel Adams, who closely followed the trial, called the verdict “very dramatic but not entirely surprising.”
Most lawyers ""who looked at the evidence had a feeling the state would not be able to clear the threshold of disproving self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt,” he said.
Live-streamed and dissected by cable TV pundits daily, the trial unfolded during a time of social and political polarization in the United States. Gun rights are cherished by many Americans and are enshrined in the U.S. Constitution even as the nation experiences a high rate of gun violence and the easy availability of firearms.
Rittenhouse, who testified https://www.reuters.com/world/us/rittenhouse-called-stand-testify-own-defense-us-murder-trial-2021-11-10 that he had no choice but to open fire to protect himself, is viewed as heroic by some pro-gun conservatives who consider the shootings justified. Many on the left view Rittenhouse as a vigilante and an embodiment of an out-of-control American gun culture.
Protests against racism and police brutality turned violent in many U.S. cities after the police killing of Black man George Floyd in Minneapolis three months before the Kenosha shootings.
The Rittenhouse verdict ended the highest-profile U.S. civilian self-defense case since a man named George Zimmerman was acquitted in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Black teenager, in Florida in 2013.
With so much of that night in Kenosha caught on cellphone and surveillance video, few basic facts were in dispute. The trial instead focused on whether Rittenhouse acted reasonably to prevent ""imminent death or great bodily harm,"" the requirement for using deadly force under Wisconsin law.
The prosecution, led by Kenosha County Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger, sought to paint Rittenhouse as the aggressor and repeatedly stressed that he was the only one to kill anyone that night. 
RISKY DECISION
Rittenhouse's gun was loaded with 30 rounds of full metal jacket bullets, which are designed to penetrate their target. The jury saw a series of graphic videos, including the moments after Rittenhouse fired four rounds into Rosenbaum, who lay motionless, bleeding and groaning. Other video showed Grosskreutz screaming, with blood gushing from his arm.
Rittenhouse testified in his own defense last Wednesday in the trial's most dramatic moment - a risky decision by his lawyers given his youth and the prospect of tough prosecution cross-examination. Rittenhouse broke down sobbing at one point, and emphasized that he acted out of fear for his life.
""I did what I had to do to stop the person who was attacking me,"" he said.
His defense counsel, Mark Richards, said Rittenhouse has difficulty sleeping at night and was being treated for post traumatic stress disorder. He said the defense team decided to have him testify after they tested two versions of their case before mock juries, one with him testifying and one without.
""It was substantially better when we put him on,"" Richards told reporters after the verdict. ""In Wisconsin, if you don't put a client on the stand, you're going to lose. Period.""
Rittenhouse testified that he shot Huber after he had struck him with a skateboard and pulled on his weapon. He said he fired on Grosskreutz after the man pointed the pistol he was carrying at him - an assertion Grosskreutz acknowledged under questioning from the defense. Rittenhouse testified that he shot Rosenbaum after the man chased him and grabbed his gun.

Huber's parents, Karen Bloom and John Huber, said in a statement they were ""heartbroken"" by the verdict. 
""It sends the unacceptable message that armed civilians can show up in any town, incite violence, and then use the danger they have created to justify shooting people in the street.""

Court documents released by the ICC and confirmed by Philippine officials on Saturday showed that Manila filed the deferral request on Nov. 10, citing the country's own investigations into drug war killings.
""The prosecution has temporarily suspended its investigative activities while it assesses the scope and effect of the deferral request,"" ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan wrote, adding that it would seek additional information from the Philippines.
Governments can ask the ICC to defer a case if they are implementing their own investigations and prosecutions for the same acts. 
Duterte, 76, pulled the Philippines out of the ICC in 2018 and has said the international court has no jurisdiction https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-drugs-icct-idUSKCN1GJ0ER to indict him. The ICC maintains it has jurisdiction to investigate crimes committed while Manila was a member and up until 2019.
The Manila request for the deferral follows repeated statements by the Duterte government that it would not cooperate with the ICC. 
""We welcome the judiciousness of the new ICC prosecutor who has deemed it fit to give the matter a fresh look, and we trust that the matter will be resolved in favor of the exoneration of our government and the recognition of the vibrancy of our justice system,"" Karlo Nograles, acting spokesperson for Duterte, said in a statement on Saturday.
A Philippine lawyers group called on the ICC not to remove the glimmer of hope for families of drug-war victims.
""We ask the ICC not to allow itself to be swayed by the claims now being made by the Duterte administration,"" the National Union of People's Lawyers, which represents some victims' families, said in a statement.
The Philippine justice system is ""extremely slow and unavailing to the majority of poor and unrepresented victims"", it said.
Human Rights Watch said the government's claim that existing domestic mechanisms afford citizens justice was absurd. ""Let's hope the ICC sees through the ruse that it is,"" Brad Adam, its Asia director, said in a statement.
LOOMING ELECTIONS
The ICC decision is a boost for Duterte, who this week launched a run for the Senate https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/philippines-edge-deadline-presidential-candidates-looms-2021-11-15 in elections next year. He is barred by the constitution from seeking re-election as president.

""It will of course provide some relief in the raucous elections,"" political analyst Ramon Casiple, vice president of consulting and research firm Novo Trends PH, told Reuters. ""However, it may not enable (him) to do more after the elections, particularly if the incoming government chooses to cooperate with the ICC process.""
In its nearly two-decade existence, the ICC has convicted five men for war crimes and crimes against humanity, all African militia leaders from Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali and Uganda.

DENVER (Reuters) -The city of Aurora, Colorado, has agreed to pay $15 million to settle the civil rights lawsuit brought by the family of Elijah McClain, a Black man who died in 2019 after he was subdued by police and injected by paramedics with a sedative, both sides said on Friday.
The agreement, marking the largest civil rights settlement in state history, came about nine weeks after Colorado's attorney general completed an investigation finding that Aurora's police routinely violated state and federal law by engaging in racially biased policing and excessive force.
The inquiry led to a consent decree with the city police department in Aurora, a Denver suburb of about 369,000 residents, allowing an independent monitor to review the department's training, policies and practices. 
On Sept. 1, three police officers and two paramedics involved in McClain's death were indicted on charges of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. Those cases are pending.
McClain’s mother, Sheneen McClain, confirmed the settlement amount in a written statement issued through her attorney, after the deal was announced by the city.
“No amount of money will ever bring Elijah back to his mother,” the statement said. “Ms. McClain would return every cent for just one more day with her son.”
Elijah McClain, 23, was walking home from a convenience store in Aurora on Aug. 24, 2019, when he was confronted by police responding to reports that he had been seen acting suspiciously, though he was not suspected of a crime.
Police officers placed McClain in a carotid neck hold and he was later injected by paramedics with ketamine, a powerful sedative. He went into cardiac arrest and died days later at a hospital.
'I WAS JUST GOING HOME'
In a video recording of the encounter from a police-worn body camera, a sobbing McClain could be heard pleading with the officers restraining him: “I can’t breathe, please stop. I was just going home.”
The episode initially got little attention outside Colorado. But the case drew renewed scrutiny and public ire as protesters against racial injustice and police brutality took to streets across the United States in the summer of 2020 after George Floyd, a Black man accused of trying to pass a counterfeit bill, died under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer.
The officer in that case, Derek Chauvin, was later convicted of murder and sentenced to 22 years in prison.
Colorado prosecutors at first declined to bring criminal charges in McClain's case, citing an autopsy that listed the cause of death as undetermined. But Governor Jared Polis ordered the state’s attorney general to open a new investigation last year, leading to the 32-count indictment of police and paramedics in September. 
The local police union at the time called the indictments an ""hysterical overreaction"" and noted an earlier investigation cleared the officers of wrongdoing.
In a written statement on Friday, McClain’s father, LaWayne Mosley, said he hoped the large payout “sends a message to police everywhere that there are consequences for their actions.” 
“I hope Elijah’s legacy is that police will think twice before killing another innocent person,” he said.
Aurora Police Chief Vanessa Wilson said on Friday that her department has implemented “significant changes” in response to the tragedy.

The finalized agreement comes after a mediation hearing between McClain's family members in federal court on Friday, the city said.
Municipal liability insurance will cover $10 million of the settlement, the maximum amount it can pay. The remaining $5 million will be paid from Aurora's general fund, the city said.

SAN JOSE, Calif. (Reuters) -Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes took the stand on Friday to defend herself against charges of defrauding investors and patients about the now-defunct blood-testing startup once valued at $9 billion.
Holmes, 37, is accused of making false claims about Theranos, including that its technology could run a range of diagnostic tests more quickly and accurately than conventional laboratory testing with a drop of blood from a finger prick.
Removing her blue mask to testify, Holmes said that her work at Theranos led her to believe in the company's technology. 
Holmes told the jury about early efforts to raise capital, testifying that she had met with Silicon Valley venture capitalist Don Lucas, who ultimately invested in Theranos and became the chairman of its board.
""I knew him as someone who focused on building great companies for the long term,"" she said. ""He had a lot of questions.
Lucas ""began a very comprehensive diligence process,"" including asking for Theranos' financial information, Holmes added.
Once touted as the Steve Jobs of biotech, Holmes and Theranos' fortunes waned after the Wall Street Journal published a series of articles starting in 2015 that suggested its devices were flawed and inaccurate.
The willingness of Holmes to testify adds to the buzz surrounding the trial. Defendants are not required to testify in criminal cases, but sometimes do so in a bid to create reasonable doubt about their guilt by punching holes in the prosecution's case.
A major risk is that prosecutors can cross examine them, in an effort to expose possible inconsistencies or lies in their testimony.
Holmes has pleaded not guilty to nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy.
Over the course of the two-month trial, jurors in San Jose, California, have heard testimony from more than two dozen prosecution witnesses, including patients and investors whom prosecutors say Holmes deceived.
At the close of their case on Friday, prosecutors moved to dismiss one count of fraud regarding a patient.
Defense attorney Lance Wade told jurors during opening statements in September that Holmes had been a young, hardworking entrepreneur who underestimated the obstacles Theranos faced.
He said the trial would show Holmes to be ""a living, breathing human being who did her very best each and every day.""
On Friday, Holmes described having been absorbed in lab research when she decided to leave Stanford University to start Theranos in 2003 at the age of 19.

She also said she had introduced early investors to representatives from pharmaceutical companies that Theranos was in talks with.
Holmes' testimony will resume on Monday morning.

Enterprises involved in the cases would be fined 500,000 yuan ($78,000) each, it said, the maximum under China's 2008 Anti-Monopoly Law.
Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com and Geely did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
China has been tightening its grip on internet platforms, reversing a once laissez-faire approach and citing the risk of abusing market power to stifle competition, misuse of consumers’ data and violation of consumer rights.
The earliest deal listed was a 2012 acquisition involving Baidu and a partner, and the most recent was the 2021 agreement between Baidu and Chinese automaker Zhejiang Geely Holdings to create a new-energy vehicle company.

(Reuters) - With concern over the safety of Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai growing into a global cause, the International Olympic Committee could be pushed into taking a hard line with the 2022 Beijing Olympic hosts, senior IOC member Dick Pound told Reuters.
Former doubles world number one Peng has not been seen or heard from publicly since she said on Chinese social media on Nov. 2 that former vice-premier Zhang Gaoli coerced her into sex and they later had an on-off consensual relationship.
Such is the global outcry over Peng's safety and whereabouts, Pound said the situation could force the IOC to confront China over its human rights record.
Although the outrage is unlikely to stop the Beijing Winter Games going ahead in February, Pound would not completely rule it out.
""If that's not resolved in a sensible way very soon it may spin out of control,"" Pound, the IOC's longest serving member, told Reuters. ""It may (force IOC into taking a harder line).
""Whether that escalates to a cessation of the Olympic Games I doubt it. But you never know."" 
Neither Zhang or the Chinese government have commented on Peng's allegation. The 35-year-old tennis player's social media post was quickly deleted and the topic has been blocked from discussion on China's heavily censored internet.
The governing body of women's tennis (WTA) has called for an investigation and has threatened to pull tournaments worth tens of millions of dollars out of China.
Even though Peng is a three-time Olympian, the IOC has given no indication it is willing to take a similar stand and risk billions of dollars in television rights and sponsorships.
""I don't know whether we are there yet but I'm sure they (IOC executive committee) are following this to see where it is going,"" said Pound, a Canadian lawyer and former-Olympian.
""Action against one of its own citizens for airing a complaint about one of their higher ups - that's harder for them (China) to handle than the usual 'this is a domestic matter now get lost'.""
Thus far the IOC has declined to comment on Peng's matter, saying it believed ""quiet diplomacy"" offered the best opportunity for a solution. 
Pound conceded that China does not respond well to threats and negotiating with sport and government officials requires nuance.
""That would be a little harder line than the IOC would normally be taking,"" said Pound, when asked if the IOC might demand a meeting with Peng. 
""Where we have generated some change of attitude in the past we've said, ""listen this is all out there in the public how do we respond. We can't ignore it.
""That in the past has produced some movement. 

""My guess is it will be that kind of line rather than jabbing them in the chest and saying 'do this or the world will end'.
""If you're China you can say, 'ok it will be disappointing (losing the Olympics) but it will be more disappointing for the rest of the world than it will be for us'.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden is nominating two former government officials to serve on the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) Board of Governors, replacing the current chairman, Ron Bloom, the White House confirmed on Friday.
Biden announced he intends to nominate Daniel Tangherlini, who was chief financial officer at the U.S. Treasury Department under President Barack Obama and held other government positions.
He will also nominate Derek Kan, an executive at startup Deliverr and a former deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget and senior Transportation Department official during the Trump administration. 
Reuters first reported the nominations.
Bloom has drawn anger from some Democrats in Congress over his support for a plan from Postmaster General Louis DeJoy released this year to restructure USPS operations in hopes of reducing anticipated red ink over a decade.
The board last week voted to re-elect Bloom as chairman, even though the White House had not decided whether to renominate him.
Bloom did not comment Friday.
Bloom will be forced to leave the board next month. Biden is also replacing Governor John Barger.
House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney said under DeJoy USPS ""lost focus on its core mission"" and hoped the board ""will begin to hold the Postmaster General accountable for the damage that has been done to the Postal Service’s operations and credibility.""
Many Democrats have urged the Postal Board to fire DeJoy, a supporter of Trump named USPS head last year who came under criticism for changes to election mail deliveries in 2020.
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the administration ""continues to be deeply troubled"" about DeJoy's ""potential financial conflicts"" and takes ""serious issue with the job he's doing running the Postal Service.""
Some Democrats have raised questions about DeJoy's investments in USPS contractors and competitors.
She noted Biden cannot fire DeJoy.
A USPS spokesman pointed to comments from USPS's inspector general in February that said DeJoy had ""divested appropriately"" from USPS contractor  XPO Logistics  (NYSE:XPO), a former DeJoy employer.
The board cannot have more than five Democrats and the new nominations are not expected to result in a board majority willing to oust DeJoy, officials said.
In September, the USPS's revised service standards took effect, slowing some first-class mail deliveries.
Existing one- to three-day service standards were revised to one to five days, affecting about 40% of first-class mail. USPS has also recently hiked prices.
DeJoy, who had warned that USPS without reform is ""on a death spiral,"" in March proposed cutting $160 billion in predicted losses over the next decade with changes in service standards a key part. The USPS has struggled with poor delivery performance over the past year, facing a huge jump in packages and staffing issues due to COVID-19.

The Postal Service has reported net losses of more than $90 billion since 2007. One reason is 2006 legislation mandating it pre-fund more than $120 billion in retiree healthcare and pension liabilities, a requirement not shared by other businesses, which labor unions have called unfair.
Congress is considering a plan to provide the USPS with $46 billion in financial relief over 10 years, including eliminating the requirement that the service pre-fund retiree health benefits for 75 years.

HOPE, British Columbia (Reuters) - For the hundreds of travelers stranded on a mountain road between two mudslides outside the small British Columbia town of Hope on Sunday, the first night was the worst. They had to sleep in their cars.
But then their luck changed - by coincidence, there just happened to be a lodge nearby. And that is how almost 300 strangers found themselves crammed together for three nights.
Damage from the storms and landslides is set to cost billions of dollars to repair, provincial officials say.
Stephanie Schafer, food services manager of Camp Hope Lodge, was alerted by a phone call early on Monday.
""So I came in and started making breakfast ... and then the people just started coming - it ended up to be 271 of them sleeping everywhere,"" she said in an interview on Friday.
The 72-room lodge was already housing several dozen people evacuated from wildfires which destroyed the nearby town of Lytton in June. 
So newcomers slept on mats crammed into halls and the auditorium and the dining room. During the day they played cards and board games.
""It was really an awesome experience. They were beautiful people, so grateful to get out of their car, so grateful for a place to go to the bathroom,"" said Schafer.
Craig Schelter was stranded in his truck outside Hope when a school bus turned up and took him and others to the lodge. He said the experience had been emotional.
""It's been great to see how everybody supported one another,"" he said.
By late Wednesday, rescuers opened a narrow road to the town, and people were able to start leaving. 

That did not include David and Doreen Crozier, who lost everything when Lytton burned down.
""It's been kind of weird, (experiencing) so much all at once,"" said Doreen.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Outcry over Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai's whereabouts escalated as the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) threatened to pull tournaments out of China over her disappearance and the White House asked Beijing to prove she was safe. 
Former doubles world number one Peng has not been seen or heard from publicly since she said on Chinese social media on Nov. 2 that former vice-premier Zhang Gaoli coerced her into sex and they later had an on-off consensual relationship.
Neither Zhang or the Chinese government have commented on her allegation. Peng's social media post was quickly deleted and the topic has been blocked from discussion on China's heavily censored internet.
Concern among the global tennis community and beyond has grown over Peng's safety and whereabouts since her allegation, with the WTA calling for an investigation.
Some of the world's top tennis players, including Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka, as well as the German Olympic Committee, have used the social media hashtag #WhereIsPengShuai.
The White House on Friday called for the Chinese government to provide ""independent, verifiable proof"" of Peng's whereabouts and safety. 
""We are deeply concerned by reports that Peng Shuai appears to be missing after accusing a former [People's Republic of China] senior official of sexual assault,"" said spokesperson Jen Psaki.
French sports minister Roxana Maracineany called for transparency.
""Our country is deeply committed to the respect of human rights. Transparency is absolutely necessary on accusations of sexual assault such as the situation of Peng Shuai,"" she wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Friday. 
""We are following this issue closely with the tennis authorities and the Quai d'Orsay (foreign ministry).""
The issue has emerged as China prepares to host the Winter Olympics in Beijing in February amid calls from global rights groups and others for a boycott over its human rights record. The International Olympic Committee has declined to comment on Peng's matter, saying it believed ""quiet diplomacy"" offered the best opportunity for a solution. 
Liz Throssell, a U.N. human rights spokesperson, called for proof of Peng's whereabouts and wellbeing as well as a transparent investigation into her allegations.
WTA Chief Executive Steve Simon told CNN and other U.S. media outlets on Thursday that the tour would consider pulling tournaments worth tens of millions of dollars out of China. 
In a statement to Reuters on Friday, Simon said the WTA was ""at a crossroads"" with China.
""We continue to call for independent and verifiable proof that Peng Shuai is safe and that her sexual assault allegation will be investigated fully, fairly and without censorship. If not, the WTA is prepared to do what is right,"" he said.
FOCUS OF EXPANSION
Hu Xijin, editor of China's Global Times, responded to Simon's comments to CNN on Friday on Twitter, saying ""don't use a coercive tone when expressing any concern to China.""
""Perhaps you did it out of goodwill. But you should understand China, including understanding how the system you dislike has promoted the actual rights of the 1.4 billion Chinese,"" said Hu, whose newspaper is published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily.
The WTA said it was not responding to Hu's tweet.
China has been the focus of the WTA's most aggressive expansion over the last decade and hosted nine tournaments in the 2019 season with a total $30.4 million of prize money on offer.
The season-ending WTA Finals had a prize purse of $14 million in 2019 when it was played in Shenzhen for the first time.
The Finals were cancelled last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and moved this year to Guadalajara, Mexico, but the WTA has said it will return to Shenzhen from 2022 until 2030.
Streaming platform iQiyi is the WTA's digital rights partner in China, signing a 10-year deal reportedly worth $120 million. The deal commenced in 2017.
HEAVILY CENSORED IN CHINA
The hashtag #WhereIsPengShuai has so far racked up more than 32 million mentions on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s Instagram and Twitter, according to hashtag analysis website BrandMentions. Both platforms are blocked in China. 
In contrast, the topic remains heavily censored in China's tightly controlled cyberspace. As of Friday, searches for the WTA's official account on China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) platform yielded no results although its account remained available. Peng's name on Weibo also continues to show no search results.
Peng had not been seen or heard from since her post until Wednesday, when the WTA's Simon said he had received an email purporting to be from Peng and denying the allegations of sexual assault, which he cast doubt over. A Chinese state media outlet also released the letter on Twitter. 

Hu, who has a uniquely high profile in China's tightly controlled state media, weighed in on the scandal on Twitter earlier on Friday, saying he does not believe she has been the target of retribution.
""As a person who is familiar with Chinese system, I don't believe Peng Shuai has received retaliation and repression speculated by foreign media for the thing people talked about,"" he said on Twitter. He did not make any similar comment on his official account on Weibo.

BIELSK PODLASKI, Poland/BRUZGI, Belarus (Reuters) -Poland accused Belarus on Friday of trucking hundreds of migrants back to the border and pushing them to attempt to cross illegally, only hours after clearing camps at a frontier that has become the focus of an escalating East-West crisis.
The accusation by Poland suggests the crisis has not been resolved by an apparent change of tack by Minsk, which on Thursday had cleared the main camps by the border and allowed the first repatriation flight to Iraq in months. 
European governments accuse Belarus of flying in thousands of people from the Middle East and pushing them to attempt to illegally cross the EU border, where several people have died in the freezing woods. Belarus denies fomenting the crisis.
Polish Border Guard spokesperson Anna Michalska said that by Thursday evening, just hours after clearing the camps, Belarus authorities were already trucking hundreds back and forcing them to try to cross in darkness.
""(The Belarusians) were bringing more migrants to the place where there was a forced attempt to cross,"" Michalska said. ""At the beginning there were 100 people, but then the Belarusian side brought more people in trucks. Then there were 500 people.""
When the migrants tried to cross the border, Belarusian troops blinded Polish guards with lasers, she told a news conference. Some migrants had thrown logs and four guards sustained minor injuries.
Access to the border on the Polish side is restricted by a state of emergency, making it difficult to verify her account.
'NIGHTMARE'
In an interview with the BBC, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko repeated denials that he had orchestrated the crisis but, asked if Belarus was helping migrants try and cross into Poland, he said: ""I think that's absolutely possible. We're Slavs. We have hearts. Our troops know the migrants are going to Germany. Maybe someone helped them. I won't even look into this.""
The migrants from the camp on the Belarus side were taken on Thursday to a huge, crowded warehouse and journalists were permitted to film them. Children ran about on Friday morning, and men played cards while one dangled a toddler on his lap.
""This is not a life but this is not permanent, this should be just temporary until they decide our destiny: to take us to Europe or bring us back to our countries,"" said 23-year-old electrician Mohammed Noor.
""What I wish for myself, I wish it for others too - to go to Europe and live a stable life.""
Meanwhile in a hospital in Bielsk Podlaski, on the Polish side, two migrants who had been caught after crossing were given treatment before being taken away by Polish border guards.
Before he was taken away, Mansour Nassar, 42, a father-of-six from Aleppo, in Syria, who had travelled to Belarus from Lebanon, described his ordeal during five days in the forest. 
""The Belarusian army told us: 'If you come back, we will kill you',"" he said, in tears in his hospital bed. ""We drank from ponds… Our people are always oppressed.""
Kassam Shahadah, a Syrian refugee doctor living in Poland who helps out in another hospital, said patients were terrified of being forcibly returned to Belarus.
""What they have seen, what they have lived through on that side is a nightmare for them,"" he said.
EXTREME SUFFERING
Human rights groups say Poland has exacerbated the suffering by sending back those who try to cross. Poland says this is necessary to stop more people from coming.
""I have personally listened to the appalling accounts of extreme suffering from desperate people - among whom many families, children and elderly - who spent weeks or even months in squalid and extreme conditions in the cold and wet woods due to these pushbacks,"" Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights Dunja Mijatović said after a four-day mission to Poland.
""I have witnessed clear signs of their painful ordeal: wounds, frostbite, exposure to extreme cold, exhaustion and stress,"" she said. ""I have no doubt that returning any of these people to the border will lead to more extreme human suffering and more deaths.""
The Polish border guards have recorded seven deaths at the border. Rights groups say more than 10 people have died.
'CYNICAL AND INHUMANE'
Europeans have shunned Lukashenko since a disputed election last year, but reached out cautiously this week, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel speaking to Lukashenko twice by phone.
However, on Thursday the European Commission and Germany rejected a proposal that Minsk said Lukashenko had made to Merkel, under which EU countries would take in 2,000 migrants, while 5,000 others would be sent back home..

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday that the situation on the borders remained deeply concerning.
""Lukashenko's regime's use of vulnerable people as a means to put pressure on other countries is cynical and inhumane,"" he said. ""NATO stands in full solidarity with all affected allies.""

WASHINGTON/OTTAWA/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - When U.S. President Joe Biden gathered the leaders of his closest neighbors at the White House on Thursday, far-off rival China was top of mind.
Trying to unify a collection of democracies to challenge China's growing economic and military clout, Biden has revived the so-called Three Amigos working group ditched by his predecessor Donald Trump.
While he did not say the word ""China"" in front of reporters, aides said the emphasis of his private meetings was on policies designed to counter a country that by some estimates could overtake the United States as the world's largest economy within a decade.
On Thursday, Biden, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador agreed to donate millions in vaccines to third countries, work together to fix their dependency on broken supply chains, and to prohibit imports of goods made with forced labor, which the United States says China uses in its northwestern Xinjiang region. Beijing denies it.
The three leaders also suggested it was time to reverse the trend of decades of global trade and claw back manufacturing from China. 
""It's a paradox that there's so much money in North America and the Pacific ports are saturated with goods from Asia,"" Lopez Obrador said. ""Why can't we produce in North America what we consume?""
Economic integration between the three countries, which make up 28% of global gross domestic product, is the best way to stave off competition from China and an ""unacceptable imbalance"" that ""would keep alive the temptation of trying to resolve this disparity by use of force,"" Lopez Obrador said. 
Under Biden, Washington is the leading supplier of vaccines to the world as it works to jumpstart infrastructure development abroad and secure the raw minerals and supplies it needs to be a leader in electric vehicles.
In each case, China has a rival program, including its Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.
The new effort under Biden, a Democrat, marks another sharp departure from Republican Trump's ""America First"" policies that rubbed some traditional allies of Washington the wrong way. 
NAFTA 
The economies of Canada, Mexico and the United States have been tightly bound since the 1994 implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was later replaced by a similar deal negotiated under Trump.
One rationale for the original deal was that North American trade on fair and open terms would make all three richer, more integrated and prepare them to better compete worldwide, including with an ascendant China.
In the years that followed, China was the clear winner. Beijing expanded its market access with its 2001 entry into the World Trade Organization and the United States became dependent on Chinese exports, while manufacturing jobs migrated to China and other low-cost areas including Mexico.
Many lawmakers from both parties now regard that level of dependence on China as a mistake. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the United States has faced shortages of goods ranging from masks to meat and computer chips, some of which are dependent on manufacturing or raw materials from East Asia.
Shortages this year have contributed to inflation and Americans' deteriorating view of Biden's handling of the economy.
In viewing China as a rival, Biden has natural allies in Canada and Mexico.
Since the end of a three-year standoff over the arrest https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-welcomes-huawei-executive-home-silent-freed-canadians-2021-09-25 of a Huawei Technologies Co executive in September, diplomatic exchanges between Canada and China have been tense.
Canada is promoting its wealth of critical minerals including rare earths used in electric vehicle batteries as a way to wean the West's dependence on China.
""Many of those critical minerals have been cornered by ... certain parts of the world that are somewhat less reliable these days,"" Trudeau said on Wednesday in Washington.
On Thursday, Trudeau and Biden ""underscored their commitment to supply chain security,"" according to a statement after their meeting. 
Lopez Obrador agreed, saying Mexican consumers are also waiting for cars or household appliances because of the semiconductor shortage.

The comments marked a welcome return to putting North America first, said Ildefonso Guajardo, a former Mexican economy minister who oversaw trade negotiations with the Trump administration.
""The new reality of the supply chains and logistical disruptions caused by COVID to international trade obviously means we have to give more priority to North America,"" he said.

""No verdict will be able to bring back the lives of Anthony Huber and Joseph Rosenbaum, or heal Gaige Grosskreutz's injuries, just as no verdict can heal the wounds or trauma experienced by Jacob Blake and his family. No ruling today changes our reality in Wisconsin that we have work to do toward equity, accountability, and justice that communities across our state are demanding and deserve.""
KAREN BLOOM AND JOHN HUBER, ANTHONY HUBER'S FAMILY, IN STATEMENT
""Today's verdict means there is no accountability for the person who murdered our son. It sends the unacceptable message that armed civilians can show up in any town, incite violence, and then use the danger they have created to justify shooting people in the street. We hope that decent people will join us in forcefully rejecting that message and demanding more of our laws, our officials, and our justice system.""

(Reuters) - In January, lawyer Cleta Mitchell joined a phone call with then-President Donald Trump as he pressured Georgia's top election official to ""find"" enough votes to overturn his defeat in the state, playing an important role in Trump's attempts to subvert the 2020 results.
Nearly a year later, the longtime conservative has been appointed to the advisory board of a federal agency with a mission to help states conduct secure elections. 
Her surprise appointment to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission's (EAC) Board of Advisors shows how once-fringe ""election integrity"" activists are trying to gain footholds in U.S. institutions in the run up to next year's congressional elections. And it illustrates Trump's continued dominance over his party as Mitchell and other backers of his stolen-election falsehoods win support from powerful Republicans in Congress. 
    Mitchell, part of a small network of Republican lawyers who have for decades pushed the idea that U.S. elections are vulnerable to rampant fraud, left her partnership at law firm Foley & Lardner days after the Georgia phone call. She has since been focused on championing ""election integrity"" as chairwoman of the conservative Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF). She began work at the EAC advisory board on Nov. 3.
Research by election lawyers shows voter fraud in the United States is rare, despite what Trump and his allies have claimed about voting in 2016, 2018 and 2020.
    Mitchell's appointment, which was made in August but only came to light this week after a tweet by a reporter with non-profit media organization Votebeat, alarmed Democrats and voting rights groups. Although the 35-member board is an advisory body and does not have any specific powers over voting procedures, critics said the appointment gives legitimacy to someone they accuse of undermining faith in the democratic process in the United States.
""I would expect Mitchell to continue to spread disinformation about the actual integrity of American elections,"" said Lisa Graves, executive director of watchdog group True North Research and a former deputy assistant attorney general at the U.S. Department of Justice. ""Putting Mitchell on the advisory board demonstrates how devoted the Trump party is to rewarding those who spread his claims.""
    Mitchell pushed back against the criticism, saying ""millions of Americans"" are concerned about voting integrity. 
""The real outliers are the tiny fraction of Americans who oppose voter ID, who promote an avalanche of unverified mail ballots and who work constantly to eliminate procedures that ensure proper election administration,"" she said in a statement to Reuters.
The EAC's four commissioners said in a statement it was not their role to ""comment on or criticize"" appointments to the Board of Advisors. 
    Mitchell was nominated to the board by conservative members on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (USCCR), a bipartisan agency that studies allegations of discrimination, including in voting rights.
Her appointment is part of a much larger Republican push to try to exert more control over election administration. At least 18 Republican-led states have passed voting restrictions this year, while backers of false stolen-election claims are running campaigns for secretary of state - the top election official - in election battleground states.
    'HOSTAGE'
    Mitchell said her role was clinched with bipartisan support by the eight-person USCCR, evenly split between conservatives and liberals. But Democratic commissioner Michael Yaki told Reuters that his bloc was subject to a ""hostage-like"" situation by conservatives. 
The commission's conservative faction refused to ratify Norma Cantu, who was appointed by President Joe Biden to chair the agency in February, unless certain demands were met, Yaki and Cantu said.
""One of the changes the Conservative placed as a condition to ratifying me as the Chair was to create a process for bipartisan nominations to the board of advisors of Elections Assistance Commission,"" Cantu said in a statement to Reuters.
    At the time, the USCCR chair put forward nominees, who were then ratified by majority vote, but Republicans asked each of the two political factions to put forward a candidate, Yaki said.
The conservatives initially wanted J. Christian Adams, a Trump-appointed USCCR commissioner who has, without evidence, alleged ""alien invasion"" by non-citizens trying to vote illegally in the United States and spent years suing counties to force them to purge voter rolls. Adams, president of the PILF group, was also a member of Trump's election integrity commission, which disbanded without finding evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2016 election.
    When Democrats refused to accept Adams, work on the commission stalled, Yaki said.
    Eventually, the two sides reached a deal in which both factions put forward two appointments to boards such as the EAC's and the opposite side selects one of them.
Adams told Reuters that the selections should have always been bipartisan. ""They weren't. We fixed that,"" he said. ""You don't really think having a bipartisan process is 'being held hostage do you?'"" 
    On April 30, the USCCR commissioners ratified Cantu and, minutes later, agreed to change the appointment process. The commission's four conservatives then put forward two names for the EAC board, according to an internal nomination email reviewed by Reuters: Adams and Mitchell. 

    ""Well, do you drink cyanide or hemlock? It's a Hobson's choice of nightmarish proportions,"" Yaki said.
Adams was well-known for his work at PILF whereas Mitchell was more of an ""unknown variable,"" Cantu said. ""I am not pleased with the appointment and would have welcomed another choice.""

BETHESDA, Md. (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden briefly transferred power to Vice President Kamala Harris Friday as he underwent a colonoscopy, making her the first woman to hold the presidential reins in U.S. history.
Biden, a Democrat, alerted leaders in Congress of the power transfer at 10:10 a.m. EST (1510 GMT) and took back control at 11:35 EST, the White House said.
The president was undergoing a routine physical at the Walter Reed military hospital outside Washington.
White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said Biden spoke to Harris and White House chief of staff Ron Klain after the procedure and was ""in good spirits.""
Biden's power transfer occurred while he was under anesthesia for the colonoscopy. Harris worked from her office in the West Wing of the White House during that time, Psaki said.
Harris is the first woman to serve as vice president of the United States; no woman has ever been president in the country's nearly 250-year history.
The moment, while historical, doesn’t count as a woman having served as U.S. president, said Debbie Walsh, the director of the Center for American Women and Politics, a research group.
But it does reinforce that “for the first time a woman is the number one person in the line of succession,” she said. “It is still not the presidency, that glass ceiling has not yet been broken.” 
The U.S. Constitution's 25th Amendment lays out a process for the president to transfer power when he is unable to discharge his duties.
Presidential power has been transferred to the vice president before, when President George W. Bush had colonoscopies in 2002 and 2007.
Biden, who turns 79 on Saturday, is the oldest person to take office as U.S. president, leading to high interest in his health and well-being. Although speculation has persisted about whether he will run for re-election in 2024, he has said he expects to seek a second four-year term.
Biden has pledged to be more transparent about his health than predecessor Donald Trump. The Republican visited Walter Reed in 2019 for an undisclosed reason that a former press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, later revealed was for a colonoscopy. 

Trump once had his doctor brief the press about the president's health after questions were raised about his mental acuity.
Psaki said the White House would release a comprehensive written summary of Biden's physical later on Friday.

A state grand jury indicted Murdaugh on counts stemming from schemes to defraud law clients and associates and launder more than $4.8 million dollars, South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson said in a statement.
Murdaugh, 53, scion of a South Carolina legal dynasty whose wife and son were murdered in June, remains in custody at the Alvin S. Glenn Detention Center in Columbia, South Carolina. He was suspended from practicing law in September. 
The new indictments charge him with crimes including breach of trust, fraudulent intent, money laundering, computer crimes and forgery, Wilson said. Murdaugh's lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Murdaugh was accused of embezzling settlement funds related to his housekeeper, Gloria Satterfield, who died in 2018 after a ""trip and fall"" accident in the Murdaugh home, according to court records.
Satterfield's heirs have claimed in a South Carolina probate court that Murdaugh diverted more than $3.5 million in death settlement money to a fraudulent account, according to local reports.
Murdaugh also was accused of arranging to have himself shot on Sept. 4 so his son, Buster Murdaugh, could collect an insurance payout. 

Murdaugh's lawyer previously said the elder Murdaugh, who was wounded and survived, arranged the shooting because of depression following the shooting deaths of his wife and another son, Paul. 
Satterfield family lawyers cheered the new indictments as a move toward justice.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York has launched its largest tourism advertising campaign in history. John F. Kennedy International Airport bustles again with foreign passengers. The holiday season promises peak travel cheer, with more visitors on streets and in stores.
But souvenir shops, horse carriage drivers and small businesses that rely on vacationers said it could take weeks, or longer, to revive their fortunes, especially to robust pre-pandemic levels.
""I'm just pessimistic, that they're not going to return in the way people think they will,"" said Daniel Zambrzycki, the owner of Gifts on the Square in Times Square, one of the world's most-visited tourist sites. ""It's a snail-pace progression.""
International tourists bring something different to New York than domestic travelers, city tourism officials said. They tend to spend more, stay longer, and bring a mix of cultures, accents and attitudes that reinforce its cosmopolitan feel.
How and when New York tourism emerges from the pandemic after U.S. curbs on foreign travel were eased on Nov. 8 is something that business owners, city officials and other top tourist destinations are closely watching. 
Vijay Dandapani, chief executive of the Hotel Association of New York City, sees the country's most populous city as a litmus test for tourism in the rest of the country.
""New York is the biggest destination,"" he said. ""Many stop here and go on to other places.""
Current forecasts are not encouraging. This year, NYC & Co, the city's tourism agency, expects total visitor spending of $24 billion, down from about $47 billion in 2019.
Just 2.8 million foreign visitors are expected this year, a far cry from the record 13.5 million in 2019, when they accounted for 20% of all visitors and half of the spending.
International visitors could triple to 8.5 million next year, NYC & Co spokesman Chris Heywood said. But a rebound to 2019 levels may not come until 2025, two years after domestic travel is expected to recover.
By comparison, it took five years for international tourism in the city to fully recover following the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, according to the agency.
'IT TAKES TIME'
Some souvenir stores in the Times Square area closed for good after pandemic restrictions shut down discretionary travel from much of the world, making parts of New York feel like a ghost town. While pedestrian traffic has picked up since the summer, shops that remain are operating through uncertainty.
Zambrzycki, for one, worries that spikes in crime and homelessness since the pandemic began in March 2020 will deter some foreign visitors. 
He said revenues at his store remained down 65% from 2019. He has no immediate plans to restore store hours or enlarge his four-person staff - half the number in 2019.
Jalal Alif, who manages a shop called I Love NY by Phantom of Broadway, also sees no quick surge in customer traffic.
""It takes time,"" Alif said, standing in the middle of the nearly empty store. ""It's not going to be the same like before."" 
To jumpstart a rebound, NYC & Co has launched a $30 million tourism campaign, its largest, with $6 million dedicated to key international markets, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Mexico, Brazil and South Korea, Heywood said.
""Our goal really is to create urgency to book now and ensure that New York is at the top of the priority list for international travel.""
About 20 blocks north of Times Square, Kieran Emanus has offered rides through Central Park in his horse-drawn carriage for decades. Like a visit to the Statue of Liberty, the experience is on the bucket list of many out-of-town visitors. 
Emanus enjoyed a modest uptick in bookings in the first week after restrictions were lifted. A good day before the pandemic would have had six carriage bookings on weekdays and 12 on weekends, he said. Now, ""if you get eight on a weekend day, you are very happy.""

But there are hopeful signs. 
Six groups from Britain were among Emanus' recent customers, he said. ""I hadn't seen an English person since the pandemic.""

KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) - The 12-member jury that acquitted U.S. teenager Kyle Rittenhouse on Friday of all charges in his murder trial over shootings at protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last year deliberated on five felony charges and several related charges.
All five charges carried the aggravating factor of ""use of a dangerous weapon."" 
COUNT 1: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESS HOMICIDE
This felony stemmed from Rittenhouse fatally shooting Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and carries a sentence of up to 60 years in prison. 
Video at the trial showed Rosenbaum chasing Rittenhouse into a used-car lot as Rittenhouse yelled: ""Friendly, friendly, friendly."" Rittenhouse and a witness testified that Rosenbaum, who was unarmed, tried to grab the teen's rifle. 
The charge required the jury to find that Rittenhouse caused the death with ""utter disregard for human life.""
COUNTS 2 AND 3: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESSLY ENDANGERING SAFETY
Prosecutors say that when Rittenhouse shot Rosenbaum, the teenager recklessly endangered the safety of a bystander, Richard McGinnis. McGinnis, chief video director of the Daily Caller, a conservative website, testified that Rosenbaum tried to grab the barrel of Rittenhouse's rifle before the teenager shot Rosenbaum.
Before Rittenhouse shot Anthony Huber, video shows an unidentified man trying to kick Rittenhouse and the teen firing two shots at him, which appear to miss. Prosecutors also charged Rittenhouse with first-degree recklessly endangering safety for this incident.
The felony carries a fine of up to $25,000 and up to 12-1/2 years in prison.
COUNT 4: FIRST-DEGREE INTENTIONAL HOMICIDE
This was the most serious charge Rittenhouse faced and similar to first-degree murder in other states. It carried a mandatory sentence of life in prison.
The charge stems from the death of Huber, 26, the second person Rittenhouse shot.
After shooting Rosenbaum, Rittenhouse fled the scene and was chased by Huber and others. After stumbling to the ground, Rittenhouse shot Huber, who swung a skateboard at him. 
The judge granted a prosecution request to have the jury also consider second-degree intentional homicide and first-degree reckless homicide. Both carry up to 60 years in prison. 
COUNT 5: ATTEMPTED FIRST-DEGREE INTENTIONAL HOMICIDE

This charge stemmed from Rittenhouse wounding Gaige Grosskreutz, 27, who lost part of his arm to the bullet. The felony carries up to 60 years in prison.
The judge granted a prosecution request to have the jury also consider attempted second-degree intentional homicide, which carries up to 60 years in prison, and first-degree reckless endangering safety, which is punishable by up to 12-1/2 years in prison.

443,"<span>Nov 19, 2021 01:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) - A jury in the murder trial of Kyle Rittenhouse, 18, decided on Friday to acquit him on all charges in the deaths of two men and the wounding of a third with a military-style rifle during protests last year in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
Before the killings, Kenosha had endured two nights of chaotic protests over the police shooting of a local Black man, Jacob Blake. Several businesses were burned to the ground and there were incidents of looting. Police used rubber bullets and tear gas to control the crowds. 
The following is based on court testimony, drone footage and videos from Aug. 25, 2020:
* During the day, Rittenhouse helps clean graffiti off a school. That same day Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, is released from a Milwaukee hospital where he had been admitted after a suicide attempt. 
* Around 10 p.m. video shows Rittenhouse with a rifle standing with other armed men near a used-car dealership. Rittenhouse testified he was asked to help guard the business due to the threat of looting and arson. He brought a medical kit and says his objective was to provide aid to anyone injured.
* Around 10:45 p.m., another video shows Rittenhouse asking police officers for water. One officer says: ""We appreciate you guys. We really do.""
* Around 11:45 p.m. Rosenbaum chases Rittenhouse into a used-car lot as Rittenhouse yells ""Friendly, friendly, friendly."" Rosenbaum throws a plastic bag containing toiletries at Rittenhouse.
* Rittenhouse testified that Rosenbaum grabbed his gun. A journalist for the Daily Caller, a conservative website, testified that Rosenbaum lunged for the rifle. Rittenhouse fires his gun at Rosenbaum, hitting him four times and killing him.
* Video shows Rittenhouse fleeing the scene of the Rosenbaum shooting and being chased by a growing crowd, some yelling ""Get him!""
* Just minutes later, after stumbling to the ground, Rittenhouse fatally shoots Anthony Huber, a 26-year-old who swung a skateboard at him. 
* After Huber was shot, Gaige Grosskreutz, now 27, stops moving toward Rittenhouse and put his hands in the air. He was holding a handgun. When Grosskreutz resumes advancing, Rittenhouse shoots him, severing most of his bicep. Rittenhouse testified that Grosskreutz had his pistol pointed at his head.

* Rittenhouse then walks toward the police with his hands up and the rifle slung across his body. Police order him to get out of the way and one officer pepper sprays Rittenhouse when he approaches the window of the patrol car. The police then drive off, believing the active shooter was elsewhere.
* Around 1:30 a.m. on Aug. 26, Rittenhouse, accompanied by his mother, turns himself into a police station in his hometown of Antioch, Illinois.

444,"<span>Nov 19, 2021 01:31PM ET</span>",,,,,,"KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) - The following were some of the key moments in the murder trial of Kyle Rittenhouse in Wisconsin that may have factored into the jury's decision to acquit him on all charges on Friday.
Rittenhouse, 18, was charged in the killing of Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and the wounding of Gaige Grosskreutz, 27.
1) Rittenhouse testifies in his own defense
In dramatic and risky testimony, Rittenhouse took the stand and portrayed himself as wanting to help others by providing medical aid and extinguishing fires. He said he used his gun only after being attacked and ambushed.
Rittenhouse broke down sobbing as he recalled the events immediately before he shot Rosenbaum, prompting the judge to call for a recess. After returning to the stand, Rittenhouse testified that Rosenbaum charged at him, telling the jury, ""I remember his hand on the barrel of my gun."" 
Rittenhouse told the prosecution during cross examination: ""I did what I had to do to stop the person who was attacking me."" He admitted using deadly force but said he did not intend to kill anyone.
2) The only survivor testifies 
Grosskreutz, the only protester shot by Rittenhouse to survive, testified that he had pointed his Glock pistol in Rittenhouse's direction and only advanced on the teenager as a last resort because he thought he ""was going to die.""
Under cross-examination by the defense, Grosskreutz said Rittenhouse did not fire when his hands were up and only did so when he moved toward Rittenhouse with his pistol pointed at him. 
The photos of the injuries to his arm were so gruesome that some jurors adverted their eyes.
3) Eyewitness testifies about Rosenbaum's death
Richie McGinniss - chief video director of the Daily Caller, a conservative website - was perhaps the closest eyewitness to any of the shootings. 
While the prosecution called him as a witness, his testimony helped the defense argue that Rittenhouse acted in self-defense. McGinniss testified that Rosenbaum tried to grab the barrel of Rittenhouse's rifle before the teenager fired.
McGinnis was both a witness and victim in the case. Prosecutors say Rittenhouse endangered McGinniss when he shot Rosenbaum. McGinnis testified that he had to check to make sure he was not shot. 
4) Judge and prosecutor spar
Throughout the two weeks of testimony, Kenosha County Judge Bruce Schroeder and the prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger, have clashed. 
Their exchanges got especially heated when Binger crossed examined Rittenhouse. 
Schroeder twice asked the jury to leave the courtroom and then sharply admonished Binger for his line of questioning.
""When you say you were acting in good faith, I don't believe you,"" the judge said to Binger. At one point, he barked at Binger: ""Don't get brazen with me!""
5) FBI drone video

On the night of the shooting, the FBI had a drone conducting surveillance about 8,500 feet (2,600 meters) overhead. The grainy, infrared video was shown at the trial as evidence of what happened in the moments leading up to Rittenhouse shooting Rosenbaum.
Aerial surveillance by law enforcement has happened during other protests but critics say it infringes on civil rights and privacy.

(Reuters) - The Biden administration will remove the word “squaw” from place names on federal land as part of an effort to reckon with the nation's racist past, the Department of Interior said on Friday.
The word, a term for Indigenous women that Native Americans find offensive, is used in more than 650 place names on federal lands, according to the Department. 
Several states, including Maine, Minnesota and Montana, have already banned the use of the term in place names.
""Racist terms have no place in our vernacular or on our federal lands,"" said Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the nation's first Native American cabinet official. 
""Our nation's lands and waters should be places to celebrate the outdoors and our shared cultural heritage - not to perpetuate the legacies of oppression.""
She said her agency would also create an advisory committee to begin a review to find and replace other derogatory names of places on federal land.
The so-called Advisory Committee on Reconciliation in Place Names will be comprised of representatives from tribes, Native Hawaiians, civil rights and cultural studies experts and members of the public.
The committee's creation is aimed at accelerating the renaming of properties. Currently, there are hundreds of name changes pending before the Board on Geographic Names, and the process can take years, the Department said.

A Native American rights group applauded Haaland's action.
""It is well past time for us, as a nation, to move forward, beyond these derogatory terms, and show Native people - and all people - equal respect,"" John Echohawk, executive director of the Native American Rights Fund, said in a statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Now that the U.S. House of Representatives has passed President Joe Biden's ambitious $1.75 trillion social policy and climate bill, the action moves to the Senate, where its fate is unclear.
Biden's Democrats, who hold the thinnest-possible Senate majority, do not expect any Republican support for the sprawling initiative, leaving them to turn to a maneuver known as ""budget reconciliation"" for a second time this year.
    WHAT IS RECONCILIATION?
The reconciliation procedure enables the 100-member Senate to pass measures with a simple majority vote, instead of the 60 votes required by Senate rules to stop debates known as ""filibusters."" That means Democrats, who currently control 50 Senate seats, do not have to try to get at least 10 Republicans to vote with them. Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris can break a tie, giving the party a majority.
    WHEN AND WHY WAS RECONCILIATION CREATED?
    Reconciliation came into being as part of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. It was designed to enable lawmakers to adjust spending or revenues to comply with a budget blueprint without supermajority support.
    The law was one of several Congress passed in the 1970s establishing exceptions to the 60-vote filibuster rule. Others included fast-track procedures for Congress to approve trade agreements, or to limit the president's ability to commit troops overseas.
    HOW HAS RECONCILIATION BEEN USED?
    Reconciliation has become a favored route to enable a president to pass trademark legislation. It has been used over 20 times since 1980.
    Then-President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, used reconciliation to raise taxes. Republicans George W. Bush and Donald Trump used it to cut them. Barack Obama, a Democrat, used it to help create the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. 
Biden has already used reconciliation to pass a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 aid package. He did not need it to push through another part of his agenda, a $1 trillion infrastructure bill, because 19 Republicans in the Senate and 13 in the House supported that measure.
    Majority parties cannot use the process all the time. Legislation has to have a direct budgetary impact to qualify. Reconciliation generally has not been employed more than once a year. 
Biden’s Democrats can use reconciliation again this calendar year because their previous use was connected to the fiscal 2021 budget. Now they are switching to the fiscal 2022 budget.
    HOW DOES RECONCILIATION WORK?
    First, the House and Senate pass budget resolutions with ""reconciliation instructions"" for committees. That happened in August.
The program initially called for $3.5 trillion worth of environmental and social programs promised by Biden, such as clean energy requirements for utilities, free community college, extending the child tax credit and paid family and medical leave.
The plan was whittled down after objections to the cost from centrist Democrats. Many proposals were assigned shorter periods, while some ideas like the community college spending were tossed out altogether. The measure would be financed by higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations as well as increased tax enforcement measures.
In the Senate, it is the parliamentarian's job to identify items that should be stripped out of reconciliation bills because they look more like regulatory initiatives than fiscal matters. That happened in February when the parliamentarian ruled that a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage should not be included in the COVID-19 aid reconciliation bill.
The parliamentarian has been reviewing the 2,000-plus-page ""Build Back Better"" bill, and lawmakers say she has already nixed two immigration proposals that were in previous versions. Supporters hope she will approve new wording on immigration that is in the bill now.
Generally the parliamentarian's rulings are respected by the majority. Senators would need 60 votes to overturn them.
Before the final Senate vote, there is a session called the ""vote-a-rama"" in which amendments can be offered until the parties agree to stop.
    PARTY UNITY REQUIRED AT THE FINISH LINE 
    In the end, Senate Democrats must stick together to pass the reconciliation bill, since no Republican support is expected. Democrats currently need all their members to pass the measure, but at least two moderate Senate Democrats have repeatedly expressed concerns about the ""Build Back Better"" plan, leaving its fate in doubt.

Senator Joe Manchin has not committed to voting for the program, and urged lawmakers to slow their rush to pass it. The West Virginia Democrat opposes the paid family leave provisions and has objected to some environmental measures such as tax incentives for electric vehicles.
Senator Kyrsten Sinema's opposition to the initial $3.5 trillion price tag was one reason it was slashed. But like Manchin, she has still not promised publicly to back the bill.

They wanted to make a citizen's arrest, they told police. Arbery's family and their supporters say he was targeted because he was Black.
Here are some highlights of the trial before Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley of Georgia's Eastern Judicial District: 
Nov. 3: 
A jury of 11 white people and one Black man is selected in Glynn County Superior Court. It took almost three weeks because many potential jurors told the court they personally knew Arbery or know some or all of the defendants.
During jury selection, Kevin Gough, who represents Bryan, complained that the potential jury pool didn't contain enough white men over 40 without a college degree - people he called ""Joe Six-pack"" and ""Bubba.""
Prosecutors tried unsuccessfully to argue that defense lawyers rejected many potential jurors because they were Black, which the U.S. Supreme Court has long deemed unconstitutional.
Nov. 5:
The jury is seated, and opening statements were made. Cobb County prosecutor Linda Dunikoski told the jury that the defendants had deadly intent. She pointed to something the elder McMichael told police he shouted at Arbery: ""Stop or I'll blow your fucking head off!""
Defense attorney Rob Rubin, representing the younger McMichael, told the jury that the men were trying to make a citizen's arrest.
""It is a citizen's job to help the police, and the law authorizes that,"" Rubin said. ""When seconds count, the police are often minutes away.""
Nov. 10:
Glynn County Police Detective Roderic Nohilly told the jury that Greg McMichael said Arbery realized he was not going to get away.
""He was trapped like a rat,"" the elder McMichael told the detective a few hours after the deadly pursuit, according to an interview transcript read aloud in court.
Nov. 11
The jury heard recorded police calls and saw surveillance videos of Arbery walking around a vacant, half-built house, over the weeks and months before his death. The final visit was just minutes before he was shot.
The McMichaels told police they were aware of reports of an unidentified Black man wandering around the property.
Outside of the jury's presence, defense attorney Kevin Gough complained to the court that civil rights leader Al Sharpton, a nationally known Black preacher, was in the courtroom with the Arbery family.
Gough said his team did not want ""any more Black pastors coming"" into the Georgia courtroom, saying it might influence the jury.
Judge Walmsley said, ""I am not going to blanketly exclude members of the public.""
Nov. 16
After eight days of testimony and 23 witnesses, the prosecution rested its case after presenting evidence it said showed the defendants wrongly assumed the worst about a Black man jogging through the mostly white Satilla Shores neighborhood.
The state rested after the jury was shown graphic photos of Arbery's body and hearing testimony from the medical examiner.
Nov. 17
Travis McMichael, the man who shot Arbery, took the stand in his own defense and testified, at times on the verge of tears, that he thought Arbery was a burglar and said Arbery tried to take his weapon. 
""I shot him. He had my gun,"" Travis McMichael said. ""It was a life-or-death situation.""
He testified about his Coast Guard training to apprehend suspects in the line of duty, protecting high-value ships and intercepting drug dealers or helping immigration officials.
Nov. 18
A prosecutor questioned Travis McMichael over apparent inconsistencies in the accounts he gave to police of how he chased and shot Arbery.
McMichael said his statements to police that day were ""choppy"" because he was nervous and under stress.

""I just killed a man,"" he said. ""I had blood on me still. It was the most traumatic event of my life."" 
The defense teams rested their cases and jurors were told to return on Monday morning for closing arguments.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -The Kremlin denounced as ""absurd"" on Friday a resolution proposed by U.S. lawmakers to stop recognising Vladimir Putin as Russia's president if he stays in power after 2024, and described it as U.S. meddling in Russian affairs. 
Putin's term as president is due to end in 2024 and he can seek two more terms under constitutional amendments made during his presidency. Under the previous constitutional limits, he would have been barred from running again.
The resolution introduced by two U.S. congressmen says the amendments were illegal and any attempt by Putin to remain in office after May 2024 ""shall warrant nonrecognition on the part of the United States,"" according to a statement on the website of Congressman Steve Cohen, one of the lawmakers behind it.
""Every time we think there is nothing more absurd, aggressive, unfriendly and unconstructive that can come from that side of the ocean, and every time we are wrong unfortunately,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. 
""This is a perfect demonstration not only to Russia, but to all the countries of the world that the United States officially interferes in the internal affairs of other countries.""
Peskov said it was up to Russians to choose their president, and that Russian lawmakers were likely to retaliate. 
Konstantin Kosachev, deputy speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament, said the resolution was ""a provocation designed to disrupt the nascent normalisation of bilateral relations.""
""This time the Americans have started meddling in the presidential elections rather early on,"" he wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).

Putin on Thursday described Russian-U.S. ties as ""unsatisfactory"" but said he was open to dialogue. The Kremlin has raised the possibility of a second summit between Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden.
Putin, who is 69 and has been in power as president or prime minister since the turn of the century, has not said whether he plans to run again in 2024.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's centrist presidential candidates are lagging behind the polarized favorites on the right and left ahead of Sunday's election, but could play roles as kingmakers in an expected second-round run-off.
Yasna Provoste, 51, a former teacher, sits in third place in opinion polls for the powerful center-left Christian Democratic party, behind hard-right front-runner Jose Antonio Kast and leftist former student protest leader Gabriel Boric.
Sebastian Sichel, 44, a lawyer and independent allied to the center-right ruling coalition, is in fourth.
Both have been squeezed out - at least according to the polls - by voters shifting to radical candidates amid anger over inequality, crime and immigration.
Most pollsters forecast that Kast and Boric will seize the top two spots needed to head to a run-off in December, though both will fall well short of the 50% plus one vote needed to win outright. Luring voters from their centrist rivals will be key.
But it's unclear how moderate voters would lean in a run-off. Voting is voluntary in Chile, so they may abstain - or take their cue from their first choice candidates.
Sichel, backed by the conservative government of President Sebastian Pinera, has criticized Boric, but also distanced himself from Kast, who has praised the ""economic legacy"" of former dictator Augusto Pinochet. Some members of the ruling coalition have put pressure on him to give Kast his backing.
""I will not accept blackmail from those who want me to transform into someone that I am not,"" Sichel said last month. ""It seems that some want to go back to the past and support the old right."" 
Chile election race https://graphics.reuters.com/CHILE-ELECTION/xmpjoryxzvr/chart.png 
'DEMOCRACY VS POPULISM'
In a Pulso Ciudadano poll of probable voters, released earlier in November, Kast had the support of 27.3%, Boric had 23.7%, Provoste had 13.5% and Sichel had 11.3%.
Pollsters are split about whether Kast or Boric would win in a head-to-head. Some polls show that either Provoste or Sichel would beat out both favorites in a second round - if they could make it though.
Provoste, who has indigenous ancestry and is the only woman among the seven presidential candidates, has clashed with the government, and her voters would more likely shift allegiance to Boric than Kast, though some analysts point to her conservative religious values as clashing with her leftist credentials. 
""She has assumed a left-wing discourse, but she does not come from the left,"" said Robert Funk, a political scientist from the University of Chile.
Boric would also need to ease moderate voters' fears about the presence of the Communist Party in his broad coalition.
Provoste has played up her mainstream credentials as a member of the coalition that has ruled copper-rich Chile on-and-off since the return to democracy in 1990.
Under a banner of sustainable growth, she has pledged to rebuild the country from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and after it was convulsed by angry social uprisings in 2019 against inequality. She promises ""governability over populism.""
""We are heirs to a government coalition, the broadest and also the most successful in recent years in our country,"" she recently told a business forum.

Sichel has been critical of what he says are inconsistencies in the programs and economic plans of both Kast and Boric.
""This is our most important election of the 21st century,"" he said in a meeting with business leaders this month. ""What's at play here is not only democracy against violence, but also against populism.""

(Reuters) - Ahmaud Arbery was a 25-year-old Black man running through a mostly white neighborhood on Feb. 23, 2020, when he was chased by three white men in two trucks, and shot and killed about 2 miles (3.2 km) from his mother's house near Brunswick (NYSE:BC), Georgia.
Here is the timeline of the case:
FEB. 23, 2020
Before 1 p.m. on Sunday Arbery left his mother's house, for a jog just outside coastal Brunswick, Georgia, his aunt, Thea Brooks said.
He crossed a four-lane highway into the Satilla Shores subdivision, lined with saw palmettos, old oaks draped with Spanish moss, and ranch-style homes with boat docks along the Little Satilla River.
About 2 miles (3.2 km) into his run, he passes Greg McMichael, who is in his driveway working on boat cushions. McMichael later tells police he thought Arbery might have been running from a crime. He yells to his son Travis McMichael to get a gun and they both give chase in a pickup truck, police reports say. They are then joined by a neighbor, William ""Roddie"" Bryan, in his own pickup truck, who videos part of the encounter on his cellphone.
After being boxed in by the trucks, Arbery is seen on video reaching for a shotgun leveled at him by Travis McMichael. Arbery is fatally shot three times, turns to run one last time, and falls prone on the street.
Glynn County police officers interview the McMichaels and Bryan, but do not file charges, following directions from Jackie Johnson, Brunswick Judicial Circuit's district attorney, a grand jury later found. 
Greg McMichael, a former Glynn County policeman, also worked as an investigator for Johnson.
Feb. 24, 2020
Johnson recuses herself from the case because of her connection with McMichael and informally hands it over to the Waycross Judicial Circuit. 
FEB. 27, 2020
Waycross Judicial Circuit's District Attorney George Barnhill formally takes the case, at the behest of Johnson, court records show.
April 7, 2020
Barnhill recuses himself from the case, telling his boss, Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, that he didn't realize his son had previously worked with Greg McMichael in Johnson's office.
Carr transfers the case to the Atlantic Circuit's District Attorney Tom Durden.
May 5, 2020
A Brunswick radio station, WGIG, is given a copy of Bryan's video of the shooting by an attorney and posts it online. It becomes widely distributed on the internet, sparking a national uproar. Within hours, Durden announces a grand jury investigation. The same day, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp orders the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) to take the case.
May 7, 2020
GBI investigators arrest the McMichaels, charging them each with murder and other crimes. This is 74 days since the shooting.
May 11, 2020
Durden steps aside and Georgia Attorney General Carr appoints Cobb County's District Attorney Joyette Holmes to lead the prosecution. Cobb is the fourth district attorney to take the case.
May 21, 2020
GBI agents arrest Bryan and charge him with murder.
On June 24, 2020
A grand jury formally indicts all three men on charges of murder, aggravated assault and false imprisonment. 
Nov. 3, 2020
Johnson, who had been the Brunswick Judicial Circuit's district attorney for 10 year, loses her re-election bid, following a grassroots campaign against her spurred by the Arbery case.
Sept. 2, 2021
Johnson is indicted by a grand jury, which accused her of ""showing favor and affection"" to the McMichaels. She is charged with violation of oath of office and obstructing a law enforcement officer.
She has told the media that she did nothing wrong and is currently out on $10,000 bond.

Oct. 18, 2021
The trial starts. It takes 13 days to seat a jury of 11 white people and one black person. All three men are being tried jointly.

PARIS (Reuters) -France's foreign minister warned Iran on Friday not to come to the next round of talks on reviving the 2015 nuclear deal with a ""sham"" negotiating stance, a day after Paris urged the board of the U.N. atomic watchdog to send Iran a tough message.
Tehran had earlier responded to Paris by saying the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which verifies Tehran's compliance with the 2015 deal with world powers limiting Tehran's nuclear programme, must be ""free of any political conduct 
The statements highlighted rising tension before the United States, Iran and world powers resume indirect negotiations on reviving the deal on Nov. 29, five days after a meeting of the IAEA's Board of Governors.
Western diplomats say time is running low to resurrect the pact, which then-U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018, angering Iran and dismaying the other world powers involved - Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia.
Six rounds of indirect talks were held between April and June. The negotiations were interrupted after the election of a new Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, who has said Iran will not back down in the talks.
Paris warned Tehran over what U.S. and European diplomats view as unrealistic demands, including a call for all U.S. and EU sanctions imposed since 2017 to be dropped.
Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told Le Monde newspaper Paris wanted first to establish whether talks would resume where they ended in June. 
""If this discussion is a sham, then we will have to consider the JCPoA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) empty,"" he said, referring to the 2015 deal.
""The United States is ready to return to the negotiations where they left off in June, so that they can be concluded quickly. We will assess from the 29th and in the following days whether this is also the Iranian will.""
France said on Thursday a strong message should be sent to Iran over its nuclear activities and a lack of cooperation.
Diplomats say it is unlikely Western powers will take tough action such as pushing an IAEA board resolution rebuking Iran for fear of jeopardising the Nov. 29 talks.

Tehran said on Friday the IAEA must not be politicised.
""As a responsible member of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Iran has always emphasised that the IAEA's reputation as a technical and specialised body of the United Nations must be free of any political conduct,"" Iran's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Under the 2015 deal, Iran limited its nuclear programme in exchange for relief from sanctions. Trump's 2018 decision to reimpose U.S. sanctions prompted Tehran to begin breaching its nuclear restrictions. ",,,,,

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's military said on Friday it scrambled fighter jets after two Chinese and seven Russian warplanes intruded into its air defence identification zone during what Beijing called regular training.
The Chinese and Russian aircraft entered the northeastern part of the Korea Air Defence Identification Zone (KADIZ) for a unspecified period before exiting, Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said, adding that they did not violate its airspace. 
The JCS dispatched fighter jets and air refuelling tankers as an usual step to brace for a potential contingency. 
The Chinese military said in response to a query that its planes were carrying out routine drills, the JCS said. 
""We assess the situation as joint Chinese and Russian military exercises but additional analysis is needed,"" the JCS said in a statement. 
Chinese and Russian warplanes have often entered the zone in recent years amid conflicting claims over various Air Defence Identification Zones (ADIZ). 
Unlike airspace, an ADIZ is usually an area where countries may unilaterally demand that foreign aircraft take special steps to identify themselves, with no international laws governing ADIZs. 
Moscow does not recognise KADIZ, while Beijing said the area is not territorial airspace and all countries should enjoy freedom of movement there.
In 2019, South Korean warplanes fired hundreds of warning shots toward Russian military aircraft when they entered South Korean airspace during a joint air patrol with China.
South Korea and Japan had scrambled jets to intercept the patrol at the time, accusing Russia and China of violating their airspace. Moscow and Beijing denied it.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Former Japanese premier Shinzo Abe, who remains influential in the ruling party, said on Friday Japan should cooperate with the AUKUS security partners the United States, Britain and Australia on artificial intelligence and cyber capabilities.
The AUKUS pact, which was agreed in September and will see Australia acquiring technology to deploy nuclear-powered submarines, is widely seen as a response to Chinese militarisation in the region, particularly in the strategically important South China Sea.
Japan aims to strengthen ties with ally the United States and other friendly nations while bolstering its own defence posture, as it faces Chinese military expansion.
""A key to realising a free and open Indo-Pacific is ensuring like-minded countries' mid- to long-term engagement with the Indo-Pacific region. From this standpoint, I welcome the formation of AUKUS,"" Abe said in a speech at an online forum.
""It is extremely important to carry out multi-layered efforts to promote the peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific region. I believe Japan should engage in AUKUS cooperation in such areas as cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and quantum technologies.""
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said although AUKUS partnership will begin with nuclear-powered submarines, alliance members expect to accelerate the development of other advanced defence systems including in cyber, AI and quantum computing.
Japan forms the Quad grouping with India and two of the AUKUS members - Australia and the United States. Quad leaders in September held their first in-person summit, which presented a united front amid shared concerns about China.
On Japan's ties with Australia, Abe said the two countries need to deepen further their special strategic partnership.

""Given the regional security environment which has become increasingly severe, there is a need to elevate Japan-Australia bilateral security and defence cooperation to a new level.""
Abe, Japan's longest-serving prime minister, stepped down last year due to ill health, but stayed on as a lawmaker and this month took over as the head of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's largest faction.

(Reuters) -Pressed by a prosecutor about inconsistencies in his testimony, Travis McMichael said at his murder trial on Thursday that he misspoke to police in the hours after fatally shooting Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man who ran by McMichael's home in Georgia.
McMichael, one of three white men on trial for Arbery's death, had told the jury a day earlier that Arbery was grabbing his shotgun at the end of a five-minute chase, so he fired in self defense. On Thursday, he conceded that he told police that day that he could not say for sure whether Arbery actually grabbed it.
The defense teams rested their cases on Thursday, and jurors were told to return on Monday morning for closing arguments.
McMichael said the accounts he gave of the shooting to police initially were ""choppy"" because he was nervous and under stress. He at times misspoke to police, he said, or ""had it wrong"" in his statements made soon after the shooting on Feb. 23, 2020, in Satilla Shores in coastal Georgia.
""I just killed a man,"" he said. ""I had blood on me still. It was the most traumatic event of my life."" 
Prosecutors and relatives say Arbery was an avid runner jogging in a neighborhood a couple of miles from his home.
Outside the Glynn County Superior Court building, hundreds of Black pastors assembled from around the country to offer prayers for Arbery and his family. 
The rally was organized after Kevin Gough, a lawyer for co-defendant William ""Roddie"" Bryan, unsuccessfully asked for a ban on Black pastors coming into the courtroom after Rev. Jesse Jackson, Rev. Al Sharpton and other civil rights activists sat with Arbery's parents in the courtroom's public gallery. 
McMichael told jurors on Wednesday that while he and his father and co-defendant, Gregory McMichael, were chasing Arbery in their pickup truck, Arbery ""turned and ran"" when the younger McMichael told him the police were on their way. 
In cross-examination by prosecutor Linda Dunikoski on Thursday, McMichael agreed that he did not explicitly mention such a moment in a police interview the afternoon of the shooting, nor include it in a written statement he made that day. He later conceded that his father had not called the police while they were pursuing Arbery.
""You're telling this jury you're all confused and you can't get your facts straight when you're telling the police why you shot and killed a man?"" Dunikoski asked.
""I've never been through a situation like that,"" he said.
The younger McMichael said he tried to be calm when calling out to Arbery during the chase and used polite language including ""please."" 
Dunikoski contrasted this with the threatening language McMichael's father used, according to his accounts to police.
Quoting from one of the police interviews, Dunikoski asked the younger McMichael if he heard his father shout at Arbery: ""'Stop or I'll blow your fucking head off?'""
McMichael said he did not recall hearing that.

The two McMichaels presented a joint defense. Their neighbor Bryan, who jumped in his own pickup truck and joined the chase after seeing it go past his driveway, did not call any witnesses. 
McMichael left the stand after more than six hours of testimony over two days. His lawyers have argued that McMichael's neighborhood was on edge over some recent thefts, and called some Satilla Shores residents to testify who said they did not know the McMichaels but had seen thefts discussed in a community Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Two men who spent decades in prison for the murder of Black activist and civil rights advocate Malcolm X in 1965 were exonerated on Thursday after the Manhattan district attorney apologized for what he called ""violations of the law and the public trust.""
Applause broke out in the courtroom as New York State Supreme Court Justice Ellen Biben vacated the convictions against Muhammad Aziz, 83, and Khalil Islam, who died in 2009. Both were released from prison on parole in the 1980s.
Aziz told the court that his wrongful conviction had stemmed from ""a process that was corrupt to its core, one that is all too familiar to Black people in 2021,"" and said he hoped the system would take ""responsibility for the immeasurable harm it caused me.""
Two of Islam's sons who were also present in court, Ameen and Shahid Johnson, told reporters outside the courthouse that they felt ""bittersweet"" about the exoneration because it could not replace everything their family had lost.
Ameen was 1-1/2-years old and their mother was pregnant with Shahid when Islam, who was formerly known as Thomas Johnson, was arrested. The exoneration was a ""very, very long time coming,"" Ameen Johnson told Reuters earlier while waiting to enter the courtroom. ""I honestly didn't think I'd live to see the day.""
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said in court that new exculpatory evidence uncovered during a two-year-long investigation had made it clear that Aziz and Islam were wrongfully convicted for murdering Malcolm X.
Investigators withheld from both defense and prosecution ""dozens and dozens"" of documents from the New York Police Department and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, including reports that implicated other suspects, according to Vance. 
The conviction of a third man for murdering Malcolm X still stands. 
""IGNOMINY"" OF BEING SEEN AS ASSASSINS
Malcolm X rose to prominence as the national spokesman of the Nation of Islam, an African-American Muslim group that espoused Black separatism. He spent over a decade with the group before becoming disillusioned, publicly breaking with it in 1964 and moderating some of his earlier views on racial separation.
He was shot dead at New York City's Audubon Ballroom while preparing to deliver a speech. All three of the men convicted were members of the Nation of Islam.
Before tossing the convictions on Thursday, Biben said she regretted the court could not give Aziz and Islam back the years they had lost.
Islam's family and Aziz could each reasonably seek $1 million in restitution for each year they spent in prison, according to New York-based civil rights lawyer Richard Emery, who has represented wrongfully convicted people.
Emery said there were two ways to seek restitution: suing the state for unjust conviction, and filing a federal civil rights case against the law enforcement agencies involved.
Still, there's ""no hard and fast formula"" for such settlements, according to Zachary Carter, who represented New York City in its $41 million settlement with five men wrongfully convicted of the 1989 rape of a woman jogger in Central Park.
If Islam's family and Aziz seek settlements, their lawyers likely will also point to the damage their reputations suffered from the wrongful convictions, according to Carter. 
Aziz and Islam suffered the ""ignominy"" of being viewed as assassins of a beloved figure in the U.S. civil rights struggle, Carter said. ""What should be the compensation for having been a pariah in your community for so many years?""

One of Malcolm X's daughters, Ilyasah Shabazz, said in a statement on Thursday that she hoped the ""long overdue"" exonerations would bring some peace to Aziz, his family and Islam's family. But Shabazz said her family still wants to know the full truth behind her father's murder.
""Full justice will not be served until all parties involved in the orchestrated killing of our father are identified and brought to justice,"" she said.

(Reuters) - The head of the Women's Tennis Association on Wednesday voiced doubt over an email it received, also released by a Chinese state media outlet, in which tennis player Peng Shuai was said to deny her allegations of sexual assault.
Peng, one of China's biggest sport stars, said on social media this month that former Chinese vice premier Zhang Gaoli coerced her into sex and that they later had an on-off consensual relationship.
Her post was deleted about half an hour later and she had not since then been seen in public or made a statement, alarming the global tennis community.
On Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Wednesday, Chinese state media outlet CGTN released what it said was an email Peng had sent to WTA Chairman Steve Simon, who is also its CEO, in which she said the allegation of assault was untrue. Twitter is blocked in China.
""The statement released today by Chinese state media concerning Peng Shuai only raises my concerns as to her safety and whereabouts,"" Simon said in a written statement.
""I have a hard time believing that Peng Shuai actually wrote the email we received or believes what is being attributed to her.""
Beijing has yet to comment on Peng's initial allegation and discussion of the topic has been blocked on China's heavily censored internet. 
The statement comes as China prepares to host the Winter Olympics in Beijing in February amid calls from global rights groups and others for a boycott over its human rights record.
""My answer is very simple. This is not a foreign affairs matter, and I am not aware of the situation you mentioned,"" foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Thursday when asked about Peng's whereabouts and whether China is concerned her case would affect its image ahead of the Olympics.
The Chinese Tennis Association did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The email which CGTN attributes to Peng says: ""I'm not missing, nor am I unsafe. I've just been resting at home and everything is fine.""
Besides CGTN, the English-language arm of state broadcaster CCTV, no other Chinese media outlet as of Thursday morning in Asia had reported the letter. 
A representative for Peng did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Florida-based WTA and its men's counterpart, the London-based Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), previously called on China to investigate Peng's allegations.
Current and former players, from multi-major winners Naomi Osaka and Novak Djokovic to Billie Jean King, have expressed support and concern for Peng, with many top women's players taking to social media with the hashtag #WhereIsPengShuai.
""The WTA and the rest of the world need independent and verifiable proof that she is safe,"" Simon wrote. ""I have repeatedly tried to reach her via numerous forms of communications, to no avail.""
Peng, 35, was the first Chinese player to top the world rankings when she was doubles number one in 2014. She won doubles titles at Wimbledon in 2013 and the French Open in 2014.

Zhang, now 75, was a vice premier between 2013 and 2018 and served on the Politburo Standing Committee between 2012 and 2017.
""I hope @WTA continues to show what we stand for as players,"" Jessica Pegula, a top-20 American player, said on Twitter. ""We are extremely lucky to be able to do what we do but I hope more people, not just tennis players, shed some light on this deeply concerning situation.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States is considering a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Olympics, President Joe Biden confirmed on Thursday, a move that would be aimed at protesting China's human rights record, including what Washington says is genocide against minority Muslims.
""Something we're considering,"" Biden said when asked if a diplomatic boycott was under consideration as he sat down for a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
A diplomatic boycott would mean that U.S. officials would not attend the opening of the Beijing Winter Olympics in February.
A U.S. decision not to send diplomats would be a rebuke of Chinese President Xi Jinping just days after Xi and Biden worked to ease tensions in a virtual summit, their first extensive talks since Biden took office in January.
Activists and members of Congress from both parties have been pressing the Biden administration to diplomatically boycott the event given that the U.S. government accuses China of carrying out a genocide against Muslim ethnic groups in its western Xinjiang region, something that Beijing denies.
White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told a regular briefing on Thursday that U.S. consideration of a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics was driven by concerns about human rights practices in Xinjiang province.
""There are areas that we do have concerns: human rights abuses,"" Psaki told reporters. ""We have serious concerns.""
""Certainly there are a range of factors as we look at what our presence would be,"" she said, while declining to provide a timeline for a decision. 
""I want to leave the president the space to make decisions,"" she said. 
Sources with knowledge of the administration's thinking have told Reuters there was a growing consensus within the White House that it should keep U.S. officials away from the Games.
Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington was talking to countries around the world about ""how they're thinking about participation,"" but left a deadline for a decision unclear.
A bipartisan group of U.S. senators in October proposed an amendment to an annual defense policy bill that would prohibit the U.S. State Department from spending federal funds to ""support or facilitate"" the attendance of U.S. government employees at the Games.
Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has also called for a diplomatic boycott, saying global leaders who attend would lose their moral authority.
Some Republican lawmakers have been calling for a complete boycott of the Olympics.

Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas told a news conference on Thursday that a diplomatic boycott of what he called the ""genocide Olympics"" would be ""too little, too late"" and said no U.S. athletes, officials, or U.S. corporate sponsors should take part.
Nikki Haley, a Republican former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, also had called for a complete boycott, saying attending would send a message that America was willing to turn a blind eye to genocide.

ABBOTSFORD, British Columbia (Reuters) -Emergency crews were still trying to reach 18,000 people stranded on Thursday after floods and mudslides destroyed roads, houses and bridges in British Columbia in what could be the costliest natural disaster in Canadian history.
Receding floodwaters helped rescue efforts, but the downpour blocked off entire towns in the Pacific Coast province and cut access to the country's largest port in Vancouver, disrupting already strained global supply chains.
Premier John Horgan declared a state of emergency and said the death toll would rise from the one confirmed fatality. Police say four more people are missing.
Many of the affected towns are in mountainous areas to the east and northeast of Vancouver with limited access. 
Provincial Cabinet ministers told a briefing on Thursday that some major highways were slowly starting to reopen.
Some towns reported fuel shortages. Deputy Premier Mike Farnworth said the province was exploring whether to import fuel from the United States or neighboring Alberta.
In Ottawa, the federal minister for emergency preparedness, Bill Blair, said river flows were beginning to drop as the rain lightened.
""The situation remains critical, however, but there is in fact an improvement,"" he told reporters.
Ottawa has promised to send hundreds of air force personnel to British Columbia, the first of whom have already arrived. Thousands more are on standby.
Shoppers emptied grocery shelves https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/panicked-shoppers-clear-out-grocery-stores-flood-hit-british-columbia-2021-11-18, although the shortages were as much down to panic buying as disrupted supply chains. 
Provincial Agriculture Minister Lana Popham said the food supply was secure.
""We're just rejigging routes to get it to folks, but we're definitely not going to run out of food,"" she told the briefing.
The flooding also hit the U.S. state of Washington, as President Joe Biden noted before a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
""We've been good friends for a while. ... We're both keeping our minds close to the families affected by the storms, flooding in the British Columbia area and the Pacific Northwest,"" he said in the Oval Office.
WATER RECEDING
At one point, the city of Abbotsford, east of Vancouver, feared the waters would overwhelm the pumping station and force the evacuation of all 160,000 residents.
Mayor Henry Braun said there had been no change in the status of the station and water was receding ""at a pretty good clip"" in some parts.
""We continue to move toward the recovery phase of this emergency,"" he told reporters, noting more heavy rain was forecast for next week.
""We are not out of this by a long shot yet,"" he said, adding he had been promised help by Trudeau and provincial ministers.
""I take them all at their word. But I've also prepared them for one big bill,"" he said, estimating it would cost up to C$1 billion ($792 million) to repair local damage.
Asked how much the total repairs would cost, Farnworth, the deputy premier, said: ""It's going to be a lot. It's going to be an awful lot. ... But what I can also tell you is this - the province has the fiscal capacity to be able to rebuild.""
That indicates the final amount will far exceed the C$3.6 billion in insured losses https://www.reuters.com/article/canada-disasters/factbox-canadas-10-costliest-natural-disasters-by-insurance-claims-idUSL4N2S83G8 from wildfires that hit Alberta's oil-producing region of Fort McMurray in 2016.
""Easily the costliest natural disaster in Canadian history. Won't even be close,"" tweeted University of Calgary economics professor Blake Shaffer.

A massive wildfire https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/canadas-infernal-summer-puts-climate-change-forefront-election-2021-09-01 in British Columbia's interior during a heat wave this past summer may have left hills devoid of vegetation, contributing to the flooding and mudslides.

KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) -Jurors in the Wisconsin murder trial of Kyle Rittenhouse ended their third day of deliberations on Thursday without reaching a verdict, as the judge banned MSNBC from the courthouse after a freelancer for the network got close to a bus carrying the jury.
Rittenhouse, 18, is charged with killing Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and attempted homicide in the wounding of Gaige Grosskreutz, 28, during a chaotic night of protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Aug. 25, 2020.
There were no notes from the jury on Thursday to indicate the focus of their deliberations. On Wednesday the jury had asked to re-watch a series of videos of the shootings, including drone footage at the heart of a mistrial motion by the defense.
Michael F. Hart, a criminal defense lawyer in Milwaukee, said the lack of a note, which would normally be sent to the judge to relay a difficulty in coming to a consensus, suggests it is too early to conclude the jury is deadlocked.
""It could just be one or two holdouts,"" Hart said, cautioning against reading too much into the lack of a verdict after three days. ""It’s a guessing game and it's anyone’s guess.""
At the end of the day when Kenosha County Judge Bruce Schroeder asked the jurors if they had any questions, one asked if she could take home the 36 pages of jury instructions, which includes details on the different charges and requirements for finding guilt. Schroeder said that she could and told the jury of 7 women and 5 men to return on Friday at 9 a.m. Central Time (1500 GMT) for a fourth day of deliberations in the divisive trial.
Outside the courthouse pro-Rittenhouse protesters squared off with demonstrators calling for his conviction, leading to some intense shouting matches but no violence. Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth handed out coffee and cookies to the crowd to try and keep the protests peaceful.
Earlier on Thursday, Schroeder banned MSNBC from the courthouse after a freelancer for the media network was detained by police close to a bus carrying the jury. Police said they suspected he was trying to photograph the jurors.
Security of the jury has been a concern for authorities, and jurors have been ferried back and forth to the courthouse from an unidentified location in a bus with covered windows.
""I've instructed that no one from MSNBC News will be permitted in this building for the duration of this trial,"" Schroeder said in court. ""This is a very serious matter and I don’t know what the ultimate truth of it is."" 
NBC News said a freelancer for the network was cited for a traffic violation but did not try to make contact with jurors.
“While the traffic violation took place near the jury van, the freelancer never contacted or intended to contact the jurors during deliberations, and never photographed or intended to photograph them,"" a spokesperson said in a statement.
""We regret the incident and will fully cooperate with the authorities on any investigation.
While media organizations often seek post-verdict interviews with jurors, judges instruct jurors to avoid contact with anyone about the case during the trial.
Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time of the shootings, has pleaded not guilty and testified last week that he fired his weapon in self defense. If convicted on the most serious of three homicide charges, Rittenhouse could be sentenced to life in prison.

The shootings took place in Kenosha during protests - marred by arson, rioting and looting - that followed the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, who was left paralyzed from the waist down.
Views on the trial have largely split along ideological lines, with Rittenhouse considered a hero by some conservatives who favor expansive gun rights and as a symbol of an out-of-control American gun culture by many on the left.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A bipartisan coalition of U.S. state attorneys general said on Thursday it has opened a probe into Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), now known as Meta Platforms, for promoting its subsidiary Instagram to children despite potential harms.
The investigation, involving at least nine states, comes at a time when Facebook is under scrutiny over its approach to children and young adults.
The attorneys general are investigating whether the company violated consumer protection laws and put young people at risk, they said in emailed statements.
""Facebook, now Meta, has failed to protect young people on its platforms and instead chose to ignore or, in some cases, double down on known manipulations that pose a real threat to physical and mental health – exploiting children in the interest of profit,"" said Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey in a news release.
A Meta spokesperson responded in a statement that ""these accusations are false and demonstrate a deep misunderstanding of the facts.""
""While challenges in protecting young people online impact the entire industry, we've led the industry in combating bullying and supporting people struggling with suicidal thoughts, self-injury, and eating disorders,"" the spokesperson said.
The company is continuing to develop parental supervision controls and exploring ways to provide age-appropriate experiences for teens by default, they added. 
Instagram, like other social media sites, has rules against children under 13 joining the platform but has said it knows it has users this age.
In September, the company said it was pausing its plans for a version of Instagram for kids, amid growing opposition to the project.
The move followed a Wall Street Journal report that said internal documents, leaked by former Facebook employee Frances Haugen, showed the company knew Instagram could have harmful mental health effects on teenage girls. Facebook has said the leaked documents have been used to paint a false picture of the company's work.

In previous months, a group of more than 40 state attorneys had written to the company asking it to abandon plans for the kids-focused app and lawmakers had raised concerns.
States involved in the investigation include Nebraska, Massachusetts, California, Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee and Vermont, New York and New Jersey.

WASHINGTON/PARIS (Reuters) - The stated U.S. aim when indirect U.S.-Iranian talks resume this month is to see if the two can revive a 2015 nuclear deal, but Washington's unspoken goal may be to win support from China and Russia to pressure Iran if the talks fail, diplomats said.
Western diplomats have said time is running low to resurrect the pact, which then-U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018, earning Iran's fury and the dismay of the remaining major powers in the pact - Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia.
Under the agreement, Iran limited its nuclear program in exchange for relief from U.S., EU and U.N. economic sanctions. Trump's 2018 decision to reimpose harsh U.S. sanctions prompted Tehran to begin breaching the deal's nuclear restrictions.
The three European nations have worked hand in glove with the United States to try to restore the deal and Russia has been supportive, notably at the Vienna-based U.N. nuclear watchdog that monitors Iran's eroding compliance.
China, however, has undercut U.S. leverage by buying Iranian oil, throwing Tehran an economic lifeline in violation of U.S. sanctions. 
One way to pressure Iran to rejoin the original pact or, if that is not possible, to accept another arrangement would be to persuade Beijing and Moscow that Tehran, not Washington, is the obstacle, diplomats said.
""They need China and Russia,"" said a Western diplomat on condition of anonymity.
SHIFTING THE ONUS 
While Washington initially got blamed for Trump's withdrawal and reimposition of sanctions on Iran, the onus may gradually be shifting to Tehran as U.S. President Joe Biden seeks to restore the pact.
U.S. and Iranian officials held six rounds of indirect talks in Vienna between April and June. A new round begins on Nov. 29 after a five-month hiatus triggered by the election of a new Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, a hardline cleric who said this month that Iran would not back down https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-raisi-vows-no-retreat-nuclear-talks-with-major-powers-2021-11-04 in nuclear talks.
U.S. and European diplomats are frustrated by what they view as Iran's unrealistic demands, including what one described as a recent insistence that all U.S. and EU sanctions imposed since 2017 be dropped, and their expectations for the talks are low.
This month's talks will be a chance to gauge whether Iranwants to revive the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and, if not, for Washington to try to garner greater support from China and, to a lesser degree, Russia to put pressure on Tehran.
""(The) Russians are a more helpful partner than China,"" said a second Western diplomat on condition of anonymity. The best way to get China's support was via diplomacy rather sanctioning Chinese companies that buy Iran's oil, the envoy added.
""We have to talk to China and get them on side,"" this diplomat said.
Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed how to ""align"" their positions before the Vienna talks during their virtual summit this week.
'GOOD OLD COLLEGE TRY'
The major powers believe the greater their cohesion, the better the chances of bringing Iran back into the deal, said a third Western diplomat.
""It becomes more important when we come to a crucial point in the discussions,"" the diplomat added, referring to the next round and Western hopes that China might eventually trim its oil purchases.
Brookings Institution analyst Robert Einhorn suggested Washington may wish to show it had gone the extra mile to revive the agreement.
""(The idea is to) make a good old college try ... but if that doesn't work, make sure that the world sees Iran as the reason for failure,"" Einhorn said.
Shifting the onus to Tehran could prove helpful even if Washington concludes the original deal is dead but tries to fashion another agreement.
The State Department has said it will pursue diplomacy even if the JCPOA cannot be saved.
""We want to present Iran with a clear choice about the path forward. That's our focus, not thinking of who to blame,"" said a U.S. official on condition of anonymity.

""We are not naive about what Iran is trying to do by building its nuclear program while talks proceed at snail's pace. We are adapting our posture to Iran's actions even as we seek - in good faith - to try to revive the JCPOA,"" he said.
""At some point we may conclude with our partners that it no longer is worth saving the JCPOA. We are not there yet. But ... it would be wrong to assume our policy is static.""

BRUZGI, Belarus (Reuters) -Belarus authorities on Thursday cleared the main camps where migrants had huddled at the border with Poland, in a change of tack that could help calm a crisis that has spiralled in recent weeks into a major East-West confrontation.
In another potential sign of the crisis easing, hundreds of Iraqis checked in at a Minsk airport to fly back to Iraq, the first repatriation flight since August.
However, the European Commission and Germany rejected a Belarus proposal that EU countries take in 2,000 of the migrants currently on its territory, and the United States accused Minsk of making migrants ""pawns in its efforts to be disruptive"", signalling tensions with the West were far from over.
In any case, Belarus' step to move the migrants to a giant warehouse where hundreds, including young children, could be seen resting on mattresses, meant they were no longer outdoors in freezing temperatures.
One Iraqi, Zain Shad, said they were being moved further, to another holding centre.
""We are moving to there because the weather's pretty damn cold. The people are all sick because of the rain yesterday and they are all freezing, and we're now moving on to the camps,"" he said.
European countries have for months accused Belarus of engineering the crisis by flying in migrants from the Middle East and pushing them to attempt to illegally cross its borders into Poland and Lithuania.
Minsk, backed by Moscow, rejects those accusations, but Lithuania's President Gitanas Nauseda said the tough stance taken by the EU was paying off.
""We are seeing the first results - the flights organised by the regime from the Middle East are being stopped, and migrants in Belarus are returning home,"" he said after speaking with his Polish counterpart.
'UNCONSCIONABLE'
A spokesperson for the Polish border guard said the camps on the frontier in western Belarus were completely empty on Thursday, which a Belarusian press officer confirmed.
The Polish spokesperson added a word of caution, saying ""there were groups appearing in other places trying to cross the border. We'll see what happens in the next hours."" 
In recent weeks, migrants have tried, mostly at night, to cross the frontier, sometimes clashing with Polish troops. 
In a cruel illustration of the harsh conditions for those camped out, a couple, both injured, told the Polish Centre for International Aid, an NGO, on Thursday morning that their one-year-old child had died in the forest. At least eight more people are believed to have died at the border in recent months.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States had the authority to add to sanctions, telling reporters during a visit to Nigeria: ""It is profoundly unconscionable that Lukashenko and Belarus have sought to weaponize migration.""
The camp clearances came during a week of intensified diplomacy. Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke by telephone twice to Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, normally shunned by European leaders.
Belarus said Lukashenko had proposed a plan to Merkel to resolve the crisis, under which the EU would take in 2,000 people while Minsk would send home another 5,000.
But German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer rejected the proposal and talked of misinformation.
""If we took in refugees, if we bowed to the pressure and said 'we are taking refugees into European countries', then this would mean implementing the very basis of this perfidious strategy,"" Seehofer said in Warsaw.
A government source added that Germany had not agreed to any deal, stressing that this was a European problem.
'DANGER'
Shortly before the plan was announced, the European Commission had said there could be no negotiation with Belarus over the plight of the migrants.
It declined to comment on the proposal, with a spokesperson saying: ""This is an artificially created, state-orchestrated crisis and it is a responsibility of Lukashenko's regime to stop it and to solve it.""
French President Emmanuel Macron said Europe must keep up the pressure on Lukashenko, but also ensure that those who were not eligible to asylum were flown back home.
Around 430 would-be migrants, mostly Iraqi Kurds, touched down in Erbil in Iraq's autonomous northern Kurdistan region on Thursday on the first such flight since the summer.
""I would have stayed till death, but my family were in danger,"" said Mohsen Addi, a Yazidi from Sinjar in northwestern Iraq, who spent one month in the cold in Belarus. 

Belarusian state airline Belavia has meanwhile stoppedallowing citizens from Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Syriaand Yemen to board flights from Uzbekistan's capital Tashkent toMinsk, Belta reported.
The EU has put diplomatic pressure on regional countries not to allow migrants to board flights for Belarus.

(Reuters) -  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) said on Thursday the U.S. government would pay $5.29 billion for 10 million courses of its experimental COVID-19 antiviral drug, as the country rushes to secure promising oral treatments for the disease. 
The deal is for around twice as many treatment courses as Merck & Co Inc has agreed to supply the United States under its contract. The price for the Pfizer pill is nearly 25%lower at roughly $530 per course, compared with about $700 for Merck's. 
Pfizer applied for emergency authorization of the drug, branded as Paxlovid, this week after reporting data showing that it was 89% effective at preventing hospitalization or death in at-risk people. The trial's results suggest that Paxlovid surpasses Merck's molnupiravir which was shown last month to halve the risk of dying or being hospitalized for COVID-19 patients at high risk of serious illness. 
""While this pill still requires a full review by the Food and Drug Administration, I have taken immediate steps to secure enough supply for the American people,"" President Joe Biden said in a statement. He added that his administration was making preparations to ensure the treatment is easily accessible and free. 
Pfizer said it would begin deliveries of the treatment as soon as this year if it is authorized by the U.S. FDA.
Shares of Pfizer were up 0.65% at $51.20 on Thursday afternoon, while shares of Merck were nearly flat at $82.63.
Getting vaccinated should still be the priority for Americans but having pills that can keep people out of the hospital ""could be a lifesaver,"" said U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra. 
Pfizer has said it expects to manufacture 180,000 treatment courses by the end of next month and at least 50 million courses by the end of 2022. 
Countries have scrambled to secure doses of the Pfizer and Merck oral drugs, based on promising data reported by both companies.

The U.S. government has so far secured 3.1 million courses of Merck's COVID-19 pill for $2.2 billion, with the right to buy 2 million more courses in the future. 
Drugs in the same class as Merck's pill have been linked to birth defects in animal studies. Merck has said similar studies of its drug - for longer and at higher doses than used in humans - show that it does not cause birth defects or cancer.

SYDNEY/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -A Chinese professor at the University of Copenhagen conducted genetic research with the Chinese military without disclosing the connection, the university told Reuters, in the latest example of how China's pursuit of military-civilian technology is tapping into Western academia in the strategically sensitive area of biotechnology.
The professor, Guojie Zhang, is also employed by Shenzhen-based genomics giant BGI Group, which funds dozens of researchers at the university and has its European headquarters on the university's campus.
Zhang and a student he was supervising worked with a People's Liberation Army (PLA) laboratory on research exposing monkeys to extreme altitude to study their brains and develop new drugs to prevent brain damage – a priority the PLA has identified for Chinese troops operating on high plateau http://eng.mod.gov.cn/news/2021-02/09/content_4878887.htm borders.
Zhang co-published that paper https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6956719 with a PLA major general in January 2020. At the time the study was published, the university was ""not familiar with the fact that the paper also included authors from Chinese military research institutions,"" Niels Kroer, head of its biology department, told Reuters in an email.
Zhang confirmed that he did not inform the university of the link because the university didn't require researchers to report co-authors on scientific papers to it, which the university confirmed. BGI said the study with the PLA lab ""was not carried out for military purposes"" and brain research is a critical area for understanding human diseases. China's government science academy said http://www.kiz.ac.cn/gre/gre7/gre73/201912/t20191223_5467586.html the study had national defence and civilian benefits on the Tibetan plateau.
Concerns about China's fusion of military and civilian technology, and about universities transferring sensitive technology to China that could help its military, have grown in the United States in recent years. Washington agreed https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/29/u-s-eu-trade-and-technology-council-inaugural-joint-statement last month to work with the European Union on the issue under a new joint technology and trade council. A U.S. Department of Defense report on China's military power this month flagged concern over Beijing using biotechnology to enhance its soldiers' performance. 
The Danish incident, reported here for the first time, shows how China's pursuit of biotechnology with a military use has also become an issue for universities in Europe.
The European Commission says it is developing guidelines on ""tackling foreign interference"" at higher education institutions; a 2020 report https://leidenasiacentre.nl/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Towards-Sustainable-Europe-China-Collaboration-in-Higher-Education-and-Research.pdf from the Leiden Asia Centre, an independent group affiliated with Leiden University in the Netherlands, found at least five countries in Europe had concerns about the risks of research collaboration with China. Some universities, including Copenhagen, have long had close science ties to China.
Copenhagen university and two large Danish foundations who funded some of Zhang's work said they discovered China's military was involved only after one of the foundations saw it had been credited, incorrectly, with financing the monkey study. The work was funded by the Chinese government and military, the paper said. 
The discovery came as Denmark's intelligence agency, PET, warned https://ufm.dk/en/publications/2021/files/er-din-forskning-i-fare-en.pdf Danish universities in May of the national security risks of being unwittingly involved in foreign military research, citing ""a number of espionage activities and other foreign interference,"" and a student who co-authored research into 5G technology with an engineer from a Chinese military university. It declined to comment on specific cases.
The Chinese Academy of Science, where Zhang also has a genetics lab, said http://www.kiz.ac.cn/gre/gre7/gre73/201912/t20191223_5467586.html of the study at the time that brain damage and death caused by high altitude on the Tibetan plateau had severely hindered ""national defence construction.""
Denmark's Ministry of Higher Education and Science declined to comment on the altitude study, but said export control rules apply to some technology that can be used for both civilian and military purposes. The Danish Business Authority said most types of gene technology are not on its export control list.
The ministry said it had launched a broad review of the risks of international research cooperation, led by top university heads, to conclude at the start of next year.
The University of Copenhagen expects the review of ""ethical and security policy limits"" for collaboration will result in new rules for universities - and greater focus on the risks, its deputy director for research and innovation Kim Brinckmann told Reuters in an email.
""We are very proud to have Prof. Zhang ... as one of our very highly performing researchers,"" he said. The university did not respond to a question about how much funding BGI provides it.
China's foreign ministry said it urged Danish institutions to ""abandon ideological prejudice and end groundless accusations and smears,"" and treat their research cooperation rationally ""to accrue positive energy in the development of bilateral relations and practical cooperation.""
ALTITUDE
Zhang and the head of the PLA laboratory for high-altitude research, Major General Yuqi Gao, designed the study, which also lists BGI founders Wang Jian and Yang Huanming as co-authors. BGI's other joint research with Gao has involved soldiers in Tibet and Xinjiang, Reuters reported in January.
That report was cited by two U.S. senators who called in September for BGI to be sanctioned by the United States as a military-linked company. Gao's research has directly improved the ability of China's rapid-advance plateau troops to carry out training and combat missions, according to the Chinese military's official news service http://www.81.cn/zghjy/2015-12/11/content_6811003.htm.
China's Academy of Military Medical Sciences launched a four-year plan in 2012 for troops to acclimatise and adapt to the low-oxygen Tibetan plateau. That plan said BGI was working with Gao's lab to test soldiers arriving in Tibet and identify genes linked to altitude sickness, which does not affect Tibetans. It said preventing altitude sickness helped to ""manage border areas where ethnic minorities gather,"" and had far-reaching economic and political significance.
BGI told Reuters the research with the military university aimed to understand the health risk for all people travelling to and working at high altitude.
""The project using BGI's technology studied the changes of the pathophysiology and genomics of the human body at very high altitudes,"" a BGI spokesman said. ""In China, many military institutions ... carry out both civilian and military research,"" he added.
Gao wrote https://mmrjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40779-018-0150-0#author-information in 2018 that high altitude disease ""is the main reason for reduced combat effectiveness and health damage of soldiers at high altitudes and influences the results of war on the highland plateau,"" and noted that drugs could be used in an emergency for the rapid deployment of soldiers.
China's military has recently increased http://www.mod.gov.cn/v/2021-11/01/content_4898183.htm live fire drills in Tibet after border clashes with India.
DEEP TIES
The University of Copenhagen has one of Europe's oldest genetics institutes, and it is BGI's biggest international research partner by count of science papers.
The ties run deep. Two former BGI chief executives, BGI's chairman, and the founder of its animal cloning programme previously studied or worked at Copenhagen. The university hosts more than two dozen BGI-funded researchers undertaking science and health doctorates.
Biology head Kroer told Reuters the university had been unaware of ""claims that BGI has connections with the PLA."" The university said that other than Zhang's salary as a professor, no Danish money was spent on the study, which animal rights activists have argued https://actionforprimates.org/public/afp_take_action_2020.php subjected the animals to suffering and distress.
The student Zhang worked with was in China and employed by BGI, the university said. Zhang's research team was not involved in the animal experiments performed in China, but did analyse the genomic data generated from the experiments, it added.
The Lundbeck Foundation, which primarily funds brain research and was incorrectly listed as a funder of the monkey brain study, ""has not supported this area of his research, nor do we have any knowledge about it,"" a spokesman said of the monkey brain project. Lundbeck said Zhang had told them he was studying ants and genetics https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2P3WGVZgJs and how this could explain brain processes in humans.
The foundation said it asked Zhang this year to remove its name from the study. The Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY) Foundation, which controls the world's third-largest brewer and said it gave Zhang a DKK 4 million ($623,000) fellowship in 2016, also told Reuters it had been incorrectly listed as funding the project.
The paper was published in a Chinese journal, Zoological Research, which declined to comment.
Zhang is on the journal's editorial board. He told Reuters the two Danish foundations were mentioned in the paper by mistake. ""We did not spend any funding from the grants I received from these two foundations on this project,"" he added in an email. The journal published a correction removing the foundations' names in March 2021.
Lundbeck declined to comment on what impact the discovery might have; Carlsberg has said animal experiments conducted overseas must comply with Danish regulations, but did not comment on the military involvement.
INTERNAL DEBATE
In June 2020, the University of Copenhagen decided to close a think tank it had run with Shanghai's Fudan University since 2013, saying it had adjusted its overall cooperation strategy.
The decision prompted a debate about China inside the university, documents obtained by Reuters under freedom of information rules show. The university held a meeting in August 2020 to discuss the closure of Fudan and review its collaboration with China.
""China has engaged in a strategic civil-military fusion of research that often blurs the lines to the outsider,"" China Studies professor Jorgen Delman said in a note to the university's head afterwards, recommending better screening of Chinese researchers and consultations with Danish military intelligence to advise on ""risks and no-go areas."" He declined to comment further. 
Genetic cloning technology was transferred to BGI after a researcher, Yutao Du, received her doctorate in 2007 with a team from Danish universities that created the world's first pigs using a technique called handmade cloning. She was praised by the Chinese government for bringing the technology to China, which went on to clone genetically modified pigs for the study of human neurological illnesses. 

China's national science programme said cloned pigs were a stepping stone to chimeras, a controversial area where China wanted to lead the world. Chimeras are organisms composed of cells from two or more species that may be capable of growing organs for human transplantation.
Du is now vice president at BGI Genomics Ltd, and won promotion within the Chinese Communist Party, becoming a delegate to its national congress in 2017. She did not respond to a request for comment.

The event, which passed off peacefully, was organised by far-right politician Florian Philippot, who has been at the forefront of protests in France against the COVID-19 health pass and vaccination certificate required for many daily activities.
Europe has again become the epicentre of the pandemic, prompting some countries to reimpose restrictions in the run-up to Christmas, and stirring debate over whether vaccines alone are enough to tame COVID-19.
Earlier this week, Austria imposed a lockdown on people unvaccinated against COVID-19.
However, pressure on Austria's government to impose a full COVID-19 lockdown grew on Thursday as its worst-hit provinces said they would adopt the measure for themselves since infections are still rising despite the current lockdown for the unvaccinated.
An Elabe opinion poll published in French media on Thursday said around 60 percent of those surveyed backed a new COVID lockdown in France for those not fully vaccinated against the virus.
Yet those protesting outside the Austrian Embassy in Paris said such measures would be discriminatory, and they feared President Emmanuel Macron's government could take similar steps.
""What is happening in Austria is very, very concerning,"" said Martine Cirasa, a 43-year old languages teacher.
""First up, we need to support the Austrian people. I think, we are plumbing the very depths of horror, in terms of what is being proposed, plumbing the very depths of discrimination, and obviously we are afraid that this will happen in France,"" she added.
Her views were echoed by 64-year old former soldier Pierre-Louis, who was also at the demonstration.
Earlier this week, Belgium tightened its coronavirus restrictions, mandating wider use of masks and enforcing working from home. 
Germany's chancellor-in-waiting Olaf Scholz on Thursday also warned the country must prepare for tough measures in coming months to tackle a new wave of COVID infections.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Ghislaine Maxwell leaves Manhattan federal court at the end of each day of her upcoming sex abuse trial, the British socialite will return to a Brooklyn jail cell that she says is plagued by vermin and the scent of raw sewage.
Since her July 2020 arrest on charges of grooming underage girls for now-deceased financier Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse, Maxwell has been held in isolation at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC), a jail where, according to several defense attorneys, conditions are substandard. 
Maxwell has said raw sewage seeped into her cell, that she was given moldy food and deprived of water, and that guards shine flashlights at her at night, court filings show. Her attorney Bobbi Sternheim compared her cell to Hannibal Lecter's, a far cry from Maxwell's pre-arrest life of luxury.
Maxwell cited the jail's conditions in three of her four bail requests, all of which were denied by U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan, who called Maxwell a flight risk. Those denials were twice upheld on appeal. 
Maxwell has pleaded not guilty to six counts of sex trafficking and other crimes. Jury selection is underway, with opening statements scheduled for Nov. 29. 
The close watch guards keep on Maxwell comes after Epstein died by suicide at age 66 in 2019 in his cell at Manhattan's Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC).
Prosecutors accused two guards responsible for monitoring Epstein of surfing the web, taking naps and manipulating documents to make it seem they were watching him. In May, the guards admitted to falsifying records but avoided jail time.
Prosecutors have said surveillance of Maxwell is appropriate due to security concerns, that she is ""physically healthy,"" and that she gets more time than other inmates to review evidence.
Still, Sternheim called Maxwell's detention ""overly-restrictive."" 
""Her conditions of confinement significantly impede her ability to prepare for trial, negatively impact her health, and compromise her stamina to endure the rigors of trial,"" Sternheim wrote in a Nov. 9 filing.
A U.S. Bureau of Prisons spokesperson declined to comment on Maxwell's conditions, but said it was committed to inmates' safety and takes staff misconduct allegations seriously. 
The U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York declined to comment. 
TROUBLED HISTORY
Maxwell's concerns are a part of a long history of complaints about conditions at MDC, which opened in 1994 and holds 1,676 inmates. 
Joshua Schulte, a former CIA employee detained at MDC on charges of leaking classified information, said in a court filing last week that he would begin a hunger strike to call attention to ""torturous conditions"" at the jail, including sleep deprivation and exposure to extreme cold. Schulte has pleaded not guilty.
Several defense lawyers told Reuters that MDC's medical care, utilities, and recreational and educational programming are deficient. 
""It's a miserable place to do time,"" said David Patton, executive director and attorney-in-chief at Federal Defenders of New York. 
In early 2019, an electrical fire at MDC led to a weeklong power outage that prompted the suspension of legal visits. Many inmates were without heat during that cold winter week. Power outages remain frequent, said Katie Rosenfeld, a partner at ECBAWM LLP. 
""They can't even keep basic utilities running,"" Rosenfeld said. 

Six weeks after Maxwell reported the sewage seepage this summer, an MDC inmate charged with robbing a bank said the toilet in his cell had been broken for three days.
""I do not care if the defendant is Jack the Ripper, we treat people under our care with respect and decency,"" U.S. District Judge William Kuntz said in a July 27 hearing about the toilet, which a prosecutor said was fixed ahead of the hearing. ""This is an ongoing disgrace.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A British man pleaded guilty on Thursday to involvement in an alleged global piracy ring that distributed unreleased movies and television shows online, causing major losses for production studios.
George Bridi, 52, entered his plea to a copyright infringement conspiracy charge in a telephone hearing before U.S. District Judge Richard Berman in Manhattan.
He admitted to being ""a bit nervous,"" but when asked by the judge whether he was pleading guilty because he was guilty answered clearly, ""Yes, your honor.""
The case arose from Bridi's work for the Sparks Group, which, according to prosecutors, cost studios tens of millions of dollars over nearly a decade by leaking movies and TV shows before their scheduled release dates.
Prosecutors said Sparks obtained advance copies of copyrighted DVDs and Blu-Ray discs from wholesale distributors after concocting reasons to obtain them.
Sparks then used computers to override the discs' copyright protections, known as ""cracking"" or ""ripping,"" and recoded the discs so they could be shared easily online, prosecutors said.
The indictment said the reproduced content was tagged with such names as ""Drones,"" ""Rovers,"" ""Geckos"" and ""Sprinter.""
Bridi, who has lived on the Isle of Wight in England, was arrested in Cyprus in August 2020 and extradited one year later.
He could face 2-1/4 to 2-3/4 years in prison under recommended federal guidelines at his Jan. 20, 2022, sentencing.

U.S. prosecutors have also charged two other defendants over the scheme.
One defendant, Jonatan Correa, pleaded guilty to a copyright infringement conspiracy charge and was sentenced in May to 2-1/4 years of supervised release. The other defendant, Umar Ahmad of Norway, has been at large.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An American who had been blocked for years from leaving China has returned to the United States, the U.S. government told Reuters, his release coming just hours before the two countries' leaders met this week. 
Daniel Hsu's return also coincided with the United States' deportation of seven Chinese nationals convicted of crimes, including at least one who was sought by Beijing to face fraud charges. A U.S. government official denied the individuals were part of an exchange. 
The U.S. official, authorized to speak to Reuters on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that Hsu - who had never been convicted of a crime in China and had been under an exit ban for more than four years - had been allowed by Chinese authorities to leave the country last weekend.
He arrived home on Monday evening, just as President Joe Biden held a 3 and 1/2 hour video conference with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. 
Hsu, a Chinese American, was one of an undisclosed number of U.S. citizens the United States says China is holding unlawfully under ""coercive exit bans."" 
The exit bans are one of many disputes that have sent U.S.-Sino relations to their lowest point in years. The U.S. government warned citizens this year to reconsider travel to China due to the exit bans, which it said China can use to ""gain bargaining leverage over foreign governments."" 
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) said separately that it had flown back to China the Chinese nationals, including individuals convicted of fraud and photographing a defense installation, as well as two women who had tried to gain access to former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.
Their return marked what U.S. officials said were ""initial steps"" to resolve a long running feud between Beijing and Washington over China's refusal to accept the repatriation of tens of thousands of Chinese nationals subject to removal orders.
""We welcome Daniel Hsu's return to the United States,"" the official said, denying that the seven individuals were part of an exchange linked to the leaders' meeting. 
""That's not how we see them. These actions are the PRC reversing things that never should have happened in the first place,"" the official said, using the acronym for the People's Republic of China. 
""There are additional Americans subject to exit bans and arbitrary detentions in the PRC, and we will continue to work to secure their release. And we will continue to press the PRC to accept additional repatriation flights,"" the official said. 
Reuters could not reach Hsu for comment. 
Hsu told the Associated Press last year that he had effectively been held hostage by Chinese authorities since 2017 in an attempt to lure his father back to China to face decades-old embezzlement charges. 
Chinese authorities have been silent over Hsu's case.
China's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his release or the deportations. 
'ESCALATED CONSEQUENCES' 
ICE told Reuters in a statement that Xu Guojun, a former president of a Bank of China branch who fled to the United States in 2001 and had been wanted in China on suspicion of embezzlement, was among the Chinese nationals deported. China confirmed his return on Sunday..
Others sent back to China included Zhang Yujing and Lu Jing, who both tried to enter Mar-a-Lago in 2019; Wang Yuhao and Zhang Jielun, who had been sentenced to 10 months and 12 months respectively for photographing a U.S. defense installation in Florida; and Sun Yong and Tang Junliang, convicted of financial crimes. 
One source with knowledge of the deportation operation, who was not authorized to speak to Reuters, said there was broad approval within the U.S. government for what was seen as an effort to show goodwill ahead of the virtual summit. 
But the source added some officials were concerned about the optics of an apparent exchange linked to the meeting, worried it would encourage Beijing to use more exit bans.
Two American siblings facing exit bans from China since 2018 were released by Beijing in September just days after an agreement that allowed Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou to return to China from Canada.
At the time, the White House said her return to China and the near-simultaneous release of two Canadians detained shortly after her arrest was not a prisoner swap.
China's Foreign Ministry hailed the return of Xu, the former bank branch president, as a ""major achievement"" in its fugitive hunt.
But some of the others had been among the more than 40,000 Chinese nationals subject to final removal orders from the United States on which the Department of Homeland Security says China refuses to cooperate. 
A DHS spokesperson said the department hoped to work with China on the removals, but noted that it imposed visa sanctions on Chinese officials last year for refusal to facilitate the repatriations. 
""As the PRC government continues to flout its international obligations and disrespect U.S. law, DHS will continue to seek escalated consequences when necessary,"" the DHS spokesperson said.

The couple's release spurred the first conversation between the countries' leaders in years. 
Mordi and Natali Oknin were detained on Nov 9. A Turk was also arrested on espionage charges, state-run news agency Anadolu said.
Their family said the pair, drivers for Israel's biggest bus company, had been on vacation.
The Oknins' case became a cause celebre in Israel, whose relations with Turkey have been strained as Erdogan has championed the Palestinian cause.
""Thank you to the entire nation of Israel. Thank you to everyone who helped and supported and got us freed,"" Natali Oknin told reporters after she and Mordi landed in Tel Aviv aboard a chartered private plane. 
Turkish officials did not immediately comment.
Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett later spoke with Erdogan - the first conversation between Turkish and Israeli leaders since 2013, according to Bennett's office - and thanked Erdogan for helping to resolve the affair.
""The prime minister said this is a solution to a humanitarian issue and noted favourably the communication between the countries, which functioned efficiently and discreetly in a time of crisis,"" Bennett's office said.
Israel sent a senior envoy to Turkey to seek the couple's release.

Matan Kahana, an Israeli cabinet minister, said Turkish authorities had realised that the Oknins were innocent civilians. Israel gave Ankara nothing in return for the couple's release, he added. 
""Let's hope that ties with Turkey will warm. I'm confident that, after days of such intensive contacts, connections were created that will naturally be of service to us in the future,"" Kahana told Israel's Army Radio.

(Reuters) - A Chinese envoy has lobbied Southeast Asian nations to let Myanmar's military ruler attend a regional summit being hosted by China's president next week but has met stiff opposition, diplomatic sources said on Thursday.
Myanmar's standing as a member of the 10-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has been thrown into the spotlight by a Feb. 1 coup, when its military ousted the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking bloody turmoil.
Several ASEAN members, dismayed by the return of crisis and the suppression of democracy in Myanmar, have sought to press its generals by excluding them from ASEAN meetings.
In an unprecedented decision last month, ASEAN leaders blocked Myanmar's military chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, from an ASEAN summit after he failed to honour pledges to allow an ASEAN envoy to meet lawmakers overthrown in the coup.
Instead, ASEAN leaders said a non-political figure from Myanmar should be asked to attend. In the end, Myanmar was not represented.
Four diplomatic and political sources in the region said Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia and Singapore wanted Min Aung Hlaing to be banned from a Nov. 22 China-ASEAN meeting being hosted by Chinese President Xi Jinping.
""Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Brunei have agreed to maintain the same position as the ASEAN summit,"" said a government source in an ASEAN country who declined to be identified, referring to the demand that Myanmar be represented by a non-political figure.
Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman Teuku Faizasyah, confirmed its unwavering stand on the non-political figure, referring to the ""wisdom"" shown by leaders before the October summit.
""Indonesia is consistent in its position on who should represent Myanmar in the forthcoming leader's summit,"" Faizasyah said.
Indonesia has been among the most outspoken of the ASEAN critics with its foreign minister, Retno Marsudi, stating that Myanmar should not be represented at the political level until it restores democracy.
Malaysia's foreign ministry declined to comment. The foreign ministries of Singapore, Brunei and Vietnam did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment but on Tuesday, its spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said China supported all parties in Myanmar in seeking political settlement through dialogue and would work with the international community on efforts to restore stability and resume democratic transformation.
Myanmar's military government did not respond to a request for comment.
'MAINTAIN THE PRINCIPLE'
A regional diplomat briefed on China's lobbying effort said its Special Envoy of Asian Affairs Sun Guoxiang visited Singapore and Brunei last week but was told that Ming Aung Hlaing could not participate in the virtual summit.
Sun, faced with the ASEAN opposition, then told Min Aung Hlaing at a meeting in Myanmar's capital of Naypyidaw on the weekend that China had to accept the ASEAN stand.
China ""would maintain the non-political representative principle applied by ASEAN"", the regional diplomat said, citing Sun.
ASEAN has for decades been known for its policy of engagement and non-interference but Myanmar's coup has changed that.
In April, ASEAN brokered a five-point plan at a special leaders' summit, which Min Aung Hlaing attended, that included pledges to end violence and allow an ASEAN envoy to start dialogue with ""all parties"", including ousted lawmakers.
Myanmar has not followed through, saying it has its own ""road map"" to new elections.
Myanmar's junta chief could still make an appearance at the summit.

Myanmar is China's co-ordinating country for ASEAN this year, meaning it helps facilitate its interactions with the bloc. 
""Typically, the coordinating member will set up everything, such as the virtual links and so on,"" said one source. Myanmar, the source added, may use this role to ""slot in"" Min Aung Hlaing, even if other ASEAN countries objected.

CHIAYI, Taiwan (Reuters) - Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen lauded military cooperation with Washington on Thursday as she commissioned the first combat wing of F-16 fighters upgraded with U.S. help to bolster the island's defences during rising tensions between Taipei and Beijing.
Frequent Chinese and U.S. military exercises in the region have raised fears of conflict touched off by a crisis over democratically-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own territory.
Tsai told a ceremony at an air base in the southern Taiwanese city of Chiayi to unveil the first squadron of its most advanced F-16s, the F-16V, that the project showed the firm commitment of the Taiwan-U.S. partnership.
""I believe that as long as we adhere to the values of democracy and freedom, there will be more like-minded countries standing on the same front with us,"" she said, speaking on the same stage as the top U.S. diplomat in Taiwan, Sandra Oudkirk.
The United States has no official diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is the island's main international backer and arms supplier, to Beijing's fury.
The T$110 billion ($3.96 billion) F-16 upgrade is led by manufacturer  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and Taiwan's Aerospace Industrial Development Corp (AIDC), and is the latest example of military cooperation between Washington and Taipei.
Taiwan has been converting 141 F-16A/B jets into the F-16V type, 64 of which have already been upgraded, and has additionally ordered 66 new F-16Vs, which have new avionics, weapons and radar systems to better face down the Chinese air force, including its J-20 stealth fighter. 
The F-16Vs can carry Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp's advanced AIM-9X Sidewinder air-to-air missiles.
To a backdrop of dance music broadcast over the air base, the F-16s showed off their mettle with combat take offs and landings, and flying low in formation above the runway. 
Tsai said that as more F-16Vs entered service, Taiwan's defences would be ""even stronger"".
Taiwan's air force is well trained but dwarfed by China's.
The United States in 2019 approved an $8 billion sale of F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan, a deal that would take the island's F-16 fleet to more than 200 jets, the largest in Asia.
China has announced sanctions on Lockheed Martin for selling arms to Taiwan.

Originally a children's clothes chain, Chickeeduck became known for selling protest-themed items, including shirts that made humorous puns of pro-democracy slogans.
It gained popularity among democracy activists last year when owner Herbert Chow refused a request from his landlord to remove a statue of a protester in helmet, gas mask and goggles. The shop moved to a new location where the statue is still up.
In early May, national security police cordoned off the area of a Chickeeduck shop and searched its premises with a warrant, with police saying they responded to complains from the public. This month, authorities ordered one of the shops to remove a bronze statue of Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo outside the entrance, saying it obstructed the street.
""Chickeeduck has been experiencing disturbance from evil forces in the past 18 months,"" Chow said in a statement.
""We have never given up on voicing out against injustice and will never consider backing off. However, the feasibility of the business going forward is now in question and we are thinking of wiser and more sustainable strategies for the company.""
The government's Security Bureau and the Hong Kong police did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Chow did not elaborate on the future strategy after his 32-year-old company's ""exit"" from the Hong Kong market, but said the firm planned to continue as a ""brand for Hong Kongers.""

Chickeeduck has sold shirts that read ""Liberate Sausages, Vegetables of our time"" and ""Five meatballs, no sauce left"" – puns echoing slogans of mass 2019 demonstrations: ""Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our time"" and ""Five demands, not one less.""
The ""Liberate Hong Kong"" slogan was ""capable of inciting secession,"" a major offence under the city's national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020, a judge ruled earlier this year.

(Reuters) -Travis McMichael testified at his murder trial on Wednesday that he shot Ahmaud Arbery because he thought the Black man was attacking him after McMichael and his two co-defendants chased Arbery through a mostly white Georgia neighborhood.
In over three hours on the stand, McMichael, who is white, sought to convince jurors he had good reason to grab his shotgun and jump into his pickup truck with his father to chase Arbery last year, saying they thought Arbery might be a burglar. 
He frequently used police jargon and invoked law-enforcement training he got when he was a U.S. Coast Guard mechanic. Holding back tears, he said 25-year-old Arbery had frightened him.
""You pull a weapon on someone, from what I've learned in my training, usually that tells people to back off,"" he said, explaining why he aimed his pump-action 12-gauge shotgun at Arbery.
Arbery, however, ran toward McMichael at the end of a chase lasting about five minutes on Feb. 23, 2020, through Satilla Shores, a cluster of homes outside the small coastal city of Brunswick (NYSE:BC).
""I shot him. He had my gun,"" McMichael said, his voice trembling as he described a split-second when they grappled over the weapon.
""It was a life or death situation,"" he said. McMichael fired at Arbery three times, tearing two deadly gaping wounds in his chest. 
Prosecutors said Arbery was an avid runner on an afternoon jog, and cellphone footage of the killing sparked outrage when it emerged two months later. 
McMichael, 35, has pleaded not guilty to murder and other crimes alongside two other white defendants: his 65-year-old father, Gregory McMichael, and their neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan.
The decision to testify in his own defense was a risky legal maneuver. McMichael will now face questions from prosecutors, who have said they may ask him about Bryan's report that McMichael uttered a racial slur as he stood over Arbery's body.
'HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?'
McMichael told jurors his decision to grab a gun and chase Arbery was driven by an encounter 12 days before, when he saw Arbery ""creeping in the shadows"" at night around a house under construction nearby.
Police had told the McMichael men that nothing was taken on that day. But they nonetheless suspected Arbery had committed theft on a different occasion and that he may have been armed on the night of Feb. 11 because of the way he seemed to reach for his waistband or pocket.
The property's owner has said through his lawyer that Arbery probably stopped to drink from a water faucet. Arbery had nothing on him besides his running clothes and shoes on the day he was shot.
Defense lawyers have said the men were legally trying to stop Arbery under a now-repealed Georgia citizen's arrest law.
McMichael, however, repeatedly said he chased Arbery only to ask him questions and that he wrongly believed his father had called 911.
""I ask him: 'Hey, what are you doing? What's going on?'"" McMichael testified, saying he pulled alongside Arbery running in the road. Arbery never spoke a word in reply and looked angry with clenched teeth, McMichael said.
""He was mad, which made me think something's happened,"" McMichael said. 
Speaking calmly and often turning to address the jurors directly, McMichael said he had arrest powers while in the U.S. Coast Guard and was trained on using force and the need for reasonable suspicion of a crime, although he never had cause to use force while on duty.
In cross examination, which was due to continue on Thursday, McMichael agreed with prosecutor Linda Dunikoski that he had been trained in constitutional limitations on law enforcement powers.
""So you learned in your time in the military that you can't force anyone to speak with you?"" Dunikoski asked.
""That's correct,"" McMichael replied.

""And that if someone walks away, you have to let them walk away?"" she asked.
""Yes,"" he said.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -A crew member working on the Western movie ""Rust"" said in a lawsuit on Wednesday that the script never called for a gun to be fired during a scene that Alec Baldwin was rehearsing when he killed a cinematographer last month.
Script supervisor Mamie Mitchell alleges Baldwin should have checked the gun himself for live ammunition rather than relying on the assistant director's assertion that the Colt .45 revolver was safe to use.
""In our opinion, Mr. Baldwin chose to play Russian Roulette when he fired a gun without checking it and without having the armorer do so in his presence,"" Mitchell's attorney Gloria Allred told a news conference.
Mitchell, who said she was in the line of fire, alleges assault, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and deliberate infliction of harm and is seeking unspecified damages in the lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court.
""I relive the shooting and the sound of the explosion from the gun over and over again,"" said Mitchell, who made the emergency call to authorities immediately after the Oct. 21 incident. 
The lawsuit, the second to be lodged over the incident, names Baldwin, the movie's producers, assistant director Dave Halls and Hannah Gutierrez, the armorer who was in charge of the weapons used in the movie. 
Representatives for Baldwin, the producers, and Halls did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for Gutierrez said he had yet to see the lawsuit.
Baldwin has said he is heartbroken and is cooperating with the law enforcement investigation. Production company Rust Movie Productions is conducting its own probe.
Authorities in New Mexico have said they are investigating how a live bullet ended up in a gun Baldwin was using as he rehearsed a scene inside a church on Bonanza Creek (NYSE:BCEI) Ranch near Santa Fe. No criminal charges have been filed.
Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed and director Joel Souza was wounded when a gun Baldwin had been told was safe fired off a live bullet, investigators have said. 
Other live rounds have also been found on the set.
The lawsuit said the ""Rust"" script called for three tight camera shots for the scene - one of Baldwin's eyes, another of a bloodstain, and a third on Baldwin's torso ""as he reached his hand down to the holster and removed the gun.""
Baldwin ""intentionally, without just cause or excuse, cocked and fired the loaded gun even though the upcoming scene did not call for the cocking and firing of a firearm,"" the lawsuit asserts. 

Allred said she believed Baldwin's behavior on the set was ""reckless"" and alleged that other safety protocols had been flouted or ignored.
Last week, chief electrician Serge Svetnoy filed a negligence lawsuit https://www.reuters.com/world/us/rust-crew-member-files-negligence-lawsuit-over-fatal-shooting-2021-11-10 against the producers.

ABBOTSFORD, British Columbia (Reuters) - The death toll from massive floods and landslides that devastated parts of British Columbia is set to rise, with the Canadian province declaring a state of emergency on Wednesday and the federal government promising major help.
Authorities have confirmed one death after torrential rains and mudslides destroyed roads and left several mountain towns isolated. At least three people are missing. Some 18,000 people are displaced in the Pacific Coast province, Canadian Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino said.
""We expect to confirm even more fatalities in the coming days,"" British Columbia Premier John Horgan said, describing the calamity as a once-in-500-year event
""We will bring in travel restrictions and ensure that transportation of essential goods and medical and emergency services are able to reach the communities that need them,"" Horgan told a news conference, urging people not to hoard supplies.
The floods and mudslides also severed access to the country's largest port in Vancouver, disrupting already strained global supply chains.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government would help the province recover from what he called a ""terrible, terrible disaster."" 
Ottawa is sending hundreds of air force personnel to aid the recovery and ""there are thousands more on standby,"" Trudeau told reporters in Washington ahead of a U.S.-Canada-Mexico summit on Thursday.
Some affected towns are in remote mountain areas with limited access and freezing temperatures.
In Tulameen, northeast of Vancouver, up to 400 people are trapped, many without power, said Erick Thompson, a spokesman for the area's emergency operations.
""(We) did a helicopter flight recently, dropped off food,"" he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
In Hope, 100 miles (160 km) east of Vancouver, food was starting to run low. Pastor Jeff Kuhn said a quarter of the town's 6,000 residents were seeking shelter. 
About 100 volunteers at the Dukh Nivaran Sahib Gurdwara Sikh temple in Surrey spent all night Tuesday preparing about 3,000 meals and then hired helicopters to deliver the food to Hope, said the temple's president, Narinder Singh Walia.
SECOND RECENT CALAMITY
The disaster could be one of the most expensive in Canadian history.
The flooding is the second weather-related calamity to hit British Columbia in the past few months. A massive in the same region as some of the devastation destroyed an entire town in late June.
""These are extraordinary events not measured before, not contemplated before,"" Horgan said.
Canadian exporters of commodities from grain to fertilizer and oil scrambled to divert shipments away from Vancouver but found few easy alternatives. 
 Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Railway Ltd and Canadian National Railway (TSX:CNR) Co , the country's two biggest rail companies, said their lines into Vancouver remained unusable on Wednesday.
After a phenomenon known as an atmospheric river dumped a month's worth of rain in two days, officials are concerned that another downpour could overwhelm a pumping station near Abbotsford, a city of 160,000 east of Vancouver, which has already been partly evacuated.
Mayor Henry Braun said volunteers built a dam around the station overnight.
""That will buy us some more time, but if we had another weather event like we just went through, we are in deep doo-doo (trouble),"" he told reporters.
Abbotsford farmers ignored an evacuation order on Tuesday and desperately tried to save animals from rising waters, in some cases tying ropes around the necks of cows and pulling them to higher ground.
Provincial Agriculture Minister Lana Popham said thousands of animals had died and others would have to be euthanized.
Environment Canada said Abbotsford would receive more rain early next week.

Rescuer Mike Danks, part of an Abbotsford evacuation team, said the situation had been very tough.
""The majority of people had elderly parents with them that were unable to walk, suffered from dementia,"" he told local outlet Black Press Media.

If the revision takes effect, such workers - many from Vietnam and China - would be allowed to renew their visas indefinitely and bring their families with them.
Top government spokesman Hirokazu Matsuno stressed, however, that any such change would not mean automatic permanent residency, which would require a separate application process.
Immigration has long been taboo in Japan as many prize ethnic homogeneity, but pressure has mounted to open up its borders due to an acute labour shortage given its dwindling and ageing population.
""As the shrinking population becomes a more serious problem and if Japan wants to be seen as a good option for overseas workers, it needs to communicate that it has the proper structure in place to welcome them,"" Toshihiro Menju, managing director of think tank Japan Center for International Exchange, told Reuters.

The 2019 law was meant to attract some 345,000 ""specified skilled workers"" over five years, but the intake has hovered at around 3,000 per month before the COVID-19 pandemic sealed the borders, according to government data.
As of late 2020, Japan housed 1.72 million foreign workers, out of a total population of 125.8 million and just 2.5% of its working population.

KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) -Jurors in the Wisconsin murder trial of Kyle Rittenhouse ended their second day of deliberations without reaching a verdict, after reviewing a series of videos on Wednesday of the teenager's deadly encounters at racial justice protests last year.
Defense lawyers made a new request for a mistrial, saying prosecutors withheld the high-definition version of a drone video in evidence and enhanced it in order to portray Rittenhouse as a threat. Prosecutors denied the defense's allegation.
Rittenhouse, 18, is charged with killing Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and attempted homicide in the wounding of Gaige Grosskreutz, 28, during a chaotic night of protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin on Aug. 25, 2020.
After deliberating for roughly 14 hours over two days, the jury of 7 women and 5 men asked the judge to go home just after 4:30 p.m. Central Time. The judge told the group to return at 9 a.m. (1500 GMT) on Thursday.
The jury, which asked the judge if they could re-watch videos in evidence, spent about 45 minutes on drone video of the Rosenbaum shooting and videos of the subsequent shootings of Huber, who swung a skateboard at the teenager, and Grosskreutz, who was armed with a handgun when he was shot.
The shootings took place in Kenosha during protests - marred by arson, rioting and looting - that followed the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, who was left paralyzed from the waist down.
The trial has emerged as the most closely watched case involving a civilian's right to self-defense since George Zimmerman was acquitted in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Black teenager, in 2013. Like Zimmerman, Rittenhouse has become a polarizing figure, viewed as heroic by some conservatives who favor expansive gun rights and as a symbol of a reckless American gun culture by many on the left.
Tensions were starting to rise outside the courthouse on Wednesday, with the crowd growing to a few dozen in anticipation of a verdict. Two protesters were arrested after a shoving match with a demonstrator holding a sign in support of Rittenhouse, and one man with a long gun was ordered to leave.
VIDEO DISPUTE
Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time of the shootings, has pleaded not guilty and testified last week that he fired his weapon in self defense. He said Rosenbaum, the first person he shot that night, grabbed the barrel of his gun.
Prosecutors have used an enhanced drone video to argue that Rittenhouse raised his rifle in a threatening way before Rosenbaum started chasing him. Prosecutors say Rittenhouse therefore provoked the incident, creating an ""active shooter"" situation that Huber and Grosskreutz felt a need to stop. 
Rittenhouse's lawyers accused the prosecution of withholding a high-definition version of the footage until Saturday after the case was already closed to new evidence. Prosecutors said the video was likely compressed by defense counsels' computers after it was sent to them.
The drone video issue was cited among several factors in a motion by the defense on Monday seeking a mistrial with prejudice, meaning Rittenhouse could not be prosecuted again.
In seeking a mistrial without prejudice on Wednesday, defense attorney Corey Chirafisi said he would have approached the trial differently if they had known about the existence of a higher-resolution video earlier.
Mark Richards, another attorney for Rittenhouse, said the higher-definition version of the video had been enhanced to take the reflection from the side mirror of a car and erroneously make it look as if Rittenhouse raised his rifle. 
""In their enhanced video that sideview mirror is what they point to as him raising his arms,"" Richards told Reuters. ""It's not, it's the sideview mirror."" 

The prosecution denied doing anything wrong. Kenosha County Assistant District Attorney James Kraus referred to the issue as ""technical incident"" and said it did not warrant a mistrial.
Kenosha County Judge Bruce Schroeder has not ruled on the mistrial motions, allowing the jury to proceed with deliberations.

(Reuters) -Two men convicted of killing Black activist and civil rights advocate Malcolm X in 1965 will be exonerated, the Manhattan district attorney's office said on Wednesday, saying it will move to ""vacate the wrongful convictions.""
It would be an official acknowledgement of errors made in the case.
Malcolm X rose to prominence as the national spokesman of the Nation of Islam, an African-American Muslim group that espoused Black separatism. He spent over a decade with the group before becoming disillusioned, publicly breaking with it in 1964 and moderating some of his earlier views on racial separation.
He was shot dead at New York City's Audubon Ballroom while preparing to deliver a speech. Three members of the Nation of Islam were convicted in the shooting. In 1966, the three defendants were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.
The conviction of the third man, who had confessed to the murder at the time of his trial, still stands.
The district attorney's move was first reported by the New York Times and confirmed to Reuters by a spokesperson for the Manhattan D.A.'s office. 
In an interview with the Times, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. apologized on behalf of law enforcement, which he said had failed the families of the two men - Muhammad Aziz and Khalil Islam. 
Both men spent decades in prison. Aziz, 83, was released in 1985. Islam was released in 1987 and died in 2009 at age 74.
""This points to the truth that law enforcement over history has often failed to live up to its responsibilities,"" Vance said. ""These men did not get the justice that they deserved.""
""D.A. Vance, @innocence, and Shanies Law Office will move to vacate the wrongful convictions of two men for the murder of Malcolm X. More to come tomorrow,"" Vance said in a tweet, referring to the Innocence Project and the law firm representing the men. 
A nearly two-year investigation conducted jointly by the Manhattan D.A. and lawyers for the two men found that prosecutors and law enforcement agencies withheld key evidence that, had it been turned over, would likely have led to the pair's acquittal, according to the Times.

""This wasn't a mere oversight,"" said Deborah Francois, a lawyer with Shanies Law Office. ""This was a product of extreme and gross official misconduct.""
Some historians and scholars have contended that the wrong men were convicted. Vance's office said last year it would review the convictions in the case.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) -Security forces shot dead at least 15 people and wounded dozens as thousands of Sudanese took to the streets on Wednesday on the deadliest day in a month of demonstrations against military rule, medics said. 
The protesters, marching against an Oct. 25 coup across the capital Khartoum and in the cities of Bahri and Omdurman, demanded a full handover to civilian authorities and for the leaders of the Oct. 25 coup to be put on trial.
Security forces fired live rounds and tear gas to prevent gatherings in all three cities, and mobile phone communications were cut, witnesses said. State television said there were injuries among protesters and police.
""The coup forces used live bullets heavily in different areas of the capital and there are tens of gunshot injuries, some of them in serious condition,"" said the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors, a group aligned with the protest movement. Deaths were concentrated in Bahri, they said. 
In response, protesters built extensive barricades, emptying the streets of traffic, a Reuters witness said. 
""People are just terrified right now,"" said an Omdurman protester. 
Earlier, on a main road in Khartoum, protesters burned tyres and chanted: ""The people are stronger, and retreat is impossible."" 
Others carried pictures of people killed in previous protests and of Abdalla Hamdok, the civilian prime minister who was put under house arrest during the coup, with the slogan: ""Legitimacy comes from the street, not from the cannons."" 
Images of protests in towns including Port Sudan, Kassala, Dongola, Wad Madani and Geneina were posted on social media. 
Security forces were heavily deployed on main roads and intersections, and bridges across the River Nile were closed, witnesses said.
There was no immediate comment from the security forces and a police representative could not be reached for comment. Military leader General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan has said peaceful protests are allowed and the military does not kill protesters.
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Molly Phee said in a tweet: ""I am saddened by reports of violence and loss of life today in Sudan. We condemn violence towards peaceful protesters and call for the respect and protection of human rights in Sudan."" 
Phee met Hamdok during a visit to Khartoum on Tuesday where they discussed ways to restore Sudan's democratic transition.
ARRESTS
The coup ended a transitional partnership https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sudan-politics-timeline-idAFKBN2HJ2NE between the military and a civilian coalition that helped topple autocrat Omar al-Bashir in 2019.
Despite pressure from Western states, which have suspended economic assistance, efforts at mediation have stalled, with Burhan moving to cement control with help from Bashir-era veterans https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/sudans-military-rulers-draw-bashir-era-veterans-tighten-grip-2021-11-11. 
Speaking in Kenya, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said ""We back (the Sudanese people's) call to restore Sudan’s democratic transition,"" adding that the country had been on a path towards stability and that he was ""engaged intensely"" in the matter.
Protesters and a Reuters witness said they saw security forces chase protesters into neighbourhoods and homes to carry out arrests.
""We haven't ever had violence in Bahri like today's, even under the old regime,"" said one demonstrator, who said the air was thick with tear gas and security forces used live bullets into Wednesday night.
""The coup forces are practising excessive repression and are encircling the revolutionaries' marches in several areas,"" said the Sudanese Professionals Association, which has helped promote the protests.
""This was preceded by the deliberate interruption of voice and internet communications services.""
Mobile internet services in Sudan have been suspended since Oct. 25, complicating a campaign of anti-military rallies, strikes and civil disobedience.
The doctors' committee and other unions said in a statement that security forces had tried to raid one hospital in Omdurman and were surrounding another, releasing tear gas and blocking patients' access. The same was witnessed at hospitals in Bahri, said a demonstrator.

Wednesday's deaths brought the committee's death toll since the coup to 39 people.
""Military commanders will be held accountable for these abuses,"" said the U.N. special rapporteur on Freedom of Association and Peaceful, Assembly Clement Voule, in a tweet.

DENVER (Reuters) - Prosecutors will try for a second time to convict a former longshot Idaho gubernatorial candidate in the abduction and slaying of a 12-year-old Colorado girl after their first attempt ended with a hung jury and mistrial, court records show.
Steven Pankey, 70, will stand trial again for the kidnapping and murder of Jonelle Matthews, who vanished in 1984 and whose remains were uncovered more than three decades later, according to minutes from a status hearing on Wednesday.
Following a three-week trial that ended in early November, a 12-member jury found Pankey guilty of false reporting, a misdemeanor, but were unable to reach unanimous verdicts on the more serious charges.
Weld County Judge Timothy Kerns then declared a mistrial and ordered Pankey held on a $5 million bond.
Matthews disappeared in December 1984 after she was dropped off at her home in Greeley, Colorado, about 50 miles north of Denver, after singing at a Christmas concert.
In 2019, an excavation crew working on a pipeline uncovered the girl’s remains at a remote oil and gas site in Weld County, police said. She had died of a gunshot wound to the head, authorities said.
Prosecutors presented no direct evidence linking Pankey to the crime, instead relying on incriminating statements they said he made over the years, including details of the crime scene that only the killer would know.
Pankey lived in Greeley at the time Matthews disappeared and watched the girl and other children walk home, according to prosecutors.
Pankey testified at his trial that he did not kill the girl, and that he made up details ""to be a big man in the case.""

Pankey unsuccessfully ran for Idaho governor on the Constitution Party ticket in 2014, and lost a second gubernatorial bid in the 2018 Republican primaries.
A new trial date has not been set.

BALTIMORE, Md. (Reuters) -U.S. Roman Catholic bishops on Wednesday reaffirmed their stance that Catholics who defy church teaching without repenting should refrain from the sacrament of Holy Communion, but did not directly rebuke politicians for supporting abortion rights as some conservatives had hoped.
The matter of communion eligibility has ignited fierce debate within the church over whether politicians like U.S. President Joe Biden, who support abortion rights, should be able to receive the sacrament, which is a central tradition for the faith. 
The Roman Catholic Church teaches abortion is immoral. Biden, the first Catholic U.S. president since John F. Kennedy, has said he personally opposes abortion but supports a woman's right to choose and has vowed to protect that right in the face of restrictive state laws.
The communion document bishops approved by a wide margin at their meeting in Baltimore, Maryland, does not explicitly mention Biden or any other politician by name, and does not focus on the issue of abortion. It says Catholics who exercise public authority ""have a special responsibility"" to follow the church's moral law.
While offering a symbolic rebuke, the document does not set forth any new guidelines that would block Biden from receiving communion. It repeats a statement the conference made in 2006, which said Catholics who ""obstinately"" reject the church's moral teaching should refrain from communion.
Since the bishops resolved to draft the document at their June conference, debate over what it should say has exposed political rifts in the church. 
Some conservative bishops wanted it to rebuke politicians who support abortion rights and set explicit standards of eligibility for receiving the sacrament. Others cautioned against weaponizing the Eucharist and sowing further division among the church's fractured membership.
Nearly 20% of U.S. Catholics have left the church in the past two decades, according to a Gallup poll in March, as sexual abuse scandals involving predatory priests have emerged and Catholics have disagreed on social issues.
Some 55% of Catholics believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, compared to 59% of the general population, according to a Pew Research survey https://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion conducted in April. 
Bishop Kevin Rhoades, chair of the conference's Committee on Doctrine, brushed off the notion that the political debate surrounding the writing of the document had exacerbated existing division in the church.
""Perhaps the debate helped the general public know how important the Holy Eucharist is, or we wouldn't even be having debates about reception,"" he said on Wednesday.
DOCUMENT PASSES OVERWHELMINGLY
The document passed with 222 ""yes"" votes, eight ""no"" votes and three abstaining. It required two-thirds of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' membership to pass.
Bishop Michael Burbidge of Arlington, Virginia, told reporters on Tuesday that the document was never intended ""to target any individual or group of individuals."" 
The document vaguely appears to chastise politicians who support abortion rights where it states, ""Lay people who exercise some form of public authority have a special responsibility to form their consciences in accord with the Church's faith and the moral law, and to serve the human family by upholding human life and dignity.""
It avoids giving an explicit directive to bishops to withhold communion from Catholics who they say oppose Church teachings. It says: ""It is the special responsibility of the diocesan bishop to work to remedy situations that involve public actions at variance with the visible communion of the Church and the moral law.""

Biden, who regularly attends mass, met privately with Pope Francis at the Vatican last month and said afterward that the pope had told him he was a ""good Catholic"" who can receive communion.
Prior to that meeting, Pope Francis, whose liberal theology has ruffled many conservative Catholics since his election in 2013, appeared to criticize U.S. bishops for dealing with the issue in a political rather than a pastoral way. The pope said bishops should use ""compassion and tenderness"" with Catholic politicians who support abortion rights.

(Reuters) - More Americans than ever before died from drug overdoses over a 12-month period, according to federal data released on Wednesday, as the coronavirus pandemic disrupted medical care and increased mental health woes, and as more lethal drugs flooded the streets.
The record of more than 100,000 overdose deaths between April 2020 and April 2021, which U.S. President Joe Biden called ""a tragic milestone,"" represents a 28.5% jump from the previous 12 months, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The Biden administration said it would push states to enact laws making it easier for people to get access to naloxone, a drug that can reverse opioid overdoses. 
""No one should die from an overdose, and naloxone is one of the most effective tools we have to save lives,"" said Dr. Rahul Gupta, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. 
Biden said in a statement that even as the country battles against the COVID-19 pandemic, ""we cannot overlook this epidemic of loss"" from drug overdose deaths. 
Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, director of the American Health Initiative at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, which focuses on addictions and overdose, said the peak of drug deaths hit in the spring of 2020, early in the pandemic. He expects the year-on-year overdose data to begin falling with July figures, but not by much. 
""This is a momentous tragedy hidden by the pandemic,"" Sharfstein said. ""It's heartbreaking how many families have been affected by an overdose this year.""
Sharfstein said the surge in overdose deaths reflects two factors, the first directly connected to pandemic disruptions that caused intense stress for many people.
""A lot of (drug addiction) programs had to close or reduce their hours or otherwise become less accessible during the pandemic,"" Sharfstein said. ""So even as there was much more need, there was less access to care in many places.""
The second is that the illegal drug supply out on the streets has become deadlier. That is mostly due to widespread availability of fentanyl, which can be 100 times more potent than morphine and is increasingly being mixed with other drugs, such as cocaine, without users knowing, as drug suppliers seek to boost their effects. 
Even minuscule amounts of fentanyl make the drugs far more dangerous.
Sharfstein and other public health experts are calling on governments at all levels to take the overdose epidemic as seriously as they have confronted COVID-19, and to invest more in treatments proven to work, like naloxone, and in real-time data that tracks when and where overdoses are flaring up.

Data in July showed that last year's drug overdoses jumped 30% as pandemic lockdowns made getting treatment difficult and dealers laced more drugs with fentanyl or copycat versions of the potent opioid.
The U.S. states with the biggest percentage spike in overdose deaths were Vermont at 70%, followed by West Virginia (62.2%) and Kentucky (54.5%). California, the most populous state, saw its overdoses climb nearly 47.8%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday sentenced the U.S. Capitol rioter known as the ""QAnon Shaman"" for his horned headdress to 41 months in prison for his role in the deadly Jan. 6 attack by followers of then-President Donald Trump.
Prosecutors had asked U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth to impose a longer 51-month sentence on Jacob Chansley, who pleaded guilty in September to obstructing an official proceeding when he and thousands of others stormed the building to try to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's election.
The sentence matches one Lamberth imposed on a former mixed martial artist filmed punching a police officer during violence, who was sentenced last week to 41 months in prison. The two are the stiffest sentences handed down in any of the roughly 675 riot prosecutions.
Lamberth said he believed Chansley, 34, had done a lot to convince the court he is ""on the right track.""
Chansley's attorney asked the judge for a sentence of time served for his client, who has been detained since his January arrest. Chansley appeared in court in a dark green prison jumpsuit, with a beard and shaved head.
""The hardest part of this is that I know I am to blame,"" Chansley said in a lengthy statement before he was sentenced, describing a difficult childhood and saying he had taken responsibility for his behavior. 
""I thought I was going to get 20 years solitary confinement,"" he said, adding: ""This trauma has done something to me ... I have the white hairs to prove it ... on my chest ... on my arms... I should not have white hairs your honor."" 
While in detention, Chansley was diagnosed by prison officials with transient schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and anxiety. When he entered his guilty plea, Chansley said he was disappointed Trump had not pardoned him.
Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives and acquitted by the Senate on a charge of inciting the Jan. 6 riot for a fiery speech that preceded it in which he told his followers to ""fight like hell.""

Four people died in the violence. A Capitol Police officer who had been attacked by protesters died the day after the riot and four police officers who took part in the defense of the Capitol later took their own lives. About 140 police officers were injured.
Most of the guilty pleas in Jan. 6 prosecutions so far have been in cases involving non-violent misdemeanors, but government lawyers are seeking prison sentences for some defendants facing more serious felony charges.

Meghan, formally known as the Duchess of Sussex, sat down with DeGeneres for an episode that will air in the United States on Thursday, producers of the daytime show said on Wednesday.
It was the first big TV appearance for Meghan since she and Harry gave a bombshell interview to Oprah Winfrey in March and spelled out their unhappiness at life within the royal family.
The former ""Suits"" actress, who gave up her acting career when she married Harry in 2018, related an anecdote about her many auditions when she was starting out as an actress in Los Angeles, according to a clip of her surprise appearance.
“I had this very old Ford Explorer Sport and, at a certain point, the key stopped working on the driver’s side, so you couldn’t get yourself in through the door,"" she told DeGeneres.
""So after auditions, I would park at the back of the parking lot and I would open the trunk and climb in, pull the door shut behind me and crawl all over my seats to get out. That’s how I would come to and fro.”

Since quitting their royal duties and moving to California in 2020, Meghan and Harry have largely restricted their public outings to charitable events or conferences that promote the work of their Archewell foundation on issues ranging from disinformation in the media to women, hunger and mental health.
They have also signed lucrative deals with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) to produce their own TV shows and podcasts.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Urgent measures are needed to strengthen the credibility of U.S. military deterrence of any potential Chinese aggression against Taiwan, according to a report from a bipartisan advisory body to the U.S. Congress published Wednesday.
The influential U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) included a range of recommendations about Taiwan in its annual report to Congress, amid heightened tensions between the democratically ruled island and China.
The report said Congress should authorize and appropriate funds for Taiwan to purchase defense articles from the United States and finance the deployment of cruise and ballistic missiles and other munitions in the Indo-Pacific while increasing funding for surveillance.
""A lack of clarity in U.S. policy could contribute to a deterrence failure if Chinese leaders interpret that policy to mean opportunistic aggression against Taiwan might not provoke a quick or decisive U.S. response,"" the report said.
China claims Taiwan as its own and has vowed to bring the island under Chinese control, by force if necessary, and tensions across the Taiwan Strait have escalated in recent months.
In a video call this week, Chinese leader Xi Jinping warned Biden that China would respond to provocations on Taiwan.
The report addressed a range of economic issues between the United States and China, including recommending Congress consider legislation to address risks to U.S. investors and interests in China investment.
China's capital controls ""may limit investors’ abilities to move money out of equity and bond investments and the lack of oversight by trusted authorities may jeopardize investors' funds,"" Commission chair Robin Cleveland said in an opening statement. ""More importantly, numerous companies which will benefit from U.S. investment have been formally identified as threats to U.S. national security interests."" 
The report recommends prohibiting or at least better identifying the risks of variable interest entities, where mainland Chinese companies create offshore corporate entities to circumvent China's prohibitions on foreign direct investment in certain industries and list on U.S. exchanges.

The report said U.S. participation in China’s financial markets was increasing -- reaching as much as $1.2 trillion in 2020 -- and “outpacing the U.S. government’s defense” against threats posed by problematic Chinese companies.
The Biden administration has prohibited investment in 24 publicly traded Chinese companies but, Commissioners Jeffrey Feidler and Michael Wessel say, ""many more should be on the list.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) -A former U.S. Marine serving a nine-year jail sentence in Russia has ended a hunger strike after nearly a week, lost a lot of weight and is ill, according to a message he sent his family. 
Trevor Reed, a university student from Texas, was convicted last year of endangering the lives of two policemen in Moscow while drunk on a visit in 2019. He denies the charges and the United States called his trial a ""theatre of the absurd"".
His family said last week he had begun a hunger strike in protest at his incarceration and alleged violations of his rights. The prison service denied he was refusing food or that his rights were being abused.
In Nov. 15 comments shared by his family, Reed said he ended the strike on the morning of Nov. 9, having refused food and drunk only water since the evening of Nov. 3. 
""They (prison staff) were ALL aware of my hunger strike. They asked me on video every day if I wanted food and I refused. They did not weigh me or give me a medical inspection,"" he said.

Reed said he had a cough, headache, congestion, mucus in his lungs and back pain, and that a doctor had given him vitamins. 
He said he was due to be moved from his cell to a punishment cell but did not say why. 

A family spokesman said: ""Trevor's new complaints about his health are alarming and it's quite clear Russian authorities aren't taking them seriously. The Reeds continue to urge the (U.S.) Administration to make a deal to bring their son home.""

WARSAW/BRUSSELS/VILNIUS (Reuters) -The EU said on Wednesday it will send 700,000 euros worth of food, blankets and other aid to migrants at the Belarus border, after criticism it had done too little to help thousands of people trapped in frozen woods by an east-west feud.
In a sign of European urgency to resolve what it calls an artificial border crisis created by Minsk, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke by phone on Wednesday for the second time in three days to Belarus's President Alexander Lukashenko.
A day after Polish border guards used water cannon against migrants hurling stones, the situation at the frontier appeared to have grown calmer. Polish and Belarusian border guards both said some 2,000 migrants were right at the border fence.
The head of the EU executive, Ursula von der Leyen, announced the aid, while saying it was up to Lukashenko to halt a crisis that Europe believes he created deliberately. 
""We are ready to do more. But the Belarusian regime must stop luring people and putting their lives at risk,"" she said. 
The EU says Minsk has flown in thousands of migrants from the Middle East to push them to cross illegally into the bloc, in order to put pressure on Europe in retaliation for sanctions imposed against Belarus over human rights abuses.
Belarus denies fomenting the crisis but says it cannot help end it unless Europe lifts sanctions it imposed since Lukashenko cracked down on opponents after a disputed election last year.
Poland's Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak told Polish public radio on Wednesday the crisis at the border was likely to last months: ""We have to be prepared that this situation on the Belarusian border won't settle swiftly,"" he said.
Several thousand people have been camped out in the woods as winter approaches, suffering from frost and exhaustion, and barred either from entering Poland or returning into Belarus. 
At least eight have died at the Polish border since the crisis started this summer. Neighbouring Lithuania and Latvia have also experienced a sharp spike in attempted irregular crossings from Belarus.
EAST-WEST ROW
The EU has called on Russia to make Lukashenko end the crisis. Moscow denies any direct role but has offered to mediate, while also demonstrating support for Lukashenko by staging military exercises jointly with Belarus near the border.
Merkel's phone calls with Lukashenko are an unusual sign of direct outreach to a leader Europe has shunned as illegitimate since last year's election. In statements following the calls, Merkel's spokesperson Steffen Seibert referred to him as Mr Lukashenko, without referrence to his title as president.
Merkel ""stressed the need, with the support of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Organisation for Migration and the cooperation of the European Commission, to provide humanitarian aid and repatriation facilities to the affected people,"" Siebert said of Wednesday's call.
The EU has blacklisted Lukashenko and dozens of Belarusian state officials and introduced economic sanctions on trade since the crackdown that followed last year's election. It is now expanding sanctions on travel agents and airlines involved in what it calls ""human trafficking"" behind the border crisis.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) might also halt investments in Belarus, a source told Reuters. The bank currently has 914 million euros ($1.03 billion) in projects there.
EU IN A BIND
The bloc has so far largely supported Poland's nationalist government in taking a hard line at the border, fearing that allowing migrants to cross would encourage more to try.
Police in Germany - a top destination for immigrants once they reach the EU - say they have registered 9,549 illegal entries from Belarus via Poland this year. In figures that show how suddenly the issue emerged, they reported only 26 such cases between January and July, rising to 474 arrivals in August and 5,285 in October.
Preventing uncontrolled immigration has been a central political issue for the bloc since 2015, when more than a million people arrived from the Middle East and Africa, triggering feuds between member countries over how to share responsibility for caring for them. 
The EU was caught off guard, its welfare and security systems were strained and the ensuing chaos triggered a surge in nationalist movements, also contributing to support for Britain's exit from the bloc.
The EU has since tightened external borders and paid to host migrants in countries such as Turkey, and stop them along migration routes in Libya and elsewhere, often in dire conditions. Rights groups decry the EU's restrictive tactics as aggravating human suffering. 

""The European Union doesn't have a good common migration policy, despite obvious need for one after the previous migration crises,"" said Linas Kojala, director at the Eastern European Studies Centre think-tank in Vilnius.
""Each time it needs to look for ways to extinguish fires. And it lacks tools to use against regimes hostile towards it, including Belarus and Russia.""

MERRITT, British Columbia (Reuters) -Floods and landslides that have killed at least one person have cut all rail access to Canada's largest port in the city of Vancouver, a spokesperson for the port said on Tuesday.
Two days of torrential rain across the Pacific province of British Columbia touched off major flooding and shut rail routes operated by  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Rail and Canadian National Railway (TSX:CNR), Canada's two biggest rail companies.
""All rail service coming to and from the Port of Vancouver is halted because of flooding in the British Columbia interior,"" port spokesperson Matti Polychronis said.
At least one person was killed when a mudslide swept cars off Highway 99 near Pemberton, some 100 miles (160 km) to the northeast of Vancouver. 
Two people were missing and search and rescue crews were combing through the rubble, officials said.
Vancouver's port moves C$550 million ($440 million) worth of cargo a day, ranging from automobiles and finished goods to essential commodities.
The floods temporarily shut down much of the movement of wheat and canola from Canada, one of the world's biggest grain exporters, during a busy time for trains to haul grain to the port following the harvest. 
Drought has sharply reduced the size of Canada's crops this year, meaning a rail disruption of a few days may not create a significant backlog, a grain industry source told Reuters.
Del Dosdall, senior export manager at grain handler Parrish & Heimbecker, said he expected some rail services could be restored by the weekend. Another industry source said he expected the shutdown to last weeks.
OIL PIPELINES SHUT DOWN
Floods have also hampered pipelines. Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) Inc shut a segment of a British Columbia natural gas pipeline as a precaution. 
The storms also forced the closure of the Trans Mountain pipeline, which carries up to 300,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Alberta province to the Pacific coast.
Copper and coal miner Teck Resources (NYSE:TECK) Limited said the floods had disrupted movement of its commodities to its export terminals, while potash exporter Canpotex Ltd said it was looking for alternatives to move the crop nutrient overseas.
Directly to the south of British Columbia, in the U.S. state of Washington, heavy rain forced evacuations and cut off electricity for more than 150,000 households on Monday. 
The U.S. National Weather Service on Tuesday issued a flash flood in Mount Vernon, Washington, ""due to the potential for a levee failure.""
Some areas of British Columbia received 8 inches (20 cm) of rain on Sunday, the amount that usually falls in a month.
Authorities in Merritt, some 120 miles (200 km) northeast of Vancouver, ordered all 8,000 citizens to leave on Monday as river waters rose quickly, but some were still trapped in their homes on Tuesday, said city spokesman Greg Lowis.
Snow blanketed the town on Tuesday and some cars could be seen floating in the flood waters up to 4 feet (1.22 m) deep. 
The towns of Chilliwack and Abbotsford ordered partial evacuations. 
Abbotsford also issued an emergency warning https://twitter.com/city_abbotsford/status/1460813259661996041?s=12 on Tuesday night, asking all residents to evacuate the Sumas Prairie region immediately as deteriorating conditions posed a significant threat to lives.

Rescuers equipped with diggers and body-sniffing dogs started clearing mounds of debris that have choked highways.
The landslides and floods come less than six months after a wildfires gutted an entire town in British Columbia as temperatures soared during a record-breaking heat dome, raising new worries about climate change.

The EU has accused Belarus of flying in thousands of migrants from the Middle East and Africa and pushing them to cross into EU and NATO members Poland, Lithuania and Latvia in retaliation for sanctions already imposed on Minsk. Belarus has denied deliberately fomenting the crisis.
The EU neighbours of Belarus, which is a close Russian ally, have warned that the crisis could lead to a military clash, and have declared states of emergency and deployed military forces near their borders.
Estonia has a similar geopolitical history to Lithuania and Latvia, although it has no border with Belarus.
The snap exercise is scheduled to last until Nov. 25 and was called to test rapid response of the national chain of command, the Estonian government said.

The reserve solders will help install 40 km of razor wire in places along Russian border, where risks of illegal crossings are highest, Estonian police and border guard said in a statement.
""What is happening in Poland, Lithuania and Latvia also requires the strengthening of the border infrastructure in Estonia,"" said chief of Police and Border Guard Elmar Vaher.

MANILA (Reuters) - The son of late Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos, an early frontrunner for the May election, is facing a second petition seeking to bar him from the presidential race, centred on a tax evasion conviction nearly three decades ago. 
The complaint, filed on Wednesday at the election commission by a group called the Campaign Against the Return of the Marcoses and Martial Law, argued the conviction should have perpetually disqualified Ferdinand Marcos Jr from holding or running for office. 
He was found guilty in 1995 of failing to file income tax returns from 1982 to 1985 while governor of Ilocos Norte province, a verdict upheld two years later by an appeals court. 
""He has continuously neglected his penalty and disrespected the rule of law by running and filing his candidacy knowing in fact that he is a convicted criminal,"" lawyer Howard Calleja told reporters after the filing. 
Marcos's spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The internal revenue code states that a public officer convicted of a tax crime will be barred for life from holding public office, voting and participating in any election.
Since his conviction, however, Marcos has been elected governor, congressman and senator and ran unsuccessfully for the vice presidency.
The Marcos family is one of the most famous dynasties in the Philippines and despite its fall from grace after a 1986 ""people power"" revolution, it has retained its wealth and far-reaching and powerful connections. 
Sara Duterte-Carpio, the president's popular daughter, will be the running mate of Marcos. 
Antonio La Viña, a law and politics professor at the Ateneo de Manila University, said election authorities would typically only disqualify a barred candidate if a complaint is made first. 
""People will only complain if you are winnable,"" he said, adding the case against Marcos could go either way.
Asked if Marcos had ever faced a disqualification case, election commission spokesperson James Jimenez said: ""Not that I can recall, no.""

Marcos, whose father ruled the Philippines for almost two decades, much of that a harsh era of martial law, led an opinion poll conducted last month on preferred presidential candidates.
The poll body has scheduled a preliminary conference for Nov. 26 on an earlier disqualification complaint against Marcos filed by a group representing political detainees, human rights and medical organisations, who has said that petition ""is without merit and has no legal basis"".

Peng, one of China's biggest sport stars, said on social media earlier this month that a former member of China's Politburo Standing Committee, Zhang Gaoli, coerced her into sex and that they later had an on-off consensual relationship.
The global tennis community has grown alarmed as Peng has not been seen since the post and on Monday the governing body of men's tennis (ATP) backed the Women's Tennis Association's (WTA) call for China to investigate the allegations.
""I was recently informed of a fellow tennis player that has gone missing shortly after revealing that she has been sexually abused,"" said Japan's Osaka. ""Censorship is never ok at any cost, I hope Peng Shuai and her family are safe and ok.
""I'm in shock of the current situation and I'm sending love and light her way. #whereispengshuai.""
WTA chief Simon told the New York Times on Sunday that no one at the Tour has talked directly to Peng but that he had received assurances from the Chinese Tennis Association that she was safe ""and not under any physical threat"".
The Chinese Tennis Association did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.

The 35-year-old Peng was the first Chinese player to top the world rankings when she was doubles number one in 2014. She won doubles titles at Wimbledon in 2013 and the French Open in 2014.
Zhang, now 75, was a vice premier between 2013 and 2018 and served on the Politburo Standing Committee between 2012 and 2017.

CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australia's prime minister said on Wednesday more than 60 areas of technology were critical to the national interest and promised millions of dollars in funding to keep strategic rivals from controlling industries from cyber security to medicine. 
In recent months, Australia has pledged to spend billions of dollars to modernise its economy and cut dependence on China by spurring manufacturing in industries such as resources and critical minerals as well as backing low-emission technology.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia has identified 63 technologies that Canberra can not allow others to dominate. These include advanced cyber, genomics and novel antibiotics.
""In most cases having diverse well-functioning markets can meet our technology needs, but in some cases – for critical technologies – we need to ensure we can access and use such technologies reliably and safely, in good times and bad,"" Morrison said in a speech.
“This investment will help secure future economic opportunities for Australian businesses, create local jobs and importantly, it will help keep Australians safe.""
While Morrison highlighted 63 technologies, Australia will initially focus on supporting nine. The first of which will be quantum technology. Morrison pledged A$100 million ($73 million) to commercialise quantum research and forge links with global markets and supply chains.
""Australia is working with like-minded countries, liberal democracies in particular, to ensure global technology rules and norms reflect those values – liberal democratic values.""
Such is the importance of the technology for Australia, Canberra may also impose restrictions on domestic universities conducting joint research with foreign institutions across the 63 areas.
Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews announced new rules on Wednesday governing universities that are designed to reduce the threat of foreign interference.
Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) technology, based on core principles of physics, is still in its infancy but has become a darling of investors aspiring to revolutionise industries, from healthcare and finance to artificial intelligence and weather forecasting.
A 2020 report titled ""Growing Australia’s Quantum Technology Industry"" by the CSIRO, the national science agency, said it could generate over $4 billion and 16,000 jobs by 2040.
The announcement by Morrison was welcomed by Australia's information technology sector.

""Quantum technology has the potential to be a multi-billion dollar industry that generates thousands of Australian jobs,"" said Ron Gauci, chief executive officer of the industry group, the Australian Information Industry Association.

Twenty-nine men were killed after a series of blasts ignited by methane gas ripped through the Pike River mine on the west coast of the South Island in November 2010. Two men managed to escape.
The mine was shuttered and entry barred for years because of safety concerns. Investigators were eventually allowed access in 2019 following calls from the families of the miners. 
Police said images taken late last week during deep boring in the mine confirmed two bodies, with the possibility of a third. However, the remains were far from the mine entrance and could not be recovered.

""While we have been unable to identify the remains, we are working with forensic experts to see what we can do to confirm their identities,"" said Detective Superintendent Peter Read.
Investigators believe there were six to eight people working in the area where the remains were found, he added.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) -Resource-rich Western Australia state on Wednesday unveiled a long-awaited bill aimed at protecting Indigenous heritage, but drew immediate fire from Aboriginal groups because a government minister will keep final say over development decisions. 
Indigenous heritage protection has become a hot button issue since miner Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) legally destroyed culturally significant rock shelters for an iron ore mine 18 months ago, sparking widespread public outrage. 
""It's a devastating day for Aboriginal heritage,"" said Tyronne Garstone, chief executive of the Kimberley Land Council. 
""Fundamentally, this bill will not protect Aboriginal cultural heritage and will continue a pattern of systematic structural racial discrimination against Aboriginal people.""
Western Australia produces more than half of the world's traded iron ore, a key steel-making ingredient and Australia's most lucrative export, worth A$153 billion ($111 billion) in the year to end-June.
The new state legislation is at odds with the findings of a national inquiry into Rio's destruction last year of rock shelters at Juukan Gorge that showed evidence of continual human habitation stretching back 46,000 years into the last Ice Age.
The inquiry urged a new national protection framework and said Aboriginal traditional owners should be the top decision makers on development applications that could impact their heritage and have the power to withhold consent.
The bill, which has been under revision for three years, was introduced to state parliament on Wednesday.
The state premier's department said it will focus on reaching agreement with Aboriginal groups and on obtaining full, prior and informed consent for development.
Aboriginal groups, however, said they had not been adequately consulted and they did not gain a right of appeal to a ministerial decision, a cornerstone of modernising the laws. Miners and developers will also be unable to appeal any ministerial decision. 
In the decade to July 2020, miners submitted more than 460 applications to impact Aboriginal heritage sites and all but one were approved.
""What we have been delivered is ... the Minister making unchallenged decisions on whether cultural heritage may be destroyed,"" Tony Bevan, acting chief executive of the Wintawari Guruma Aboriginal Corp, said in a statement.
The bill also put a lot of extra bureaucratic requirements on poorly resourced and financed Aboriginal groups that many would be unable to meet, he added.
The Chamber of Minerals and Energy, which represents miners including Rio, BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) and Fortescue Metals Group (OTC:FSUGY) noted ""extensive consultation"" with government ministers, and said it could work with the new laws. 
""We acknowledge that our industry hasn't always got things right, at times with deeply regrettable consequences,"" Chamber Chief Executive Paul Everingham said in a statement, adding that it remained committed to ""respond to the priorities of local Indigenous people.""
The rock shelters that Rio destroyed at Juukan Gorge had contained remnants of a 4,000 year old plaited hair belt that showed a genetic connection with the area's traditional owners.

Amid a public uproar, three senior executives including then chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques left the company and parliament launched a national enquiry into the incident.

KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) -The jury in the Wisconsin murder trial of Kyle Rittenhouse ended their first day of deliberations on Tuesday without reaching a verdict, pushing their efforts to form a consensus on whether to convict or acquit the teenager into a second day.
Rittenhouse, 18, is charged with killing Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and wounding Gaige Grosskreutz, 28, on Aug. 25, 2020. The shootings took place during protests in Kenosha - marred by arson, rioting and looting - that followed the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, who was left paralyzed from the waist down.
After roughly eight hours of deliberations, Kenosha County Judge Bruce Schroeder said he would accept the jury's request to call it a day and come back at 9 a.m. Central Time (1500 GMT) on Wednesday.
""I understand that you wish to break for the evening,"" Schroeder said. ""You are in charge at this particular point.""
The jury of 7 women and 5 men sent two notes to the judge on Tuesday, neither giving any indication of the substance of their discussions. The first note asked for extra copies of the first six pages of the judge's 36-page jury instructions and the second requested copies of the final 30 pages.
The high-profile case pits the prosecution's argument that Rittenhouse shot the men without justification, against the teenager's assertion that he acted in self-defense. Rittenhouse faces life in prison https://www.reuters.com/world/us/how-much-prison-time-could-shooter-kyle-rittenhouse-face-2021-11-16 on the most serious count.
At the start of Tuesday, Rittenhouse played an indirect role in whittling down the jury, which was composed of 18 members through two weeks of testimony, to 12 for deliberations. He selected six pieces of paper out of a metal raffle tumbler, each with the number of a juror who was then designated an alternate.
Rittenhouse has pleaded not guilty and took the stand last week to argue that he only fired his weapon after the men attacked him. He said Rosenbaum, the first person he shot that night, grabbed the barrel of his semi-automatic rifle.
On Monday, prosecutors and defense counsel gave their closing arguments https://www.reuters.com/world/us/key-moments-closing-arguments-rittenhouse-murder-trial-2021-11-15, offering widely different portrayals of the defendant. 
Prosecutors described Rittenhouse as a reckless vigilante who provoked the series of violent encounters, first by raising his rifle in a threatening way, then by shooting Rosenbaum which created an ""active shooter"" situation which others tried to stop.
The defense said Rittenhouse, who carried a medical kit in addition to his gun, merely wanted to help the injured and protect a used-car dealership from the kind of property damage that Kenosha had seen over two nights before the shooting.
The shootings have emerged as the most closely watched case involving a civilian's right to self-defense since George Zimmerman was acquitted in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Black teenager, in 2013.
Like Zimmerman, Rittenhouse has become a polarizing figure, viewed as heroic by some conservatives who favor expansive gun rights and as a symbol of a reckless American gun culture by many on the left.

Kenosha has been on edge during the trial, and a small crowd of demonstrators stood watch outside the courtroom on Tuesday, some holding placards in support of Rittenhouse, others calling for racial justice and his conviction.
On Tuesday, the Kenosha County Sheriff’s Department issued a press release acknowledging ""the anxiety surrounding the Kyle Rittenhouse trial"" but saying that it currently saw no need to enact a curfew or close off roads.

JESUS CARRANZA, Mexico (Reuters) -More than 1,500 members of a migrant caravan that set off toward the U.S. border from southern Mexico last month have been issued documents to regularize their stay in Mexico, the migration authority said on Tuesday.
The National Migration Institute (INM) said it had given 1,574 foreign nationals migration cards and ensured they could work in Mexico since the caravan set off on Oct. 23.
Enduring adverse weather and under pressure from officials to give up, the caravan containing many women and children has made slow progress through southern Mexico, and on Tuesday moved into the Gulf state of Veracruz from neighboring Oaxaca.
Reuters witnesses estimated up to 1,500 people entered Veracruz. Organizers of the caravan put the figure at 2,000.
About 3,000 people were in the caravan when it set out, though some estimates since then have put the number higher.
Overnight, the caravan stopped in the municipality of Jesus Carranza on Veracruz's border with Oaxaca.
Hector Martinez, a senior INM official, denied that authorities were trying to block the caravan's progress, but again urged its members to accept documentation to stay in Mexico.
The bulk of the people in the caravan are Central Americans, as well as people from the Caribbean who are seeking to escape economic malaise and security problems in their homelands.
Organizers of the group said a new caravan with more Haitians could depart from the southern Mexican city of Tapachula on Thursday. A decision would be made on Wednesday about whether to set off, organizer Luis Garcia Villagran said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia says it has toughened foreign interference rules for universities to stop self-censorship on campuses and the covert transfer of sensitive technology, before hundreds of thousands of international students are expected to return as borders closed by the COVID-19 pandemic re-open.
International education is Australia's fourth-largest export industry, with China the biggest source of fee-paying students.
Home Affairs minister Karen Andrews said on Wednesday the foreign interference guidelines will protect universities and students from ""hostile foreign actors and intelligence services; who have been known to target sensitive research, muzzle debate, and intimidate foreign students"". 
Australia is concerned its commercial advantage could be lost by unwanted technology transfer, and by researchers not declaring affiliations with militaries or governments in countries that don't rank highly on transparency or democracy indices, the guidelines said.
Universities will determine which staff will be required to undergo checks on their links to foreign governments or companies.
High numbers of Chinese students at Australian universities have created an environment of self-censorship with lecturers avoiding criticism of Beijing and Chinese students staying silent in fear of harassment, Human Rights Watch said in June.
The new guidelines don't name China, but feature case studies that parallel incidents involving China and the harassment of Hong Kong protesters on Australian campuses since 2019, as well as pressure on a university from a country's consulate to retract an academic paper on COVID-19 because it embarrassed the foreign government.
Australia, which passed its first foreign interference law in 2018, sparking a dispute with China, defines the term as activity that is coercive, clandestine or corrupting, and distinct from the normal lobbying activity of a foreign government.
The tougher rules come after ties worsened last year when Australia called for an independent probe into the origins of the novel coronavirus, sparking trade reprisals hitting Australian goods ranging from barley and coal to wine.
The European Commission has said it is also developing foreign interference rules for European universities. 

The Chinese embassy in Canberra wrote to Australia's parliament to complain that Senator James Paterson, chair of its intelligence committee, last week gave a speech to the European Parliament outlining how Australia's foreign interference rules were a response to the threat from China.
The ""so-called security threat of China's influence in Australia"" was false information, a copy of the Chinese complaint reviewed by Reuters said.

501,"<span>Nov 16, 2021 10:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The global agreement reached at the United Nations’ COP26 summit in Glasgow last weekend may help solve one of the trickiest problems in climate policy: how to boost confidence in the voluntary market for carbon credits.  
Such credits, or offsets, allow companies to pollute at home in exchange for investing in greener projects elsewhere. Voluntary markets are currently something of a Wild West, with no unified standards or governance -- and experts say at least some of the credits they generate do little or nothing to curb climate change. 
“The voluntary market is really booming, but at the same time you have this integrity problem,” said Lambert Schneider, research coordinator on international carbon policy at the Oeko-Institut think tank in Germany. Although the COP26 agreement doesn’t directly affect voluntary markets, its rules may “spill over into the system, setting the bar higher.”
In Glasgow, after a six-year deadlock, negotiators agreed rules on international emissions trading and established a UN-controlled marketplace. The new offset program will run in parallel to the existing voluntary markets. 
Soaring Demand
Demand for offsets is soaring. More credits were traded in the first eight months of this year than in all of 2020, according to BloombergNEF, as companies and governments spend billions of dollars to meet net-zero emissions targets and burnish their green credentials. 
The offset market could be worth $100 billion by the end of the decade, up from about $300 million in 2018, according to projections by Mark Carney, a former Bank of England governor, and Bill Winters, the chief executive of Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc. The two financial veterans last year created a task force including hundreds of business leaders, bankers, scientists and others to set up unified rules for voluntary markets.
But there are concerns. With little oversight in voluntary markets, there is room for abuse. Low-quality offsets, or emissions reductions counted twice, do little for the planet -- and can even hinder the fight against climate change.
“The voluntary carbon market has a quality problem on the supply side,” said Schneider, who is also a co-chair of the expert panel on the task force. “There are some good projects, but there are also some projects that do not deliver actual emissions reductions.” He said there should also be “more transparency” surrounding demand for offsets. 
‘Powerful Boost’
The COP26 deal on carbon markets last weekend was a “powerful boost” in confidence for private investors, according to the International Emissions Trading Association. The challenge now is in the interpretation of the agreement and what it could mean for voluntary carbon markets. 
For example, the Glasgow decision allows -- but does not oblige -- countries that host offset-generating projects to authorize credits for use toward climate targets abroad. Such authorization would ensure that the same emissions-reduction unit won’t be claimed twice: by the nation where the offsets were generated and by the company that bought them. 
Credits that will be used for international programs, such as the offsetting system for airlines, will need authorization. Such a procedure isn’t currently required in voluntary markets.
Andrea Bonzanni, IETA’s international policy director, believes it will still be possible for a company to issue credits claiming emission cuts without authorization. Yet buyers may prefer authorized credits, which then can be used toward climate pledges.
“There are different views on where the market will head to, and this is normal,” Bonzanni said. The Glasgow deal “is a starting point for the private sector to keep delivering high-quality credits and functioning market.”  
In the coming years, the UN credits could become a kind of global benchmark, with other voluntary carbon credit prices trading in relation, according to Henrik Hasselknippe, who’s in charge of carbon exchanges at Xpansiv, where more than 100 million metric tons of the credits have traded this year. 
“Markets can handle multiple standards,” Hasselknippe said. “That’s something that we see in many markets.”

BRUSSELS/WARSAW (Reuters) - Polish security forces fired water cannon at rock-throwing migrants on the border with Belarus on Tuesday, and NATO reiterated its support for Warsaw in a crisis that has left thousands stranded on the frontier in icy temperatures. 
Video footage released by Polish authorities showed migrants also throwing bottles and logs across a barbed-wire border fence, and using sticks to try to break through.
Seven police were hurt in the violence, the latest in a crisis the European Union says is orchestrated by Belarus - an ally of Russia - in retaliation for EU sanctions imposed over a crackdown on political protests, a charge that Minsk denies.
Up to 4,000 migrants, mostly from Iraq and Afghanistan, are now waiting in freezing forests on what is not only Poland's frontier but is also the external border of the EU and NATO, the Western military alliance.
""We are deeply concerned about the way the (Belarusian leader Alexander) Lukashenko regime is using vulnerable migrants as a hybrid tactic against other countries,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told alliance defence ministers meeting in Brussels. ""We stand in solidarity with Poland and all the allies affected."" 
Lithuania and Latvia, which like Poland are members of NATO and the EU, have also reported a sharp increase in attempts to cross from Belarus since summer.
At least eight migrants have died at the border during the crisis. One, a 19-year-old Syrian man, was buried on Tuesday in the northeastern Polish village of Bohoniki.
A nine-year old Kurdish boy who has had both legs amputated was among those stuck between the lakes, swamps and forests at the frontier after Poland refused to let them in and Belarusian forces prevented them heading back.
'ENORMOUS SUFFERING'
""We can see enormous suffering of people who are left in limbo,"" said Dunja Mijatovic, human rights commissioner for the Council of Europe, a European rights watchdog that is larger than the EU and also counts Russia among its members.
After visiting a migrants' aid centre in a Polish town nearby the border, she said: ""We need to find a way to de-escalate, to make sure that the focus is on stopping the suffering.""
Relations between Belarus and the EU worsened after a contested presidential election last year in which Lukashenko, who has held power since 1994, claimed victory. That triggered mass street protests and, in turn, a police crackdown.
The EU agreed on Monday to impose more sanctions on Belarus to target airlines, travel agencies and individuals involved in pushing migrants towards the border.
The EU and NATO have asked Russia, Lukashenko's most important ally, to make him end the crisis. The West has also warned the Kremlin over what NATO says is a Russian military buildup on the border with neighbouring Ukraine. 
In Brussels, French Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly said Europe was keeping a close eye on both the Belarus-Polish border and Russia's activity near Ukraine.
""It is an unsupportable instrumentalisation (of migrants),"" she said. 
Italian Defence Minister Lorenzo Guerini said the West was acting together to ""firmly condemn the Belarusian regime.""
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Lukashenko discussed the matter on Tuesday, Russian state news agency TASS quoted the Kremlin as saying. 

Belarusian state news agency BELTA said border guards had started moving migrants who gathered at a closed crossing point to a reception centre further away from the frontier. 
Moscow has dismissed a U.S. State Department comment that the crisis was meant to distract attention from Ukraine, from which Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Russia has also backed separatists fighting government troops in eastern Ukraine.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in Manhattan on Tuesday began questioning potential jurors for the sex abuse trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, asking individuals about topics ranging from their opinions of people with luxurious lifestyles to what television shows they watch.
Prosecutors have said that Maxwell 59, recruited and groomed underage girls for deceased financier Jeffrey Epstein to abuse. She has pleaded not guilty to six counts of sex trafficking and other crimes. Her lawyers have said extensive media coverage of her July 2020 arrest has tainted the jury pool.
U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan plans to question 23 potential jurors about what they have previously heard about Epstein and Maxwell, as well as about their own experiences with sexual assault and abuse.
""It would be hard to not have heard something about the case,"" one potential juror said during questioning by Nathan, a process known as voir dire. 
The individual, a female 69-year-old Manhattan resident, added that although she had heard of Maxwell and Epstein and had experienced sexual harassment in the past, she believed she would not be biased one way or the other. 
""As a woman today, if you ask me if I have in my lifetime, if I have experienced, shall we say, sexual harassment ... as we understand it today, I would have to say 'yes,'"" she said.
The potential jurors' names are being withheld from the public. Voir dire is expected to conclude on Friday.

While some individuals interviewed in the first day of questioning said they had not heard of Maxwell, most had heard of Epstein, a wealthy U.S. investor who counted elite politicians and businesspeople among his associates. 
Epstein died by suicide in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting his own trial on sex crimes charges in 2019 at the age of 66.

BALTIMORE, Md. (Reuters) -An advisory group to U.S. bishops urged the Catholic leaders on Tuesday to avoid making communion ""a tool for division"" amid debate over whether President Joe Biden's support for abortion rights should disqualify him from receiving the sacrament.
Gathered in a Baltimore hotel ballroom, the bishops' conference on Tuesday was presented with a draft of a document about the meaning of Holy Communion, a sacrament central to the faith. 
The bishops have been divided over how explicitly the document should define the eligibility of prominent Catholics like Biden to receive communion due to political stances that contradict church interpretation.
Biden, the first Catholic U.S. president since John F. Kennedy, has said he personally opposes abortion but supports a woman's right to choose. He has vowed to protect abortion rights in the face of increasingly restrictive laws enacted by states. Last month, his administration called on the Supreme Court to block a Texas law that bans abortions after six weeks.
The bishops are expected to debate the communion document and take a vote on Wednesday. The document needs a ""yes"" vote from two-thirds of the conference to pass.
The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' National Advisory Council, a body made up of laypeople and clergy, reviewed the document draft. The council holds the position that the Eucharist should not be politicized, council chair Mark Sadd told the bishops on Tuesday.
""We are united in our conviction that the Eucharist cannot be a tool for division, the Eucharist cannot be ideological, the Eucharist cannot be partisan,"" Sadd said.
The conference has not made the draft document public. A version of the draft published by the Catholic newsletter The Pillar https://www.pillarcatholic.com/p/usccb-eucharist-draft-document-focuses does not mention Biden or any politician by name, but states that ""people who exercise some form of public authority have a special responsibility to embody the church."" It says Catholics who live in a state of ""mortal sin"" without repentance should not receive communion, but does not say who should sit in judgment.
""It was never the intention to target any individual or group of individuals,"" Bishop Michael Burbidge of Arlington, Virginia told reporters on Tuesday. ""This is a document that is reaching out to all Catholics.""
Archbishop Jose Gomez, the conference president, said he felt the document was ""absolutely necessary"" and intended ""to educate Catholics about the real presence of Jesus in the Eucharist.""
Some conservative bishops have argued the conference must rebuke politicians such as Biden who support abortion rights, given the church teaches that abortion is immoral. That contingent has called for the document to set explicit standards of eligibility for receiving the sacrament.
Others have cautioned against weaponizing the Eucharist and withholding it as a means of punishing specific political stances. 
Some 55% of U.S. Catholics believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, compared to 59% of the general population, according to a Pew Research survey https://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion conducted in April.

Sadd told bishops that some members of the advisory council expressed doubt that the document would serve to heal existing rifts in the church.
Nearly 20% of U.S. Catholics have left the church in the past two decades, according to a Gallup poll in March, as sexual abuse scandals involving predatory priests have emerged and members disagreed on social issues.

(Reuters) -A judicial panel on Tuesday consolidated 34 lawsuits challenging the Biden administration's workplace COVID-19 vaccine rule in the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a venue favored by opponents of the rule. 
President Joe Biden announced plans for the vaccine requirement in September, seeking to stem a surge in COVID-19 cases and get more people back to work. 
The Cincinnati appeals court was chosen randomly and will take up the challenges to the rule, which compels employers with at least 100 workers to mandate COVID-19 vaccination or weekly testing combined with face masks at work.
The court, which has 10 Republican-appointed judges and five appointed by Democratic presidents, was the venue where Kentucky, a conservative media company and religious groups filed their challenges.
The rule was issued as an emergency temporary standard by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which said it will prevent 250,000 hospitalizations. The rule set a Jan. 4 deadline for compliance.
In court, the administration must show that a ""grave danger"" required an emergency standard, which allows the agency to bypass a years-long rulemaking process.
OSHA has issued 10 emergency standards in its 50-year history, and of six challenged in court, only one survived intact. 
Vaccine mandates are deeply controversial in the United States. Supporters say they are helping to end the nearly two-year coronavirus pandemic, while opponents argue they violate the U.S. Constitution and curb individual liberty. 
On Friday, a three-judge panel on the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans blocked the rule, calling it a ""one-size-fits-all sledgehammer.""

The court noted nearly 80% of working-age Americans are vaccinated and many workers such as truckers are at little risk of exposure.
The Biden administration is expected to ask the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals to revisit that ruling. Legal experts expect the challenges to reach the U.S. Supreme Court.

(Reuters) - The prosecution rested its case on Tuesday against the three white men charged with murdering Ahmaud Arbery after presenting evidence it said showed the defendants wrongly assumed the worst about a Black man jogging in a mostly white southern Georgia neighborhood.
Over eight days, prosecutors from the Cobb County district attorney's office repeatedly played a cellphone video made by one of the defendants, which shows another defendant, Travis McMichael, firing a shotgun three times at Arbery, 25, at close range.
McMichael, 35, and his 65-year-old father, Gregory McMichael, told investigators they grabbed their guns and jumped in their pickup truck after Arbery ran past their driveway on the afternoon of Feb. 23, 2020, believing he could be the same Black man seen walking around a nearby construction site.
Bryan, 52, got in his own pickup truck after the chase passed by his driveway. He later told investigators he tried to use the truck to block Arbery's path down a road in Satilla Shores, a leafy residential area outside the small coastal city of Brunswick (NYSE:BC), before videoing Arbery's final moments.
Defense lawyers, who are due to present their own cases to the jury in the coming days, are arguing that the chasing of Arbery was justified under Georgia's 19th-century citizen's arrest law that was repealed after an outcry over the killing.
At the end of the chase Arbery ran toward the younger McMichael, reaching toward the gun, and defense lawyers say McMichael fired in self-defense. 
Prosecutors sought to rebut arguments that the defendants were attempting a valid citizen's arrest, which required that someone have ""reasonable and probable"" suspicion that a person is fleeing a serious crime they committed.
They showed the jury multiple security-camera videos of Arbery walking around a half-built house on an unoccupied, unfenced property near the McMichaels' house. 
They also showed police body-worn camera video of a police officer telling the McMichaels that no one knew who the young Black man walking around the property was, but that nothing was ever taken on the days he was seen there. 
And they had the defendants' own words to investigators read aloud in court, in which they said they did not see Arbery before he ran past their driveways and did not know what he had been doing before.
McMichael also said he shouted out a graphic threat mid-chase that he would shoot Arbery's head off if he did not stop. 
The trial began on Oct. 18 in Glynn County Superior Court with nearly three weeks of jury selection, resulting in a jury that prosecutors complained was disproportionately white.
Defense lawyers struck all but one Black person from the jury panel, drawn from a county where about a quarter of residents are Black, but told the court the strikes were for reasons that had nothing to do with race.
Prosecutors called more than a dozen witnesses, most of them county police or state investigators, several of whom read aloud from transcripts of their interviews with the defendants.

""He was trapped like a rat,"" the elder McMichael told a Glynn County detective a few hours after the deadly pursuit of Arbery. ""I think he was wanting to flee and he realized that, you know, he was not going to get away.""
Jurors were also shown graphic video and photographs of two gaping shotgun wounds in Arbery's chest.

KAMPALA (Reuters) -Islamic State claimed an attack in the heart of Uganda's capital on Tuesday after three suicide bombers killed three people and sent members of parliament running for cover, in the latest in a wave of bombings. 
The blasts in Kampala, which forced the evacuation of parliament, shocked a nation known as a bulwark against violent Islamist militants in East Africa, and whose leader has spent years cultivating Western security support.
Islamic State claimed responsibility via the group's Amaq News Agency on an affiliated Telegram account. The nicknames of the three attackers indicated all were Ugandan. 
The death toll including the three bombers was six, police spokesperson Fred Enanga said, including police officers. A diplomat told Reuters two police officers were killed. 
Enanga said 33 people were being treated in hospital, including five in critical condition. 
Police said intelligence indicated the Islamic State-aligned Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) were responsible. 
""Our intelligence...indicates that these are domestic terror groups that are linked to ADF,"" Enanga said. 
The explosions three minutes apart - the first near the central police station and two very close to parliament - sent MPs and office workers rushing for cover over shards of broken glass as a plume of white smoke rose above downtown. 
A suicide bomber wearing a backpack detonated near the checkpoint at the police station, killing two, Enanga said. The second attack, involving two suicide bombers on motorbikes, killed one person.
""A booming sound like that from a big gun went off. The ground shook, my ears nearly went deaf,"" said Peter Olupot, a 28-year-old bank guard close to parliament. ""I saw a vehicle on fire and everyone was running and panicking. I saw a boda boda (motorcycle) man - his head was smashed.""
Anti-terrorism police caught another potential suicide bomber and found a device at his home, Enanga said.
MILITANT GROUPS
The ADF was founded by Ugandan Muslims but is now based in the forested mountains of the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, where it has been blamed for thousands of civilian deaths. 
Last month, Islamic State claimed its first blast in Uganda - an attack on a police station in Kampala which killed no one. 
Days later, it said a ""security detachment"" in ""Central Africa Province"" bombed a restaurant. Police said the device killed a waitress and wounded three others, and linked it to the ADF, which has pledged allegiance to Islamic State.
Also last month, Ugandan police said a suicide bomber had blown up a bus, killing only himself. His affiliation was unclear. 
Dino Mahtani of the International Crisis Group think tank said the ADF's focus had shifted from settling local scores and controlling local war economies. 
""With the more recent affiliation of its main faction to ISIS (Islamic State), a number of foreigners from across East Africa with more globalist jihadist agendas have been arriving into its camps,"" he said. 
Laren Poole from the U.S.-based Bridgeway Foundation said the Uganda bombings and a recent attempt in neighbouring Rwanda, which police announced on Oct. 1, appeared to be linked to a Ugandan bombmaker active in eastern Congo called Meddie Nkalubo, nicknamed ""Punisher"". 

The group begin training fighters to use suicide vests in March, he said, and since then have hatched increasingly sophisticated plots. Initial physical evidence linked Tuesday's Kampala attack to the ADF, he said - probably an attempt to showcase its strength to attract volunteers. 
Islamic State is heavily promoting actions in what it calls ""Central Africa Province"", he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -In-person jury selection began on Tuesday in the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite accused of grooming underage girls for the late financier Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse.
Here's an explanation of how the process will work: 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED SO FAR?
Between Nov. 4 and Nov. 12, more than 600 prospective jurors filled out questionnaires asking what they had heard about Maxwell and Epstein, as well as their own experiences with sexual abuse or assault.
WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS? 
Of that initial pool, U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan plans to question 231 individuals in person, a process known as voir dire. 
Nathan on Tuesday began asking whether potential jurors know any of the Maxwell accusers who will be testifying at the trial, and if they have opinions about people with ""luxurious lifestyles"" that would prevent them from being impartial. 
Due to the personal nature of many of the questions, prospective jurors are appearing individually before Nathan and lawyers for both sides.
Nathan will dismiss indivuals whose answers indicate they could be biased, known as a strike for cause. Prosecutors and defense attorneys will be able to object to those rulings and propose follow-up questions. Nathan has also excused prospective jurors with travel plans that could interfere with the trial. 
Nathan has said she hopes to have a pool of 50 to 60 qualified jurors by the time voir dire is complete on Nov. 19. Attorneys for both sides will then select dozens of jurors to be removed from the pool without specifying a reason - known as a peremptory strike. 
Opening statements are scheduled for Nov. 29. The trial is expected to last six weeks.
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL SERVE ON THE JURY?
The Manhattan federal court jury will consist of 12 jurors and six alternates. 
WHO WILL BE ON THE JURY?

The identities of the jurors will not be made public because of the sensitive nature of the case and the personal questions they will be asked during jury selection. 
The jury pool is drawn from Manhattan and the Bronx, as well as some of New York City's northern suburbs.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City's Times Square will once again fill with revelers ringing in the new year on Dec. 31, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Tuesday, but only if they are fully vaccinated against COVID-19. 
Last year, the still-raging coronavirus pandemic allowed only a handful of invited guests, including essential workers, to witness in person the dropping of the iconic New Year’s Eve ball, signaling the start of the new year. 
""We can finally get back together again,"" de Blasio told reporters, touting New York City's recovery after more than a year of pandemic hardship. ""It's going to be amazing, it's going to be a joy for this city.""
Visitors to the area will be asked to provide proof of vaccination and a valid photo ID, de Blasio said. Security checkpoints will be in place to check documentation of those seeking to enter Times Square for the festivities.
""We will require spectators five and older who are eligible to be fully vaccinated,"" said Tom Harris, president of the Times Square Alliance. ""If you are unable to get vaccinated because of a disability, we will require a proof of a negative PCR test within 72 hours.""

Masks will be required for those unable to get vaccinated, he added. 
Earlier this month, U.S. health authorities authorized the COVID-19 vaccine from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech for children aged 5 to 11.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Polish security forces turned water cannon on migrants who threw rocks across the Belarusian border, where thousands have gathered in a chaotic attempt to reach the European Union, video footage shared by authorities showed on Tuesday.
The crisis has led the EU to prepare further sanctions against Belarus, which it accuses of attempting to destabilise the bloc by pushing migrants across the border illegally.
Footage shared by a Polish government spokesperson and the Ministry of Defence showed a further escalation of the crisis at the border, where migrants have assembled in growing numbers on the Belarusian side in the last week. 
""Attention, attention, if you don't follow orders, force will be used against you,"" said a loudspeaker message directed at migrants throwing objects, according to the images that were shown on public broadcaster TVP.
Migrants threw bottles and wooden logs at Polish soldiers, and used sticks to try to break through the fence, the video showed. 
The Interior Ministry said a policeman was seriously injured by an object thrown across the border and was in hospital with a suspected fractured skull.
The Polish defence ministry said in a tweet that Belarusian authorities had given migrants sound grenades to throw at Polish soldiers and border guards. 
The EU says Belarus is encouraging migrants to cross the border in revenge for earlier sanctions over a crackdown on protests last year against President Alexander Lukashenko's contested re-election.
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said he was deeply concerned about how Belarus was putting the lives of vulnerable migrants at risk.
Belarus, a close Russian ally, said assertions it had fuelled the border crisis were ""absurd"". Lukashenko had a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday to discuss the crisis, Belarusian news agency BELTA reported.
Polish authorities said they were informed about a phone call on Monday between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Lukashenko, when they discussed aid to migrants on the Poland-Belarus border.
PESSIMISTIC OUTCOMES
Poland's government spokesperson said the government was discussing whether to launch formal consultations on the crisis with NATO allies. 
""We are preparing for a pessimistic outcome - that this conflict could stretch out for months,"" spokesperson Piotr Muller told a news conference. 
According to Polish authorities, more than 20,000 members of the police, border guard and army are reinforcing the border where migrants have gathered near the Polish town of Kuznica.
An estimated 4,000 migrants are at the border and many say Belarusian authorities are not allowing them to return to Minsk. 
Poland's ruling party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski said his country was facing a hybrid war.
""We have a hybrid war, but an actual war, with arms, is not on our horizon. We are facing an unpredictable enemy,"" Kaczynski told Polish public radio. 
Iraq meanwhile scheduled an evacuation flight from Minsk on Thursday. So far about 150 to 200 Iraqis already in Minsk have registered to fly home. 
Other Iraqis at the border have struggled to register. ""We are working on this with the Belarusian authorities,"" said Iraq's consul for Russia and Belarus, Majid al-Kinani.

""The number is fluctuating, because people are stuck on the Belarusian border with Poland or Lithuania and so far they have not been authorised to go back to Minsk by the Belarusian authorities,"" the consul said.
In Lithuania, authorities said they had detained 47 people who had tried to approach the border.

(Reuters) - Journalist Danny Fenster had an emotional reunion with his family on his return to the United States on Tuesday after more than five months in a Myanmar prison cell, and he pledged to keep working for others still detained in the country.
Fenster, 37, still wearing a red wool hat he said was given to him by a fellow inmate, said at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport that he felt ""incredible"" after being freed on Monday despite an 11-year prison sentence handed down just three days earlier. 
""It's about this right here,"" he said as he hugged and posed with his family including father Buddy, mother Rose, and brother Bryan, who hail from a suburb of Detroit. 
Fenster was accompanied by former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, who flew to Myanmar on Monday to collect Fenster after talks over humanitarian aid and COVID-19 vaccines with junta chief Min Aung Hlaing, which Richardson said helped secure Fenster's release.
At a news conference, Fenster thanked those who campaigned for his release, and said he wanted to keep the spotlight on those still in detention in Myanmar, including at least 47 other journalists, according to the United Nations.
""I'm going to take time to celebrate and to spend time with my family and then, you know, continue concentrating on all the other... journalists and prisoners of conscience,"" Fenster said.
The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a rights group, says 10,143 people have been arrested since the Feb. 1 coup in Myanmar, including many ordinary Burmese who have joined protests against the military.
""This will be a short little celebration but, you know, let's keep focused on what the actual story is here,"" Fenster added.
Fenster, in high spirits, said he kept positive in Yangon's notorious Insein Prison by reading and by jogging in a small circle in a prison courtyard. He joked that he had yet to speak to his employer, the magazine Frontier Myanmar, to check if he still worked there.
Richardson, who traveled to Myanmar as a private citizen, said he met four times with the junta chief and made progress on getting humanitarian aid and vaccines into Myanmar, where the coup derailed plans for COVID-19 vaccine deliveries.
""I think those discussions led to a little bit of understanding on the case of Danny,"" Richardson said.
The trips drew criticism that the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations was giving legitimacy to the junta, which opponents say is not the legitimate government of Myanmar.
""You know what... (Myanmar) government officials asked me for in exchange for Danny? Nothing. They didn't ask me for anything. I couldn't deliver anything anyway,"" he said, turning to Fenster sitting beside him: ""But here he is.""

Since seizing power from an elected government, Myanmar's ruling generals have arrested leading politicians and cracked down on protests and dissent. About 1,260 people have been killed in violence, most shot by security forces.
The junta said it acted because its complaints of fraud by Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party, which won an election last year in a landslide, were being ignored by the election commission. The NLD says it won fairly, and the coup and the crackdown have drawn widespread international condemnation.

DOHA (Reuters) -American journalist Danny Fenster said he was healthy and happy to be going home after he was freed from prison in Myanmar and flew to Qatar on Monday, following negotiations between former U.S. diplomat Bill Richardson and the ruling military junta. 
Fenster, 37, the managing editor https://www.reuters.com/world/five-facts-about-danny-fenster-us-journalist-jailed-myanmar-2021-11-12 of independent online magazine Frontier Myanmar, looked frail three days after he was sentenced to 11 years https://reut.rs/3HqVKmY in prison for incitement and violations of laws on immigration and unlawful assembly. He had been detained since May.
He told reporters on the tarmac at Hamad International Airport in Doha that he felt well and had not been beaten or starved while in captivity.
""I feel great and am really happy to be on my way home. I'm incredibly happy for everything Bill has done,"" Fenster, wearing a red woollen hat, loose-fitting trousers and a white COVID-19 mask, said after flying to Doha with Richardson by jet.
""You just go a little stir crazy and the longer it drags on the more worried you are that it's just never going to end. That was the biggest concern, staying sane through that.""
Asked if he was mistreated, he said: ""I was arrested and held in captivity for no reason, so I suppose so. But physically, I was healthy. I wasn't starved or beaten.""
Myanmar's military-owned Myawaddy TV said Fenster had been granted an amnesty following requests from Richardson and two Japanese representatives ""to maintain the friendship between the countries and to emphasize humanitarian grounds"".
Fenster was among dozens of media workers detained in Myanmar since a Feb. 1 coup that led to an outpouring of public anger over the military's abrupt end to a decade of tentative steps towards democracy. Myanmar's military has accused many media outlets of incitement and spreading false information.
A source familiar with Richardson's trip to pick up Fenster said it was arranged without the knowledge of the State Department or the U.S. embassy in Yangon. Officials had initially opposed Richardson's visit to Myanmar earlier this month and urged him not to raise the case with Myanmar officials, the source said.
Before his release, some State Department officials were concerned that Richardson's involvement could delay his release by leading the junta to see the American as an asset to try to extract concessions.
U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Monday that the former governor ""was not acting at the direction of the U.S. government"" in Myanmar but officials had been in regular contact with Richardson and his team.
U.S. officials including Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens also worked on getting the journalist released, Price said.
CRACKDOWN
The United Nations hailed Fenster's release as a ""positive step"" but called for at least 47 other journalists in detention to be freed immediately, U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said in New York.
Fenster said efforts to secure other journalists' release would continue. 
""We're going to keep the focus on them as much as possible and do everything we can to lobby on their behalf. We're still trying really hard to get them out of there,"" he said.
According to rights group Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, 10,143 people have been arrested since the coup and 1,260 people killed in violence in Myanmar, most of them in a crackdown by security forces on protests and dissent. 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken commended U.S. officials as well as Richardson. Blinken said Washington would ""continue to call for the release of others who remain unjustly imprisoned.""
Fenster's editor-in-chief, Thomas Kean, expressed relief that he had been freed, and said he was one of many journalists ""unjustly arrested simply for doing their job"" in Myanmar.
Fenster's brother, Bryan, said the family was overjoyed.
""We cannot wait to hold him in our arms. We are tremendously grateful to all the people who have helped secure his release,"" he said. 
Fenster was the first Western journalist in years sentenced to prison in Myanmar, where the coup against the elected government of Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has left the country in chaos. 

Richardson, a former New Mexico governor, U.S. energy secretary and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, visited Myanmar in a humanitarian capacity https://reut.rs/3njmeix on Nov. 2, offering COVID-19 assistance. 
He is one of only a few foreigners to have met junta leader Min Aung Hlaing in Myanmar since the coup, and said his discussions with the government on humanitarian matters and vaccines had helped secure Fenster's release.

NORTE DE SANTANDER, Colombia (Reuters) - Camouflaged Colombian troops with guns and anti-COVID masks creep through dense vegetation in suffocating heat, ready for their many enemies crisscrossing the Venezuelan border.
The soldiers are part of a 14,000-strong military unit created last month to stem rising bloodshed in the northeastern province of Norte de Santander (MC:SAN): Colombia's new epicenter of conflict, fueled by rising cocaine production.
""Any of the illegal armed groups in this area involved in drug trafficking could attack us,"" said their sergeant, a 20-year army veteran, speaking under the shade of a tree near a river dividing Colombia and Venezuela. 
Vulnerable to mines, snipers and ambushes, 16 soldiers have died this year in around 30 attacks in Norte de Santander.
Nineteen members of illegal armed groups have also died and dozens of soldiers, rebels and gang members been injured, according to Defense Ministry figures. 
The military surge and sacrifice may not be the right tactic though: eradication of coca leaves, the raw ingredient for cocaine, is actually falling amid resistance from locals who say they have few other viable options to live off.
Furthermore, Colombia's army has a checkered history, at times committing rights abuses while opposing rebels, traffickers and criminal gangs for more than half a century.
President Ivan Duque's government is furious with Venezuela, accusing President Nicolas Maduro's administration of providing a safe haven for gangs over the border and conniving in drugs shipments to the United States and Europe for a cut of profits.
Venezuela's collapsed economy and rampant crime also fan the border violence, Colombian officials say. Reuters showed in a recent investigation how the rebel National Liberation Army (ELN) functions as a de facto local government and leading employer in some Venezuelan towns. 
Caracas vigorously denies responsibility, saying Colombia's right-wing ""oligarchy"" fails to curtail armed groups in a deliberate strategy to destabilize leftist-ruled Venezuela.
'CONFLUENCE OF INSTABILITY'
Colombia hopes the troop buildup in Norte de Santander will provide a roadmap for pacifying other parts of a nation whose long civil war has now fractured into local battles against transnational insurgents and criminals. 
""In Norte de Santander, there's a confluence of various factors of instability,"" General Luis Fernando Navarro, head of the armed forces, told Reuters in his Bogota office.
A porous frontier and weak law enforcement in Venezuela allow guerrillas from the ELN and dissident Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels - who reject a 2016 peace agreement - to strike and then flee across the border, he added.
About half the ELN fighters and 30% of the FARC dissidents operate from there, protected from bombing raids, Navarro said. 
On the Colombian side, groups fight each other for control of rising coca production. One area, Catatumbo, now has capacity to produce 312 tonnes of cocaine per year, a quarter of Colombia's output, according to U.N. data. 
Murders in Norte de Santander rose to 576 last year, compared with 539 in 2019. Through September 2021, 436 people have been slain, according to the defense ministry.
Twenty-two human rights activists have been assassinated since the beginning of 2020, while fighting has displaced some 6,500 people, according to activist groups.
""What's behind this overflow of violence is this whole criminal dynamic,"" said Wilfredo Canizares, director of human rights group Fundacion Progresar.
In two brazen attacks in June, former rebels bombed a military barracks in regional capital Cucuta and a sniper tried to shoot down a helicopter carrying Duque and other officials. 
A FARC dissident commander took responsibility for the attacks, saying they targeted the U.S. presence.
MILITARIZING ALONE 'A FAILURE'
The recent capture of ""Otoniel"", leader of a major gang called the ""Gulf Clan"", may not stem violence by his group, which police say has alliances with criminals in more than two dozen countries. The arrest might even increase fighting, regional analysts say, as the gang retaliates against security forces or members fight for power among themselves.
Security consultant John Marulanda, a retired army colonel, said groups attack high-profile targets to draw authorities away from drug production zones and the routes to clandestine airstrips in Venezuela.
The military's new Specific Command for Norte de Santander (CENOR) will bring together four previously separate units, which the army says will allow better, faster coordination of logistics and intelligence with more patrols, offensive operations and air support. 
The military says increased troops - with on-the-ground U.S. military advisors - will go hand-in-hand with investments in roads, schools and other programs.
But there are detractors.
Activists say boots on the ground mean little without anti-poverty measures and more support for voluntary substitution of coca crops. ""It's proven it's a failure to insist on militarizing territory as the only answer,"" said Fundacion Progresar's Canizares.
It is indefensible that murders, mass killings, displacements and drug trafficking continue despite a large, long-term military presence in the province, he added.
Farmers outside the municipality of Tibu, home to Colombia's largest coca plantations, recently held 180 soldiers on an eradication mission hostage for several hours in protest at removal of a crop that is one of few ways to make ends meet.
And eradication efforts overall in Norte de Santander are floundering, falling to about 30 square km so far this year, from 95 in 2020, largely due to opposition from locals.
Figures from the military and defense ministry also show the number of clandestine labs - usually deep in the jungle - destroyed in the first nine months of 2021 was 458, compared to 694 in 2020. 
Seizures of cocaine in Norte del Santander in 2021 - 24.8 tonnes - have outpaced 16.6 in 2020 and 22.4 in 2019. But the increase is partly due to more production, officials said, as well as improved U.S. satellite data.

As locals clamor for land titles, loans for crop-switching and more public works, authorities insist the security strategy will be backed by social investment.
For example, provincial governor Silvano Serrano, with help from the national government, is spending $8 million on a program to encourage cacao production. It will give farmers seeds, technical assistance and guaranteed, fixed-price sales.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -An anti-satellite missile test Russia conducted on Monday generated a debris field in low-Earth orbit that endangered the International Space Station and will pose a hazard to space activities for years, U.S. officials said. 
The seven-member space station crew - four U.S. astronauts, a German astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts - were directed to take shelter in their docked spaceship capsules for two hours after the test as a precaution to allow for a quick getaway had it been necessary, NASA said.
The research lab, orbiting about 250 miles (402 km) above Earth, continued to pass through or near the debris cluster every 90 minutes, but NASA specialists determined it was safe for the crew to return to the station's interior after the third pass, the agency said.
The crew was also ordered to seal off hatches to several modules of the International Space Station (ISS) for the time being, according to NASA.
""NASA will continue monitoring the debris in the coming days and beyond to ensure the safety of our crew in orbit,"" NASA chief Bill Nelson said in the statement.
Experts say the testing of weapons that shatter satellites in orbit pose a space hazard by creating clouds of fragments that can collide with other objects, setting off a chain reaction of projectiles through Earth orbit.
THOUSANDS OF FRAGMENTS
The Russian military and ministry of defense were not immediately available for comment. A message posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) by the Russian space agency Roscosmos downplayed the danger.
""The orbit of the object, which forced the crew today to move into spacecraft according to standard procedures, has moved away from the ISS orbit,"" Roscosmos tweeted. ""The station is in the green zone.""
The direct-ascent anti-satellite missile fired by Russia into one of its own satellites generated more than 1,500 pieces of ""trackable orbital debris"" and would likely spawn hundreds of thousands of smaller fragments, the U.S. Space Command said in a statement.
""Russia has demonstrated a deliberate disregard for the security, safety, stability and long-term sustainability of the space domain for all nations,"" space command chief U.S. Army General James Dickinson said.
The debris from the missile test ""will continue to pose a threat to activities in outer space for years to come, putting satellites and space missions at risk, as well as forcing more collision avoidance maneuvers,"" he said.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned the missile test as ""reckless and irresponsible."" At the Pentagon, spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said the test showed the need to firmly establish norms of behavior in space.
""It is unthinkable that Russia would endanger not only the American and international partner astronauts on the ISS, but also their own cosmonauts,"" Nelson said. He said the cloud of debris also posed a threat to a separate Chinese space station under construction and the three-member crew of ""taikonauts"" aboard that outpost.
The incident came just four days after the latest group of four space station astronauts - Americans Raja Chair, Tom Marshburn and Kayla Barron of NASA and European Space Agency crewmate Matthias Maurer of Germany - arrived at the orbiting platform to begin a six-month science mission.
They were welcomed by three space station crew members already on board - U.S. astronaut Mark Vande Hei and Russian cosmonauts Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov.
""Thanks for the crazy but well-coordinated day. We really appreciated all the situational awareness you gave us,"" Vande Hei said in a Monday radio transmission to NASA posted online by Space.com. ""It was certainly a great way to bond as a crew, starting off our very first workday in space.""
The space station, spanning the size of an American football field end to end, has been continuously occupied since November 2000, operated by an international partnership of five space agencies from 15 countries, including Russia's Roscosmos.
Russia is not the first country to conduct anti-satellite tests in space. The United States performed the first in 1959, when satellites were rare and new.
In April Russia carried out another test of an anti-satellite missile as officials have said that space will increasingly become an important domain for warfare.

In 2019, India shot down one of its own satellites in low-Earth orbit with a ground-to-space missile. 
These tests have raised questions about the long-term sustainability of space operations essential to a huge range of commercial activities, from telecommunications and weather forecasting to banking and GPS services.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is considering a joint military force of up to 5,000 troops by 2025 to intervene in a range of crises and without relying on the United States, according to a draft plan.
The ""EU Rapid Deployment Capacity"" should be made up of land, sea and air components that could be swapped in and out of any standing force, depending on the crisis, according to the confidential 28-page document dated Nov. 9 and seen by Reuters. 
EU foreign and defence ministers began debating the plan on Monday evening in Brussels and continued on Tuesday, aiming to settle on a final document by March next year.
Italy and France, two of the EU's military powers, welcomed the draft. The view of Germany's incoming federal coalition government, expected soon, will prove critical.
""The document combines a high level of ambition but also makes concrete and operational proposals. It's a good balance,"" French Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly told reporters. Her Italian counterpart, Lorenzo Guerini, said it would also be complementary to NATO and strengthen transatlantic ties. 
Two decades after EU leaders first agreed to set up a 50,000-60,000-strong force but failed to make it operational, the draft strategy by the bloc's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell is the most concrete effort to create a standalone military force that does not rely on U.S. assets.
""We need more rapidity, robustness and flexibility to undertake the full range of military crisis management tasks,"" said the draft, called the ""Strategic Compass"". 
""We need to be able to respond to imminent threats or quickly react to a crisis situation, for example a rescue and evacuation mission or a stabilisation operation in a hostile environment,"" the draft said.
JOINT MILITARY PROJECTS
Not all 27 EU states would need to take part, although approval of any deployment would require consensus.
The Strategic Compass is the closest thing the EU could have to a military doctrine and akin to U.S.-led NATO's ""Strategic Concept"" that sets out alliance goals. Crucially for the EU, Borrell wants EU states to commit to ""providing associated assets and the necessary strategic enablers"".
That means developing the logistics, long-range air transport and command and control capabilities of the United States that European allies in NATO have relied on.
Borrell told reporters there were now 60 joint EU military projects for weapons and other capabilities under development, after 14 more were approved on Tuesday, including one called ""Strategic Air Transport for Outsized Cargo"". 
The United States has urged Europeans to invest in deployable troops and U.S. President Joe Biden has said such moves would be complementary to NATO. The EU has maintained battlegroups of 1,500 troops since 2007 but they have never been used, despite efforts to deploy them in Chad and Libya.

Breaking up the battlegroups into smaller units could make them more flexible and more deployable. 
""The use of modules will give us greater flexibility to tailor our force to the nature of the crisis ... This is key if we want to overcome the obstacles that we have faced in the past,"" the draft strategic plan said.

MANILA (Reuters) - The son of late Philippines strongman Ferdinand Marcos has emerged as the person to beat in the 2022 presidential race, after President Rodrigo Duterte's popular daughter decided not to contest the country's top job. 
Ferdinand Marcos Jr. likely benefited the most from Davao city mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio's move to run for vice president, against the wishes of her supporters, despite leading polls for preferred presidential contenders all throughout the year.
Duterte-Carpio announced on Tuesday she would be Marcos' running mate.
""Without the popular Duterte-Carpio in the presidential race, Marcos is frontrunner, with 60% odds of victory, though there is a long road ahead,"" the Eurasia Group consultancy said in a note to clients late on Monday, after nominations closed. 
While Marcos's candidacy has angered victims of his father's brutal era of martial law, a survey by the Social Weather Station (SWS) in October showed he could easily beat his rivals, including boxing hero Manny Pacquiao.
Of the six key candidates confirmed to run for president at the time the poll was conducted, 47% of the 1,200 surveyed by SWS said they would vote for the 64-year-old Marcos, popularly known as ""Bongbong"" or ""BBM"".
""The only explanation there is he got the pro-Sara voters. There is very close affinity between BBM voters and Sara's voters,"" said political analyst Temario Rivera. 
The election to choose a successor to Duterte will be held in May next year. He himself is not eligible to contest for the presidency again after his single six-year term but will be standing in the election for a senator's seat. 
Marcos is the only son of the late dictator who ruled the Philippines for almost two decades until his 1986 overthrow. He said he wants Duterte-Carpio to be his running mate, but she has yet to accept. 
Marcos's family is among the country's most famous dynasties and despite its fall from grace, has retained far-reaching and powerful connections. 
'STOP-MARCOS CANDIDATE' 
Marcos, the dictator, died in exile in 1989 after fleeing the country following the ""people power"" revolution. Since the family's return, Marcos junior has been elected governor, congressman, and in 2010, as a senator. His sister is a senator and a former governor, and his mother, Imelda Marcos, was elected to Congress for four terms. 
""In a country whereby political memories are quite short and forgiveness is not in short supply, this is definitely working in favour of the Marcoses,"" said Richard Heydarian, an author, columnist and academic who specialises in politics.
Working to his advantage, political analysts also say, is Marcos's strong social media presence aimed at targeting the youth, who make up a third of eligible voters. Many of them were not born when Marcos senior was in power.
Marcos will benefit also from the tie-up with Duterte-Carpio, tapping her family's huge popularity in the south, a region where the Marcos family has struggled to make inroads in national elections. 
The poll results showed the other presidential candidates far adrift, with incumbent Vice President Leni Robredo with 18%, and Manila mayor Francisco Domagoso on 13%, followed by Pacquiao with 9%.
The poll did not include Christopher ""Bong"" Go, President Duterte's closest aide, who only joined the presidential race on Saturday, and analysts say his entry, which is backed by the popular firebrand leader, could dilute some of Marcos's support. 
Marcos is also facing a disqualification case grounded on a two-decade old tax evasion conviction, which Eurasia said the president could ""weaponise if he turns against his ally.""

It was not immediately clear late on Tuesday if Duterte-Carpio's alliance with Marcos had her father's blessing. 
The race could narrow too, if Marcos's rivals unite behind a single ""stop-Marcos"" candidate in the race, Eurasia said.

KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) - Whether Kyle Rittenhouse walks free or goes to prison is now in the hands of a Wisconsin jury. 
A 12-member jury must decide whether the U.S. teen acted in self-defense when he fatally shot two men and wounded a third during protests for racial justice in Kenosha last year. 
Rittenhouse, 18, faces five felony charges with sentences ranging from life in prison to 12-1/2 years behind bars. Two of the charges are punishable by up to 60 years in prison.
The judge dismissed a misdemeanor charge against Rittenhouse for illegally possessing the AR-15-style rifle he used in the shootings. Judge Bruce Schroeder said there were exceptions in the law that appeared to allow for Rittenhouse to possess the semi-automatic rifle.
All five remaining charges carry the aggravating factor of ""use of a dangerous weapon."" The provision can add up to five years to each sentence. 
COUNT 1: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESS HOMICIDE
This felony stems from Rittenhouse fatally shooting Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and carries a sentence of up to 60 years in prison. 
Video at the trial showed Rosenbaum chasing Rittenhouse into a used-car lot as Rittenhouse yelled: ""Friendly, friendly, friendly."" Rittenhouse and a witness testified that Rosenbaum, who was unarmed, tried to grab the teen's rifle. 
The charge requires the jury to find that Rittenhouse caused the death with ""utter disregard for human life.""
COUNTS 2 AND 3: FIRST-DEGREE RECKLESSLY ENDANGERING SAFETY
Prosecutors say that when Rittenhouse shot Rosenbaum, the teenager recklessly endangered the safety of a bystander, Richard McGinnis. McGinnis, chief video director of the Daily Caller, a conservative website, testified that Rosenbaum tried to grab the barrel of Rittenhouse's rifle before the teenager shot Rosenbaum. 
Before Rittenhouse shot Anthony Huber, video shows an unidentified man trying to kick Rittenhouse and the teen firing two shots at him, which appear to miss. Prosecutors also charged Rittenhouse with first-degree recklessly endangering safety for this incident.
The felony carries a fine of up to $25,000 and up to 12-1/2 years in prison.
COUNT 4: FIRST-DEGREE INTENTIONAL HOMICIDE
This is the most serious charge Rittenhouse faces and similar to first-degree murder in other states. If the jury finds him guilty, the 18-year-old faces life in prison. 
The charge stems from the death of Huber, 26, the second person Rittenhouse shot.
After shooting Rosenbaum, Rittenhouse fled the scene and was chased by Huber and others. After stumbling to the ground, Rittenhouse shot Huber, who swung a skateboard at him. 
The judge granted a prosecution request to have the jury also consider second-degree intentional homicide and first-degree reckless homicide. Both carry up to 60 years in prison. 
COUNT 5: ATTEMPTED FIRST-DEGREE INTENTIONAL HOMICIDE

This charge stems from Rittenhouse wounding Gaige Grosskreutz, 27, who lost part of his arm to the bullet. The felony carries up to 60 years in prison.
The judge granted a prosecution request to have the jury also consider attempted second-degree intentional homicide, which carries up to 60 years in prison, and first-degree reckless endangering safety, which is punishable by up to 12-1/2 years in prison.

BRUSSELS/WARSAW/MOSCOW (Reuters) - France told Russia on Monday NATO would be prepared to defend the sovereignty of Ukraine, near where NATO says Moscow has been staging a troop buildup, while Western leaders sought to tackle a migrants crisis on the eastern borders of the European Union.
The European Union agreed to step up sanctions against Belarus over thousands of migrants stranded in freezing forests on its borders with the EU. Belarus, a close Russian ally, said assertions it had fuelled the crisis were ""absurd"".
Speaking by telephone to Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of a flurry of conversations between Western leaders and Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, the French leader spoke of his strong concern over the situation on Ukraine's borders.
""Our willingness to defend Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity was reiterated by the president,"" an adviser to Macron told reporters of the conversation Macron initiated.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov earlier dismissed as ""wrong"" a U.S. State Department statement that the Belarus border crisis was meant to distract attention from increased Russian military activity close to Ukraine, another former Soviet republic.
The EU is seeking to stop what it says is a policy by Belarus to push migrants towards it to avenge earlier sanctions https://www.reuters.com/article/us-belarus-migrants-timeline-idAFKBN2HU1SV over a crackdown on protests last year against veteran leader Alexander Lukashenko's contested re-election.
Belarus and Russia have both repeatedly denied any role.
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said earlier on Monday NATO did not want to speculate on Russia's intentions on Ukraine, while adding: ""We see an unusual concentration of troops, and we know that Russia has been willing to use these types of military capabilities before to conduct aggressive actions against Ukraine.""
U.S. CONCERN
The U.S. Defense Department said it continued to see Russia concentrate forces along with unusual military activity near its border with Ukraine. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said the build-up was concerning and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin would meet his Ukrainian counterpart on Thursday.
Russian-backed separatists took control of Ukraine's eastern Donbass region in 2014 in a conflict that has rumbled on. Moscow also annexed Crimea from Ukraine earlier that year after the former Soviet republic sought closer ties with the EU.
Moscow claims the Black Sea waters around Crimea, although most countries consider the peninsula still Ukrainian.
In the Kremlin's readout of the call with Macron, Putin said large-scale military drills staged by the United States and its allies in the Back Sea were a ""provocation"".
""This is increasing tensions in relations between Russia and NATO,"" the Kremlin said.
The two leaders also discussed the migrants crisis. Macron's adviser said they had agreed on the need for a deescalation while the Kremlin reiterated Russia's insistence that the EU discuss it directly with Minsk.
Migrants - mostly from Iraq and Afghanistan - began appearing on Belarus' land borders with the EU this year, trying to cross into member states Lithuania, Latvia and Poland via routes not used before.
The top EU diplomat, Josep Borrell, said a fifth package of sanctions had been agreed by EU foreign ministers and would be finalised in the coming days. They would target airlines, travel agencies and individuals involved in ""this illegal push of migrants"", he said.
Latvia said on Monday it had deployed 3,000 troops for a previously unannounced military exercise near the border. It, Lithuania and Poland make up the eastern flank of the EU and NATO, while Ukraine is not a member of either western group.
Several hundred migrants, some throwing stones, made a new attempt on Monday to cross the border near the Polish village of Starzyna, but were forced back, Polish police said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Lukashenko discussed humanitarian aid for refugees and migrants by telephone, a German government spokesperson said.
The talks are the first known contact between the Belarusian president and a Western leader since last year's presidential election in Belarus triggered mass protests by demonstrators accusing Lukashenko of electoral fraud, a charge he denies.
Merkel and Lukashenko agreed to continue their exchange, the spokesperson said, but gave no sign a breakthrough had been made. Merkel has spoken twice to Putin in recent days.
AIRLINES
Middle East travel agencies working together with operators in Belarus provided tourist visas to thousands of people in recent months, a Reuters investigation showed https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-belarus-iraq-insight-idCAKBN2I00V0. 
The EU's executive, the European Commision, said it was looking into whether other airlines should face sanctions after the bloc banned Belarus' state-owned carrier Belavia from its skies and airports. Ireland said EU aircraft leasing contracts with Belavia would also end.
Lukashenko said Belarus was trying to persuade migrants to go home but that none of them wanted to return. Minsk would retaliate against any new EU sanctions, he said.
The EU has been stepping up sanctions on Belarus for months. Curbs already in place include blacklisting of Lukashenko, his son and 165 other Belarusian officials, as well as restrictions on trade in potash, an important export.
In Washington, the White House said it was in close contact with EU allies to hold the government of Belarus accountable.
The Kremlin, which has sent strategic bombers to patrol over Belarus, said Putin spoke to Lukashenko on Sunday and Moscow had no plans to reroute gas flows away from Belarus despite Minsk threatening to cut transit to Europe through the Yamal pipeline.

At least eight people have died along the 200-km (124-mile)long land border between Poland and Belarus, including from cold and exhaustion. The sparsely populated area of lakes, swamps and forests is becoming even more hostile to people https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/no-going-back-migrants-tell-being-trapped-belarus-poland-border-2021-11-10 trying to keep warm around bonfires through the cold November nights.
The EU's Borrell urged Warsaw to allow humanitarian aid on the frontier, where Poland has deployed some 20,000 police, border guards and soldiers.

WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping just completed their longest exchange as world leaders - but three and a half hours of talks appear to have done little, if anything, to narrow divergent positions between the superpowers. 
China's state media described the meeting as ""frank, constructive, substantive and fruitful.""
A senior U.S. official said the talks, held by video conference, went on longer than expected and the two sides discussed a wide range of issues from Taiwan, to trade, to North Korea, Afghanistan and Iran.
There was nothing from the respective readouts to immediately suggest that either side had softened increasingly entrenched positions that have brought relations between the world's two largest economies to a historically volatile point, particularly over the issue of Taiwan. 
And it was hard to see any definitive impact. ""It appears they exchanged views about everything under the sun, but announced no decisions or policy steps,"" said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.
""Perhaps that will be revealed in the coming days, but if not, this ended up being a recitation of both sides’ basic positions. They seem to agree that the relationship needs to have some guardrails and stability, but they don’t agree about how to get there.""
The senior U.S. official said after the meeting that the purpose of the exchange from the U.S. side was not particularly to ease tensions, nor necessarily was that the result.
""We were not expecting a breakthrough,"" the official said. ""There were none to report.""
Chinese media said Xi had said he hoped Biden could demonstrate ""political leadership"" to bring U.S. policy towards China back to a ""rational and practical"" track, but appeared to offer little incentive for that, only ominous warnings.
On the key potential flashpoint of Taiwan, Xi said China would have to take decisive measures if pro-independence forces crossed a red line, while saying that the U.S. and China were ""like two ships that should not collide.""
Daniel Russel, who served as the top U.S. diplomat for Asia under former President Barack Obama and is now with the Asia Society think tank, noted it had taken 10 months for the leaders to get to the point of face-to-face talks, albeit held virtually, and suggested more could be coming. 
""We should think of this not as a one-off sort-of-summit, but as one in a series of important conversations that can steer the relationship on a steadier course while the two sides continue to furiously compete,"" he said.
""Hopefully the Chinese side is empowering their teams to be able to hold more authoritative talks at lower levels. But this is just the beginning of process of working out of a deep hole and ultimately that requires more regular engagement between the two leaders themselves.""
Paul Haenle, director of the Carnegie–Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing and a former National Security Council official, said that while the meeting has stabilized the relationship in the near term, ""the long term structural challenges in the U.S.-China relationship have not been addressed in any substantial way."" 
Despite the lack of obvious progress, some Chinese analysts were upbeat and Wang Huiyao, president of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing, said that the meeting sent a ""very positive signal.""
""I think it will stop the downward spiral of bilateral relations and will stabilize U.S. China relations for some time,"" he said, adding that it should also help reduce tensions in the Taiwan Strait.

Wu Xinbo, director of American Studies at Shanghai’s Fudan University, said the meeting continued the positive trend of improving bilateral ties following a phone call between Biden and Xi in September.
""I think both sides will turn their attention to increasing cooperation and more effective management of their differences, so as to minimize the negative impact of the frictions on bilateral ties,"" he said.

520,"<span>Nov 16, 2021 04:47AM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would rather find a negotiated settlement to post-Brexit trade problems in Northern Ireland but if the government does escalate its dispute with Brussels it will do so in an appropriate way. 
Relations between Brussels and London have soured in recent weeks after Britain, unhappy with the deal it signed up to in 2020, threatened to trigger an emergency clause known as Article 16, potentially leading to a trade war.
However London and the European Union agreed last week to intensify efforts to solve the trade issues stemming from the Northern Ireland Protocol, after Brussels said it welcomed Britain's ""change in tone"".
In a speech late on Monday that was largely about the United Nations COP26 climate summit, Johnson said that he would ""rather find a negotiated solution to the problems created by the Northern Ireland Protocol, and that still seems possible"". 
""But if we do invoke Article 16 - which by the way is a perfectly legitimate part of that Protocol – we will do so reasonably and appropriately, because we believe it is the only way left to protect the territorial integrity of our country, and meet our obligations to the people of Northern Ireland under the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement,"" he said.

Were Britain to trigger Article 16, Brussels will have to decide how to respond, and its approach will likely depend on how far London goes in trying to use the mechanism as the start of a much broader renegotiation. 
The European Commission's Maros Sefcovic said on Monday he was ""absolutely convinced"" Britain and the European Union could break their impasse over post-Brexit trade arrangements but he remained concerned about London's ""rhetoric and action"".

Worries about the future of Afghanistan under the new Taliban government and a gathering economic and humanitarian crisis that threatens millions with joblessness and hunger have fuelled an exodus, with thousands crossing the border every day.
Alam Gul Haqqani, director of the passport department, said as many as 15,000-20,000 people a day were camped outside the office in Kabul, five or six times more than the office was able to handle, with many sleeping on the pavement overnight.
Many were forced to come back day after day after failing to file their application and the biometric machines regularly broke down as they processed the documents, causing further delays, he said.
""To stop people suffering this and to avoid disturbance, we have decided to stop the activities of the passport department activities for a few days,"" he told Tolo News television on Monday night, adding that the office would re-open soon.

On Tuesday, the interior ministry said 60 people, including a number of members of the passport department, had been arrested for using forged or fake documents to obtain a passport. There have also been growing complaints of people being forced to pay bribes to officials to get their applications approved.
International flights have slowly begun operating again with regular services from Kabul to Dubai and Islamabad offered by state-owned Ariana Afghan Airlines and privately owned Kam Air, in addition to charter services from other carriers.

SULAIMANIYA, Iraq/HAJNOWKA, Poland (Reuters) - When Kamaran Mohammed travelled with his wife and three children to the Belarus capital Minsk last month from their home in northern Iraq, they went as tourists.
They were among thousands of people provided with tourist visas in recent months with the help of travel agencies in the Middle East working in partnership with tour operators in Belarus, according to documents and witness accounts.
A few days after arriving in Minsk, the family made its way to the Belarus-Poland border, joining a wave of Iraqis, Syrians, Afghans and others attempting the hazardous and sometimes deadly crossing into the European Union to start a new life.
""The planes carry tourists that are not going for tourism,"" said Mohammed, speaking on Thursday in his home in the northern Iraqi city of Sulaimaniya.
""The Belarusian government knows very well that these people are not tourists, but that they are going to the Polish border.""
Mohammed and his family made it to Poland, but only briefly. They were deported back to Iraq on Oct. 31, a reminder that spending thousands of dollars and risking lives are no guarantee of settling in the EU.
Reuters could not independently verify his account.
The migrant crisis has stoked tensions between the West and Belarus' ally Russia. Moscow has sent nuclear-capable bombers to patrol Belarusian skies and nations bordering Belarus voiced alarm that the row could escalate into military confrontation.
    The European Union has accused Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko of orchestrating the influx of migrants to pressure it to back down over sanctions slapped on his government.
Poland and Lithuania have produced documents, seen by Reuters, that they say show at least one Belarusian state-owned travel company made it easy for would-be migrants to visit from May, while a state carrier more than doubled flights on a route popular with asylum seekers.
Lukashenko denies facilitating the crisis, although he has said he would no longer hold back migrants due to the penalties imposed by the EU after a disputed presidential election last year and subsequent crackdown on protesters.
Reuters spoke to more than 30 migrants or would-be migrants from the Middle East for this article in their homelands, on the Belarus-Poland border and in migrant centres in Poland.
Around 20 specified what visas they travelled on and all said they were for tourism. The documents released by Poland showed nearly 200 Iraqis received visa support from a state-run travel company in Belarus to visit for hunting and other trips.
Migrants and travel agents in Iraq and Turkey described the relative ease with which they have obtained documents for passage to Belarus in recent months.
Despite the cost - Iraqi migrants said they spent between around $1,250 and $4,000 reaching Minsk - thousands have made the journey, getting visas with the help of Belarusian firms and taking commercial flights that have become more frequent since the spring.
The surge in migrants has been aided by a small industry of travel agents, companies, smugglers and drivers seeking to take a cut of the profits, according to those travelling to or at the frontier.
    Several migrants near the border told Reuters that Belarusian border guards helped them try to cross into Poland or turned a blind eye when they did so. Two migrants separately said they handed them wire cutters.
Belarusian authorities did not respond to requests for comment on accusations that they facilitated the migrant crisis.
But Belarus' foreign ministry said on Monday allegations that Minsk had engineered the crisis on its borders with the European Union were ""absurd"".
Russian news agency RIA cited the ministry as saying Belarus had tightened border controls and its state-owned airline Belavia has carried no illegal migrants.
SAFER ROUTE TO EUROPE
Most migrants Reuters spoke to said they made the journey because they saw no future for themselves or their children, be it in Syria or Iraq. A handful said they were trying to enter the EU to reunite with friends or relatives.
They saw a chance to get to Europe via land - less risky than by sea, especially when travelling with young children. As 2021 went on, they read on social media that visas were becoming readily available. Middlemen and agents offered their services.
Hussein al-Asil is an Iraqi based in Ankara who provides travel services to would-be tourists and migrants.
He said he arranged invitations for his clients from three Belarusian partners and processed passports sent from Iraq. Once returned, their owners could travel to Minsk via Turkey. According to Asil, it was much harder for Iraqis to get visas for Belarus before this year.
Asil said he charged $1,250 per person - which he claimed made him one of the cheapest travel agents.
""The (Belarus) embassy of course knows that this person is not going for tourism,"" he said. ""What kind of tourism would that be, to book a plane ticket for $800 and get a visa for $1,250? They know that these people are coming to go to Europe.""
Flights to Minsk became more frequent since the spring.
Belavia, for example, flew 28 times from Istanbul to Minsk in February, 2021, and 31 times in March. By July that had more than doubled to 65, according to Flightradar24 data.
Turkish Airlines flights on the same route also jumped, to 64 in July and August from 32 in March and April. In October, both airlines flew a combined 124 times to Minsk.
The EU has moved to counter that. Amid pressure from Brussels, Baghdad suspended flights from Iraq to Minsk this autumn.
On Friday, Belavia and Turkish Airlines confirmed they would no longer take passengers from Yemen, Iraq or Syria to Minsk, except for diplomats.
And on Saturday Cham Wings Airlines, a private Syrian carrier, told Reuters it had suspended flights to Minsk.
'EVERY DAY FRIENDS LEAVE'
Once migrants arrive in Minsk, most move quickly to the border. City residents said they had seen a large increase in people who appeared to be from the Middle East waiting in malls, sleeping on benches and buying provisions for their onward journey.
Some migrants who made it to Poland said they were beaten by Belarusian border guards and chased back and forth across the frontiers. They faced exhaustion, hunger, thirst and fear.
Belarus authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment on their accusations.
Umm Malak, a 26-year-old Iraqi woman weeks away from giving birth, told Reuters that she and her family were shunted between Poland and Belarus six times before she made it to a migrant centre in the Polish city of Bialystok.
She said she, her husband and their three small daughters waded through chest-deep water and hid in cold forests.
A Polish police spokesperson said police did not conduct activities such as taking migrants back to the border. Neither the Polish Border Guard nor Belarusian authorities responded to requests for comment on her case.
Umm Malak may consider herself lucky.
Many migrants do not make it into the EU and are forced to try to get back to Minsk - sometimes having to pay a bribe to do so - or their homeland. At least eight migrants have died trying to cross and fears are growing for the safety of others as harsh winter conditions set in.
Despite the crackdown on flights from the Middle East to Minsk, Fabrice Leggeri, director of the EU border agency Frontex, warned on Friday that the bloc must be prepared for an increase in the number of migrants trying to enter.
Numbers have already spiked. The Polish Border Guard said over 17,000 illegal attempts to cross the border were made in October, more than double the attempts in September, and thousands of migrants were camping out near Belarus' border with Poland.
Back in northern Iraq, in Said Sadiq, barber Warzer Ibrahim said dozens of people from his town had left Iraq's northern Kurdistan region for Belarus in recent weeks.
The 37-year-old father of two has decided to join them.
""I have a child who is eight, she can't write properly. Why? Because school is not good. And I can see that the life of my children doesn't look good,"" he said.
""I see the images every day, of people in the forest, but I am not afraid. The hardship in Belarus is temporary. A week, two weeks. But here, it is every day.""
Iraq's Kurdistan regional government told Reuters it was investigating local travel agents involved in the exodus, and blamed politicians and smugglers for exacerbating the crisis.

Ibrahim said he had paid $1,600 for each of his family of four to get to Minsk. Some would-be migrants said they had sold land and homes to pay for fares, hotels, smugglers and bribes.
""Every day to see your good friend leave,"" Ibrahim added. ""You know each other for 20 years and then they leave for Belarus and you don't know what will happen to them. That is hard. But I still say go, and I am going because it is better than here.""

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan on Tuesday distanced itself from a visit to Myanmar by its special envoy during which, according to military-run media in Myanmar, he played a role in the release from jail of U.S. journalist Danny Fenster.
Fenster, 37, the managing editor of magazine Frontier Myanmar, was freed https://www.reuters.com/world/american-journalist-fenster-out-prison-myanmar-employer-says-2021-11-15 on Monday three days after being sentenced to 11 years for incitement and violations of laws on immigration and unlawful assembly.
He had been detained since May, spurring an international campaign for his release that has highlighted the plight of media in the Southeast Asian nation roiled by internal strife since the military takeover in February threw it into chaos.
Myanmar's military-owned Myawaddy TV said on Monday Fenster had been granted an amnesty following requests from former U.S. state governor and diplomat with longstanding Myanmar ties Bill Richardson, who has been openly linked with the release effort.
But in a surprise, it also credited for the release Yohei Sasakawa, the chairman of the Nippon Foundation who doubles as Japan's special envoy on Myanmar for national reconciliation, as well as former Japanese minister Hideo Watanabe http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/12/09/JapanMyanmar.pdf.
Both Sasakawa and Watanabe have for years cultivated close ties to the Myanmar military. Sasakawa met coup leader Min Aung Hlaing over the weekend, but his Nippon Foundation declined to comment on the talks, citing political sensitivity.
Myawaddy TV said Fenster was released in response to requests by Sasakawa, Watanabe and Richardson to ""maintain the friendship between the countries and to emphasize humanitarian grounds"".
Japanese foreign minister Yoshimasa Hayashi, asked at a news conference about the reports of Sasakawa's involvement in the release, said the envoy was on visit to Myanmar in a personal capacity.
Hayashi said he was aware of Sasakawa's meeting with Min Aung Hlaing but said the visit ""was not carried out in his capacity as the government representative"" and his ministry was not involved in arranging it.
""The government has traditionally maintained a level of contact with Mr Sasakawa, but I would like to refrain from making the details of these communications public,"" said Hayashi.
He did not refer to Fenster's release but said Japan would continue its efforts towards improving and resolving the situation in Myanmar, including considering further humanitarian aid in coordination with international agencies.
The office of Watanabe's Japan-Myanmar Association declined to comment. In recent years Watanabe has been key to creating a special economic zone close to Myanmar's main city of Yangon that helped spur Japanese investment.
'IMPROVING RELATIONS'
Sasakawa's talks came amid a breakdown https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/myanmar-says-no-suu-kyi-visit-envoy-would-be-unlawful-2021-11-03 in a Southeast Asian peace process that Myanmar's neighbours say the junta has failed to follow, which led to the unprecedented decision to exclude Min Aung Hlaing from a regional summit last month.
Central to the decision was the military's refusal https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/myanmar-says-no-suu-kyi-visit-envoy-would-be-unlawful-2021-11-03 to grant a special Southeast Asian envoy access to the detained leader of Myanmar's ousted government, Nobel peace prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
It was unclear whether Sasakawa had asked to meet Suu Kyi or made any other conditions ahead of his talks with the isolated junta chief. Myanmar's main state-run newspaper reported the meeting on its front page, using Sasakawa's full title as Japan's envoy.
During his trip Sasakawa also met Myanmar's health minister, state media said, to discuss ""conditions for Japan to donate COVID-19 vaccine to Myanmar, and issues that can be done to improve Japan-Myanmar relations"".
Sasakawa also travelled to the northwestern Rakhine region riven by ethnic tensions where, according to media, he said that he had told junta officials his foundation would donate $8.5 million for internally displaced people.
Media also said Sasakawa promised a donation of $3 million-worth of COVID-19 vaccines for Myanmar. It was not clear whether the vaccines would be provided by the foundation or the government of Japan.

Hayashi did not directly address the question of any vaccine donation.
According to rights group Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, 10,143 people have been arrested since the coup in Myanmar and 1,260 people killed in violence, most of them in a crackdown by security forces on protests and dissent.

LIVERPOOL, England (Reuters) -British police have identified the suspect behind an explosion which engulfed a taxi in flames outside a hospital in Liverpool on Sunday, a blast the authorities have declared a terrorist incident. 
Police say 32-year-old Emad Al Swealmeen, who was killed in the blast, boarded the taxi in the northern English city and asked to be driven to the hospital, which was about 10 minutes away. 
The blast took place within the car as it approached the drop-off point in front of Liverpool Women's Hospital. The taxi driver was treated for injuries and released after medical attention.
The country has raised its national threat level to severe, with interior minister Priti Patel saying the blast was the second fatal incident in one month following the stabbing to death of lawmaker David Amess.
Four men, who were arrested by the police in relation to the explosion, were released from custody, the police said late Monday.
Three of them, aged 29, 26 and 21, were arrested on Sunday and on Monday Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson of Counter-Terrorism Policing Northwest said another man aged 20 had been arrested.
The explosion occurred just before 11 a.m. on Sunday, when a Remembrance Day service to commemorate war dead was being held at nearby Liverpool Cathedral. Police are investigating whether the events are connected.
Police are searching two places associated with Al Swealmeen and have recovered significant items, Detective Chief Inspector Andrew Meeks said in a statement released by Greater Manchester Police. 
""Now that we have released his name, any information that the public may have about Al Swealmeen, no matter how small, may be of great assistance to us,"" he said.
Police carried out a controlled explosion earlier on Monday as a precaution at Sefton Park. 
Jackson said it was unclear why the passenger had wanted to go to the hospital or what had caused the sudden explosion of the device.
Police also said they have recovered important evidence from an address at Rutland Avenue, adding it is becoming central to the investigation. Al Swealmeen had been picked up by the taxi from the Rutland Avenue area, according to the BBC https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-59287001.

Earlier, Liverpool Mayor Joanne Anderson described the actions of the taxi driver as heroic. The BBC said he had locked the passenger inside the vehicle. 
""It is important that the public remains alert to the threat from terrorism but not alarmed,"" Patel said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping stressed their responsibility to the world to avoid conflict as the heads of the two top global economies gathered for hours of talks on Monday.
""It seems to me our responsibility as leaders of China and the United States is to ensure that our competition between our countries does not veer into conflict, whether intended or unintended,"" Biden said.
""Just simple, straightforward competition.""
The United States and China disagree on the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, trade and competition rules, Beijing's expanding nuclear arsenal and its stepped-up pressure on Taiwan, among other issues.
Calling Biden an ""old friend,"" Xi said the two sides must increase communication and cooperation to solve the many challenges they face. Biden previously disputed the characterization https://www.reuters.com/world/china/old-friends-xi-biden-not-necessarily-2021-11-16 of their relationship as an old friendship. 
Speaking through an interpreter, Xi said: ""As the world's two largest economies and the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, China and the United States need to increase communication and cooperation.""
Biden promised to address areas of concern, including human rights and other issues in the Indo-Pacific region, adding that ""you and I have never been that formal with one another.""
The talks, which were initiated by Biden and began at 7:46 p.m. on Monday (0046 GMT Tuesday), were intended to make the relationship less acrimonious https://www.reuters.com/world/china/top-pain-points-between-us-china-xi-biden-meet-2021-11-15. 
The two sides took a 15-minute break after a nearly two-hour first session that ran half an hour longer than expected, according to reports from Chinese state media, before resuming the conversation.
The early moments of the two leaders' dialogue were observed by a small group of reporters with Biden in the White House's Roosevelt Room before the heads of state and top aides spoke privately. The U.S. president smiled broadly as the Chinese president appeared on a large screen in the conference room.
Biden and Xi have not had a face-to-face meeting since Biden became president and the last time they spoke it was via telephone in September.
U.S. officials have downplayed expectations for any concrete agreements between both sides, including on trade, where China is lagging in a commitment to buy $200 billion more in U.S. goods and services. Not on Biden's agenda are U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods that Beijing and business groups hope to be scaled back. 
The White House has declined to answer questions on whether the United States will send officials to the Beijing Winter Olympics in February. Activists and U.S. lawmakers have urged the Biden administration to boycott the Games.
""Both sides are trying to establish the call’s goal as creating stability in the relationship, both through their collegial language and overall framing of the conversation and the importance of the relationship,"" said Scott Kennedy, China expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.
""The question is whether they’ll reach agreement on anything, or at least, agree to disagree and avoid escalatory steps.""
COMPETING VISIONS
Xi, looking ahead to the Olympics and a Communist Party congress next year where he is expected to secure an unprecedented third term, is also keen to avoid heightened tensions with the United States.
But he is expected to push back over Washington's efforts to carve out more space for Taiwan in the international system. China claims the self-ruled island as its own. Beijing has vowed to bring the island under Chinese control, by force if necessary.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular briefing on Monday: ""It is hoped that the United States and China will meet each other halfway, strengthen dialogue and cooperation, effectively manage differences, properly handle sensitive issues, and explore ways of mutual respect and peaceful coexistence.""
Xi and Biden last week outlined competing visions, with Biden stressing the U.S. commitment to a ""free and open Indo-Pacific,"" which Washington says faces increasing Chinese ""coercion,"" while Xi warned against a return to Cold War tensions. 
A tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily on Monday called Taiwan ""the ultimate red line of China.""
Taiwan is not the only flashpoint. Democrats in the U.S. Congress want Biden to make nuclear risk reduction measures with China a top priority, after the Pentagon reported that Beijing was significantly expanding its nuclear weapons and missile programs.

Beijing argues its arsenal is dwarfed by those of the United States and Russia, and says it is ready for dialogue if Washington reduces its nuclear stockpile to China's level.
""This is President Biden's opportunity to show steel, show strength on America's side, to make it clear that we are going to stand by our allies and that we will not endorse or condone the malign behavior that China has engaged in,"" said Republican Senator Bill Hagerty, who served as ambassador to Japan under former President Donald Trump.

527,"<span>Nov 15, 2021 11:38PM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Chinese leader Xi Jinping greeted U.S. President Joe Biden as ""old friend"" at the start of their first video meeting, using an expression that Biden has pushed back on.
In China, the expression ""lao peng you"" connotes fondness and shows a level of familiarity and trust, and when said by Xi, 68, reflects a shared history that dates to August 2011, when the two held hours of conversations and travelled in Sichuan province - before either had reached the highest office.
Wang Huiyao, president of the Center for China and Globalization, said Xi's use of the expression is a show of genuine goodwill.
Daniel Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for Asia under former President Barack Obama, said it was part of each leader's seeking the ""narrative high ground"" at the opening.
""Xi deliberately greeting Biden as 'my old friend' - after Biden went on record this summer expressly denying that they are 'friends.' And Biden, with a toothy smile, reminding Xi that all countries - including China - 'have to play by the same rules of the road',"" Russel said.
Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University of China, noted Xi's use of the term despite the difficult state of relations.
""When we Chinese call someone an old friend, we mean we've known him for a long time. But an 'old friend' doesn't necessarily mean he is still a real friend,"" Shi said. 
Given current diplomatic tensions, Biden may not want to be seen by U.S. allies and his political opponents as too much of a ""friend"".
In June, a reporter asked Biden, 78, whether he might call Xi - ""old friend to old friend"" - seeking access for World Health Organization investigators searching for the origins of COVID-19.
""Let's get something straight. We know each other well; we're not old friends. It's just pure business,"" Biden said at the time.

Ahead of the meeting on Monday, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki was asked about that exchange.
""Well ... I can confirm ... he still does not consider him an 'old friend,' so that remains consistent,"" she said.

KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) - (note graphic language, paragraph 17) 
Prosecutors and defense counsel in the Wisconsin murder trial of Kyle Rittenhouse presented conflicting pictures of the defendant on Monday: an armed vigilante who provoked a series of violent encounters and a teenager who just wanted to help the community.
The widely differing portrayals were presented over more than five hours of closing arguments, the attorneys' last chance to influence the jury before it decides the fate of Rittenhouse, who fatally shot two men and wounded a third during racial justice protests in the city of Kenosha last year.
Jurors will begin deliberations on Tuesday morning.
Kenosha County Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger told the jury to ignore Rittenhouse's argument that he was ambushed and fired his semi-automatic AR-15-style rifle in self-defense during the chaotic night of protests on Aug. 25, 2020.
Instead, Binger argued, Rittenhouse instigated the first shooting by pointing his weapon at people, and caused the subsequent encounters by creating an ""active shooter"" situation in which protesters felt an urgency to disarm him. 
""If you created the danger, you forfeit the right to self-defense by bringing that gun, aiming it at people, threatening people's lives,"" said Binger, who aimed the gun in front of the jury to demonstrate. ""The defendant provoked everything.""
The defense said Rittenhouse, who carried a medical kit in addition to his gun, merely wanted to help the injured and protect a used-car dealership from the kind of property damage that had marred protests in Kenosha over two previous nights.
""Kyle was a 17-year-old kid out there trying to help this community,"" said Mark Richards, Rittenhouse's lawyer.
Richards said the media and Binger's office had been too quick to judge his client in what has emerged as the most closely watched case involving a civilian's right to self-defense since George Zimmerman was acquitted in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Black teenager, in 2013.
Like Zimmerman, Rittenhouse has become a polarizing figure, viewed as heroic by some conservatives who favor expansive gun rights and as a symbol of a reckless American gun culture by many on the left.
""Ladies and gentlemen, this is a political case,"" Richards said. ""The district attorney is marching forward with this case because they need someone to be responsible."" 
PROVOCATION
Rittenhouse, 18, is charged with killing Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and wounding Gaige Grosskreutz, 28, on Aug. 25, 2020. The shootings took place in Kenosha during protests - marred by arson, rioting and looting - that followed the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, who was left paralyzed from the waist down
That incident took place against the backdrop of nationwide protests over racism and police brutality following the May 2020 murder of George Floyd, another Black man, by a policeman in Minneapolis.
Rittenhouse, who has pleaded not guilty and testified last week that he acted in self-defense, faces life in prison if convicted. He was 17 at the time of the shootings. 
While showing the jury a grainy drone video, Binger argued that Rittenhouse raised his rifle in a threatening way as he entered a used-car lot, prompting someone to yell: ""Gun, gun, gun"" and for Rosenbaum to pursue the teen to ""try and stop the defendant from pointing his gun or shooting anyone.""
Multiple witnesses testified that Rosenbaum, the first man Rittenhouse shot, screamed: ""Fuck You!"" as he charged and lunged at the teenager. Rittenhouse said Rosenbaum grabbed his rifle when he fired, fearing his weapon would be used against him.
By arguing that Rittenhouse was the aggressor, prosecutors were attempting to raise the bar for the teen's self-defense claim, making it easier for the jury to convict. Under Wisconsin law, a person who has provoked a confrontation must exhaust all other options before resorting to deadly force.
Richards said the strategy smacked of desperation, noting that prosecutors had spent little time on the issue of provocation during two weeks of testimony - much of which was supportive of the teen's argument that he was attacked.
""When his case explodes in his face, now he comes out with provocation,"" Richards said of the prosecutor. ""Provocation, I don't think so.""
GRAPHIC IMAGES 
In an effort to argue that Rittenhouse acted recklessly, Binger talked at length about the powerful nature of an AR-15 and the ammunition it was loaded with: full metal jacket bullets designed to penetrate their target. 
He called Rittenhouse a “fraud” for saying he was there as a medic to provide first aid, noting that he lied to a journalist about being a certified EMT. “This AR-15 is completely incompatible with the role of a medic,” Binger said
The jury was shown graphic video of Rosenbaum after he was shot four times, lying motionless and struggling to breathe. Binger also displayed a graphic photograph of Grosskreutz with a large chunk of his right arm shot off
The prosecutor also called Huber, a protester who was shot after striking Rittenhouse with his skateboard, a hero for trying to disarm the teenager, and noted that Rittenhouse did not seek to provide medical aid to the men he shot. 
""The defendant walks away ... like he's some sort of hero in a Western,"" Binger told the jury.
Richards noted that Rosenbaum had just been discharged from a hospital and had been caught on videos yelling racial slurs at people and setting fires. Rosenbaum's fiancee testified that he had bipolar disorder.

""We don't play fast and loose with the facts pretending that Mr. Rosenbaum was Citizen A, No. 1 guy,"" Richards said. ""He was a rioter and my client had to deal with him that night, alone.""
Earlier on Monday, Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed a misdemeanor charge against Rittenhouse for illegally possessing the rifle he used in the shootings, citing vagueness in the law.

Lopez Obrador is due to hold talks with U.S. President Joe Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Washington on Thursday at the first in-person meeting of the leaders of the three nations since 2016. Only Trudeau was in office last time.
""There are three issues: economic integration, migration and health regarding COVID and cooperation on dealing with the pandemic,"" Lopez Obrador told a regular news conference.
The Mexican president said labor mobility in the region would also be on the agenda, and reiterated that he did not intend to discuss a proposed electricity market reform in Mexico which has caused concern inside the U.S government https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-ambassador-hopes-accord-attainable-mexico-power-bill-2021-11-09.
Lopez Obrador pitched his plan to change the constitution to give Mexico's state-owned power company priority over private investment in the energy market on the grounds that past governments had rigged the sector in favor of private interests.
Critics are concerned it breaches Mexico's obligations under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal.
Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, Finance Minister Rogelio Ramirez de la O, Economy Minister Tatiana Clouthier, deputy health minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell and Mexico's migration chief would be in the Mexican delegation, Lopez Obrador added.
Lopez Obrador said he would travel on Wednesday to Washington and return early on Friday.

Later on Monday, Canada said its foreign minister, Melanie Joly, was flying to Mexico City for talks with Ebrard ahead of the Washington summit.
During the talks, Joly would highlight the importance of working together on North American competitiveness and shared challenges such as climate change, her government said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson helped free American Danny Fenster from a Myanmar prison on Monday, and the journalist's release was the latest in Richardson's long career of dealing with notorious dictators.
The U.S.-diplomat-turned-freelance-fixer, who celebrated this 74th birthday on Monday, posted a photo on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that showed him with his arm around Fenster at the bottom of the steps of a jet that flew them out of the country. 
The release, which brought relief to Fenster’s family in Detroit and was welcomed by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, came after Richardson met this month with Myanmar junta leader Min Aung Hlaing, one of the only foreigners to do so since he seized power in February.
Richardson's visit earlier drew fire from activists accusing Richardson of giving the junta legitimacy, a familiar line of criticism in his more that a quarter century of dealing with notorious foreign leaders.
'KNOW WHAT MAKES THEM TICK'
Richardson got his start in hostage negotiations in 1994. Then a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, he traveled to North Korea to discuss a nuclear accord struck by President Bill Clinton. 
As Richardson was traveling to the country, North Korea shot down a U.S. military helicopter that had entered its territory, killing one pilot and capturing the other, and the congressman ended up staying several weeks to negotiate.
Soon after, Richardson sat down with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein to secure the release of two Americans detained after straying over the border from Kuwait.
“The first rule of negotiating, with me, is you’ve got to relate to your adversary personally. You have to respect them. You’ve gotta know what… makes them tick,” Richardson said on a podcast produced by Foreign Policy magazine in 2018. 
“You’ve gotta let the other side save face and find some ways that they get some credit, that they’re getting something out of the negotiation, when in effect the only thing may be praise for a humanitarian gesture.” 
Myanmar's military-run TV channel said on Monday that Fenster was granted an amnesty on ""humanitarian grounds.""
Richardson later served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and energy secretary under Clinton, before being elected governor of New Mexico in 2002. He ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic Party's nomination for president in 2008.
Richardson and his staff at the Richardson Center for Global Engagement now frequently travel on private missions, without the U.S. government’s imprimatur, at the request of the families of people kidnapped, detained or killed in countries with testy relations with Washington. 
In 2014 he returned to North Korea, alongside Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) CEO Eric Schmidt, to ask North Korea to release Korean-American missionary Kenneth Bae. 
He also worked for the release of student Otto Warmbier, who was brought back to the United States in 2017 in dire health and died soon afterwards.
Richardson dealt with Iran’s Islamist leaders to help in the release of Xiyue Wang in 2019 and Michael White in 2020.
HISTORY WITH MYANMAR

Richardson became involved in Myanmar in the mid-1990s, he recounted to Foreign Policy, first to get the generals to release opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi from prison and into house arrest.
He later clashed with Nobel laureate Suu Kyi over the arrest of two Reuters journalists detained while reporting on killings of Rohingya Muslims in 2017, after she had risen to de facto leader of a civilian administration. Richardson failed to get the two reporters released.

DENVER (Reuters) -Six teenagers were wounded on Monday in a drive-by shooting near their high school in Aurora, Colorado, and authorities were searching for multiple suspects in an attack that investigators believe may have been gang-related, the city police chief said.
All six victims, ranging in age from 14 to 18, are expected to recover from injuries described as non-life-threatening, although one youth was undergoing surgery, Police Chief Vanessa Wilson told reporters about two hours after the shooting.
The gun violence erupted shortly before 1 p.m. at a park about a block north of Aurora Central High School in the heart of the Denver suburb. Five of the victims were taken by ambulance to area hospitals, and one was ""self-transported,"" the chief said. All were students at Central High, she said.
Details of the incident remained sketchy. But the shooting unfolded as a drive-by attack involving multiple vehicles described by neighbors as suspicious as well as by suspects ""who may have been on foot,"" Wilson told the news briefing.
KCNC-TV, a Denver-based CBS News affiliate, quoted a neighbor identified as Henry Martinez, who lives across the street from the park, as saying he heard ""30 to 50 gunshots.""
""It's sad to see young people just throwing their lives away like that,"" Martinez told the station. 
Wilson said investigators were seeking ""multiple suspects"" and asking neighbors and witnesses to come forward with any information that might prove helpful. Numerous shots of different calibers were fired, suggesting more than one gun was involved, she said.
Police detectives specializing in street-gang crimes are assisting in the investigation, Wilson said, adding: ""I'm not 100% sure this is gang-related.""
Aurora, a city of about 386,000 residents just east of Denver, was the scene of one of the bloodiest episodes of modern U.S. gun violence in 2012 - a movie theater shooting that took 12 lives and wounded dozens during a midnight premiere of the Batman film ""The Dark Knight Rises.""
""There’s a violence crisis across the nation right now, so we all need to pay attention,"" Wilson said.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The Delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus now accounts for nearly all of the coronavirus infections globally, fueled by unchecked spread of the novel coronavirus in many parts of the world. So far, vaccines are still able to defend against serious disease and death from Delta, but scientists remain on alert.
Here is what we know:
    DELTA - STILL DOMINANT
    The Delta variant, first detected in India in December 2020, remains the most worrisome version of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
The World Health Organization classifies Delta as a variant of concern, a category that means the variant is capable of increasing transmissibility, causing more severe disease or reducing the benefit of vaccines and treatments. 
    Delta's ""superpower"" is its transmissibility, according to Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in San Diego. 
    Delta is more than two times as contagious as previous SARS-CoV-2 variants, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Studies suggest it may be more likely to put infected people in the hospital than prior forms of the virus. 
    Delta also can cause symptoms two to three days sooner than the original coronavirus, giving the immune system less time to mount a defense.
    People infected with Delta carry around 1,200 times more virus in their noses compared with the original version of the coronavirus. The amount of virus in vaccinated individuals who become infected with Delta is on par with those who are unvaccinated, and both can transmit the virus to others. 
    In vaccinated people, however, the amount of virus drops more quickly, so they likely spread the virus for a shorter time.
    According to the WHO, Delta makes up 99.5% of all genomic sequences reported to public databases and has ""outcompeted"" other variants in most countries.
    A key exception is South America, where Delta has spread more gradually, and other variants previously seen as possible global threats - notably Gamma, Lambda and Mu - still contribute to a significant proportion of reported cases. 
    DELTA OFFSPRING
    Given Delta's global dominance, many vaccine experts now believe that all future variants will be offshoots of Delta.
    One notable Delta ""grandchild"" is known as AY.4.2 and is concentrated largely in the UK, where it makes up roughly 10% of sequenced virus samples. 
    AY.4.2 carries two additional mutations in the spike protein, which the virus uses to enter cells. Scientists are still studying what advantage, if any, these mutations confer.
The UK Health Security Agency has designated the AY.4.2 a ""Variant Under Investigation."" A preliminary analysis suggests it does not significantly impair vaccine effectiveness compared with Delta, but there is some evidence that it could be slightly more transmissible, the agency said.
According to the WHO, AY.4.2 has spread to at least 42 countries, including the United States. 
    MORE ON THE WAY?
    Virus experts are closely watching the evolution of Delta, looking for any sign that it has acquired mutations that would allow the highly transmissible variant to pierce the immune protection of vaccines and natural infection.

    Even so, while current vaccines prevent severe disease and death, they do not block infection. The virus is still capable of replicating in the nose, even among vaccinated people, who can then transmit the disease through tiny, aerosolized droplets.

(Reuters) -A lawyer for one of the three white men charged with murdering Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man, in their southern Georgia neighborhood failed in an attempt to have the judge remove civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson from the courtroom on Monday.
The same lawyer, Kevin Gough, made a similarly unsuccessful attempt last week to get the court to prevent any more ""Black pastors"" attending the trial after the Rev. Al Sharpton, another civil rights leader, was seen sitting with Arbery's parents in the public gallery.
After the jury was sent out, Gough stood in the Glynn County Superior Court and said he objected to what he called ""an icon in the civil rights movement"" sitting between Arbery's parents. 
""How many pastors does the Arbery family have?"" he said, referring to a similar objection he had made on Thursday to Sharpton's visit. ""The seats in the public gallery of a courtroom are not like courtside seats at a Lakers game.""
Gough said the presence of civil rights leaders might influence jurors hearing the high-profile case.
Cell phone footage made by Gough's client, William ""Roddie"" Bryan, of the fatal shooting of Arbery after he was chased through Satilla Shores on a Sunday afternoon in February 2020 drew outrage when it was published more than two months later.
Prosecutors say Arbery was an avid jogger, and his killing was seen by some as another example of a Black man facing dangerous suspicion while doing some banal activity in public.
Jackson quietly listened to Gough, holding the hands of Arbery's father, Marcus Arbery Sr., and mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones. When Gough, who wore no COVID-19 mask, complained that Jackson's mask was not covering his mouth and nose, Cooper-Jones reached and lifted Jackson's mask back up.
Judge Timothy Walmsley was audibly exasperated as he rejected the motion by Gough, saying his ruling last week that he would not issue any blanket bans on who could enter a public courtroom would still stand. He said he was not aware that Jackson was in the room until Gough made his motion.
The judge said it was odd that Gough kept objecting to Black pastors showing up and that he was ""done talking about it.""
""At this point, I'm not exactly sure what you're doing,"" the judge said. ""It's almost as if you're just trying to keep continuing this for purposes other than just bringing it to the court's attention and I find that objectionable.""
Jackson said outside the courthouse during a break in proceedings that he planned to attend all week, calling it ""a constitutional right and a moral obligation.""
""They're looking for diversion,"" he said of the defense lawyers.
Sharpton has said he will be joined by more than 100 Black pastors at the courthouse on Thursday.
EMOTIONAL 'OUTCRY'
Bryan, 52, is standing trial alongside father and son Gregory McMichael, 65, and Travis McMichael, 35, on charges of murder, assault and false imprisonment. 
They have pleaded not guilty, saying they were justified in chasing Arbery in their pickup trucks because they thought he may have committed some sort of crime. They do not dispute that the younger McMichael killed Arbery with a shotgun, but say this was self defense after Arbery turned toward him and reached for the raised weapon.
After Jackson was permitted to remain in court, Gough said he wanted to move for a mistrial based on an emotional ""outcry"" by Arbery's mother from the public gallery when a photograph of Arbery was shown to jurors on Monday. Several jurors looked over as she sobbed.

Lawyers for the McMichaels joined the motion.
The judge overruled it, reading from a legal precedent that said ""emotions are neither unreasonable nor unexpected during murder trials.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned Russia on Monday that the western military alliance was standing by Ukraine amid a large and unusual concentration of Russian troops on Ukraine's borders.
Stressing that the important thing now was to prevent situations from spiralling out of control, Stoltenberg urged Russia to be transparent about military activities, to reduce tensions and prevent an escalation.
""We have to be clear-eyed, we need to be realistic about the challenges we face. And what we see is a significant, large Russian military build-up,"" Stoltenberg told a news conference with Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in Brussels.
He said he did not want to speculate about Russia's intentions but added: ""We see an unusual concentration of troops, and we know that Russia has been willing to use these types of military capabilities before to conduct aggressive actions against Ukraine.""
The Russian troop movements have over the past days spurred fears of a possible attack. Moscow has dismissed such suggestions as inflammatory and complained https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-is-not-threat-says-kremlin-after-media-report-about-possible-ukraine-2021-11-12 about increasing activity in the region by the NATO transatlantic alliance. 
Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and says the waters around it belong to Moscow now, despite most countries continuing to recognise the peninsula as Ukrainian.
Russian-backed separatists took control of Ukraine's eastern Donbass region that same year and soldiers on both sides continue to be regularly killed in the conflict there.
The troop border build-up - which Ukraine last week estimated at 100,000 - was dangerous, said Stoltenberg, because it reduced the amount of warning time, should Russia decide to ""conduct a military aggressive action against Ukraine."" 
""This is partly forces close to the border between Russia and Ukraine, but it is also partly troops and capabilities which are inside Ukraine, meaning they are in Crimea, which is illegally annexed, and also we see the militants, the separatists in Donbass, which is also part of Ukraine, supported and helped by Russia,"" he said.
A NATO source, asked to describe how Russia is going about deploying its military equipment towards Ukraine, said: ""large equipment such as tanks, self-propelled artillery and infantry fighting vehicles is moved at night to avoid tell-tale pictures showing up on social media as they did during the Russian military build-up in spring.""
""It can go either way,"" Lithuania's foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told reporters, also on Monday, on the margins of a meeting with his European Union counterparts.

The West cannot exclude a Russian attack on Ukraine while international attention is focused on the Belarus migration crisis, or that Russia establishes a permanent military presence in Belarus, he said.
""I would not exclude that as a possibility,"" he said.

SOFIA (Reuters) -A new centrist political party won Bulgaria's parliamentary election, partial official results showed on Monday, boosting hopes for an end to months of political deadlock in the European Union's poorest member state.
The anti-graft We Continue The Change party (PP), launched only two months ago by two Harvard-educated entrepreneurs who served as interim ministers, won 25.5% of the vote, based on 93% of ballots counted from Sunday's election, Bulgaria's third this year.
After two previous elections in April and July produced an inconclusive outcome, Bulgarian voters are keen to see a new government formed quickly to tackle a dire COVID-19 situation, surging energy prices and widespread graft.
""I voted for what we are fighting for and hoping to happen - a more serious change in everything, so that we can have a better life here, at least for our children,"" Kostadin Manov, a 39-year-old father of two, said after casting his vote in Sofia. 
""This corruption and all this theft should stop.""
But the partial results show the next parliament will be even more fragmented than in April and July, with seven parties represented.
TOUGH COALITION TALKS
Voter turnout in Sunday's vote is estimated at about 40% - a historic low amid public disillusionment and apathy and also coronavirus infections that have left hospitals overwhelmed. 
The centre-right GERB party of long-serving premier Boyko Borissov came in second with 22.2% of the vote. His decade-long rule ended with the April election amid public anger over his failure to crack down on corruption.
President Rumen Radev, a harsh critic of Borissov, won 49.4% of votes in a presidential election that also took place on Sunday and is tipped to win a second five-year term in the largely ceremonial post in a runoff set for Nov. 21.
Analysts said the new PP party looked better positioned to seal a coalition with the support of the Socialists, the anti-graft alliance Democratic Bulgaria and the ITN party of TV talk show host Slavi Trifonov.
However, tough coalition negotiations lie ahead before a workable government can be formed.
""Negotiations will likely be challenging... Nonetheless, the urgent need for a stable government will likely facilitate compromises on all sides, at least in the near term,"" said Andrius Tursa of consulting firm Teneo in a note. 
PP leader Kiril Petkov, 41, promised on Sunday to be open to dialogue and compromise in coalition talks but said his party would not renege on pledges to overhaul the judiciary and clamp down on corruption.

""Bulgaria is headed onto a new path,"" said Petkov, who hopes to become prime minister and to have his PP co-founder, Assen Vassilev, as finance minister.
Final official results are expected on Tuesday.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's Peronists licked their wounds on Monday after a damaging midterm election defeat, where the conservative opposition gained in key congressional battles across the country and erased the ruling coalition's Senate majority.
The opposition Juntos coalition, badly defeated in presidential elections in 2019, hammered the ruling Frente de Todos party by almost 20 points nationwide in the battle for the Senate, where a third of seats were up for grabs.
In the lower house, it won by a slightly smaller but still important margin of around eight percentage points, winning a close battle in the important province of Buenos Aires, the most populous region of the country and a Peronist stronghold.
""The people made themselves heard,"" said Beatriz Arguello, a housewife in her seventies in the capital city. ""Now we hope for some change.""
Argentine center-left President Alberto Fernandez said after the vote that he would listen to the people and pledged a new stage for the country. He called for the opposition to find consensus with the government.
That will be key after the Peronists lost their majority in the Senate, which they had held since 1983, meaning Fernandez and his more radical vice president, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, will need to reach across the aisle.
Local newspapers reacted to the defeat by splashing front pages with comments such as ""hard electoral defeat"" and ""devastating diagnosis."" The more party-allied Pagina 12 looked for positives: ""Defeat, but the fight goes on.""
Markets reacted mutely with sovereign bond prices up slightly. Analysts generally see the result as positive if it forces the government to work more closely with the opposition, favored by investors.
Voters, meanwhile, called on the government and opposition to get to work solving the country's many problems with inflation above 50% annually, the peso currency at record lows against the dollar and over four out of 10 people in poverty.
""It is a result that was expected. It is time for all politicians to get to work to get this country out of the hole it's in,"" said Heactor Lopez, 60, a small-business owner.
Opposition leaders cheered. Former President Mauricio Macri said the conservatives needed to build on the win, while party grandee Patricia Bullrich heralded the ""great choice"" by voters.
""The best thing: we managed to get the quorum from Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner in the Senate!"" she said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Government supporters pointed to an improvement versus the primary vote in September and a narrower defeat in Buenos Aires province, lost by just over one percentage point.
""They ended the day by asking please stop counting votes because the difference was getting smaller and smaller,"" said 35-year-old Jimena Cueva, who held out hope the ruling coalition could bounce back to win the presidential vote in 2023.

Shila Vilker, head of consultancy Trespuntozero, said the government had already ""paid"" a large part of the cost of defeat after the open primary vote, which led to a major cabinet reshuffle, though the loss of the Senate majority would hurt.
""I'd say it's a dignified defeat for the government, and a dignified non-catastrophic defeat gives it some air to continue,"" she said.

(Reuters) - U.S. Roman Catholic Bishops this week are expected to revisit whether President Joe Biden's support for abortion rights should disqualify him from receiving communion, an issue that has deepened rifts in the church since the Democrat took office.
At a Nov. 15-18 conference in Baltimore, the bishops are scheduled to vote on a document clarifying the meaning of Holy Communion, a sacrament central to the faith. A committee drafted the document after the bishops' June conference, where they debated whether to take a position on the eligibility of prominent Catholics such as Biden - whose political actions they say contradict church teaching - to receive communion.
Biden, the first Catholic president since John F. Kennedy, has said he personally opposes abortion but supports a woman's right to choose. He has vowed to protect abortion rights in the face of increasingly restrictive laws enacted by states; last month, his administration called on the Supreme Court to block a Texas law that bans abortions after six weeks.
The issue has divided the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and pitted more conservative Catholics against those who support the president's views. Some 55% of Catholics believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, compared to 59% of the general population, according to a Pew Research survey conducted in April. 
The debate has sown further discord as the church struggles to retain a fractured membership. Nearly 20% of U.S. Catholics have left the church in the past two decades, according to a Gallup poll in March, as sexual abuse scandals involving predatory priests have emerged and members have increasingly disagreed on social issues.
Biden met privately with Pope Francis at the Vatican last month and said afterward that the pope had told him he was a ""good Catholic"" who can receive communion.
Prior to that meeting, Pope Francis, whose liberal theology has ruffled many conservative Catholics since his election in 2013, appeared to criticize U.S. bishops for dealing with the issue in a political rather than a pastoral way.
""Communion is not a prize for the perfect. ... Communion is a gift, the presence of Jesus and his Church,"" the pope said, adding that bishops should use ""compassion and tenderness"" with Catholic politicians who support abortion rights.
THE DOCUMENT
At a virtual meeting in June, the bishops resolved to draft a document on the meaning of communion and debated how explicitly it should define who is eligible to receive the sacrament. During the debate, some conservative bishops argued that the conference had a duty to rebuke politicians such as Biden who they accuse of violating church teachings, and they called for a stricter standard for eligibility. Others cautioned against making the Eucharist a political weapon. 
Bishop Kevin Rhoades, chairman of the conference's Committee on Doctrine, described the upcoming document at a roundtable discussion in September, saying it would remind Catholics of the importance of the sacrament. He did not say whether it would state who should be considered worthy of receiving communion. 
A draft of the document, published earlier this month by the Catholic newsletter The Pillar, does not mention Biden or any politician by name, but states that ""people who exercise some form of public authority have a special responsibility to embody the church."" It says Catholics who live in a state of ""mortal sin"" without repentance should not receive communion, but does not say who should sit in judgment.
In 2004, the conference published a statement that said individual bishops could decide whether to deny communion to Catholic politicians who supported abortion rights.
A spokeswoman for the conference declined to comment on whether the draft published by The Pillar was the same one the bishops were scheduled to discuss and possibly amend this week. 
John Carr, co-director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life at Georgetown University, said the draft published in The Pillar succeeds at delivering a broader message about the Eucharist to all Catholics, without attacking Biden or other politicians. 

If the bishops vote to approve that language, ""I think the people who campaigned to deny communion to the president will be very disappointed,"" said Carr. 
""Others will be relieved that they found a way to move beyond this division and diversion.""

542,"<span>Nov 15, 2021 06:16AM ET</span>",,,,,,"KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) - Closing arguments are set to start Monday in the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse, the 18-year-old charged with murdering two men and wounding another during racial justice protests in the Wisconsin city of Kenosha last year. 
Rittenhouse, charged in the killing of Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and the wounding of Gaige Grosskreutz, 27, has pleaded not guilty and has said he acted in self-defense.
Here are some key moments from the trial:
Nov. 12 - The judge says he will instruct the jury they can consider the argument that the teenager provoked one attack, a decision that helps prosecutors. It would raise the bar for the teenager's effort to convince the jury that he acted in self-defense.
Kenosha County Judge Bruce Schroeder made the ruling after stepping down from the bench to watch grainy drone video of the Rosenbaum shooting with the defendant standing close behind him.
The judge also said on Friday he would allow the jury to consider lesser charges in the fatal shooting of Anthony Huber, one of two men Rittenhouse killed, but not consider a lesser charge in the shooting of Rosenbaum.
Nov. 11 - The defense lawyers rest their case.
Nov. 10 - Rittenhouse testifies that Rosenbaum twice threatened to kill him and ambushed him before their final encounter. 
Rittenhouse broke down sobbing as he recalled the events immediately before he shot Rosenbaum, prompting the judge to call for a recess. After returning to the stand, Rittenhouse testified that Rosenbaum charged at him, telling the jury, ""I remember his hand on the barrel of my gun."" 
Rittenhouse told the prosecution during cross examination: ""I did what I had to do to stop the person who was attacking me."" He admitted using deadly force but said he did not intend to kill anyone.
Nov. 9 - Nicholas Smith, who was in the same group of men as Rittenhouse who were protecting a used car dealership, said he spoke to Rittenhouse after he shot three people, describing him as nervous, sweating and pale.
""He repeats: ‘I just shot someone,’ over and over,"" said Smith. 
Nov. 8 - Gaige Grosskreutz, 27, the only protester shot by Rittenhouse to survive, testified that he had pointed his Glock pistol in Rittenhouse's direction and only advanced on the teenager as a last resort because he thought he ""was going to die.""
Under cross-examination by the defense, Grosskreutz said Rittenhouse did not fire when his hands were up and only did so when he moved toward Rittenhouse with his pistol pointed at him. 
""It wasn't until you pointed your gun at him, advanced on him, with your gun, now your hands down pointed at him, that he fired, right?"" asked Corey Chirafisi, Rittenhouse's lawyer.
""Correct,"" Grosskreutz responded.
The prosecution rests.
Nov. 5 - Jason Lackowski, a former Marine, was with Rittenhouse on the night of the shootings. Prior to the shootings, Lackowski said Rosenbaum had taunted him and other armed men. Lackowski answered ""no"" when asked whether he considered the unarmed Rosenbaum a threat.
Nov. 4 - Richie McGinniss - chief video director of the Daily Caller, a conservative website - said Rosenbaum yelled as he advanced toward Rittenhouse in the parking lot of a used-car dealership and then lunged for the youth's semi-automatic rifle.
Ryan Balch, a military veteran who was among the armed men with Rittenhouse at the used car dealership, testified that Rosenbaum was acting in a ""violent"" manner that night, throwing rocks and trying to set fires.
Nov. 3 - Video was the star witness at the second day of the trial.
Jurors saw a series of graphic videos showing the chaotic moments after Rittenhouse shot three protesters, including one man who lay motionless and bleeding and another screaming as blood gushed from his arm.

The jury was also shown video of Rittenhouse fleeing the scene of the Rosenbaum shooting and being chased by a growing crowd of protesters, some of them yelling things like ""Get him"" before he has a series of violent encounters. 
Nov. 2 - Jurors hear opening arguments. Prosecutors portrayed Rittenhouse a vigilante killer, repeating seven times that the teenager was the only person to have shot anyone that night. The defense said Rittenhouse opened fire in self-defense and in response to attacks by a mob.

543,"<span>Nov 15, 2021 05:35AM ET</span>",,,,,,"KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) - A jury will soon decide the fate of Kyle Rittenhouse, 18, who is on trial over the killing two men and wounding a third with a military-style rifle during protests last year in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
Before the killings, Kenosha had endured two nights of chaotic protests over the police shooting of a local Black man, Jacob Blake. Several businesses were burned to the ground and there were incidents of looting. Police used rubber bullets and tear gas to control the crowds. 
The following is based on court testimony, drone footage and videos from Aug. 25, 2020:
* During the day, Rittenhouse helps clean graffiti off a school. That same day Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, is released from a Milwaukee hospital where he had been admitted after a suicide attempt. 
* Around 10 p.m. video shows Rittenhouse with a rifle standing with other armed men near a used-car dealership. Rittenhouse testified he was asked to help guard the business due to the threat of looting and arson. He brought a medical kit and says his objective was to provide aid to anyone injured.
* Around 10:45 p.m., another video shows Rittenhouse asking police officers for water. One officer says: ""We appreciate you guys. We really do.""
* Around 11:45 p.m. Rosenbaum chases Rittenhouse into a used-car lot as Rittenhouse yells ""Friendly, friendly, friendly."" Rosenbaum throws a plastic bag containing toiletries at Rittenhouse.
* Rittenhouse testified that Rosenbaum grabbed his gun. A journalist for the Daily Caller, a conservative website, testified that Rosenbaum lunged for the rifle. Rittenhouse fires his gun at Rosenbaum, hitting him four times and killing him.
* Video shows Rittenhouse fleeing the scene of the Rosenbaum shooting and being chased by a growing crowd, some yelling ""Get him!""
* Just minutes later, after stumbling to the ground, Rittenhouse fatally shoots Anthony Huber, a 26-year-old who swung a skateboard at him. 
* After Huber was shot, Gaige Grosskreutz, now 27, stops moving toward Rittenhouse and put his hands in the air. He was holding a handgun. When Grosskreutz resumes advancing, Rittenhouse shoots him, severing most of his bicep. Rittenhouse testified that Grosskreutz had his pistol pointed at his head.

* Rittenhouse then walks toward the police with his hands up and the rifle slung across his body. Police order him to get out of the way and one officer pepper sprays Rittenhouse when he approaches the window of the patrol car. The police then drive off, believing the active shooter was elsewhere.
* Around 1:30 a.m. on Aug. 26, Rittenhouse, accompanied by his mother, turns himself into a police station in his hometown of Antioch, Illinois.

KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) - While the spotlight has focused on U.S. teenager Kyle Rittenhouse and the three men he shot in Kenosha, Wisconsin, the judge in the case has at times taken center stage in the murder trial.
Throughout the two weeks of testimony, Kenosha County Judge Bruce Schroeder and the prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger, have clashed.
The two could go head-to-head again on Monday when closing arguments start. Each side will get 2-1/2 hours to address the jury.
Schroeder's instructions to the jury could also play a prominent role in the most high-profile civilian self-defense trial since George Zimmerman was acquitted in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Black teenager, in Florida in 2013. 
So who is the judge presiding over the Wisconsin case?
LONG CAREER
Schroeder, 75, received both his bachelor's and law degree from Marquette University, a private Jesuit school in Milwaukee, according to media reports. He served as Kenosha County's district attorney before going into private practice. In 1983, he was appointed to the court and is the longest-serving active judge in Wisconsin's trial courts, according to the reports. 
He ran unopposed for office in 2020 for a six-year term. 
PATRIOTIC PERSONALITY
The trial has provided some glimpses into his personality. On Veterans Day, he asked everyone to give a round of applause to those who served in the military. The judge then asked if anyone in the courtroom had served. Only one person indicated they had, a witness for the defense.
At multiple times throughout the trial, the judge's cell phone has sounded with the ringtone of ""God Bless the USA.""
As the court was preparing to break for lunch on Thursday, Schroeder joked about Asian food.
""I hope the Asian food isn't coming ... isn't on one of those boats from Long Beach Harbor,"" Schroeder said, referring to the Port of Long Beach, a major gateway for U.S.-Asian trade experiencing congestion and delays. 
The comment prompted criticism from groups working for racial equity such as Asian Americans Advancing Justice.
YES TO LOOTERS, NO TO VICTIMS
Before the start of the trial, the judge ruled that the three men shot by Rittenhouse could be called looters and arsonists, if the evidence supported those descriptions, while banning the word victim to describe them, as he said was customary in his courtroom. He told prosecutors to call them ""complaining witness"" or ""decedent"".
""This is a long-held opinion of mine, which very few judges, I guess, share with me,"" Schroeder said.
'DON'T GET BRAZEN'
Rittenhouse testified in his own defense last week, saying he opened fire with his AR-15-style rifle to protect himself after being attacked. 
Twice during cross-examination, Schroeder asked the jury to leave the courtroom and then sharply admonished Binger for his line of questioning.
The judge excoriated Binger for asking Rittenhouse about his decision to remain silent after his arrest, as was his right, and about a video recorded two weeks before the shootings in which the teen talked about shooting men he thought were shoplifting at a pharmacy.
Schroeder had already ruled the video inadmissible. He erupted at Binger after the jury left the courtroom. 
""When you say you were acting in good faith, I don't believe you,"" the judge said to Binger. At one point, he barked at Binger: ""Don't get brazen with me!""
The defense made a motion for a mistrial. The judge said he would consider the matter, but let the trial proceed.
MORE CONFLICT
The tensions resurfaced on Thursday when Binger argued against a defense attempt to present an updated report from use-of-force expert John Black, who took the witness stand to analyze video of the shootings. Binger said the report contained evidence the judge had already ruled could not be admitted.

""Yesterday I was the target of your ire for disregarding your orders. Today the defense is disregarding your order,"" Binger said, adding that ""fundamental fairness"" was the issue at stake. ""If I'm being held to obey the court's orders, I'm asking that the defense be held to that to.""
Schroeder responded: ""I was talking yesterday about the Constitution of the United States,"" referring to Rittenhouse's right to remain silent. ""That's not what we are talking about here today.""

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) -Argentina's ruling Peronist party was reeling on Sunday after a midterm vote that saw its center-left coalition lose its majority in Congress for the first time in almost 40 years and taste defeat in its stronghold province of Buenos Aires.
The conservative opposition, which was badly defeated in a presidential election two years ago, won almost all the key races in the legislative ballot, as voters turned away from the government amid spiraling inflation and growing poverty.
""Today we took a huge step,"" said Horacio Rodríguez Larreta, opposition mayor of Buenos Aires city, who is considered to be a potential presidential candidate in a 2023 election. ""We have a huge opportunity, let's look forward.""
President Alberto Fernandez, in an address to the nation, went on the defensive, reaching across the aisle and calling for ""patriotic"" cooperation from the opposition, which will now be needed to push legislation through Congress.
Taking a moderate tone, Fernandez vowed to resolve the country's debt with the International Monetary Fund, tackle the ""evil"" of inflation and send a long-term economic plan to Congress in early December, something investors and the IMF have sought amid negotiations over a new deal with the Fund.
""In this new stage, we will deepen our efforts to reach a sustainable agreement with the IMF. We must clear the uncertainties that come with this sort of unsustainable debt,"" Fernandez said in an address to the nation.
The vote saw half the seats in the lower Chamber of Deputies up for grabs and a third in the Senate, with voters focused on high levels of poverty exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and rampant inflation that saps wages and savings.
""I know very few people who make enough money to get to the end of the month,"" said Ricardo Arese, 69, a security guard in the capital, Buenos Aires. His household expenses have risen 300% since 2016, he said, and he sees little reason for optimism.
""We're looking at a very tough two years ahead.""
'ALL CHANGE'
Voting went smoothly under sunny skies in the southern hemisphere spring, but many voters were angry or downcast.
""I'm here to vote with the hope that everything will change. We are tired,"" said Mirta Laria, 62, a housewife in Buenos Aires. ""Every day we are a bit worse off and the sad thing is that our children only see a way out for their life abroad.""
President Fernandez's popularity was hit due to COVID-19 lockdowns, inflation and a currency that is falling to record lows against the U.S. dollar despite strict capital controls. 
Ignacio Labaqui, Argentina analyst at New York-based consultancy Medley Global Advisors, said a big loss would mean Fernandez would be left with ""little political power, as a part of coalition full of internal grievances and with a pile of economic problems to fix, starting with inflation.""
'PERONIST FAMILY'
The governing coalition held 41 of the 72 seats in the Senate and makes up the largest bloc in the lower house. That majority now looks likely to be lost.

The death of Ezra Blount brought the total number of those killed during a stampede at last week's Astroworld Festival to ten, ranging in age from 9 to 27. 
The deaths took place when the Grammy Award-nominated rapper Scott appeared before a crowd of 50,000 at NRG Stadium. The scene grew out of control as fans surged toward the stage. 
""The Blount family tonight is grieving the incomprehensible loss of their precious young son,"" said attorney Ben Crump. ""This should not have been the outcome of taking their son to a concert."" 
Crump has said that any one of several concert officials could have prevented deaths and injuries by stopping the show and turning on the house lights when the chaos in the crowd became apparent.

Crump and other attorneys for those hurt at the festival have filed scores of lawsuits against Scott and the organizers, alleging negligence in crowd control, failure to provide proper medical attention and a lack of emergency preparations, among other issues. 
Scott on Thursday asked victims and their families to reach out to him, saying he ""desperately wishes to share his condolences and provide aid,"" according to a statement. The rapper earlier offered to pay for funeral costs and mental health counseling.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to use his first virtual meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden to warn the United States to ""step back"" on the Taiwan issue, according to Chinese state media editorials printed on Monday.
Xi and Biden are scheduled to meet virtually on Tuesday morning Beijing time - Monday evening in Washington - as friction between the countries persist across a range of issues including trade, technology, Xinjiang and especially Taiwan, a self-ruled island claimed by China.
An editorial in the English language China Daily on Monday said that it was likely that Xi would impress upon Biden that Beijing is resolved to ""realise national reunification in the foreseeable future no matter the cost"".
State media outlets such as China Daily are briefed by authorities on important issues such as China-U.S. relations and have been accurate in reflecting the priorities of Chinese leaders.
""The Taiwan question is the ultimate red line of China"", wrote a Monday editorial by Global Times, a tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily.
""In order to reduce the risk of a strategic collision between China and the U.S., the latter must take a step back from the Taiwan question and show its restraint,"" it wrote.
In a call with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday, senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi warned Washington against sending the wrong signals to Taiwan pro-independence forces.
Some experts said China's emphasis on Taiwan amidst other friction points reflects its reluctance to be drawn into armed conflict with the United States unnecessarily, despite its recent words and actions, including sending an unprecedented number of planes into Taiwan's air defence zone.
""Chinese leaders are aware that China has not completed its modernisation and still faces many challenges in its domestic economy,"" said Li Mingjiang, associate professor at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.

""A war could severely disrupt this modernisation and set back its rise,"" he told Reuters.
China also does not have full confidence that it can secure a clear military victory at this stage, Li said.

A male passenger in the car was declared dead at the scene, while the male driver was injured and was in hospital in a stable condition, police said. 
Counter-terrorism officers said they were investigating the case with local police and that they were keeping an open mind as to what had happened.

Rodgers was removed from the NFL's reserve/COVID-19 list on Saturday after going through a mandatory 10-day quarantine following a positive COVID-19 test last week.
The 37-year-old, who is unvaccinated, sat out the Packers' loss to the Kansas City Chiefs last Sunday due to the NFL's COVID-19 protocols, which call for a mandatory 10-day quarantine period for unvaccinated players who test positive.
Rodgers completed 23 of 37 passes for 292 yards with no touchdowns and an interception in Sunday's game at Lambeau Field as the Packers (8-2) returned to winning ways. 
""A lot of emotions, for sure,"" Rodgers said after the game. ""Good to be back with the guys, good to be back at home, good to be back on the field, really. 
""Most emotions from the whole night was probably walking off the field after the game. 

""Definitely got me a little misty heading off. So that was good to feel all those emotions and good to be back with the guys."" Rodgers received widespread criticism for telling reporters in August that he was ""immunized"" when he was asked if he had been vaccinated.
Rodgers said he has an allergy to an ingredient in the mRNA vaccines produced by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc and so he declined to take those. He did not take the Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) vaccine due to concern about side effects, he said. The NFL on Wednesday fined the Packers $300,000 and two players, including Rodgers, $14,650 each for violating COVID-19 protocols.

Youth-led protests that began last year by calling for the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, 66, a former coup leader, have become the biggest challenge in decades to the monarchy which is constitutionally enshrined to be held in ""revered worship"".
Protesters marched against rows of riot police behind shields, waving placards that read ""No absolute monarchy"" and ""Reform is not abolition"". 
""The king's increased powers in recent years are pulling Thailand away from democracy and back to absolute monarchy,"" a protester read in a statement after the demonstration reached the German embassy in Bangkok. 
""This is a fight to insist that this country must be ruled by a system in which everyone is equal.""
Protesters also marched to the German embassy in October last year to urge Germany to investigate whether King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who spends much of his time in the country, was conducting state business from there.
""The word 'reform' is not equivalent to abolition,"" said protester Peeyawith Ploysuwan, 25. ""You (authorities) only want to do the things you desire and see people with opposing views as bad guys... If society continues like this, how can we move forward?""
The protests have broken longstanding taboos in Thailand, whose lese majeste law sets jail terms of up to 15 years for anyone convicted of defaming the monarchy. 
Since the protests began last year, at least 157 people have been charged under the law, according to records compiled by the Thai Lawyers for Human Rights group.

Sunday's protest came in response to the Constitutional Court's ruling last week that a call for reforms to the monarchy by three protest leaders in August last year was unconstitutional and designed to topple the institution. 
Three protesters were wounded on Sunday, a police spokesman said, adding that the incidents were being investigated.

551,"<span>Nov 14, 2021 07:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- COP26 took fourteen days and some long nights of negotiations. It produced breakthrough pledges, a set of rules on carbon trading and some big aspirations that will have to be scrutinized against real action in the years ahead. Here’s what you need to know.
Coal  Target  (NYSE:TGT)
For the first time, a COP text takes on coal, the most polluting fossil fuel, and goes further than the G-20 had done before.  It was watered down at the last-minute to a pledge to “phase down” rather than “phase out” unabated coal power, but the inclusion is still a significant signal.  India and China’s resistance is a reminder it will take a long time to wean the world off coal.  
China-U.S. Deal
The biggest surprise in Glasgow was an agreement by the two biggest emitters to work together on climate. No big concrete action, but good news the pair are at least talking on climate amid the broader diplomatic standoff. China had been all but absent from the talks until then. President Joe Biden meets Chinese President Xi Jinping virtually on Monday.
Carbon-Trading Rules
Hard-won and long-awaited. The rules on international carbon trading bring clarity to companies and standardization that should help reduce emissions, though some activists are worried they aren’t quite tight enough and more needs to be done to bolster scrutiny. The pressure to pin down rules was growing as the voluntary market for offsets grows in an unregulated sprawl. By some estimates the market could eventually be worth $100 billion.
Fossil Fuel Taboo
The Glasgow pact called for an end to inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. While that language has knocked around in G-20 communiques for years — to little effect — activists were encouraged by the symbolism of it finally making its way into a COP accord, which is signed off by almost 200 countries. G-20 nations spent $600 billion subsidizing fossil fuels last year, something U.S. climate envoy John Kerry labeled “insanity.” 
Methane Pledge 
More than 100 countries agreed to slash methane; and there's a reference to methane for the first time in the overall pact. It’s not binding, but again, a powerful signal that it’s time to tackle emissions that are much more potent than CO2. Russia and China didn’t sign up.
Crank Up the Plans
Countries have to come back next year with better climate plans. But there’s a get-out clause. As things stand, countries’ climate plans, known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs, put the planet on track for 2.7 degrees of warming. And we’re still waiting for India to submit the one it was meant to hand in before COP. The thing to watch now is whether countries actually get cracking on new plans.
Scrutiny 
New rules were agreed that will allow for greater scrutiny on emissions reporting. At last, climate targets should be comparable, allowing for everyone to assess what everyone else is doing. This is an important bit of progress.
Cash for Damage
For the first time, there’s a recognition that countries struck by catastrophic climate events will get help. There’s an agreement to properly set up a mechanism — though the finer details and exact cash still need to be hashed out. That’s something for COP27, in Egypt next year. Rich countries failed to meet a pledge to provide $100 billion in climate finance, a failure that casts a shadow on the result.
Banks
Former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney cajoled banks, investors and insurers representing $130 trillion in assets to decarbonize their businesses by mid-century. Finance is a powerful tool in the fight against climate change but the list doesn’t include the world’s three biggest banks, all of which are Chinese and major providers of coal finance.  Even for the banks signing up, the key test is whether they stop financing fossil fuels.
And It All Adds Up To...
If all the pledges come to pass, and it’s a big if, it puts us on course for warming of 1.8 degrees Celsius, according to the International Energy Agency. That’s much better than where we were on the way into COP, but still way above what’s safe.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -More than a dozen shipowners have made payments of about $300,000 apiece to release vessels detained by the Indonesian navy, which said they were anchored illegally in Indonesian waters near Singapore, according to sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
The dozen sources include shipowners, crew and maritime security sources all involved in the detentions and payments, which they say were either made in cash to naval officers or via bank transfer to intermediaries who told them they represented the Indonesian navy.
Reuters was not able to independently confirm that payments were made to naval officers or establish who the final recipients of the payments were.
The detentions and payments were first reported by Lloyd's List Intelligence, an industry website. 
Rear Admiral Arsyad Abdullah, the Indonesian naval fleet commander for the region, said in a written response to Reuters' questions that no payments were made to the navy and also that it did not employ any intermediaries in legal cases.
""It is not true that the Indonesian navy received or asked for payment to release the ships,"" Abdullah said.
He said there had been an increasing number of detentions of ships in the past three months for anchoring without permission in Indonesian waters, deviating from the sailing route or stopping mid-course for an unreasonable amount of time. All the detentions were in accordance with Indonesian law, Abdullah said.
The Singapore Strait, one of the busiest waterways in the world, is crowded with vessels waiting for days or weeks to dock at Singapore, a regional shipping hub where the COVID-19 pandemic has led to long delays. 
Ships have for years anchored in waters to the east of the Strait while they wait to port, believing they are in international waters and therefore not responsible for any port fees, two maritime analysts and two shipowners said. 
The Indonesian navy says this area comes within its territorial waters and it intends to crack down harder on vessels anchoring there without a licence. 
A spokesperson for the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, a government agency, declined to comment. 
CRAMPED DETENTION
Around 30 ships, including tankers, bulk carriers and a pipeline layer, have been detained by the Indonesian navy in the last three months and the majority have since been released after making payments of $250,000 to $300,000, according to two shipowners and two maritime security sources involved.
Making these payments is cheaper than potentially losing out on revenue from ships carrying valuable cargo, like oil or grain, if they are tied up for months while a case is heard in Indonesian court, two shipowners said.
Two crew members of detained ships said armed navy sailors approached their vessels on warships, boarded them and escorted the ships to naval bases on Batam or Bintan, Indonesian islands south of Singapore, across the Strait. 
The ship captains and often crew members were detained in cramped, sweltering rooms, sometimes for weeks, until shipowners organised cash to be delivered or a bank transfer was made to an intermediary of the navy, two detained crew members said.
Abdullah, the Indonesian naval officer, said ship crew members were not detained. 
""During the legal process, all crew of the ships were on board their ships, except for questioning at the naval base. After the questioning, they were sent back to the ships,"" he said. 
Stephen Askins, a London-based maritime lawyer who has advised owners whose vessels have been detained in Indonesia, said the navy was entitled to protect its waters but if a ship was detained, then some form of prosecution should follow. 
""In a situation where the Indonesian navy seems to be detaining vessels with an intention to extort money it is difficult to see how such a detention could be lawful,"" Askins told Reuters in an email. He declined to give details about his clients. 
Marine Lieutenant Colonel La Ode Muhamad Holib, an Indonesian navy spokesperson, told Reuters in a written response to questions that some vessels detained in the last three months had been released without charge due to insufficient evidence.

Five ship captains were being prosecuted and two others had been given short prison sentences and fined 100 million rupiah ($7,000) and 25 million rupiah, respectively, Holib said, declining to elaborate further on the specific cases.

SOFIA (Reuters) -Bulgaria's new centrist political party was seen winning parliamentary elections on Sunday, according to four exit polls, increasing chances of an end to a political deadlock in the European Union's poorest member state.
Political wrangling prevented opponents of former Premier Boyko Borissov from building a government after the previous two elections in April and July. Bulgarians have grown tired of the impasse, which was seen hampering the country's economic prospects amid a rise in COVID-19 cases overwhelming hospitals.
The new centrist anti-graft party, We Continue The Change, was seen leading with about 26% of the vote, new exit polls by Alpha Research, Gallup International, Market Links and Trend showed. The pollsters saw Borissov's centre-right GERB party in second with about 23-24%.
Market Links said the new party got 26.5% support. Gallup International also sees the new party ahead with 26.3%. 
""Bulgaria is headed onto a new path,"" centrist party leader Kiril Petkov told reporters, saying the party understood the responsibility to forge a working government.
Analysts said the new party looked better positioned to seal a coalition with the support of two small anti-corruption groupings and the Socialists. But they said tough talks lie ahead.
Petkov promised to be open to dialogue and compromises but said his party would not step back from plans to overhaul the judiciary and clamp down on corruption. He said replacing the chief prosecutor and bolstering the anti-corruption agency would be the key issues in coalition talks.
In the presidential vote also held on Sunday, incumbent Rumen Radev, a harsh critic of Borissov, was seen winning around 50% support in the first-round vote and looked poised to win a runoff for the largely ceremonial post on Nov. 21. 
POLITICAL DIVISIONS
The close poll results on Sunday underscore deep political divisions after a decade-long rule by Borissov, 62, a former bodyguard of late Communist dictator Todor Zhivkov. 
""The question remains if all GERB's opponents would stick to their pledges to avoid supporting GERB for a government. If that is the case, we will be facing a four-party coalition,"" political analyst Daniel Smilov said.
The election coincides with high energy costs and anger at widespread corruption in Bulgaria. While new COVID-19 cases https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/bulgaria are dropping from a record high, hospitals are still overwhelmed and the death rate remains one of the highest in the EU.
We Continue the Change was set up by Harvard-educated entrepreneurs Petkov and Assen Vassilev in September. 
""We are promising zero corruption. This is what we are going after. No small tolerance, nothing, zero,"" Petkov told Reuters.

The exit polls also showed an ultranationalist party, Revival, which strongly opposes COVID-19 restrictions, crossing the 4% threshold for entering parliament.
Voter turnout was at a record low, about 25.5%, three hours before polls closed, data from the electoral commission showed. Partial official results are due after midnight.

HAJNOWKA, Poland (Reuters) -NATO must take ""concrete steps"" to resolve the migrant crisis on the Belarus border, the Polish prime minister was quoted as saying on Sunday, adding that Poland, Lithuania and Latvia may ask for consultations under the alliance's treaty.
Thousands of migrants have travelled to Belarus in the hope of crossing into the European Union (EU), only to find themselves trapped on the border https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/polish-police-find-body-syrian-man-near-belarus-border-2021-11-13 in freezing conditions.
The EU accuses Minsk of orchestrating the crisis to put pressure on the bloc over sanctions, but Belarus has repeatedly denied this. Some countries https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-says-nato-drills-black-sea-are-serious-challenge-moscow-2021-11-13 in the region have warned the stand-off could escalate into a military conflict.
""It is not enough just for us to publicly express our concern - now we need concrete steps and the commitment of the entire alliance,"" Mateusz Morawiecki told Polish state-run news agency PAP.
Under Article 4 of the NATO treaty, any ally can request consultations whenever, in the opinion of any of them, their territorial integrity, political independence or security is threatened.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, a key backer of Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko, said that Russia was ready to help resolve the crisis, RIA news agency reported on Sunday, citing an interview on a state TV channel.
Morawiecki told PAP that EU leaders would discuss further sanctions against Belarus, including completely closing the border.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell was quoted as saying that the bloc will widen sanctions on Belarus on Monday to include airlines and travel agencies thought to be involved in transporting migrants.
Morawiecki said that the EU should jointly finance a border wall.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau on Saturday and said Belarus' actions threaten regional security and distract from Russian military activities on the Ukraine border, State Department spokesman Ned Price said.
""Secretary Blinken reaffirmed U.S. support for Poland in the face of the Lukashenka regime’s cynical exploitation of vulnerable migrants,"" Price said in a statement on Sunday.
BORDER TENSION
Meanwhile, Polish forces described an increasingly tense situation on the frontier, with the Border Guard saying migrants were receiving instructions and equipment from Belarusian guards and it expected another ""big attempt"" to break through.
""Huge logs of wood are being brought in, probably to lower the fence,"" Border Guard spokeswoman Katarzyna Zdanowicz told private broadcaster TVN24.
Belarusian blogging service NEXTA shared a video of what it said was a large column of migrants walking towards the frontier.
Footage posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) by the Polish Interior Ministry showed what appeared to be a water cannon deployed at the border, as a recorded message warned migrants that force could be used against them if they did not follow orders.
NGO Grupa Granica said in a statement it had received information about attempts by Belarus to force migrants to use violence against Polish officers.
""Due to the risk of escalation of violence we want to remind all parties that migrants are not aggressors but hostages of Lukashenko's regime,"" it wrote.
The Belarusian State Border Guard Committee spokesperson Anton Bychkovsky said the accusations were disinformation. ""It does not correspond with the reality,"" he said

On Saturday, a group of about 50 migrants broke through defences on the border and entered Poland near the village of Starzyna, police said on Sunday. The Border Guard told PAP they were all caught.

QUITO/GUAYAQUIL (Reuters) - Ecuador's government said on Sunday it was moving ahead with identifying the bodies of 68 people killed the day before during violence at the Penitenciaria del Litoral prison.
The country's prison system has come under a spotlight for overcrowding, poor living conditions for inmates, and violence the government blames on gang rivalries. 
The penitentiary, in the southern city of Guayaquil, is the same prison where 119 inmates were killed in September in the country's worst incident of prison violence in recent history.
""Thirty-four bodies have been identified already ... forensics continues working on the identification of the other dead,"" the office of President Guillermo Lasso said in a statement, adding remains would be returned to families in the coming hours.
Twenty-five people were injured.
Dozens of family members gathered outside the police morgue on Sunday seeking information or waiting to retrieve bodies.
""The state is responsible for this massacre. Every day our sons and brothers die in the prisons,"" said Nestor Soriano, 56, as he looked for news of his son, who is serving a six-year sentence. ""There are no (safety) guarantees for him. They think to return him to me in a box. I don't want that.""
In September, Lasso declared a 60-day state of emergency in the prison system, freeing up government funding and allowing for limited military assistance. 
The government said it met with human rights groups, the Catholic Church and United Nations staff to ""coordinate cooperation in the pacification process.""

Lasso has called on the constitutional court to let the military enter prisons, instead of providing only outside security. The court has said a solution to the prison crisis will require more than temporary emergency measures.
The country's 36 detention centers - which house some 39,000 people - were all under control on Sunday, the SNAI prison authority said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's Queen Elizabeth missed the Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph due to a sprained back, extending the 95-year-old monarch's absence from public life after she was ordered to rest following a stay in hospital last month. 
A Buckingham Palace source said the sprain was unrelated to the unspecified ailment that caused the queen's hospital visit, calling it an ""incredibly unfortunate coincidence"".
But Elizabeth's absence from an engagement she sees as one of the most significant of the year will increase concerns about her health.
The ceremony would have been the queen's first in-person public engagement since she was advised to rest after spending a night in hospital https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/queen-elizabeth-spent-night-hospital-palace-says-2021-10-21 on Oct. 20-21. 
""Her Majesty is disappointed that she will miss the service,"" the palace said in a statement earlier on Sunday.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Sunday evening he had seen the queen last week and wanted to reassure the nation that she was well.
""I did see the queen for an audience last week, on Wednesday in Windsor, and she's very well,"" he told reporters.
In her 69 years on the throne, the monarch https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/queen-elizabeth-britains-longest-reigning-monarch-2021-10-21 had previously missed the event at the Cenotaph War Memorial in central London only six times, four while on tour abroad and twice while pregnant. 
The ceremony is held on the nearest Sunday to Nov. 11 to mark the end of World War One. The sight of the queen at the event has been one of the defining images of her reign through the decades: head bowed, wearing black and displaying a red poppy.
WREATH LAYING
The royal family joins leading members of the government, overseas representatives, and military on Remembrance Sunday to lay wreaths in commemoration of those who lost their lives in conflict.
In recent years, the queen's son and heir, Prince Charles, has laid a wreath on her behalf while she watches from a balcony at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. 
Charles, who turned 73 on Sunday, laid the wreath again this year, while his wife Camilla, along with Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, watched from the balcony.
Thousands of veterans later marched past the Cenotaph, led by the band of the Coldstream Guards. 
The queen is the world's oldest and longest-reigning monarch. Since being advised to rest, she has missed events such as the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow and a festival to remember the nation's war dead on Saturday evening. 
The palace source said the queen hoped to continue as planned with her schedule of light official duties this week. The queen has recently been photographed meeting dignitaries online. 

Attending the Cenotaph event would have required the queen to make a car journey from her residence at Windsor Castle, west of London, and to stand for a period of time.
In April her husband of more than seven decades, Prince Philip, died aged 99.

The protests came two days after army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan announced a new ruling council that excludes the civilian coalition the military had been sharing power with since 2019, hardening opposition among pro-democracy groups to the Oct. 25 coup. 
In a sign authorities may be stepping up efforts to quash a campaign of planned protests and civil disobedience, security forces moved to disperse protesters as soon as they began to gather in the early afternoon. They fired tear gas and chased demonstrators down side streets to prevent them reaching central meeting points, witnesses said.
Previously, security forces had waited until later in the day before moving in.
""People were surprised that they fired the tear gas so early,"" said one protester in Omdurman across the Nile from central Khartoum, adding that demonstrators retreated, barricaded streets, and then reassembled. 
Most protesters dispersed of their own accord around sunset, though tear gas and gunfire continued until around 8 p.m. in Khartoum North as security forces arrested protesters and removed their barricades, witnesses said. 
Witnesses estimated the numbers around Khartoum to be in the tens of thousands, with large crowds in other cities bringing the total nationwide to hundreds of thousands.
""The revolutionaries have nothing but peacefulness and are calling for democracy and bringing back civilian rule which was taken away by Burhan,"" said Mohamed Hamed, a protester in Khartoum who held up the cases of two of the bullets he said were being used against protesters.
In Wad Madani, south-east of Khartoum, protesters chanted ""Down, down with military rule"", a witness told Reuters. Protesters in other cities, including Al Gadarif and Kosti, were also met with tear gas, witnesses said. 
'HOSPITAL STORMED'
The Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors, which is aligned with the protest movement, said demonstrations in Khartoum were ""facing excessive repression using all forms of force including live bullets"".
In Khartoum and its twin cities of Omdurman and Khartoum North four people were killed by live fire and one after suffocating from tear gas, the committee said. It said access to hospitals was difficult and that security forces had stormed Al Arbaeen hospital in Omdurman, beating medical staff and arresting injured protesters.
A medic at Khartoum's Royal Care hospital told Reuters it had received one fatality and 29 wounded, including some with serious injuries.
""People should not stop, I was beaten but I have to go back to protest tomorrow,"" said one of the wounded demonstrators, declining to be named. ""It's good that I'm alive but I wanted to be a martyr. I said goodbye before I left home."" 
Sudanese police said they did not use firearms during the protests, which they said began peacefully but went off track. They said 39 policemen were injured and stations were attacked, triggering arrests.
A military spokesman suggested the protests had failed. Burhan has previously said peaceful protests are allowed and the military does not kill protesters.
The military takeover upended a transition towards democracy that began after the uprising that toppled autocrat Omar al-Bashir in April 2019. Security forces detained senior officials appointed under a power-sharing arrangement between the military and civilian groups. Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok was placed under house arrest.
On Saturday, protesters carried pictures of Hamdok, now a symbol of resistance to military rule, while chanting against Burhan and his deputy Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, commander of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. 
INTERNET CUT
Mobile internet services have remained cut in Sudan since the coup, despite a court order to restore them, complicating efforts by the protest movement. 
Local resistance committees had used flyers and organised smaller neighbourhood protests in recent days. 
Despite widespread opposition from Sudan's political parties and pressure from Western powers that backed the transition, Burhan has pushed to consolidate the military's position https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/sudans-military-rulers-draw-bashir-era-veterans-tighten-grip-2021-11-11. He has denied staging a coup, saying the army moved to correct the transition and accusing civilian groups of inciting unrest. 
Malik Agar, one of three former rebel leaders named in the Sovereign Council, whose position on the military takeover had been unclear, told Sky News Arabia on Saturday that he considered it a coup which faced ""many challenges"". 
Western states and the World Bank have suspended economic assistance designed to help pull Sudan out of decades of isolation and a deep economic crisis.

The United States and other Western powers expressed grave concern at Burhan's appointment of the Sovereign Council. 
The U.S. mission in Khartoum said: ""The U.S. Embassy deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries of dozens of Sudanese citizens demonstrating today for freedom and democracy, and condemns the excessive use of force.""

KABUL (Reuters) - Taliban forces held a military parade in Kabul on Sunday using captured American-made armoured vehicles and Russian helicopters in a display that showed their ongoing transformation from an insurgent force to a regular standing army.
The Taliban operated as insurgent fighters for two decades but have used the large stock of weapons and equipment left behind when the former Western-backed government collapsed in August to overhaul their forces.
The parade was linked to the graduation of 250 freshly trained soldiers, defence ministry spokesman Enayatullah Khwarazmi said.
The exercise involved dozens of U.S.-made M117 armoured security vehicles driving slowly up and down a major Kabul road with MI-17 helicopters patrolling overhead. Many soldiers carried American made-M4 assault rifles.
Most of the weapons and equipment the Taliban forces are now using are those supplied by Washington to the American-backed government in Kabul in a bid to construct an Afghan national force capable of fighting the Taliban.
Those forces melted away with the fleeing of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani from Afghanistan - leaving the Taliban to take over major military assets. 
Taliban officials have said that pilots, mechanics and other specialists from the former Afghan National Army would be integrated into a new force, which has also started wearing conventional military uniforms in place of the traditional Afghan clothing normally worn by their fighters.
According to a report late last year by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (Sigar), the U.S. government transferred to the Afghan government more than $28 billion worth of defence articles and services, including weapons, ammunition, vehicles, night-vision devices, aircraft, and surveillance systems, from 2002 to 2017.

Some of the aircraft were flown into neighbouring Central Asian Countries by fleeing Afghan forces, but the Taliban have inherited other aircraft. It remains unclear how many are operational. 
As the U.S. troops departed, they destroyed more than 70 aircraft, dozens of armoured vehicles and disabled air defences before flying out of Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport following a chaotic evacuation operation.

Yemeni forces backed by the United Arab Emirates had on Friday announced they were redeploying from around Yemen's main port in the west, a move which a U.N. monitoring mission and the government said they had no advance notice of.
The Saudi-backed government and the Iran-aligned Houthis, who hold Hodeidah city, had in 2018 agreed a United Nations-sponsored pact for a truce in Hodeidah that largely held and a troop withdrawal by both sides, stalled since 2019.
Coalition warplanes launched air strikes on Al Faza area south of Hodeidah as Houthi fighters battled UAE-backed forces until midnight, two military sources and residents said.
Al Faza lies 15 km (9 miles) from coalition-held Al-Khokha, to which hundreds of Yemenis have fled after the Houthi advance.
A U.N. mission overseeing the Hodeidah pact, UNMHA, urged both sides to ensure the safety of civilians, saying it ""was not informed in advance of the movements"". The Saudi-backed government's team for UNMHA also said it had no prior knowledge.
In a sign of differences among pro-coalition forces, the Red Sea coastal plain Tihama fighters on Sunday condemned the ""unjustified withdrawal"".
REDEPLOYMENT
It was not clear if the pullback in Hodeidah was linked to what the Saudi-led alliance had described as a redeployment in south Yemen, where sources said the Saudi military had left a main base in Aden, the interim seat of government.
Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, in an interview with France 24 TV on Saturday, reiterated a coalition denial that the Saudi military was withdrawing, saying ""there continues to be strong support for the government of Yemen and (coalition) forces"".
The alliance intervened in Yemen in 2015 after the Houthis ousted the government from the capital, Sanaa. The conflict is seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system and foreign aggression.

Washington is pressing Riyadh to lift a coalition blockade on Houthi-held ports, a condition from the group for ceasefire talks. 
Hodeidah is the main entry point for commercial goods and aid flows and a lifeline for millions facing starvation in what the U.N. describes as the world's biggest humanitarian crisis.

MANILA (Reuters) -Philippine voters were bracing on Sunday for more drama in a presidential race that already features a ""Bong"" vs ""Bongbong"" match-up and a potential 11th-hour challenge by President Rodrigo Duterte against his own daughter for the No. 2 post.
The jockeying before Monday's registration deadline bolsters the view that the 2022 election will be dominated by powerful family dynasties rather than reforms.
Senator Christopher ""Bong"" Go, a Duterte loyalist, registered https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/daughter-philippine-president-duterte-files-candidacy-vp-poll-body-2021-11-13 on Saturday to run for president after withdrawing from the vice presidential race, pitting himself against rivals including Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr, son of the late dictator.
Sara Duterte-Carpio, who had been expected to run to succeed her father - who is barred by the constitution from seeking re-election - instead registered for vice president.
Boxing hero Manny Pacquiao https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/manny-pacquiao-asias-rags-riches-champion-2021-09-29, a senator and the only man to hold world titles in eight different divisions, is running for president in what may be his toughest fight yet, promising to battle poverty and corruption. 
Duterte's communication secretary, Martin Andanar, said on Saturday the 76-year old leader, who only last month promised to retire https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/philippine-president-duterte-says-he-is-retiring-politics-2021-10-02 from politics, would throw his hat in the vice presidential ring and run against his daughter.
Duterte said on Sunday he would make known his plans for the 2022 election ""in a matter of hours"" and that he was fully behind long-time aide Go - who for his part said he did not want to run against the president's daughter.
Go, widely seen as the gatekeeper to the president, could benefit from the president's popularity. Marcos said he wanted Duterte-Carpio, the popular mayor of Davao, to run on his ticket. She has yet to respond.
A Marcos and Duterte-Carpio ticket is a team to watch out for as both have performed relatively well in opinion surveys, political analysts say.
""Marcos is a very strong candidate from all indications,"" Antonio La Vina, professor of law and politics at the Ateneo de Manila University, told Reuters.
Duterte-Carpio said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) her decision to seek the No. 2 post, instead of the presidency, was her way to meet her supporters half-way. 
If the president does run for vice president with Go, they could take votes away from his daughter's ticket, having some impact on Marcos's bid, La Vina said.
Marcos, whose presidential candidacy https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/son-late-philippines-strongman-marcos-run-presidency-media-2021-10-05 has stirred anger among victims of his father's brutal era of martial law, is facing a disqualification case.
President Duterte, in an interview with a YouTube vlogger, said he had been surprised by his daughter's election plans, as she had been leading in the polls for president.

""I didn't know about it. I don't ask. We have not been talking,"" Duterte said in the interview, a transcript of which was provided to reporters on Sunday. 
""The drama is not yet over,"" La Vina said.

De Klerk, who won praise worldwide for his role in scrapping apartheid and shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela in 1993, has a complex legacy that left many grappling with conflicting emotions following his death.
The country's Black population remains angered by his actions during apartheid and for his failure to curb political violence in the run up to South Africa's first democratic elections in 1994. Many argued against him being granted a state funeral - a privilege his foundation's statement confirmed he is not set to enjoy. 
""The FW de Klerk Foundation wishes to announce that FW de Klerk's cremation and funeral will take place on Sunday, 21 November,"" it said in statement. 
""It will be a private ceremony for family members and will not be open to media,"" it said, providing no further detail. 
De Klerk died aged 85 after a battle with cancer. After his death, his foundation published a video in which he apologised for crimes against other ethnic groups during decades of white minority rule in South Africa.
He had previously refused to apologise and prompted backlash as recently as last year when he said he did not believe apartheid was a crime against humanity. On the other hand, he angered right wing Afrikaners who viewed him as a traitor to their causes of white supremacy and nationalism by ending apartheid. 
Remarks on his death from world leaders and citizens alike reflected the difficult space in history he occupied; a key player in one of the most infamous oppressive regimes but also one who moved to bring it to an end. 

For some, his death marked a new chapter for South Africa. 
""I feel like his death helps South Africa move forward in a way, away from all the criticism, the negativity, the racism,"" 30-year-old South African Pusiletso Makofane said in Johannesburg on Thursday.

The supplies put India at risk of sanctions from the United States under a 2017 U.S. law aimed at deterring countries from buying Russian military hardware.
""The first supplies have already been started,"" Interfax cited Shugayev as saying on Sunday at an aerospace trade show in Dubai.
He said that the first unit of an S-400 systems will arrive in India by the end of this year.
The $5.5 billion deal for five long-range surface-to-air missile systems, which India says it needs to counter a threat from China, was signed in 2018.
India faces a range of financial sanctions from the United States under Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), which names Russia an adversary alongside North Korea and Iran for its actions against Ukraine, interference in the U.S. 2016 elections and help to Syria.
New Delhi said it has a strategic partnership with both the United States and Russia while Washington told India it was unlikely to get a waiver from CAATSA.
Last year the United Stated imposed sanctions citing CAATSA on NATO ally Turkey for acquiring S-400 missiles from Russia. The sanctions targeted the main Turkish defence procurement and development body Presidency of Defence Industries.
Washington also removed Turkey from a F-35 stealth fighter jet program, the most advanced aircraft in the U.S. arsenal, used by NATO members and other U.S. allies.

Russia said it had offered Turkey its help in developing advanced fighter jets but no agreement has been reached so far.
""We are still at a stage of negotiations on this project,"" RIA new agency quoted Shugayev as saying on Sunday.

GUAYAQUIL (Reuters) - At least 68 prisoners were killed and more than two dozen injured in overnight violence at Ecuador's Penitenciaria del Litoral prison, the government said on Saturday, in what officials characterize as fights among rival gangs.
The penitentiary, located in the southern city of Guayaquil, is the same prison where 119 inmates were killed in late September in the country's worst incident of prison violence in recent history.
The government has blamed disputes between drug trafficking gangs for control of prisons for the violence.
Dozens were gathered outside the prison on Saturday afternoon waiting for news of loved ones, who many said they had not heard from since Friday afternoon.
Cristina Monserrat, 58, still has not heard from her younger brother who has been in prison for a year.
""What is happening inside is reprehensible, people killing each other and the saddest thing is they have no conscience,"" said Monserrat. ""My brother is alive, my heart tells me so.""
President Guillermo Lasso, Monserrat added, must do more to help the poor. Ecuador's prison system has come under harsh spotlight in recent years for overcrowding and poor sanitary and living conditions for inmates.
Lasso in September declared a 60-day state of emergency in the prison system, which freed up government funding and allowed for military assistance in control of the prisons.
On Saturday, the president called on the constitutional court to allow the military to enter prisons, instead of providing only outside security. The court responded in a statement that a solution to the prison crisis will require more than temporary emergency measures.
Further disturbances in the penitentiary in the afternoon were under control by Saturday night, the government said, adding it was meeting with rights groups and the United Nations to handle the situation.
WAVE OF DISTURBANCES
The latest disturbance was set off by a power vacuum following a gang leader's release, governor of Guayas province Pablo Arosemena said in a press conference earlier in the day.
""The context of this situation is that there was no leader of the gang that has this cell block because a few days ago that prisoner was released,"" Arosemena said. ""Other cell blocks with other groups wanted to control them, get inside and have a total massacre.""
Videos on social media purportedly posted by detainees overnight showed them begging for help to stop the violence as shots and explosions sounded in the background. Reuters could not independently verify the origin of the videos.
There has been a wave of disturbances in the South American country's prisons, which house some 39,000 detainees, since the December 2020 killing of 'Rasquina,' the leader of the Los Choneros gang, months after he was released from prison.
His death, officials said at the time, prompted less well-known gangs to compete for influence over the country's prisons. Gang rivalries are connected to competition for drug trafficking alliances with international cartels, ex-officials said.
Officials said a February incident which killed 79 detainees was a response to Rasquina's death. Another 22 people died in a July riot.
Prisoners at least two other prisons in Azuay and Cotopaxi provinces were refusing food in a hunger strike on Saturday in solidarity with inmates at Litoral, the SNAI prison authority said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).

Some of those killed in the September violence at Penitenciaria del Litoral were decapitated or burned, the attorney general's office has said, and dozens were injured.
""I don't know anything, what we ask for are answers,"" said Estefania, who declined to give her surname, and said her husband is jailed for a robbery. ""I don't know if he's alive or dead.""

BIALYSTOK, Poland (Reuters) - Umm Malak, 26 and due to give birth in weeks, was willing to go through chest-deep water, hiding in cold forests with her three small daughters in the hopes of giving them a better life in Germany.
The Iraqi woman said she did not regret her efforts, even though she said she and her family had been shunted between Polish and Belarusian border guards six times in the last few weeks.
""The future of my children, I have to think about this first, because in Iraq, there is no future, neither for us nor for them.""
A Polish police spokesperson said police did not conduct activities such as taking migrants back to the border. Neither the Polish Border Guard nor Belarusian authorities responded to requests for comment on her case.
Reuters could not independently verify her account.
Umm Malak, who declined to give her full name, is one of thousands of migrants, many of them Iraqis, who have tried to get into the European Union through Belarus starting in the spring. 
Reuters spoke to her in a migrant centre in the Polish city of Bialystok, where she was staying with her husband and three daughters. The migrant centre is an open one, meaning migrants can come and go freely, once they have fulfilled any coronavirus quarantine requirements. 
Umm Malak said she was due to give birth in three weeks and hoped it would be in Germany.
The European Union accuses Minsk of creating the crisis as part of a ""hybrid attack"" on the bloc - distributing Belarusian visas in the Middle East, flying in the migrants and then pushing them to cross the border illegally. 
Belarus denies fomenting the crisis, but has also said it cannot help resolve it unless Europe lifts existing sanctions.
Poland has detained some migrants in closed detention centres and transferred others to open centres, mostly those who are sick, elderly or have small children.
Umm Malak said she landed in Belarus from Dubai at the beginning of October and had hoped to cross the Belarusian border then go by road to Germany with her daughters, all under the age of 10, and her husband. She said six of their attempts to cross into Poland were foiled.
FELL IN A POND
On a few occasions, she said the Polish authorities caught them, taking them back to the border with Belarus. On another attempt, she said they crossed into Lithuania but got tired and returned.
On one attempt to enter Poland, Umm Malak said the Belarusian authorities helped her cut the border fence with Poland to let her and her family through. 
She said she then fell into a pond near the border and got sick, already eight months pregnant. The Polish authorities detained her for three days, then took her to a closed migrant centre for a day, then to an open one, she said.
""We fell into the pond at noon then overnight... they (the Polish border guard) got us. When they got us, I couldn't stand by myself,"" she said.
Some migrants at the open center in Bialystok told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity, that they regretted the journey to Poland and that they were calling loved ones back in the Middle East telling them not to come. 

But Umm Malak said migrants, especially those from Iraq like her, should still try getting over the border to the EU.
""I would advise all those thinking of coming to do it, because there is no future or security or anything in Iraq,"" she said. ""So bear the difficulties of the journey for a month or two, for a week or two, instead of continuing to suffer in Iraq for years.""

566,"<span>Nov 13, 2021 03:58PM ET</span>","VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Saturday thanked journalists for helping uncover the clerical sexual abuse scandals that the Roman Catholic Church initially tried to cover up.
The pope praised what he called the ""mission"" of journalism and said it was vital for reporters to get out of their newsrooms and discover what was happening in the outside world to counter misinformation often found online.
""(I) thank you for what you tell us about what is wrong in the Church, for helping us not to sweep it under the carpet, and for the voice you have given to the abuse victims,"" the pope said.
Francis was speaking at a ceremony to honour two veteran correspondents -- Philip Pullella of Reuters and Valentina Alazraki of Mexico's Noticieros Televisa -- for their long careers spent covering the Vatican.
The sexual abuse scandals hit the headlines in 2002, when U.S. daily The Boston Globe wrote a series of articles exposing a pattern of abuse of minors by clerics and a widespread culture of concealment within the Church.
Since then, scandals have rocked the Church in myriad countries, most recently France where a major investigation found in October that French clerics had sexually abused more than 200,000 children over the past 70 years.
Critics accused Francis of responding too slowly to the scandals after he became Pontiff in 2013 and of believing the word of his fellow clergy over that of the abuse victims.
But in 2018 he tried to address past mistakes, publicly admitting he was wrong about a case in Chile and vowing that the Church would never again seek to cover up such wrongdoing. In 2019 he called for an ""all-out battle"" against a crime that should be ""erased from the face of the earth"".

Francis on Saturday said journalists had a mission ""to explain the world, to make it less obscure, to make those who live in it less fear it"". 
To do that, he said reporters needed to ""escape the tyranny"" of always being online. ""Not everything can be told through email, the phone, or a screen,"" he said.

Michael Cohen had sued the Trump Organization for failing to make good on a promise to pay legal costs resulting from his work. But the judge said Cohen failed to prove the bills he incurred amid a criminal investigation and other lawsuits related to conduct done in his capacity as an employee of the Trump Organization.
The alleged missed reimbursements included $1.9 million for legal fees and costs, plus another $1.9 million related to Cohen's criminal case, according to Cohen's 2019 complaint.
""In a nutshell, Mr. Cohen's legal fees arise out of his (sometimes unlawful) service to Mr. Trump personally, to Mr. Trump's campaign, and to the Trump Foundation, but not out of his service to the business of the Trump Organization,"" the judge said in the filing.
The Trump Organization was the only defendant in Cohen's lawsuit. 

In a statement on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Cohen's attorney Lanny Davis described the decision as ""unfair"".
Cohen, a longtime employee of the firm and Trump's, became a critic of the former president and testified that Trump had directed him to break the law.

MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines' presidential race got more crowded with the last-minute entry of Rodrigo Duterte's long-time aide, in another twist to an election likely to be dominated by powerful family dynasties rather than reforms.
Duterte loyalist, Senator Christopher ""Bong"" Go, registered to run for president after withdrawing his application to run for the No. 2 post, pitting himself against several rivals, including the son of late Philippine strongman Ferdinand Marcos.
Go admitted he didn't want to run against Duterte's daughter, Sara Duterte-Carpio, who made a surprise move earlier on Saturday by filing her candidacy for the vice presidency, ending months-long speculation about her 2022 election plans. 
But with the deadline to switch candidates for the May 2022 polls two days away, political analysts suspect there could be more surprises and even changes in alliances in what is becoming an unpredictable election. 
Duterte's communication secretary, Martin Andanar confirmed media reports that the 76-year old leader, who last month promised to retire from politics, would officially throw his hat in the vice presidential ring on Monday and run against his daughter. 
""That is his plan, we don't know if that is going to change,"" Andanar told Reuters.
Duterte is barred by the Constitution from seeking a second six-year term, but nothing is stopping him from vying for another post. 
In the Philippines, the president and the largely ceremonial position of vice president are elected separately.
Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the only son of the late dictator who ruled the Philippines for almost two decades until his 1986 overthrow, has adopted Duterte-Carpio, eldest daughter of the autocratic and capricious Duterte, to be his running mate. 
Duterte-Carpio, 43, who belongs to a political party controlled by former president Gloria Arroyo, another dominant force in Philippine politics, will release a statement soon, her spokesperson, Mayor Christina Garcia-Frasco said. 
""The rivalries of the political families have really been dramatised in this case,"" said political analyst Temario Rivera. ""It looks like they are the only ones deciding on the country's fate. It is infuriating because they are making a fool of the Filipino people.""
The Southeast Asian nation of 110 million people holds elections in May 2022 for positions from president down to governors, mayors and local officials. The next government faces the uphill task of reviving a pandemic-battered economy. 
Before announcing her vice presidential bid, Duterte-Carpio, in an opinion poll remained the most preferred candidate to succeed Duterte, and placing second was Marcos.
Political analyst Edmund Tayao said a possible team up of Marcos and Duterte-Caprio, two powerful political families in the Philippines, could be a ""game changer."" 
""Both of them are very popular. It is easy to assume they are the team to beat,"" Tayao said. 
But the prospect of a Marcos-Duterte-Carpio team taking the reins of government next year has stirred anger in the human rights community. 
""What is in the offing are dire threats to democracy and freedoms in the country,"" rights group Karapatan said. 
Marcos and Go are up against other presidential aspirants, including former boxing champion Manny Pacquiao, vice president Leni Robredo, Manila mayor Francisco Domagoso, and senator Panfilo Lacson.
Duterte's former police chief turned senator Ronald dela Rosa quit the presidential race on Saturday to give way for Go. 

Analysts said a loyalist successor to Duterte could insulate him from potential legal action at home or by the International Criminal Court, which is investigating thousands of killings since 2016 during his war on drugs.
His government has denied wrongdoing and has said it will not cooperate with the ICC.

BIALYSTOK, Poland (Reuters) -The body of a young Syrian man has been found in Poland near the border with Belarus, Polish police said on Saturday, amid mounting international tension over a migrant crisis the European Union says has been orchestrated by Minsk.
Thousands of migrants from the Middle East are sheltering in freezing conditions on the border between Belarus and EU states Poland and Lithuania, which are refusing to let them cross.
At least eight of them have already died and fears are growing for the safety of others as harsh winter conditions set in.
""A forest worker informed the police about finding the body of a young man,"" Podlaska police spokesman Tomasz Krupa told Reuters, adding that the body and the man's passport had been found on Friday.
""It is a young man of Syrian nationality around 20-years old,"" Krupa said. It was not possible to determine the cause of death at the scene, he added.
International tension is growing over the crisis, with neighbours of Belarus warning the situation could escalate into a military conflict https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/poland-reports-violent-clashes-overnight-migrants-attempt-new-border-breach-2021-11-11 and U.S. President Joe Biden expressing his concern https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/biden-says-us-concerned-about-situation-belarus-2021-11-12.
Belarus said on Saturday the number of migrants arriving at a makeshift camp on the border was growing daily, and that a group of up to 100 had crossed into Polish territory. 
Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski estimated that about 1,500 people were camped at the border.
The European Union accuses Belarus of instigating the crisis in a bid to put pressure on the bloc over sanctions.
Minsk denies this, and on Saturday Russian President Vladimir Putin, a key ally of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, said Western countries were ultimately responsible for the crisis.
Some migrants have said Belarusian forces helped them cross the border, however.
On Saturday, the Polish army published footage that it said showed a group of about 50 migrants being escorted across the border by Belarusian forces.
The Polish Border Guard said Belarusian soldiers had pulled down a section of the temporary border fence.

In Lithuania, border guard officials released footage showing 70 migrants they said had been brought to the country's border by Belarusian officials in trucks.
Poland, Austria, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have asked international aid agencies to organise humanitarian and medical assistance in Belarus to ""avoid tragedies and prevent (a) humanitarian crisis"" at the Polish border.

Russia is a close ally of Belarus, which the European Union has accused of engineering a crisis on its border by flying in thousands of migrants and pushing them to try to cross illegally into Poland. Brussels is gearing up to sanction Minsk. 
Lukashenko told the National Defence magazine that he needed the Iskander mobile ballistic missile system, which has a range of up to 500 kilometres and can carry either conventional or nuclear warheads. 
""I need several divisions in the west and the south, let them stand (there),"" he said. 
EU members Poland and Lithuania lie to the west of Belarus. Its south borders Ukraine. 
Lukashenko gave no indication of whether he had held any talks with Moscow about receiving the missile system.

Russia's Defence Ministry did not immediately reply to a request to comment.

Lawyers for Basak Demirtas, 44, said she was sentenced by a court over an incorrect date on a medical report issued by a doctor in the southeastern province of Diyarbakir in 2015, which she passed to her employer while taking sick leave.
Her husband Selahattin Demirtas, the former pro-Kurdish party leader and one of Turkey's best-known politicians, has been in jail for nearly five years on terrorism-related charges that he denies.
The European Parliament's Turkey rapporteur, Nacho Sanchez Amor, said her sentencing seemed ""political"".
Amor wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that ""2.5 years of prison for a mere clerical error concerning a medical record is appalling and seems beyond common sense. It just looks so political. It gives the measure of the worrying state of Turkish judiciary.""

Basak Demirtas is free pending appeal of her conviction, which could take more than a year to finalise. 
There was an error on the records that could have been corrected by examining the appointment book of the local healthcare centre, Demirtas's lawyers said, adding that they will appeal the ruling.

GLASGOW (Reuters) -The British hosts of the COP26 U.N. climate talks published a proposal on Saturday to make sure rich countries deliver climate finance to the world's poorest nations in future years, after past promises remain unfulfilled.
Finance has proved one of the toughest issues https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/climate-finance-could-make-or-break-cop26-summit-heres-why-2021-11-01 to solve at the meeting in Glasgow, Scotland. 
Rich nations, whose emissions are responsible for the majority of human-caused climate change, failed to meet a long-held promise to deliver $100 billion a year by 2020 to support poorer countries' efforts https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/that-sinking-feeling-poor-nations-struggle-with-un-climate-fund-2021-11-11 to cope with the effects of global warming. 
That has cast a shadow over the summit, making other negotiations on carbon markets and strengthening climate targets harder to unblock, with some poorer nations saying they cannot cut emissions faster unless they get more financial help.
The draft proposal, one of many drawn up by Britain to be published at the end of COP26, asks a U.N. committee to report next year on progress towards delivering the $100 billion, and proposes government ministers meet in 2022, 2024 and 2026 to discuss climate finance.
The regular check-ins would attempt to keep up pressure on rich countries to fulfil promises to mobilise the cash. The British proposal also asks countries to increase their contributions to deliver the $100 billion.
The draft needs approval from the nearly 200 countries represented at the summit. 
Rich countries expect to deliver the $100 billion in 2023, although some have suggested it could be met next year. 
The European Union and Italy were drawing up a last-minute proposal on Friday that would use special drawing rights to help make sure the target is met next year, an EU official said. 
A second draft document published on Saturday would kick off talks among countries to set a post-2025 target on climate finance. The $100 billion target should be delivered each year from 2020 to 2025, after which a new one is supposed to kick in.
The second proposal asks countries, civil society groups and the private sector to weigh in next year on the new goal, and would launch a work programme to develop the post-2025 target, led by a developed country and a developing country, from 2022-2024.
African countries have said the new goal should reach $1.3 trillion by 2030 to reflect the spiralling costs of worsening droughts, floods and other climate-related disasters in the world's poorest nations. 

The $100 billion pledge is far below the actual needs of vulnerable countries, which could hit $300 billion per year by 2030 for them to adapt to climate impacts alone, according to the United Nations. 
That is aside from potential economic losses from crop failure or climate-related disasters.

Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor in chief, said in a statement https://press.economist.com/story/15283/statement-from-the-economist the magazine was proud of correspondent Sue-Lin Wong's journalism and regretted the decision by the immigration authorities, which it said was given without explanation.
""We urge the government of Hong Kong to maintain access for the foreign press, which is vital to the territory's standing as an international city,"" Beddoes wrote.
The Hong Kong government and immigration department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Since Beijing imposed a national security law on Hong Kong last year, democracy activists, newspaper editors and journalists have been arrested. Critics of the legislation say it is being used to crush dissent in the city - claims the Hong Kong and Beijing authorities reject.
Fears over freedom of the press in the former British colony are increasing, months after the city's most vocal pro-democracy newspaper, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily, was forced to shut after its tycoon owner, Jimmy Lai, and other staff were arrested under the national security law.
Australian passport holder Wong, a former Reuters and Financial Times correspondent, wrote https://twitter.com/suelinwong/status/1459191009947136004 on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) from London: ""Very sad I won't be able to continue reporting from Hong Kong. I loved getting to know the city and its people. I will miss you all.""
In 2018, the visa of the Financial Times' Asia editor, Victor Mallet, was not renewed by Hong Kong after he moderated a speech by a pro-independence activist at an event hosted by the Foreign Correspondents' Club in the city. The move alarmed some diplomats and business groups in Hong Kong.
As of April, 628 foreign employees working for overseas media held work visas in Hong Kong, according to the Chinese foreign ministry.

Hong Kong is guaranteed freedom of speech and the press under Article 27 of the Basic Law, the mini-constitution agreed by China when it took back control of Hong Kong in 1997.
Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam has denied the security legislation would curtail media freedom, saying that ""freedom of expression, freedom of protest, freedom of journalism, will stay.""

MELBOURNE (Reuters) -Several thousand people rallied in Melbourne against new vaccination mandates on Saturday, with a few comparing the state government to Nazis and calling for violence against politicians, local media said.
In Australia, where 83% of people aged 16 and above have been fully inoculated against the coronavirus, nationwide vaccinations are voluntary. But states and territories have mandated vaccinations for many occupations and barred the unvaccinated from activities such as dining out and concerts.
The Melbourne demonstration against the vaccination mandate that came into effect on Saturday - requiring construction workers in Victoria state to be fully inoculated - was peaceful, with no immediate reports of unruly behaviour or arrests.
But a reporter at The Age posted video on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) of a protester carrying a mock gallows with three nooses hanging from it, and the newspaper showed a protester carrying a poster depicting Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews with a Hitler moustache and the hashtag #DictatorDan.
""We're being governed by insane medical bureaucrats,"" Craig Kelly, former Liberal Party member of parliament and now the leader of United Australia Party, told the rally, media reported.
The Age said some protesters called for violence against politicians but did not offer specifics.
An Australian singer Claire Woodley dedicated a song to ""victims of satanic ritual abuse"" - a rhetoric common in the QAnon conspiracy theory about abducting children for satanic rites.
Andrews' office and protest organisers could not immediately be reached for comment.
Australia has seen frequent, occasionally violent, anti-vaccine rallies in recent months, though the movement remains small, with polls showing nationwide opposition in the single digits.
Victoria, the second-most populous state with a quarter of Australia's 25 million people, has an 87% vaccination rate and has endured six COVID-19 lockdowns totalling nearly nine months.
There were 1,221 new infections reported on Saturday in Victoria and four deaths, and 250 daily cases in New South Wales. 
Despite Delta outbreaks that led to months of lockdown in the two largest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, the national tally of just under 190,000 infections and 1,591 deaths is far lower than that of many developed nations.
Neighbouring New Zealand, which is also learning to live with the coronavirus through high vaccination rates, reported 175 new cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic to 8,121. There have been 33 deaths in total. 

In major cities across New Zealand, several anti-government protests against COVID-19 measures took place, with people driving slowly on main roads to cause traffic congestion.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Pop star Britney Spears on Friday regained control of her personal life and her money when a judge ended a 13-year conservatorship that became a cause celebre for fans and critics of an arrangement typically meant to protect the elderly.
""Effective today, the conservatorship of the person and the estate of Britney Jean Spears is hereby terminated,"" Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny said after a 30-minute hearing in which no one opposed ending the court-sanctioned arrangement.
The 39-year-old ""Piece of Me"" singer had begged the court for months to terminate the conservatorship that has governed her personal life and $60 million estate since 2008. 
Spears did not attend Friday's hearing but said in an Instagram https://www.instagram.com/p/CWMXjAMp-aJ post, ""I love my fans so much it’s crazy!!! I think I’m gonna cry the rest of the day !!!! Best day ever."" 
Outside the courthouse, dozens of fans erupted into cheers and tossed pink confetti into the air when they heard the news. Some danced and sang to her hit ""Stronger."" 
""It was a monumental day for Britney Spears,"" the pop star's attorney, Mathew Rosengart, said outside the courthouse. He thanked the #FreeBritney movement which he said had been essential to ending the legal arrangement.
The conservatorship was set up and overseen by the singer's father, Jamie Spears, after she had a public breakdown in 2007 and was hospitalized for undisclosed mental health issues.
Interest in the case was propelled in the past year by documentaries and the #FreeBritney movement of fans who questioned why the singer needed such restrictions while she was touring around the world and earning millions of dollars. 
Lauriann Wright, the attorney for Jodi Montgomery, who had been entrusted with overseeing Spears' personal life, told the judge there was ""no reason this termination cannot happen and Ms. Spears cannot live a safe, happy and fulfilling life.""
Rosengart said a ""safety net"" had been put in place to help Spears transition back to regular life. Judge Penny added that the current conservator should continue working to settle ongoing financial issues in the case.
""I'm shaking,"" Leanne Simmons, a fan and one of the organizers of the #FreeBritney movement, said shortly after the decision. ""It still hasn't sunk in to hear those words, 'The conservatorship has been terminated.' Britney is a free woman.""
The Spears case helped prompt hearings in the U.S. Congress and a new law in California aimed at preventing abusive conservatorships, which are normally set up to protect disabled people, the elderly or those suffering from dementia.
TRAUMATIZED AND HUMILIATED
Since revealing years of private anguish in tearful testimony in June, Spears hired Rosengart, who moved aggressively to end the restrictions. 
In June, she told the court she had been humiliated and traumatized https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/britney-spears-gets-her-day-court-what-will-she-say-2021-06-23 and that she wanted her life back. She said she had been forced to work and take medication against her will and was prevented from marrying or even getting her hair done.
""She stepped up on June 23rd and really shocked the country and shocked the world with her powerful, poignant words,"" Rosengart said.
Judge Penny ended the conservatorship without requiring Spears to undergo a mental health evaluation, a step often taken in such cases.
The arrangement began to crumble in September when in a sudden reversal Jamie Spears said he supported ending it because it had helped her and was no longer needed. 
Penny suspended Jamie Spears https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/britney-spears-case-back-court-with-dads-role-line-2021-09-29from the conservatorship in late September, calling his involvement ""toxic"" to the singer's well-being. 
Rosengart is pushing for Jamie Spears to be investigated for possible financial mismanagement of his daughter's affairs, but he said on Friday it would be up to Britney Spears to decide how to proceed on that matter.

Jamie Spears has said through attorneys that he helped his daughter rehabilitate her career and always acted in her best interest. 
Spears is engaged to marry her personal trainer boyfriend, Sam Asghari, but no date has been set. ""History was made today. Britney is Free,"" Asghari wrote on Instagram.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden will hold a virtual meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Monday, the White House said, talks Washington hopes will create some stability amid increased tensions between the world's two largest economies.
It is expected to be the leaders' most extensive meeting under the Biden administration and will follow on from a telephone call between the two on Sept. 9.
Washington and Beijing have been sparring on issues from the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic to China's expanding nuclear arsenal https://www.reuters.com/world/pentagon-sharply-raises-its-estimate-chinese-nuclear-warheads-2021-11-03. U.S. officials believe direct engagement with Xi is the best way to prevent ties spiraling toward conflict.
""The two leaders will discuss ways to responsibly manage the competition ... as well as ways to work together where our interests align,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement. ""President Biden will make clear U.S. intentions and priorities and be clear and candid about our concerns.""
Beijing is also keen to avoid confrontation as Xi faces a crucial year ahead with China's hosting of the Winter Olympic Games and a key Communist Party Congress where he looks to secure an unprecedented third term.
China's foreign ministry said on Saturday the leaders would exchange views on bilateral relations and issues of common interests in the summit, which will take place on Tuesday morning in Asia.
A senior U.S. official said Biden would make clear he welcomes stiff competition with China, but doesn't want conflict, and played down the likelihood of a long list of outcomes often tied to top-level meetings. 
""This is not about seeking specific deliverables or outcomes,"" the official said, adding in reference to the People's Republic of China: ""As we compete with the PRC, President Biden expects President Xi and the PRC to play by the rules of road—and he will make that point throughout the meeting.""
The meeting will come after Biden signs a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure deal in a big ceremony on Monday to celebrate domestic renewal plans he believes will position the United States to out-compete China. 
U.S. officials have played down the possibility of progress on trade, where China is lagging in a commitment to buy $200 billion more in U.S. goods and services.
China has nevertheless continued to push for relief from hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs imposed under former President Donald Trump, arguing this could help both sides by easing inflation and boosting employment.
COMPETING VISIONS
Biden and Xi outlined competing visions at meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum this week https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/biden-xi-address-asia-pacific-leaders-trade-covid-recovery-2021-11-12, with Biden stressing the U.S. commitment to a ""free and open Indo-Pacific,"" which Washington says faces increasing Chinese ""coercion,"" while Xi warned against a return to Cold War tensions.
Addressing APEC leaders on Friday, Xi spoke of the need to ""stick to dialogue rather than confrontation, inclusiveness rather than exclusion, and integration rather than decoupling,"" an apparent reference to U.S. moves to make key supply chains independent of China.
Climate is a priority for Biden, and China and the United States, the world's two biggest carbon emitters, unveiled a deal https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/china-us-make-joint-statement-cop26-climate-summit-2021-11-10 at global talks in Glasgow this week to ramp up cooperation, including by cutting methane emissions, phasing out coal consumption and protecting forests.
However, the superpowers have clashed increasingly over self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own and that Washington is required to provide with the means to defend itself.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken angered China this week when he said Washington and its allies would take unspecified ""action"" if China were to use force to alter the Taiwan status quo, further muddying the long-held U.S. policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" as to whether the United States would respond militarily.
Senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi told Blinken in a call on Saturday that the United States should not send the wrong signals to Taiwan pro-independence forces, according a statement on the Chinese foreign ministry website.
""If the United States really wants to maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait, it should clearly and resolutely oppose any Taiwan pro-independence behavior,"" Wang said.
Wang and Blinken also exchanged views on areas including energy efficiency, climate change and the Iran nuclear issue and agreed to maintain dialogue on global challenges, China said.
Daniel Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for Asia under the Obama administration, said both Biden and Xi were worried by the risk of a military incident escalating. 
""Biden knows that the tools for prevention and crisis management are rusty, so we should expect him to push to put in place safeguards or 'guardrails' to reduce risk,"" he said.

Russel said the Sept. 9 Biden-Xi call began with Xi listing complaints, but ended with a constructive agreement for officials to continue discussions.
""This suggests that the personal relationship Biden built with Xi a decade ago is still strong, and that each conversation can add some stability to the mix.""

SAN FRANCISCO/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexico is considering setting tougher entry requirements for Venezuelans, partly in response to U.S. requests, after a sharp rise in border arrests of Venezuelans fleeing their homeland, according to three people familiar with the matter.
Currently, Venezuelans do not need a visa to enter Mexico as tourists. But as apprehensions of Venezuelan migrants on the U.S.-Mexico border soar, Mexico is looking at making their entry subject to certain criteria, a Mexican official familiar with the government's internal discussions said.
New entry rules could be applied soon, the official said.
A second Mexican government source said Mexico was reviewing its options, and holding discussions with Venezuela to explore alternatives to imposing visa requirements. 
A third person familiar with Mexican-U.S. talks said Washington is urging Mexico to impose visa restrictions on Venezuelans, noting that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has been complaining about the increase in Venezuelans.
Options under review include making Venezuelans show they are economically solvent and in employment, and have a return plane ticket when they enter in order to ensure they are not using Mexico to enter the United States, the first source said.
A U.S. State Department spokesperson said Washington was working with Mexico to address root causes of irregular migration in a ""collaborative, regional approach"" when asked by Reuters whether the Biden administration was pressing Mexico to tighten entry requirements for Venezuelans.
""The United States appreciates Mexico's efforts that contribute to safe, orderly, and humane processes for migrants at and within its borders,"" the spokesperson said.
The White House, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and CBP did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither Mexico's foreign ministry nor Venezuela's Information Ministry replied to a request for comment.
The discussions come as encounters of Venezuelans at the U.S.-Mexico border have leapt to 47,762 in the year through September from just 1,262 during the previous 12-month period, according to U.S. government data.
Total apprehensions https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-under-pressure-us-mexico-border-arrests-reach-record-highs-2021-10-20 of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border have hit record levels this year. That has put pressure on U.S. President Joe Biden ahead of congressional elections next November, with many voters in Texas border towns upset https://www.reuters.com/world/us/migrants-school-buses-texas-town-feels-caught-middle-2021-09-21 and Republicans accusing his administration of pursuing an ""open border"" policy.
One of the Mexican sources said Washington had lobbied Mexico to slow arrivals from Venezuela, but that Mexico also wanted to make sure people were not entering on false pretenses.
A fourth source, in U.S. government, said efforts to lobby Mexico to tighten entry requirements from OPEC member Venezuela had increased since Venezuelan arrivals jumped this summer, and that requests for cooperation had been made informally by diplomats and the DHS. The source said Washington was not leaning hard on Mexico.
Tighter entry rules could seriously affect migration plans of many Venezuelans, who pay smuggling networks https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/fleeing-hardship-home-bias-abroad-venezuelans-flock-us-2021-07-14 to help them escape economic devastation under President Nicolas Maduro, who has presided over a severe financial meltdown amid heavy U.S. sanctions. Many of the Venezuelans depart with little money.
Venezuelans arriving from elsewhere in Latin America like Colombia or Chile, where they often work for a few years to save in hard currency before heading north, would likely be less exposed to requirements centering on their solvency. 
Rights activists on Friday decried the potential move to restrict Venezuelan arrivals. 
""Venezuelan migrants and refugees are fleeing a complex humanitarian emergency, lack of justice, an absence of freedom, and violence,"" said David Smolansky, an exiled Venezuelan opposition leader who coordinates the Organization of American States' response to Venezuela's migration crisis. ""In the face of such a situation, it is fundamental that they receive protection.""

Reuters reported in October that the Biden administration wanted Mexico to impose visa requirements on Brazilians https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazilians-flock-us-border-an-alleged-smuggler-cashes-2021-10-12 to complicate their path to the U.S. border. And in September, Mexico suspended visa exemptions for Ecuadorians for six months following a steep increase in that country's nationals trying to cross the U.S. border.
The U.S. government source said Biden's aides could raise the Venezuelan migrant issue with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's delegation when he visits Washington next week for a U.S.-Mexico-Canada summit.

BRUSSELS/ANKARA (Reuters) -Turkey banned Syrian, Yemeni and Iraqi citizens from flights to Minsk on Friday, potentially closing off one of the main routes that the EU says Belarus has used to fly in migrants by the thousand to engineer a humanitarian crisis on its frontier.
Thousands of migrants from the Middle East are sheltering in freezing conditions in the woods on the border between Belarus and EU states Poland and Lithuania, which are refusing to let them cross. Some have already died and there are fears for the safety of the rest as bitter winter conditions settle in.
The European Union accuses Minsk of creating the crisis as part of a ""hybrid attack"" https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-flies-nuclear-capable-bombers-over-belarus-migrant-crisis-escalates-2021-11-10 on the bloc - distributing Belarusian visas in the Middle East, flying in the migrants and pushing them to cross the border illegally. Brussels may impose new sanctions as early as Monday on Belarus and airlines it blames for ferrying the migrants.
EU officials welcomed Friday's announcement by Turkey's Civil Aviation General Directorate that Syrians, Yemenis and Iraqis would not be permitted to buy tickets to Belarus or board flights there from Turkish territory. 
Turkey has denied playing a direct role by allowing its territory to be used to ferry in migrants. But Minsk airport's website listed six commercial flights arriving from Istanbul on Friday, the most from any city outside the former Soviet Union.
EU officials have repeatedly said their best hope of resolving the crisis is to stop would-be migrants in the Middle East from boarding flights for Belarus at the source, and that diplomats were negotiating in the region to achieve this. 
""These contacts are already showing fruit,"" a European Commission spokesperson said.
The spokesperson said Iraqi Airways had also agreed to halt flights to Belarus.
However, the head of the EU's border agency Frontex said he saw no swift end to the migrant crisis on Poland's border.
""We have to be ready to have to face this situation for a long time,"" Fabrice Leggeri told Reuters, adding that Frontex would help Poland return migrants to their home countries. 
SANCTIONS
Belarus denies fomenting the crisis, but has also said it cannot help resolve it unless Europe lifts existing sanctions. The EU imposed several rounds of measures in response to President Alexander Lukashenko's violent crackdown on mass street protests against his rule in 2020.
Lukashenko, a close ally of Russia, threatened this week to cut off Russian gas supplies delivered to Europe through Belarusian territory. On Friday, the Kremlin appeared to distance itself from that threat, saying it was not consulted in advance of Lukashenko's remarks and it would fulfil its gas delivery contracts.
But Moscow shows no sign of leaning on Lukashenko to resolve the border crisis, and has made a number of demonstrations of its military support for him in recent days. Russian and Belarusian paratroopers held joint drills near the border on Friday, and the Russian air force has sent planes this week to patrol the frontier.
""From our point of view, the Russian president has the possibility to influence the situation and we expect him to take appropriate steps,"" a German government spokesperson said.
Separately, Russia's defence ministry said two of its servicemen had died on Friday due to parachute problems while taking part in the joint drills near the Polish border.
Polish authorities said they had foiled 223 attempts to cross the border illegally from Belarus overnight, including two large groups. They estimate the number of migrants trapped along the border at 3,000-4,000.
Neighbouring Lithuania reported 110 crossing attempts overnight and said it would be finishing a 100-km razor wire barrier along the border by Dec. 10.
Expressing support for Warsaw, Ukraine said on Friday it was sending border guards and national guard officers to its frontier with Poland to share intelligence and operational know-how on dealing with the Belarus migrant crisis.
FREEZING CONDITIONS
The EU has backed Poland and Lithuania in taking a hard line on banning illegal crossings from Belarus for fear that allowing in even a small number would encourage huge numbers to follow.
But charities and advocates say the freezing conditions have created a humanitarian emergency, and that EU states have a duty to allow access to food and shelter. The media has also been kept away, which critics say conceals the scale of the crisis.

""Access for independent observers and the media is essential,"" said Iwo Los, from Grupa Granica (Border Group), a Polish organisation. ""These people... have to receive humanitarian aid, medical aid and this aid must be provided to them on both sides of the border.""
The Baltic nations bordering Belarus fear the crisis could escalate into a military confrontation. The presidents of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia will meet on Monday in Vilnius to discuss the crisis and be joined by video link by Polish President Andrzej Duda.

KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) - The judge in the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse said on Friday he would instruct the jury they can consider the prosecution's argument that the teenager provoked an encounter with one of two men he fatally shot during protests in Wisconsin last year.
The ruling is a boost for prosecutors because it opens the door for them to argue that Rittenhouse was the aggressor, which would raise the bar for the teenager's effort to convince the jury that he acted in self-defense.
The decision comes after nearly two weeks of testimony that included considerable evidence supporting the teen's argument that he fired after being attacked.
Ahead of the trial, some legal experts told Reuters that prosecutors faced a formidable challenge https://www.reuters.com/world/us/prosecutors-face-tough-test-trial-us-teenage-protest-shooter-rittenhouse-2021-10-28 in bringing a successful prosecution. 
""Now it's a fair fight,"" said Patrick Cafferty, a criminal defense attorney in Wisconsin, referring to the lift the ruling would give the prosecution. ""Without that instruction they would have zero chance."" 
Rittenhouse, 18, is charged in the killing of Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and the wounding of Gaige Grosskreutz, 27, in Kenosha on Aug. 25, 2020. The shootings took place during sometimes violent protests that followed the police shooting and wounding of a Black man, Jacob Blake. Rittenhouse has pleaded not guilty.
Kenosha County Assistant District Attorney James Kraus showed grainy drone video of the Rosenbaum shooting as he argued that Rittenhouse raised his AR-15-style rifle shortly before the encounter and pointed it at some people, including another man, Joshua Ziminski, who fired a gunshot in the air.
""The simple argument is there's plenty of evidence that the state has brought in that he raised his gun,"" Kraus said. ""We have evidence of provocation.
Rittenhouse testified earlier this week that Ziminski pointed a gun at him as he approached the parking lot where the Rosenbaum shooting happened
Kenosha County Judge Bruce Schroeder stepped down from the bench to watch the video on a TV with Rittenhouse standing close behind him leaning in and looking on. The judge agreed the issue should be up the jury to decide.
""It's the jury's case and I think they should make the critical decisions,"" Schroeder said. ""My decision will be to submit the case to the jury with the provocation instruction and you can argue the strength or lack of strength of the evidence."" 
The shootings, which took place against a backdrop of days of rioting and arson, have divided the United States. Supporters of Rittenhouse saying he was justified in defending himself, while critics say he was a vigilante who illegally possessed a firearm and inserted himself into a violent situation.
PROVOCATION
Under Wisconsin law, if someone provokes a confrontation they are required to exhaust all other options before using deadly force in self-defense. So if the prosecution can argue Rittenhouse was the aggressor, it could raise the bar for the defense.
But the defense can point to the evidence indicating that Rosenbaum was looking for trouble that night. Several witnesses told the court Rosenbaum was making death threats and that he chased Rittenhouse and lunged for his gun before the teen fired.
Rittenhouse himself testified that Rosenbaum, the first man he shot, threatened his life and grabbed the barrel of his gun.
Cafferty said the prosecution may try to argue that by provoking Rosenbaum, Rittenhouse also raised the bar for self-defense in the subsequent shootings of Huber and Grosskreutz, who prosecutors will say were trying to disarm the teenager. 
Rittenhouse is charged with first-degree reckless homicide in the death of Rosenbaum, first-degree intentional homicide in the death of Huber and attempted first-degree intentional homicide in the shooting of Grosskreutz, who was holding a handgun when he was shot in the arm. Rittenhouse faces life in prison if convicted on those counts.
Earlier, Schroeder had ruled against the prosecution's request to allow the jury to consider a lesser charge in the killing of Rosenbaum, but he said he would allow the inclusion of two lesser charges in the killing of Huber, who was shot after swinging a skateboard at Rittenhouse.

He did not rule on a request for lesser charges regarding Grosskreutz.
With Huber, Rittenhouse's lawyers agreed to lesser charges as long as they did not include second-degree reckless homicide, because that charge does not require proof that the teen exhibited an ""utter disregard"" for human life. The defense wanted to retain that high hurdle for the prosecution, and the judge ruled in line with that wish.

DENVER (Reuters) - Five Senegalese immigrants killed in a 2020 arson house fire were targeted by one of the teenagers charged in the case because he mistakenly thought someone at the Denver home had stolen his mobile phone, court testimony showed on Friday.
The disclosures came during a preliminary hearing for Kevin Bui and Gavin Seymour, who have been charged with first-degree murder, arson, assault and related offenses stemming from the August 2020 blaze.
Denver District Judge Martin Egelhoff ruled there was sufficient evidence in the case against the pair to proceed with prosecution and ordered the two youths to be held without bail.
Both boys were 16 when they were arrested in January 2021 and are being tried as adults, though their lawyers are seeking to have their cases moved to juvenile court.
A third suspect, who was 15 when arrested, is charged in juvenile court.
The fire erupted in the early morning hours, killing 29-year-old Djibril Diol, his wife Adja Diol, 23, and the couple’s 2-year-old daughter, Khadija.
Also killed were Hassan Diol, 25, the husband’s sister, and her infant daughter, Hawa Beye. Three other family members escaped the flames by leaping from a second-story window.
Denver police detective Neil Baker testified on Friday that Bui confessed to the crime following his arrest. According to Baker, Bui told police he tracked his stolen cellphone to the northeast Denver house, where he and his two accomplices poured gasoline inside the dwelling and ignited it.
""He admitted to setting that house on fire,"" Baker testified.
After watching news stories about the fire, Bui realized that the victims were not the people who had robbed him, Baker said.

The crime roiled Denver's community of Senegalese immigrants who feared the arson's victims were singled out for attack because they were Muslim immigrants from the West African nation.  
Police were led to the three suspects through cellphone data and tracking of the getaway vehicle, authorities said.

PORTLAND, Ore. (Reuters) - Twenty people trapped by flash flooding at an Oregon recreational vehicle park were lifted to safety on Friday by U.S. Coast Guard helicopters, authorities said.
Torrential showers caused a creek adjacent to the park to overflow near Neskowin, Oregon, about 90 miles southwest of Portland, and stranded some 50 people, according to officials.
Two Coast Guard helicopters, one of them lowering a rescue swimmer to the ground, plucked 20 campers and three dogs from the inundated park and airlifted them to a nearby school, agency officials said.
The other 30 people caught by the downpour declined assistance, Coast Guard spokesman Petty Officer 3rd Class Michael Clark said.
No injuries were reported.
The Coast Guard and Tillamook County emergency personnel were dispatched after rising waters flooded out the only bridge linking the park to the main coastal highway, officials said. Clark said floodwaters also posed the threat of mudslides in the area.
The National Weather Service in Portland posted flood watch advisories for much of coastal Oregon and Washington state, with reports of 4 to 10 inches of rain falling on parts of the Pacific Northwest.

BRUNSWICK, Ga. (Reuters) - Two white men on trial in the killing of Ahmaud Arbery were shown surveillance video of the Black man walking around a half-built house in their southern Georgia neighborhood 12 days before they chased and shot him, a jury heard on Friday.
""Nobody seems to know who this kid is or where he's coming from,"" Robert Rash, a Glynn County police officer, told the two men, Gregory McMichael and his son Travis McMichael, on the night of Feb. 11, 2020, after showing them the clips, according to body-worn camera video played in court.
The McMichaels and their neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan have pleaded not guilty to murder, aggravated assault and false imprisonment for the shooting, cellphone video of which sparked outrage when it emerged more than two months later.
They face life in prison if convicted of murder at the trial in Glynn County Superior Court in Brunswick (NYSE:BC), a small city in coastal Georgia.
The men say they thought Arbery might have been the same man caught on camera in the half-built house when he ran past the McMichaels' driveway in Satilla Shores, a leafy, mostly white residential community outside Brunswick, on Feb. 23, 2020.
They pursued him in pickup trucks for several minutes before the younger McMichael pointed a shotgun and fired as Arbery ran toward him and reached toward the weapon. Their lawyers say this was justified self-defense, while prosecutors say the men ""assumed the worst"" about a Black man out for an afternoon jog.
Arbery was first captured on security cameras going into the house under construction in Satilla Shores on the night of Oct. 25, 2019. Larry English, the property owner, previously testified he wanted police to identify the man in the videos and tell him he was trespassing and not to enter the property again.
Arbery was recorded again walking around the unfenced construction site on Nov. 18, 2019, though once again nothing was taken that day, according to English. Rash told the jury he would show screenshots of the videos to people as he made his rounds but no one was ever able to identify him. 
On Dec. 20, 2019, Rash saw Greg McMichael, whom he knew from McMichael's old job as an investigator for the local district attorney, in front of his house.
""I talked to him in reference to the unidentified Black male,"" Rash said.
McMichael asked the officer to give his cellphone number to English. Rash said he did this because McMichael had the ""training and experience"" to be a good witness to make a helpful call to 911 if the man returned.
Prosecutor Linda Dunikoski asked if Rash was deputizing McMichael. Rash said no.
""So you wanted him to be a witness, to get this guy identified?"" Dunikoski asked.
""Yes,"" Rash said.
Prosecutors are seeking to rebut a defense argument that the men were trying to make a citizen's arrest on Arbery under a now-repealed Georgia law. That law required there to be reasonable belief that someone is fleeing from a serious felony crime they just committed.
On the night of Feb. 11 neighbors saw Arbery again on the property, and Travis McMichael rushed over with his gun and saw Arbery briefly in his car headlights.
Rash soon arrived on the scene and played for the McMichaels some of the videos English had sent to his cellphone.
""This guy's always on foot, nobody in the neighborhood knows who he is,"" Rash tells the McMichaels, according to video from his body-worn camera. He tells them that English has only ever seen Arbery nosing around. ""He hasn't seen him actually take anything,"" Rash says.

""It's criminal trespassing,"" Gregory McMichael replies. Criminal trespass is a misdemeanor in Georgia law.
""Yeah, yeah, at the very least,"" Rash agrees.

The United States, Britain, Norway, the European Union and Switzerland also urged the security services to respect the right to free speech ""without fear of violence or detention"" ahead of protests set for Saturday by critics of the army's move.
Sudan's Khartoum state said it would close all but three bridges across the river Nile at midnight ahead of the demonstrations on Saturday, Sudan TV reported, announcing what is a routine move to tighten security before rallies.
General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan was sworn in on Thursday as head of the new Sovereign Council, which replaces the power-sharing body he dissolved last month in a takeover that derailed Sudan's transition to civilian rule.
The head of the powerful paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in Sudan, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, was sworn in as his deputy. 
The army's move undermined its commitment to uphold transitional arrangements requiring civilians on the council to be nominated by the Forces for Freedom and Change, a coalition that had been sharing power with the army since 2019, a joint statement by the United States and the other countries said.
It ""complicates efforts to put Sudan's democratic transition back on track"", they said, adding the move was ""in violation"" of an accord setting out the transition.
""We strongly urge against further escalatory steps.""
In Geneva, the top U.N. human rights official Michelle Bachelet designated Adama Dieng, a former U.N. adviser on the prevention of genocide, to monitor ""the developing human rights situation"" in Sudan. His term will end when civilian-led government is restored, a U.N. statement said.
Abdalla Hamdok, the prime minister ousted in the Oct. 25 coup, remains under house arrest. Hamdok has demanded the release of top civilians and a return to the transition that began after the ousting of autocrat Omar al-Bashir in 2019.
Earlier, Volker Perthes, the U.N. special representative for Sudan, said the army's unilateral move on Thursday ""makes it increasingly difficult to return to the constitutional order"".

Referring to Saturday's planned demonstrations, Perthes also called on the security forces to exercise utmost restraint and respect the right to peaceful assembly and free expression.
Security forces shot dead three people during the last big protest against the takeover on Oct. 31. In total, 15 protesters have been killed since the coup.

Hilton, 40, who got engaged to businessman Reum, also 40, in February, posted details of the wedding in Los Angeles on Thursday in a blog where she said she couldn't believe she was finally a wife.
""I finally got to kiss my Prince and begin the happily ever after I’ve been dreaming of since I was a little girl,"" she wrote.
""Wifey for lifey,"" she added in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) posting alongside photos of her Oscar de la Renta lace wedding gown.
Guests at the wedding on her family's posh Bel-Air estate included Kim Kardashian, Nicole Richie and Paula Abdul. Demi Lovato performed at a wedding reception, where Hilton had four changes of outfits, celebrity website TMZ reported.
Hilton, the great granddaughter of Hilton Hotels founder Conrad Hilton, was catapulted to tabloid fame through a leaked sex tape in 2001. She later starred in the TV reality show ""A Simple Life"" and is currently filming a reality series called ""This is Paris.""

Her personal business empire now includes a perfume line, boutiques and other products.
Hilton had a long string of boyfriends, ranging from singer Nick Carter to Greek shipping heir Stavros Niarchos and musician Benji Madden. She has been engaged three times before - to actor Chris Zylka in 2018, shipping heir Paris Latsis in 2005 and fashion model Jason Shaw in 2002.

Thursday's comment by Kevin Gough drew sharp criticism from the Rev. Al Sharpton, whom the defense attorney cited in asking the judge in the high-profile case to exclude African-American clergy.
Arbery, a 25-year old Black man, was chased by the three men and shot dead in a mostly white neighborhood in the coastal city of Brunswick (NYSE:BC) in February 2020. The three have pleaded not guilty to murder, aggravated assault and false imprisonment in the trial.
""If their pastor's Al Sharpton right now, that's fine. But then that's it. We don't want any more Black pastors coming in here ... sitting with the victim's family, trying to influence a jury in this case,"" said attorney Kevin Gough, who represents defendant William ""Roddie"" Bryan.
Sharpton had attended the trial on Wednesday and conducted a prayer vigil with Arbery's parents outside the courthouse, he said on his official Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account. 
The trial comes as the killings of Black Americans by police in recent years have sparked a renewed push for civil rights in the United States, with the murder of George Floyd captured on video last year sparking worldwide protests.
""The arrogant insensitivity of attorney Kevin Gough in asking a judge to bar me or any minister of the family's choice underscores the disregard for the value of the human life lost and the grieving of a family in need (of) spiritual and community support,"" Sharpton said.
He said his attendance was ""not disruptive in any way"" and was ""at the invitation of the family.""
Gough, who said he did not learn about Sharpton's presence until after that day's court session, told Judge Timothy Walmsley, ""We want to keep politics out of this case."" He suggested the presence of figures like Sharpton ""could be consciously or unconsciously an attempt to pressure or influence the jury.""
The judge told Gough he was ""not going to blanketly exclude members of the public from this courtroom.""

Bryan, 52, as well as neighbor Gregory McMichael, 65, and his son Travis McMichael, 35, face life in prison if convicted of murder.
The jury was shown videos on Thursday of Arbery walking around a vacant property on earlier visits to the Georgia neighborhood where he was shot. Prosecutors say Arbery was an avid runner out for a Sunday afternoon jog.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba opens its borders next week signaling new opportunity for pandemic-weary travelers and the island's tourism industry, but for U.S. citizens getting there requires jumping through hoops like never before, according to the heads of eight U.S. tour agencies.
U.S. President Donald Trump ended cruise ship dockings, reduced flights to Havana and eliminated them altogether to the outlying provinces. His administration declared most hotels, bus and other Cuban tour services off limits because they were owned by the military, and made financial transactions more difficult in general, measures that remain in place under President Joe Biden. 
""U.S. obstacles are the most significant in our more than 22 years of doing business in Cuba,"" said Michael Zuccato, head of Cuba Travel Services. 
Tensions between Washington and Havana are on the rise ahead of protests planned by dissidents on the island for Nov. 15, the same day Cuba reopens its borders to international visitors.
""The challenges seem endless right now. Between Trump, the pandemic and now Biden,"" said Mayra Alonso, president of Marazul Tours. She said walking the tightrope between U.S. and Cuban regulations ""keeps it interesting.""
Zuccato, like the others, said booking hotels and transferring funds to the Caribbean island in particular had become major headaches for those planning trips to Cuba from the United States.
Many tour operators had hoped that Biden would make good on campaign promises and reduce hurdles to visiting the Caribbean island, a popular destination that boasts a rich culture, white sand beaches and historic buildings.
""U.S. sanctions increased by Trump and maintained by the Biden administration are a great disappointment,"" Collin Laverty, head of Cuban Educational Travel, said.
Rising political tensions between the long-term rivals ahead of next week's planned protests do not help, the tour operators said.
Despite the escalating rhetoric, Cuba, which depends on tourism, continues to welcome all U.S. citizens to vacation on the island, Transportation Minister Eduardo Rodriguez told reporters last week. 
""Today the United States has four weekly flights to Havana, and we have increased this to 147 per week, including 77 to Havana,"" he said. 
U.S. airlines have announced more flights to Havana beginning next week, with an eye toward Cuban-Americans traveling home over the holidays. 
The Biden administration has given no indication it plans to allow flights to the provinces, however. 
Tom Popper, founder and former president of insightCuba and CEO of 82° West Consultants, a Cuba business consulting firm, said despite strict travel restrictions to the neighboring island nation, Americans can still go there legally.
    ""Typically, the U.S. market sees Cuba as a binary choice: either they are permitted to travel to Cuba or they are not, which depends on the most recent actions by the sitting U.S. president,"" he said.
    Popper explained travel to Cuba is allowed under 12 categories including the Support for the Cuban People category, used by most travelers – journalistic activities, and visiting relatives.
    He said many tour operators and travel advisers design trips that are compliant with U.S. regulations. 
Travel boomed during the detente begun by former U.S. President Barack Obama who loosened restrictions and even took his own family there during an historic visit in 2016.
The Trump administration reversed Obama's measures and added new restrictions, and then Cuba closed its borders during much of the pandemic.

During 2018 and 2019, some 500,000 Cuban Americans visited their homeland each year, according to the Cuban government. 
Travel by non-Cuban Americans, however, plunged from 498,538 in 2018 when the Trump administration began to impose new sanctions to just 58,147 in 2020 when pandemic lockdowns began, the government said.

PARIS (Reuters) -World powers will push for sanctions against anyone who disrupts Libya's electoral process and political transition, they said in Paris on Friday, though big disputes remain over how to stage a vote intended to help end a decade of conflict. 
The meeting, which included the leaders of France, Libya, Germany, Italy and Egypt, as well as the U.S. vice president, was to cement backing for the planned Dec. 24 election and efforts to remove foreign forces.
The elections are envisaged as a key moment in a U.N.-backed peace process to end a decade of violent chaos that has drawn in regional powers and undermined Mediterranean stability since the 2011 NATO-backed uprising against Muammar Gaddafi. 
The votes for a new president and parliament are still in doubt with six weeks to go amid disputes between rival Libyan factions and political bodies over the rules underpinning the electoral schedule and who can run.
The world powers said they backed an electoral process ""starting"" on Dec. 24, a change in emphasis from a previous demand for both votes to happen simultaneously on that day.
Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said it was essential a new election law was drawn up ""with the agreement of everyone... not in the coming weeks, but in the coming days"". 
Libya's interim Prime Minister Abdulhamid al-Dbeibah said he had emphasised urgent changes during the meeting to the electoral rules that rival Libyan political bodies are tussling over.
There is no agreement yet on the constitutional basis for the election or whether Dbeibah himself, a likely front-runner for president, might be allowed to register to stand so soon before the vote and after having promised to take no part. 
Wrangling over the election threatens to unravel the wider peace process, which also includes efforts to unify long-divided state institutions and to pull out foreign mercenaries who remain entrenched along frontlines despite a ceasefire. 
Powers in Paris decided ""that individuals or entities, inside or outside of Libya, who might attempt to obstruct, undermine, manipulate or falsify the electoral process and the political transition"" could face sanctions.
They backed an ""inclusive"" process, a word often used in the context of Libya's election, to mean allowing all candidates to run including divisive factional leaders. 
INCLUSIVE VOTE. 
French President Emmanuel Macron said a commitment by eastern forces to remove 300 foreign mercenaries through a process agreed between the warring eastern and western sides must be followed by Russia and Turkey pulling out fighters. 
Paris initially wanted the leaders of Russia and Turkey to attend. Turkey, which fears France wants to accelerate the departure of Turkish forces from Libya, has joined Moscow in sending lower level representatives.

Ankara voiced reservations over language in the final statement regarding the departure of foreign forces. It stresses a difference between the presence of its troops in Libya that were invited by a U.N.-recognised government and those imported by other factions.
Mercenaries from Russia's Wagner Group are entrenched alongside the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA), which was supported in the war by Moscow, along with the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum vowed on Friday to address economic recovery in the region by shoring up supply chains, tackling labour issues and continuing to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In a joint statement after a virtual meeting hosted by New Zealand, the leaders of the 21-member grouping also pledged to work together to address climate and environmental challenges.
""With the COVID-19 crisis far from over, we are determined to use all available macroeconomic tools to address the adverse consequences of COVID-19 and sustain economic recovery, while preserving long-term fiscal sustainability,"" the leaders said in their joint statement. 
""We will intensify efforts to ensure goods continue to flow even under challenging circumstances.""
The summit of the Pacific Rim countries came amid heightened regional trade and geopolitical tensions, particularly between China and the United States, and global efforts to tackle the pandemic and the climate crisis.
Addressing APEC leaders at the summit, U.S. President Joe Biden underscored his commitment to strengthening the U.S. relationship with APEC economies ""in order to advance fair and open trade and investment, bolster American competitiveness, and ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific"".
Biden said the climate crisis was an enormous opportunity to create good jobs and that countries must work together to move towards a sustainable future, according to a White House statement.
""The President discussed ways to unleash the economic power of the region and to deepen U.S. economic engagement throughout the Indo-Pacific,"" the statement said, without elaborating.
China's President Xi Jinping told the meeting that economic and technological cooperation is important for the bloc and should receive further investment, Chinese state media reported.
Speaking via video link, Xi also said China would ""unswervingly"" expand its opening up to the outside world and share China's development opportunities with the world and Asia-Pacific countries, state broadcaster CCTV said.
The APEC summit came ahead of a much-anticipated online summit between Biden and Xi expected on Monday. U.S. officials have said they believe direct engagement with Xi is the best way to prevent the relationship between the world’s two biggest economies from spiralling toward conflict.
China set the tone for the APEC meeting with Xi warning in a video recording on Thursday that the region must not return to the tensions of the Cold War era.
The comment was seen as a reference to efforts by the United States and its regional allies to blunt what they see as China's growing coercive economic and military influence.
Speaking ahead of the expected Biden-Xi meeting, a Chinese official said Beijing was also keen to avoid confrontation and focus on ""positive competition,"" while pushing for cooperation on issues such the climate crisis and ending the coronavirus pandemic.
A framework deal on boosting cooperation to tackle climate change, unveiled by the two countries at the U.N. climate conference in Scotland, sent ""quite a positive signal"" for the upcoming summit, the official said.
APEC is the last multi-lateral meeting of the year and comes after a flurry of gatherings including the high-profile G20 summit in Rome and the COP26 climate meeting in Glasgow, Scotland.
The leaders' statement made no mention of a U.S. offer to host the gathering in 2023. Officials have said a consensus had not been reached on this proposal and a source told Reuters that Russia had not backed the proposal. 
One U.S. official said all but one country had backed the offer, which requires the consensus of all 21 economies. ""One economy is still undergoing consultations and has not yet joined consensus. We hope this impasse is resolved quickly to ensure we can continue the positive momentum on economic cooperation through APEC,"" the official said. 

The APEC summit will be held in Thailand next year.
During a session on Friday, German chancellor Angela Merkel reiterated the importance of vaccinations in the fight against the pandemic. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern then paid tribute to the outgoing chancellor.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States and Qatar signed an accord on Friday for Qatar to represent U.S. diplomatic interests in Afghanistan, an important signal of possible future direct engagement between Washington and the Taliban after two decades of war.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Qatari counterpart, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, signed the agreement making Qatar the U.S. ""protecting power"" in Afghanistan at a State Department ceremony after holding talks. 
""Qatar will establish a U.S. interest section within its embassy in Afghanistan to provide certain consular services and monitor the condition and security of U.S. diplomatic facilities in Afghanistan,"" Blinken said.
The move will further strengthen relations between Washington and the small, wealthy Gulf monarchy, which forged close ties with the Taliban by hosting the militants' only official office outside Afghanistan and by playing a key role in the talks that led to the 2020 deal for the U.S. troop pullout this year.
The agreement comes as the United States and other Western countries grapple with how to engage with the hardline Islamists after they took over Afghanistan in a lightning advance in August as U.S.-led forces were completing their pullout.
The United States and other Western countries shut their embassies and withdrew their diplomats as the Taliban seized Kabul, following which the militants declared an interim government whose top members are under U.S. and U.N. sanctions.
The United States, European countries and others are reluctant to formally recognize the Pashtun-dominated Taliban, accusing them of backtracking on pledges of political and ethnic inclusivity and to uphold the rights of women and minorities.
But with winter approaching, many governments realize they need to engage more to prevent the deeply impoverished country from plunging into a humanitarian catastrophe. 
According to the new agreement, which comes into effect on Dec. 31, Qatar will dedicate certain staff from its embassy in Afghanistan to a U.S. Interests Section and will coordinate closely with U.S. State Department and with U.S. mission in Doha.
A senior State Department official said the United States would also continue its engagement with the Taliban's political office in the Qatari capital, Doha.
Consular assistance may include accepting passport applications, offering notarial services for documentation, providing information, and helping in emergencies, the U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.
""The protecting power arrangement envisions that Qatar would facilitate any formal communication between the United States and Afghanistan,"" the senior U.S. official said.
SECOND AGREEMENT
Millions of Afghans face growing hunger amid soaring food prices, a drought and an economy in freefall, fueled by a hard cash shortage, sanctions on Taliban leaders and the suspension of financial aid.
The Taliban victory saw the billions of dollars in foreign aid that had kept the economy afloat abruptly switched off, with more than $9 billion in central bank reserves frozen outside the country.
In a second agreement with Washington, Qatar will continue to temporarily host up to 8,000 at-risk Afghans who have applied for special immigrant visas (SIV) and their eligible family members, the U.S. official said.
""SIV applicants will be housed at Camp As Sayliyah and al-Udeid Air Base,"" the official said.
At a press conference after signing the accords, Blinken praised Qatar for aiding ongoing evacuations of American citizens, green cards holders and SIV applicants.
Qatar, he said, allowed to transit through Doha roughly half of the 124,000 people evacuated from Afghanistan since August in the hastily arranged and chaotic U.S. evacuation operation.

Since then, Qatar has funded at least 15 evacuation flights by Qatar Airways of hundreds of U.S. citizens and others and will continue providing charter flights for SIV holders and other Afghans, he said.
Tens of thousands of Afghans potentially at risk of Taliban retribution for aiding the United States and its allies or working for foreign organizations remain in Afghanistan.

Fenster, 37, managing editor https://www.reuters.com/world/five-facts-about-danny-fenster-us-journalist-jailed-myanmar-2021-11-12 of online magazine Frontier Myanmar, was found guilty of incitement and violations of immigration and unlawful associations laws, his magazine said and described the sentences as ""the harshest possible under the law"".
He is the first Western journalist sentenced to prison in recent years in Myanmar, where a Feb. 1 coup by the military against an elected government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi ended a decade of tentative steps towards democracy and triggered nationwide protests.
His trial had not been made public and a spokesman for the junta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""There is absolutely no basis to convict Danny of these charges,"" said Thomas Kean, editor-in-chief of Frontier Myanmar, one of the country's top independent news outlets. 
Fenster was arrested while trying to leave https://reut.rs/3F2Dgax the country in May and has since been held in Yangon's Insein prison, where hundreds of opponents of the Tatmadaw, as the military is known, were jailed, many beaten and tortured, during decades of dictatorship. 
Fenster's family has repeatedly called for his release.
He was charged with additional, and more serious, offences https://reut.rs/3c2GGxJ of sedition and violations of the terrorism act earlier this week, without an explanation by authorities. Those charges are punishable by a maximum 20 years in prison each.
Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said Fenster's jailing was also intended as a warning to the United States and the media. 
""The junta's rationale for this outrageous, rights abusing sentence is first to shock and intimidate all remaining Burmese journalists inside Myanmar by punishing a foreign journalist this way,"" he said. 
""The second message is more strategic, focused on sending a message to the U.S. that the Tatmadaw's generals don't appreciate being hit with economic sanctions and can bite back with hostage diplomacy,"" he said. 
'UNACCEPTABLE'
The United States condemned the ruling as an ""unacceptable attack on freedom of expression in Burma"" and a reminder of the continuing human rights and humanitarian crisis in Myanmar.
""The ruling today represents an unjust conviction of an innocent person,"" a State Department spokesperson said by email. ""We are closely monitoring Danny’s situation and will continue to work for his immediate release.""
The American is among dozens of journalists detained in Myanmar after protests and strikes erupted following the coup, hampering the military's efforts to consolidate power. Independent media has been accused by the junta of incitement. 
More than 1,200 civilians have been killed in protests and thousands detained since the coup, according to activists cited by the United Nations. 
Myanmar authorities overlooked Fenster in a recent amnesty https://reut.rs/3oiKFfj for hundreds of people detained over anti-junta protests, which included some journalists. 
During nearly half a century of harsh rule by the military, news reporting was tightly controlled by the state but Myanmar's media blossomed after the a quasi-civilian government introduced tentative reforms from 2011.

Since the February coup, however, the military has rescinded media licenses, curbed the internet and satellite broadcasts and arrested dozens of journalists, in what human rights groups have called an assault on the truth. 
Frontier Myanmar's publisher, Sonny Swe, who spent eight years in prison during the previous era of military rule, announced Fenster's imprisonment on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) under the message: ""A lot of things are going so wrong in this country.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional Democrats on Friday introduced a motion to censure Republican Representative Paul Gosar on Friday over a cartoon video that depicted him killing Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and swinging swords at President Joe Biden.
Democrats backing the measure said that violent images like those in the video increase threats against elected officials after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump. 
The resolution, backed by 60 House Democrats, calls for Gosar to stand in the House chamber while the censure is read. It is unclear whether House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would bring the measure up for a vote.
A censure is a symbolic reprimand that carries no fines or other penalties. However, it could be awkward for Gosar's fellow Republicans, who would have to go on record condemning him or supporting his actions. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy has so far been silent, despite Democratic calls for action. 
At least 23 lawmakers have faced censure in the House, typically for issues of decorum or financial misconduct. 
Gosar, who shared the 90-second video on Sunday, has remained defiant since, saying on Tuesday he would fight for ""the America First agenda"" of former President Donald Trump. 

Pelosi has urged ethics and law enforcement investigations into the matter. Under House rules, ethics violations can result in reprimands, fines, censure or removal from office. Threats can also constitute felony violations punishable by imprisonment. 
The video appears to be an altered version of a Japanese animated series. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) added a warning label to the video, saying it violated its ""hateful conduct"" policy, and also restricted engagement with the tweet. But the social media giant said in a notification attached above the tweet that it had determined ""it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are expected to hold a virtual summit on Monday, sources said, amid tensions over trade, human rights and military activities.
Washington and Beijing have been sparring on issues from the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic to China's expanding nuclear arsenal. U.S. officials believe direct engagement with Xi is the best way to prevent the relationship between the world’s two biggest economies from spiraling toward conflict.
Beijing is also keen to avoid confrontation and focus on ""positive competition,"" while pushing for cooperation on issues such as the climate crisis and ending the coronavirus pandemic, said one Chinese official.
The two leaders provided a possible preview of this approach at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit on Friday. Xi promised https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/biden-xi-address-asia-pacific-leaders-trade-covid-recovery-2021-11-12 China would open up further to the rest of the world and share development opportunities and Biden pledged to deepen U.S. economic engagement in Asia. 
A framework deal on boosting cooperation to tackle climate change, unveiled by the world's two largest economies at the U.N. climate conference in Scotland, sent ""quite a positive signal"" for the approaching summit, the official said.
""We view U.S.-China competition like a golf game, where each side focuses on its own better performance, not like a boxing game, where both sides try to knock each other out,"" the official added.
Separately, Biden will address the Asia Pacific Economic Conference leaders' summit in an online appearance on Friday morning, the White House said.
Xi is likely to invite the U.S. president to attend the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, CNBC reported on Thursday, citing two people familiar with the matter.
Such a request could put Biden in an uncomfortable spot as he presses China on human rights. Biden is unlikely to go to Beijing for any kind of meeting; the U.S. president did not attend the Summer Olympics in Japan, a key American ally. 
Biden and Xi last spoke on Sept. 9, a 90-minute conversation that a senior U.S. official said focused on economic issues, climate change and COVID-19.
Biden has been eager to hold face-to-face talks with Xi to try to reduce tensions with Beijing over Taiwan and a host of other issues.
U.S. officials had wanted Biden to meet Xi on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Rome two weeks ago, but Xi has not traveled outside of China since the pandemic broke out 21 months ago.
The latest Biden-Xi virtual meeting was agreed to in principle last month during talks in Zurich between China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, and U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan, who raised concerns about Chinese actions in the South China Sea, as well as human rights and Beijing's stances on Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Taiwan.

A senior administration official said there was nothing to announce yet. ""We have an agreement in principle to have a virtual bilateral meeting before the end of the year. Working-level discussions are under way to confirm details,"" the official said.
The White House has characterized the upcoming meeting as part of ongoing U.S. efforts to ""responsibly manage"" competition between the two countries.

(Reuters) -Britain's GSK and partner Vir said on Friday their antibody-based COVID-19 drug was shown in a trial to work as well when given as a shot in the arm awhen administered via the standard infusion, potentially offering more convenience.
GSK said it would now speak to global regulators, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, about potential approval for the new method of administration, known as intramuscular injection, which can be carried out by family doctors and spare patients a trip to hospital.
Sotrovimab is authorised for emergency use in the United States to prevent mild or moderate cases of COVID-19 from worsening. The European Medicines Agency has given its go-ahead for use by member states though EU-wide approval is still outstanding. 

Similar products are offered or being developed by Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN).
Eli Lilly's therapy is so far given by infusion, or drip, only. AstraZeneca's antibody drug, under review to possibly prevent infections, is delivered by intramuscular shot only. Regeneron and Roche's product can be given as an infusion or injection under the skin, typically in the abdomen.

In excerpts of an interview with an ABC reporter, the former Republican president openly supported the threats to Pence, who went before Congress that day to certify results of the 2020 presidential election in which Democrat Joe Biden defeated Trump.
Pence, who with Trump is among potential candidates for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, has said he was proud of his role in certifying the election results.
Asked about the Jan. 6 crowd's chants of ""Hang Mike Pence"", Trump said they ""were very angry"" and he reiterated his false claim of voter fraud, according to an audio of the interview, conducted in March by ABC's Jonathan Karl and reported by Axios news outlet.
""It's common sense that you're supposed to protect. How can you — if you know a vote is fraudulent, right? — how can you pass on a fraudulent vote to Congress? How can you do that?"" Trump said, according to the report.
Asked if he was worried for Pence's safety, Trump told ABC: ""No. I thought he was well-protected, and I had heard that he was in good shape.""
Representatives for Pence could not be reached for comment on the report.
Thousands of Trump supporters stormed the seat of the U.S. government on Jan. 6 as Pence and members of Congress met to certify Biden's substantial victory. Four people died during the rioting and three Capitol Police died afterwards, while scores of other officers were injured.
Nearly 700 people have been charged in the riot and Congress is investigating the attack. 

Karl interviewed Trump for his book ""Betrayal"" that comes out on Nov. 16, in which he examines the last months of the Trump presidency and events after he left the White House in January.
The release of Trump's comments comes amid increasing concern in the United States over domestic extremism, including threats to local election officials.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's federal pollution control board on Friday ordered states and local bodies to be in ""complete readiness"" for emergency measures to tackle New Delhi's worsening smog conditions due to a drop in temperature and wind speeds.
A thick haze of toxic smog hung over the Indian capital, exacerbated by a spike in the burning of crop waste in surrounding farmlands.
It reduced visibility and the Air Quality Index (AQI) hit 470 on a scale of 500, according to the federal pollution control board. This level of pollution means the air will affect healthy people and seriously impact those with existing diseases.
According to the pollution board's ""Graded Response Action Plan"", air quality remaining ""severe"" for 48 hours must prompt states and local bodies to impose emergency measures that include shutting down schools, imposing 'odd-even' restrictions on private cars based on their number plates, and stopping all construction.
In a circular late on Friday, the board said the government and private offices should reduce the use of private transport by 30% and advised the city's residents to limit outdoor exposure.
""Meteorological conditions will be highly unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants till November 18, 2021 in view of low winds with calm conditions during the night,"" the board said.
Earlier this week, local authorities had ordered a shutdown of brick kilns, increased the frequency of mechanized cleaning and a crackdown on garbage burning and dust. 
The concentration of poisonous PM2.5 particulate matter averaged 329 micrograms per cubic meter of air. The government prescribes a ""safe"" PM2.5 reading at 60 micrograms per cubic meter of air over a period of 24 hours.
PM2.5 is small enough to travel deep into the lungs, enter the bloodstream and can cause severe respiratory diseases, including lung cancer. 
""This is becoming a nightmare,"" said Gufran Beig, founder project director of air quality and weather monitor SAFAR that falls under the Ministry of Earth Science.
""Fire counts are in the range of 3,000-5,000 and not declining,"" Beig told Reuters, referring to crop stubble fires in the regions around the capital. 

India's efforts to reduce crop-waste burning, a major source of air pollution during winter, by spending billions of rupees over the past four years have done little to avert a sharp deterioration in air quality.
Delhi, often ranked the world's most polluted capital, faces extremely bad air in winter due to the crop stubble burning, emissions from transport, coal-fired plants outside the city and other industrial emissions, open garbage burning and dust.

The military deployment follows more than 30 homicides on Tuesday and Wednesday in the impoverished Central American nation of about 6.5 million people. Average daily homicides had dropped to less than two per day under Bukele, who took office in 2019. 
""We have deployed our national police and armed forces to contain the increase in homicides registered over the last 48 hours,"" Bukele posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) alongside videos of soldiers patrolling the streets.
It was not clear how many soldiers were deployed or how long the operation would last. Bukele alleged there were ""dark forces"" at work, without elaborating.
A government source said that the majority of the troops would patrol densely populated areas of the capital, San Salvador. The country has been terrorized by street gangs since shortly after the end of its civil war in 1992.
The sight of soldiers on streets will sit uneasily with Bukele's critics, who accuse the president of growing authoritarianism. Bukele, 40, proclaimed himself ""dictator"" in his Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) bio in recent weeks in an apparent joke that did little to soothe the opposition fears. (Full Story) 
He was strongly criticized in 2020 for occupying congress with military and police, which many saw as an intimidation tactic. Bukele has also announced plans to double the military in coming years to 40,000 troops from 20,000.
Murder rates have dropped sharply under Bukele and newspaper El Faro last year alleged government officials negotiated with gang members to reduce violence in exchange for better conditions in prison.
Bukele called the article a ""farce,"" but the attorney general said it would investigate.(Full Story)
On Thursday, Bukele's political opponents speculated on social media that the uptick in homicides could be a sign that the truce is falling apart. 
Bukele's troop deployment is likely a political ""stunt"" that illustrates the limits and fragility of the security arrangement, according to Tiziano Breda, an International Crisis Group analyst for Central America.
""It shows the extremely low levels of violence were not due to successful public security policies but rather they were a result of a decision by gangs to scale down the displays of violence,"" Breda said.

""The gangs still have the ability to change or alter these violence trends if they decide to do so."" The government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Bukele said more measures to halt the violence would be announced in the coming hours.

BRUNSWICK, Ga. (Reuters) - A jury was shown videos on Thursday of Ahmaud Arbery walking around a vacant property on earlier visits to the mostly white southern Georgia neighborhood where the Black man was chased and shot by three white men who are now on trial for murder.
The videos were pulled from surveillance cameras installed in an unoccupied, half-built house in Satilla Shores that plays a crucial role in the case. Arbery visited the site multiple times at night in the months before his death, the final visit taking place just minutes before he was shot.
""I got a trespasser,"" Larry English, the property owner, said in a call to police after the first recorded visit made by Arbery on the night of Oct. 25, 2019, which was played in Glynn County Superior Court on Thursday.
Gregory McMichael, 65; his son Travis McMichael, 35; and their neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52, have pleaded not guilty to murder, aggravated assault and false imprisonment. They face life in prison if convicted of murder.
The visits to the unoccupied property have become a central part of the defense case. 
The McMichaels say they were aware of reports of an unidentified Black man wandering around the property and that Travis McMichael had even glimpsed Arbery on the property on an earlier visit in February. 
They thought Arbery might have been that same man when he ran past the McMichaels' driveway in Satilla Shores on Feb. 23, 2020. Prosecutors say Arbery was an avid runner out for a Sunday afternoon jog.
The men pursued Arbery in pickup trucks before the younger McMichael pointed a shotgun and fired as Arbery ran toward him and reached at the weapon. Their lawyers say this was justified self defense.
In a video deposition recorded in September and played to the jury, English said he had been slowly building his riverside house in Satilla Shores.
""My dream was to have a place on the water,"" he said. He knew local kids sometimes roamed about the property, which was unfenced. He testified that he worried about people having an accident around the boat dock out back so installed surveillance cameras that sent videos to his phone.
The clip of Arbery walking around the dock during the visit in October 2019 was played, along with a recording of the call English made to police to report a trespassing ""colored guy"" with tattoos on his arms and curly hair. English told police the man may have been drunk or on drugs as he was ""plundering around"" the property.
In the deposition, English said he decided soon after that it was more likely the man was not intoxicated but moving cautiously in the dark in a way that looked odd on the night-vision video.
Nothing was taken that night, English said. A clip from November showing a man and woman, both white, wandering through the property at night was also played, along with the call English made to police to report them.
Videos of three other night-time visits made by Arbery in November, December and February were played. Some fishing equipment and a cooler had gone missing from one of English's boats at some point, but nothing was taken on the days Arbery was seen there, English said.
English showed the clips of Arbery to some of his neighbors, and the McMichaels have said they knew about the reports of an unknown Black man roaming around the English property when Arbery ran by their driveway on Feb. 23, 2020.
English said he sometimes made friendly chitchat with the McMichaels, and that he had never met or spoken with Bryan. 
He said he asked only one neighbor to keep an eye on his property, and it was not any of the defendants. He later heard that Travis McMichael had joined that neighbor and called 911 during the visit Arbery made on the night of Feb. 11, 2020, to report an unfamiliar Black man on the property. 

English has also said through a lawyer that he later concluded that Arbery had been stopping by for a drink of water from a faucet on his property, which was not in the view of any of the surveillance cameras.

CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Friday he doesn't believe he has lied since he was elected to parliament in 2007, rejecting allegations from French President Emmanuel Macron and others.
Macron this month said Morrison had lied to him over Australia's decision to scrap a multibillion-dollar deal with France to build Canberra's new fleet of submarines.
Criticism of Morrison intensified this week when he announced his government would spend A$178 million ($129.6 million) to support electric vehicles, three years after he criticised the technology.
But when asked on Friday, Morrison rejected allegations he had lied.
""No, I don't believe I have, no,"" Morrison told 3AW Radio. ""It's politics. People take sledges at me all the time … I've learned in public life over a long period of time to not have a thin skin, to not get bitter.""
Morrison can ill-afford to have his integrity called into question as he has to return to the polls by May 2022.
Widely watched polls show Morrison's coalition government trailing the opposition Labor party, while a Guardian Essential poll published this week showed voter approval of the prime minister at its lowest level in 18 months.
The poll showed Morrison's approval rating has fallen from a high of 65% in Febuary and now stands at 48%.
Allies too have also questioned whether they can trust Morrison, with the EU President Ursula von der Leyen earlier this year questioning whether the bloc could strike a trade deal with Australia until trust is repaired.

In solidarity with France, the European Union last month postponed the next round of talks on a free trade deal for a second time.
France has said Australia did not attempt to inform it of the cancellation until the day Canberra announced its deal with the United States and Britain. Morrison denies that, and messages he sent to Macron in the week before the announcement have since been leaked to local media.

KAPCIAMIESTIS, Lithuania/WARSAW (Reuters) - Countries bordering Belarus on Thursday warned the migrant crisis on the European Union's eastern borders could escalate into a military confrontation while Ukraine said it would deploy thousands more troops to reinforce its frontier. 
Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia said Belarus posed serious threats to European security by deliberately escalating its ""hybrid attack"" using migrants to retaliate for EU sanctions.
""This increases the possibility of provocations and serious incidents that could also spill over into the military domain,"" a joint statement by the countries' defence ministers said.
The Belarus defence ministry earlier said that in response to a build-up of Polish military forces near the border it would be obliged it to take ""appropriate response measures"", both independently and together with its strategic ally, Russia.
While not an EU member, Ukraine, wary of becoming another flashpoint, announced drills and the deployment of 8,500 additional troops https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-deploy-troops-helicopters-guard-belarus-border-2021-11-11 and police officers to the country's long northern border with Belarus.
Migrants stranded inside Belarus threw rocks and branches at Polish border guards and used logs to try to break down a razor wire fence overnight in new attempts to force their way into the EU, the authorities in Warsaw said.
The EU says Minsk is encouraging thousands fleeing war-torn parts of the world to try to cross its borders and may impose new sanctions on Belarus and airlines ferrying the migrants as soon as Monday.
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko threatened to retaliate, including by shutting down the transit of Russian natural gas via Belarus, although there was no immediate response from Russia, its ally and financial backer.
BOMBERS, TENSIONS
Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow will try to help Europe weather an energy crunch and is hoping German authorities will soon certify the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will carry more Russian gas to Europe's biggest economy.
Moscow reacted angrily in the past when Ukraine, another transit country, disrupted gas supplies to the West, but Lukashenko has pushed back against its wishes at times while accepting loans and subsidised energy.
Minsk said two Russian strategic bombers were patrolling Belarusian airspace for a second day in a show of support.
In comments carried by local media, Lukashenko also said there were attempts to transfer weapons to the migrants, but neither provided any evidence nor said who was behind what he called a provocation.
The Kremlin said Russia had nothing to do with tensions on the border and suggested the presence of heavily armed people on both sides was a source of concern. 
It also said Putin held a second phone call in two days with German Chancellor Angela Merkel telling her the EU should talk to Belarus about the crisis.
The Kremlin earlier rejected as ""crazy"" a suggestion in a media report that Russia's flag carrier Aeroflot could be targeted with sanctions.
The EU has not said which airlines will be included, but Turkey also responded angrily to a report that its flag carrier Turkish Airlines might be affected. 
""We reject efforts to portray Turkey, which is not a party to this issue, as part of the problem,"" the Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement.
FREEZING WEATHER
Trapped between two borders, the migrants have endured freezing weather in makeshift camps. Poland has reported at least seven migrant deaths in the months-long crisis and other migrants have expressed fear they would die.
None of around 150 migrants gathered near the town of Bialowieza managed to breach the border, with 468 attempted crossings on Wednesday, according to the Polish border guard service.
Neighbouring Lithuania, which like Poland has imposed a state of emergency on the border, also reported new crossing attempts.
It said it had asked the United Nations to discuss creating a ""humanitarian corridor"" from the border zone to help the migrants return to their home countries, saying social media accounts showed some people trapped there wanted to go back.
The Iraqi embassy in Moscow on Thursday said it was ready to help evacuate any Iraqi nationals who wanted to return home from Belarus, inviting them to contact it by WhatsApp or email.
EU foreign ministers may approve more Belarus sanctions on Monday that could include individuals and companies, according to one diplomat. The bloc's executive commission said airlines that bring migrants would be on the list and two diplomats said the main airport in Belarus was also being considered.
The EU accuses Lukashenko of manufacturing the crisis in revenge for earlier sanctions in response to a violent crackdown on mass street protests against his rule in 2020. Germany said he must be countered with all strength.
""Lukashenko is making an inhumane power play with people,"" German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who is set to become the country's next chancellor, said.
Lukashenko and Russia have said the EU was not living up to its humanitarian values by preventing migrants from crossing.

Large groups fleeing conflicts and poverty in the Middle East and elsewhere started flying to Minsk this spring with the help of Belarusian travel agencies. 
Many have travelled to the border with Poland, Lithuania or Latvia and tried to cross into the EU, sometimes using wire cutters they say were given to them by Belarusian border guards.

(Reuters) - Four astronauts, three from NASA and one from the European Space Agency, arrived at the International Space Station on Thursday and docked their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule with the orbiting laboratory to begin a six-month science mission.
The rendezvous came about 21 hours after the team and its capsule were launched atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Wednesday night, following a string of weather delays that postponed the liftoff for a week and a half.
The docking took place about 6:30 p.m. EST (2330 GMT) while the Crew Dragon vehicle, dubbed Endurance, and the space station were flying about 260 miles (420 km) above the eastern Caribbean Sea, according to NASA.
The Endurance crew consists of three American NASA astronauts - flight commander Raja Chari, 44, mission pilot Tom Marshburn, 61, and mission specialist Kayla Barron, 34 - as well as German astronaut Matthias Maurer, 51, a mission specialist from the European Space Agency.
On arrival, the crew took inventory, conducted standard leak checks and pressurized the space between the spacecraft in preparation for opening the hatch to the space station about two hours later.
A live NASA video feed from the station showed the new arrivals floating headfirst through a padded passageway from their capsule into the orbiting outpost.
They were welcomed aboard with hugs from the three current space station occupants - Russian cosmonauts Pyotr Dubrov and Oleg Novitskiy and NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei, who shared a Soyuz flight with his Roscosmos crewmates to the complex.
ASTRONAUT WINGS
Endeavor's second-in-command, Marshburn - a medical doctor and former NASA flight surgeon - has logged two previous spaceflights to the space station and four spacewalks. 
Maurer, a materials science engineer, was making his debut spaceflight, as were Chari, a U.S. Air Force combat jet and test pilot, and Barron, a U.S. Navy submarine officer and nuclear engineer. Shortly after coming aboard, Marshburn pinned astronaut wings to the collars of his three rookie colleagues amid handshakes and smiles.
Both Chari and Barron also are among the first group of 18 astronauts selected for NASA's upcoming Artemis missions, aimed at returning humans to the moon later this decade, over a half century after the Apollo lunar program ended. 
""I think we all loved the ride up here,"" Chari said during brief remarks in a welcoming ceremony webcast from the station. ""It was way smoother than we could have imagined.""
The SpaceX Dragon also delivered more than 4,000 pounds (1,800 kg) of hardware and research equipment, NASA said. 
The crew arriving on Thursday was officially designated ""Crew 3"" - the third full-fledged ""operational"" crew that NASA and SpaceX have flown together to the space station after a two-astronaut test run in May 2020.
""Crew 2"" returned safely to Earth from the space station on Monday with a splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico off Florida that capped a record 199 days in orbit.
SpaceX, the rocket company formed in 2002 by billionaire Elon Musk, founder of electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, has logged a total of 15 human spaceflights in 17 months, including its astro-tourism launch in September of the first all-civilian crew sent to Earth orbit without professional astronauts.

The space station, spanning the size of an American football field end to end, has been continuously occupied since November 2000, operated by an international partnership of five space agencies from 15 countries. 
An international crew of at least seven people typically lives and works aboard the platform while traveling 5 miles (8 km) per second, orbiting Earth about every 90 minutes.

KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) -Prosecutors in the murder trial of Kyle Rittenhouse said they would seek approval for the jury to consider lesser charges after days of testimony in which considerable evidence was presented in the U.S. teenager's argument that he acted in self-defense.
Rittenhouse, 18, is charged in the killing of Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and the wounding of Gaige Grosskreutz, 27, during chaotic racial justice protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Aug. 25, 2020 following the police shooting and wounding of a Black man. Rittenhouse has pleaded not guilty. 
The defense lawyers rested their case after calling their final witness, a video journalist who testified that one of the men Rittenhouse fatally shot had charged and lunged at the teenager, who was 17 at the time of the shootings.
Kenosha County Judge Bruce Schroeder said closing arguments in the trial would begin on Monday. He said the prosecution and defense would each have 2-1/2 hours to address the jury. 
The arguments are likely to underscore how Rittenhouse has become a divisive figure. He is viewed as heroic by some conservatives who favor expansive gun rights and consider the shootings justified amid protests in Kenosha marred by arson and looting. Many on the left view Rittenhouse as a vigilante and a symbol of an out-of-control American gun culture.
Kenosha County Assistant District Attorney James Kraus said he planned to ask the judge to allow the jury to consider lesser charges - so-called lesser included offenses - on the counts involving the shootings of Huber and Grosskreutz, a move that would lower the burden of proof for conviction.
Prosecutors have sought to paint Rittenhouse as a vigilante who carried an assault-style weapon into a volatile melee and wanted to use it, but a series of witnesses have offered testimony about the threats posed to the teenager that night. 
Michael F. Hart, a criminal defense lawyer in Milwaukee who has monitored the nearly two-week trial, said he could not recall a witness who was harmful to Rittenhouse's argument of self-defense. He said the prosecution's request, which must be approved by the judge, was not unusual in homicide cases.
""I'm not surprised the state requested lesser included instructions,"" Hart said. ""They recongize that their case had some shortcomings and they are trying to salvage as many convictions as they can.""
SELF-DEFENSE ARGUMENT
Rittenhouse was charged with first degree intentional homicide in the death of Huber and attempted first degree intentional homicide in the shooting of Grosskreutz. He faces life in prison if convicted on those counts.
With Huber, Kraus said he wanted all lesser charges approved for consideration by the jury. That would open the door to four additional counts ranging from second degree intentional homicide down to second degree reckless homicide.
Kraus said he would seek the inclusion of one lesser charge in the Grosskreutz shooting, which would allow the jury to weigh a recklessly endangering safety charge.
Rittenhouse testified in his own defense https://www.reuters.com/world/us/rittenhouse-called-stand-testify-own-defense-us-murder-trial-2021-11-10 on Wednesday, saying he opened fire with his AR-15-style rifle to protect himself after being attacked. 
His lawyers sought to hammer home Rittenhouse's self-defense argument by calling to the stand Drew Hernandez, then an independent reporter in Kenosha to record the protests. Hernandez testified he saw Rittenhouse earlier in the night calming down a potential confrontation. 
Hernandez, who now works for conservative media outlet Real America's Voice, was close enough to record the Rosenbaum shooting. He said he saw Rosenbaum ""charging"" at Rittenhouse and then lunging at the teenager. 
Hernandez had several tense exchanges with Kenosha County Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger, who noted that he referred to Rittenhouse as ""Kyle"" in his testimony and had sent out a tweet supportive of the ""armed citizen"" who had shot a man - later identified as Rosenbaum - minutes after the shooting.
Earlier in the day, Binger again tangled with the judge, accusing him of unfairness. The judge on Wednesday excoriated Binger for broaching the teenager's decision to remain silent, as is his right, and introducing inadmissible evidence.
The tensions resurfaced on Thursday when Binger argued against a defense attempt to present an updated report from use-of-force expert John Black, who took the witness stand to analyze video of the shootings. Binger said the report contained evidence the judge had already ruled could not be admitted. 

""Yesterday I was the target of your ire for disregarding your orders. Today the defense is disregarding your order,"" Binger said, adding that ""fundamental fairness"" was the issue at stake. ""If I'm being held to obey the court's orders, I'm asking that the defense be held to that to."" 
Schroeder responded: ""I was talking yesterday about the Constitution of the United States,"" referring to Rittenhouse's right to remain silent. ""That's not what we are talking about here today.""

BOSTON (Reuters) - Opponents of policies used to boost the number of Black and Hispanic students on American college campuses on Thursday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear two cases together that accuse Harvard University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill of discrimination.
Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA), a group founded by anti-affirmative action activist Edward Blum, in a petition asked the court to fast-track the UNC case and take it alongside a challenge to Harvard's admissions policies.
""If the Supreme Court decides, as it should, to reconsider racial preferences in college admissions, it should consider that question in the context of both a private school and a public school,"" Blum said in a statement.
Harvard declined to comment. UNC did not respond to requests for comment. Both call their admissions practices lawful.
SFFA was already challenging an appellate court's rejection of its claims that Harvard's policies discriminate against Asian Americans, giving the U.S. Supreme Court's 6-3 conservative majority a chance to end affirmative action on campuses.
But last month a judge rejected SFFA's allegations in a case filed in 2014 that said UNC's consideration of race in its undergraduate admissions process discriminated against white and Asian American applicants.
SFFA said the justices should take the UNC case with the Harvard one without going to an appellate court.
The court in June asked the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden to weigh in on whether it should hear the Harvard case. It has not yet.
SFFA said that the U.S. Supreme Court nearly two decades ago did something similar when it took up two affirmative action cases involving the University of Michigan and bypassed an appellate court with one of them.

The justices ultimately in 2003 preserved affirmative action on campuses in a ruling SFFA wants overturned.
Harvard argues Title VI of the Civil Rights Act forbids federal funding recipients from using race in admissions. The UNC case contends that, for public schools, the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment compels the same conclusion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. congressional committee probing the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol threatened former President Donald Trump's White House chief of staff on Thursday with a criminal contempt referral if he does not appear before the panel and hand over required documents by Friday morning.
If former chief of staff Mark Meadows does not produce the documents and appear for testimony at 10 a.m. EST (1500 GMT), the House of Representatives Select Committee will view his actions as willful non-compliance, the panel's Democratic chairman, Representative Bennie Thompson, said in a letter to Meadows' attorney.
The committee announced in September that it had subpoenaed https://www.reuters.com/world/us/congressional-probe-us-capitol-riot-subpoenas-bannon-meadows-2021-09-23 Meadows, citing reports the former House member had communicated with state and federal officials - including members of Congress - as part of an effort to overturn the Republican Trump's defeat in the 2020 presidential election by Democrat Joe Biden.
It said then it wanted Meadows to testify and hand over documents by mid-October. The two sides had been negotiating since.
Thompson said Meadows has not produced even a single document. ""Although you previously indicated that your firm was searching records that Mr. Meadows provided to you, more than enough time has passed for you to complete your review,"" the letter to Meadows' attorney George Terwilliger said.
Thompson said willful noncompliance with its subpoena could result in a referral from the House to the Department of Justice for criminal contempt charges, as well as the possibility of having a civil action to enforce the subpoena brought against Meadows.
The House voted last month https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-edges-toward-contempt-charges-against-trump-aide-bannon-2021-10-21 to hold Trump senior adviser Steve Bannon in contempt and refer his case to Justice.

Terwilliger did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He had issued a statement earlier on Thursday suggesting Meadows would not cooperate with the committee until all legal disputes were resolved.
Trump has filed suit https://www.reuters.com/world/us/judge-hear-trump-bid-stonewall-us-capitol-riot-investigation-2021-11-04 to avoid turning over White House documents and urged former aides to reject subpoenas.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo will travel to the Middle East on Friday, a Treasury spokesperson told Reuters, where he will seek to build partnerships on ransomware and cybersecurity as hackers wreak havoc among some of America's more vital industries.
Adeyemo, in the highest-ranking visit of a Treasury official to the region under President Joe Biden's administration, will also discuss countering terrorist financing and proliferation as well as economic recovery following the coronavirus pandemic in his visits to Israel, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.
In Israel, Adeyemo will raise how to focus technology to counter ransomware and other cyber-related threats, the spokesperson said.
It was unclear if he would raise Israeli spyware company NSO Group, which the U.S. Commerce Department added to its trade blacklist this month, saying they sold spyware to foreign governments that used the equipment to target government officials, journalists and others.
Biden has made the government's cybersecurity response a top priority following a series of attacks this year that threatened to destabilize U.S. energy and food supplies.
Hackers use ransomware to take down systems that control everything from hospital billing to manufacturing. They stop only after receiving hefty payments, typically in cryptocurrency.
This year, gangs have hit numerous U.S. companies in large scale hacks. One such attack on pipeline operator Colonial Pipeline led to temporary fuel supply shortages on the U.S. East Coast. Hackers also targeted an Iowa-based agricultural company, sparking fears of disruptions to grain harvesting in the Midwest.

The U.S. Treasury Department in a sanctions review last month warned that digital currencies and payment systems could reduce the efficacy of U.S. sanctions, allowing the transfer of funds outside the dollar-based financial system.
""The Deputy Secretary’s visit comes on the heels of a sanctions review that emphasized multilateral coordination on sanctions, as well as the threats posed by emerging technologies like virtual assets,"" the spokesperson said.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) -South Africa's last white president, Frederik Willem (FW) de Klerk, died on Thursday leaving a final apology via video for crimes against other ethnic groups during decades of apartheid. 
""I, without qualification, apologise for the pain and the hurt and the indignity and the damage that apartheid has done to Black, Brown and Indians in South Africa,"" said de Klerk, who had previously expressed regret several times for the 1948-91 policy. 
De Klerk died aged 85 after a battle with cancer. 
He won praise worldwide for his role in scrapping apartheid and shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela in 1993. The following year Mandela won South Africa's first multi-racial elections with his African National Congress (ANC).
""Allow me in this last message to share with you the fact that since the early 80s, my views changed completely. It was as if I had a conversion,"" de Klerk said in the video message released by his foundation hours after his death. 
""And in my heart of hearts, I realized that apartheid was wrong. I realized that we had arrived at a place which was morally unjustifiable,"" he said, adding that action was then taken to negotiate and restore justice. 
It was not immediately clear when the recording was made.
In the video, De Klerk also cautioned that South Africa faced many serious challenges, including what he called an undermining of the constitution. 
President Cyril Ramaphosa paid tribute to de Klerk's role in South Africa's transition to democracy.
""He took the courageous decision (as president) to unban political parties, release political prisoners and enter into negotiations with the liberation movement amid severe pressure to the contrary from many in his political constituency,"" he said.
Mandela's foundation said de Klerk would ""forever be linked to Nelson Mandela in the annals of South African history"".
However, de Klerk's role in the transition from minority white rule remains controversial.
COMPLEX LEGACY
Many Blacks were angered by his failure to curb political violence in the turbulent years leading up to the 1994 elections, while right-wing white Afrikaners, who had long ruled the country under de Klerk's National Party, viewed him as a traitor to their causes of white supremacy and nationalism.
His complex legacy was reflected in the reactions of South Africans.
""The time he was president and the actions he did take part (in) to become a president are bad, very bad, sinful. It was the mass genocide of Black people,"" said Sihle Jwara, a student in Johannesburg.
""But at the same time you have to look at the actions that he did take to change the country.""
De Klerk's foundation said he had died peacefully at his home in Cape Town on Thursday morning after a battle with mesothelioma, a cancer that affects the tissue lining the lungs.
His widow Elita and family will announce funeral arrangements in due course, it said.
The foundation of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a veteran of the struggle against white minority rule and seen by many as the nation's moral conscience, said de Klerk had ""occupied an historic but difficult space in South Africa"".
He had seen the necessity of change and ""demonstrated the will to act on it,"" it added.
John Steenhuisen, leader of the Democratic Alliance (DA), South Africa's second biggest party after the ANC, said de Klerk's success in bringing most white voters with him over the need to abolish apartheid helped ensure the transition was peaceful.
The DA is the main rival of the ANC but has struggled to shed its image as a party of white privilege.
Julius Malema, who heads the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), the country's third biggest political party, was much more critical, saying de Klerk should be referred to not as a ""former president"" but as a ""former apartheid president"".
Though long retired from active politics, de Klerk prompted anger among supporters of then President Jacob Zuma in 2016 when he accused them and their leader of seeking to advance their personal interests and of endangering democracy. 

De Klerk again drew criticism last year when he told a national broadcaster that he did not believe apartheid was a crime against humanity, as declared by the United Nations.
The backlash forced de Klerk to withdraw from a virtual seminar in the United States, where he had been due to speak on minority rights and racism.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. appeals court on Thursday put off allowing congressional investigators access to former President Donald Trump's White House records relating to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and scheduled a hearing on the matter for Nov. 30.
Trump's lawyers had asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to put Tuesday's lower court ruling on hold pending an appeal, which they said could be fast-tracked for a quick ruling.
The three judges on the appeals panel randomly assigned to the case were all appointed to the judiciary by either President Joe Biden or former President Barack Obama, both Democrats.
The National Archives, a federal agency that holds Trump's White House records, had been scheduled to give Congress hundreds of pages of documents on Friday.
U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan's decision on Tuesday allowed the U.S. House of Representatives committee investigating the attack to access telephone records, visitor logs and other White House documents that Trump wants blocked.
The committee has said it needs the requested materials to understand the role Trump may have played in fomenting the riot in which his supporters aimed to block lawmakers from certifying Biden's presidential win.
The Republican former president had argued that the materials requested by the committee were covered by a legal doctrine known as executive privilege https://www.reuters.com/world/us/can-trump-use-executive-privilege-block-jan-6-attack-probe-2021-09-09 that protects the confidentiality of some White House communications.

But Chutkan rejected that argument in a clear win for congressional oversight powers.
Four people died on Jan. 6, one shot dead by police and the other three of natural causes, and more than 100 police officers were injured in the attack. A Capitol Police officer who had been attacked by protesters died the next day, and four other police officers who defended the Capitol later died by suicide.

Biden and many members of his Cabinet crossed the Potomac River from Washington to attend the annual ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, where ceremonial cannon blasts greeted the president's arrival and sent plumes of smoke over the vast array of white gravestones.
After nodding his head in prayer at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Biden delivered remarks in the cemetery's Memorial Amphitheater.
""Our veterans represent the best of America. You are the very spine of America, not just the backbone. You're the spine of this country. And all of us - all of us - owe you,"" he said.

Biden said that thousands of U.S. veterans of the Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts brought home ""unseen psychological wounds of war"" and that he would make sure they get the help they need.
""Our administration is going to meet the sacred obligation that we owe you,"" Biden said. ""We're going to work with Congress, Republicans and Democrats together, to make sure our veterans receive the world-class benefits that they've earned.""

CAIRO (Reuters) - Sudan's army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan was sworn in on Thursday as head of a new transitional council he appointed to lead the country following the military takeover late last month, shrugging off domestic and international pressure to reverse the coup.
The new 14-member Sovereign Council, for which one member is yet to be confirmed, includes civilians representing Sudan's regions but none from the Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) political coalition that had been sharing power with the military in a democratic transition since 2019.
Burhan's deputy will remain Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, commander of the powerful paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), with both men keeping roles they held before the coup. 
The move is likely to harden opposition among civilian groups who have pledged to resist the takeover through a campaign of civil disobedience, strikes and mass rallies, the next of which is planned for Saturday.
Late on Thursday, protesters closed roads and burned tires in Burri, a neighbourhood in the east of the capital Khartoum, witnesses said. Unverified pictures posted on social media appeared to show similar protests in other parts of the capital.
Sudan's ousted Information Minister Hamza Balloul said the announcement was an extension of the coup and that he was confident the Sudanese people could defeat it. 
The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), a leading protest movement, said: ""Burhan and his council's decisions apply only to themselves, they have no legitimacy and will be met only with contempt and resistance."" 
The new council also includes representatives of rebel groups that reached a peace deal with the government last year but had rejected the takeover in a statement this week. 
The Oct. 25 takeover ended a power-sharing arrangement between the military and civilians set up after the overthrow of former president Omar al-Bashir in 2019 that was meant to lead to elections in late 2023.
Some senior civilians have been detained and Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok has been under house arrest.
The previous council had served as Sudan's collective head of state, alongside Hamdok's government which ran Sudan's day-to-day affairs. Burhan and Dagalo had been due to hand over its leadership to a civilian in the coming months.
Mediation aimed at securing the release of detainees and a return to power sharing has stalled since the coup as the military moved to consolidate control https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/sudans-military-rulers-draw-bashir-era-veterans-tighten-grip-2021-11-11. Political sources told Reuters on Thursday that there had been no progress in indirect contacts between Hamdok and the army.
Aboulgasim Mohamed Burtum, a newly appointed council member and former member of parliament, told Sky News he hoped the new government would be well-received. ""We are civilians, the civilians are not only Hamdok,"" he said.
Prior to Thursday's announcement, Burhan told Ugandan leader Yoweri Museveni that he was committed to dialogue with all political forces and the quick formation of a technocratic government, Burhan's office said. Burhan has denied carrying out a coup and promised elections in 2023.
MEDIC ARRESTED
Sudanese medic Mohamed Nagi Al-Assam, who was prominent in the uprising against Bashir and was a vocal critic of the coup, was arrested earlier on Thursday and taken to an unknown location, a doctors union said.
In a statement on Assam's arrest, the union said resistance would continue ""until the coup is brought down and its leaders are put on trial.""
Much of the international community has called on Burhan to reverse the takeover, with Western powers and the World Bank suspending economic assistance and saying a deal to forgive tens of billions of dollars of foreign debt is at risk.
The United Nations called Thursday's developments ""very concerning."" In a closed-door briefing to the U.N. Security Council, U.N. Sudan envoy Volker Perthes had been ""very frank in his assessment that the window now is closing for dialogue and for peaceful resolution,"" Britain's U.N. Ambassador Barbara  Woodward  (NASDAQ:WWD) told reporters.
The civil disobedience movement has been hampered by a blackout of mobile internet access across Sudan since Oct. 25.
A judge on Thursday issued a second instruction to telecoms firms Zain and MTN and local providers Sudatel and Canar to restore connections, pending the announcement of any damages to be paid to subscribers. 
In a statement to Reuters, Zain said the original order only applied to some accounts which the company reconnected immediately. It said it was working on Thursday's order to restore all lines. Other companies could not be reached or did not respond to requests for comment. 

Alongside Burhan and Dagalo, three other military members of the previous ruling council were retained in the new council, as well as one civilian representative jointly selected by the military and the FFC. 
Four new members representing Sudan's regions were appointed, though the representative for eastern Sudan was yet to be confirmed, state media reported.

TIJUANA, Mexico (Reuters) - In a makeshift camp holding hundreds of migrants near a Mexican border crossing to the United States, children sleep on the floor inside tents, with no protection from heat or cold. They do not attend school. Some were born in the United States.
Mexican authorities have warned of the dangerous conditions faced by children who are often taken by parents or relatives on the perilous journey across Mexico because people smugglers tell them having a minor makes it easier to enter the United States.
A recent census by the local government in the border city of Tijuana found that 40% of the 769 people staying at the camp at El Chaparral, a crossing which remains closed even after the border reopened to non-essential travel, were minors. 
Inside the camp, which is fenced in and controlled by police, Reuters spoke to over 20 migrant children, four of whom had documents showing they were born in the United States.
All the U.S.-born youngsters said they had left when their undocumented parents were deported - and traveled back through Mexico as the adults tried to return to the United Sates.
One of them, a girl called Evelyn, whose Mexican mother showed a birth certificate stating she was born in Los Angeles, said: ""I just want everything to be okay, for my mom to have a home. I want to go to the United States, but with my mom.""
""My sister and I have (U.S.) papers but when my dad had to come here, my mom brought all of us,"" said Evelyn, 10. ""She cries a lot because they don't have money to feed us.""
The U.S.-born children do not necessarily have to suffer the hardships of migrant life to try to enter the United States.
They automatically acquire citizenship at birth but all of the U.S.-born children or their parents in the camp that Reuters spoke to said they did not want to be separated from their families, and so they left the United States together and aim to return together.
As illegal immigration leapt in 2021, more than 39,000 undocumented foreign children had been registered by Mexico's Unit for Migration Policy, Registry and Identity of Persons through September, an increase of 377% from 2020.
Sitting on asphalt near the camp, Josue, a recently arrived 7-year-old Honduran boy, said his dream was to become a doctor in the United States because he did not like to see people die.
Recalling the hunger, cold and exhaustion he faced on the trek with his father, Josue recounted survival skills he had acquired en route, such as riding a Mexican freight train known as ""The Beast"", which migrants often jump on to travel north.
He also learned how to yell at police trying to detain him, and to be strong and not cry when he missed his mother.
""(In Honduras), they pointed a gun at my dad, they wanted to kill him, that's why we came,"" he said.
Under pressure from the United States to stem migration, Mexico has urged people not to attempt the journey, but recently announced humanitarian visas for children and pregnant women traveling from southern Mexico in a migrant caravan.
Full of families with young children, according to Reuters witnesses, the caravan halted at one point because dozens of women and children were too worn out to walk.
Pedro a 15-year-old migrant, also had a birth certificate showing he was born in Los Angeles, and said his four brothers were too. His mother brought them back to her native Mexico three months ago when his father was deported.
He now cleans cars in Tijuana using a small rag, earning whatever people are willing to give. ""I've never worked before, but I'm doing it to help my mom,"" he said.

Some small children seemed unaware of the hardship of the camp, running around laughing in donated superhero costumes.
""I'm Superman!"" yelled a young boy with a heat rash breaking out across his sun-scorched face.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) -The so-called Troika Plus group pledged on Thursday to try to ease severe pressure on Afghanistan's banking system as it warned of possible economic collapse and a humanitarian disaster that could fuel a new refugee crisis.
The group, made up of Pakistan, China, Russia and the United States, met in Islamabad against a backdrop of growing alarm over the situation in Afghanistan, where more than half the population is facing severe hunger over the coming winter.
""I urge the international community to fulfil its collective responsibility to avert a grave humanitarian crisis,"" Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), adding that Pakistan would provide aid including food, emergency medical supplies and winter shelters.
The Taliban victory in August saw the billions of dollars in foreign aid that had kept the economy afloat abruptly switched off, with more than $9 billion in central bank reserves frozen outside the country.
""Nobody wishes to see a relapse into civil war, no one wants an economic collapse that will spur instability,"" Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said.
""Everyone wants terrorist elements operating inside Afghanistan to be tackled effectively and we all want to prevent a new refugee crisis,"" he told the envoys, who also met the Taliban acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi.
Restrictions on the banking system put in place by international governments since the Taliban took over have deepened the pain for Afghans, prompting growing calls for the freeze on the reserves to be lifted.
The troika said it acknowledged concerns about the ""serious liquidity challenges and committed to continue focusing on measures to ease access to legitimate banking services.""
Pakistan has called on governments, including the United States, to allow development assistance to flow into Afghanistan to prevent collapse.
Pakistan has also discussed the idea of Afghanistan joining CPEC, its multi-billion dollar infrastructure project with China, which comes under the banner of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). 

Thursday's conference, which reiterated calls on the Taliban to ensure women's rights are respected and that Afghanistan does not become a base for militant groups to carry out attacks outside the country, is the latest in a series of diplomatic meetings in the region.
Muttaqi arrived in Islamabad on Wednesday to discuss trade and other ties, while neighbouring India held a conference for regional countries on Wednesday, though arch-rival Pakistan did not attend that meeting.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Sudan's military rulers have been drawing on veteran ex-officials of toppled leader Omar al-Bashir for key posts in the state bureaucracy, in what critics see as a sign that they are seeking to cement control after seizing power in a coup.
Lacking a political base of his own, military leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, a career army officer, is resorting to an alliance of convenience with figures he helped force from power when Bashir was overthrown in 2019, analysts say.
The moves suggest Burhan is seeking to consolidate the military's takeover, ignoring calls by much of the international community to return to the civilian-military power-sharing arrangement that was meant to lead to elections in 2023. 
Burhan's media adviser could not be reached for comment. A senior source still working in the government denied that those appointed recently were ""remnants"" of Bashir's rule, saying their nominations were made according to regular bureaucratic procedures. 
Nevertheless, publicly announced appointments of former senior Bashir-era officials since the coup include justice ministry undersecretary Huweda Al Kareem, foreign ministry undersecretary Ali Sadeq, and education ministry undersecretary Mahmoud Al Houri.
Sadeq told Reuters that he moved into his position due to seniority.
""I am not affiliated with any former regime. I am just doing my job as a civil servant,"" he told Reuters.
Kareem and Houri could not be reached for comment.
Officials have also been replaced in senior positions in state banks, media, and the regional government in Khartoum State and other states.
By giving jobs to former appointees of Bashir, an autocrat and military man associated by many Sudanese with years of isolation and U.S. sanctions, Burhan may only stiffen popular opposition to the takeover and narrow the space for compromise, critics say.
At the same time, public servants appointed under the civilian Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) coalition that was sharing power with the military before the coup are being dismissed or reassigned, government employees and political groups say. Many Sudanese saw the appointment of non-political technocrats as one of the few tangible gains of the transition.
ARRESTS
In a sign of brewing discord over the appointments, dozens of people were arrested at a sit-in to oppose handovers to military appointees at Khartoum State's education ministry building on Sunday, according to a teachers' union.
In a statement on Wednesday, Khartoum State health officials rejected their dismissals and the appointment of those they said had ""submitted to the military, betrayed their oath, and disavowed the revolution"". 
Another target of the coup was a taskforce set up to dismantle Bashir's rule by seizing assets and removing supporters from public jobs. Several of the taskforce's senior members have been arrested, and late on Tuesday Burhan announced a committee to review its work.
TV channels controlled by Gulf Arab states have meanwhile seen an influx of ""strategic analysts"" defending the coup, some known supporters of Bashir's dissolved National Congress Party. 
Civilian factions bent on reversing the coup are alarmed.
In a statement urging peaceful resistance to the takeover, the political bureau of Sudan's Umma Party said it rejected ""all decisions issued by the coup leader regarding the dismissal of civil service leaders not loyal to the coup and their replacement by cadres of the defeated National Congress"". 
The Sudanese Journalists Network accused the military of using NCP figures to purge public servants appointed by the transitional government after Bashir's ouster, and to crack down on trade union committees and leaders of a civil disobedience campaign against the coup.
The NCP, which was still issuing statements before the coup despite being dissolved, has made no public comment on the takeover.
PROTEST MOVEMENT
The coup halted a military-civilian power-sharing deal agreed in 2019 after the army toppled Bashir following months of street protests. Burhan led a joint ruling council but was meant to hand leadership to a civilian ahead of elections in 2023. 
After detaining top civilians and placing Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok under house arrest on Oct. 25, Burhan said he would name a government of technocrats, but has yet to do so. Efforts involving the United Nations to secure the release of politicians and a return to power sharing have stalled.
Burhan has used the time to place people loyal to the military and the state in jobs controlling vital infrastructure, banks, and trade, said Sudanese analyst Magdi El Gizouli. 
""He's doing what every government ruler does, sort out the bureaucracy and find people who are loyal,"" he said. ""He's creating a de facto situation ahead of the cabinet.""
Burhan has said he dissolved transitional bodies to prevent squabbling political factions critical of the military from destabilising the country. He says he is committed to democratic transition and that elections will still be held in 2023.
The protest movement that drove demonstrations against Bashir and mobilised again in the build up to the Oct. 25 coup is calling for the military to exit politics altogether. 
Though a blackout on internet services hampered a civil disobedience campaign on Sunday and Monday, hundreds of thousands have turned out for mass rallies against the military, with another ""march of millions"" planned for Nov. 13.
Burhan also faces an economic crisis that triggered the revolt against Bashir and continued after his overthrow. Aid that had begun to flow from the West to help Sudan's transition has been paused, and a resolution calling for sanctions against coup leaders has been tabled in the U.S. Congress. 

Any lasting alliance between Burhan and former regime factions may be complicated by their resentment over Burhan's role as a senior army leader in toppling Bashir in 2019.
Burhan is close to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia as well as to neighbour Egypt. But such regional powers, which have worked hard to roll back the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood, would object to a coalition between Burhan and Bashir's Islamist allies, a diplomatic source said.

616,"<span>Nov 11, 2021 06:11AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Kyle Rittenhouse, the 18-year-old charged with murdering two men and wounding another during racial justice protests in the Wisconsin city of Kenosha last year, took the witness stand at his trial on Wednesday in risky and dramatic testimony.
Rittenhouse, charged in the killing of Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and the wounding of Gaige Grosskreutz, 27, has pleaded not guilty and has said he acted in self-defense. 
Here are some key moments from the trial:
Nov. 10 - Rittenhouse testifies that Rosenbaum twice threatened to kill him and ambushed him before their final encounter. 
Rittenhouse broke down sobbing as he recalled the events immediately before he shot Rosenbaum, prompting the judge to call for a recess. After returning to the stand, Rittenhouse testified that Rosenbaum charged at him, telling the jury, ""I remember his hand on the barrel of my gun."" 
Rittenhouse told the prosecution during cross examination: ""I did what I had to do to stop the person who was attacking me."" He admitted using deadly force but said he did not intend to kill anyone.
Nov. 9 - Nicholas Smith, who was protecting a used car dealership, said he spoke to Rittenhouse after he shot three people, describing him as nervous, sweating and pale.
""He repeats: ‘I just shot someone,’ over and over,"" said Smith. 
Nov. 8 - Gaige Grosskreutz, 27, the only protester shot by Rittenhouse to survive, testified that he had pointed his Glock pistol in Rittenhouse's direction and only advanced on the teenager as a last resort because he thought he ""was going to die.""
Under cross-examination by the defense, Grosskreutz said Rittenhouse did not fire when his hands were up and only did so when he moved toward Rittenhouse with his pistol pointed at him. 
""It wasn't until you pointed your gun at him, advanced on him, with your gun, now your hands down pointed at him, that he fired, right?"" asked Corey Chirafisi, Rittenhouse's lawyer.
""Correct,"" Grosskreutz responded.
The prosecution rests.
Nov. 5 - Jason Lackowski, a former Marine, was with Rittenhouse on the night of the shootings. Prior to the shootings, Lackowski said Rosenbaum had taunted him and other armed men. Lackowski answered ""no"" when asked whether he considered the unarmed Rosenbaum a threat.
Nov. 4 - Richie McGinniss - chief video director of the Daily Caller, a conservative website - said Rosenbaum yelled as he advanced toward Rittenhouse in the parking lot of a used-car dealership and then lunged for the youth's semi-automatic rifle.
Ryan Balch, a military veteran who was among the armed men with Rittenhouse at the used car dealership, testified that Rosenbaum was acting in a ""violent"" manner that night, throwing rocks and trying to set fires.
Nov. 3 - Video was the star witness at the second day of the trial.
Jurors saw a series of graphic videos showing the chaotic moments after Rittenhouse shot three protesters, including one man who lay motionless and bleeding and another screaming as blood gushed from his arm.

The jury was also shown video of Rittenhouse fleeing the scene of the Rosenbaum shooting and being chased by a growing crowd of protesters, some of them yelling things like ""Get him"" before he has a series of violent encounters. 
Nov. 2 - Jurors hear opening arguments. Prosecutors portrayed Rittenhouse a vigilante killer, repeating seven times that the teenager was the only person to have shot anyone that night. The defense said Rittenhouse opened fire in self-defense and in response to attacks by a mob.

Before the killings, Kenosha had endured two nights of chaotic protests over the police shooting of a local Black man, Jacob Blake. Several businesses were burned to the ground and there were incidents of looting. Police used rubber bullets and tear gas to control the crowds. 
The following is based on court testimony, drone footage and videos from Aug. 25, 2020:
* During the day, Rittenhouse helps clean graffiti off a school. That same day Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, is released from a Milwaukee hospital where he had been admitted after a suicide attempt. 
* Around 10 p.m. video shows Rittenhouse with a rifle standing with other armed men near a used-car dealership. Rittenhouse testified he was asked to help guard the business due to the threat of looting and arson. He brought a medical kit and says his objective was to provide aid to anyone injured.
* Around 10:45 p.m., another video shows Rittenhouse asking police officers for water. One officer says: ""We appreciate you guys. We really do.""
* Around 11:45 p.m. Rosenbaum chases Rittenhouse into a used-car lot as Rittenhouse yells ""Friendly, friendly, friendly."" Rosenbaum throws a plastic bag containing toiletries at Rittenhouse.
* Rittenhouse testified that Rosenbaum grabbed his gun. A journalist for the Daily Caller, a conservative website, testified that Rosenbaum lunged for the rifle. Rittenhouse fires his gun at Rosenbaum, hitting him four times and killing him.
* Video shows Rittenhouse fleeing the scene of the Rosenbaum shooting and being chased by a growing crowd, some yelling ""Get him!""
* Just minutes later, after stumbling to the ground, Rittenhouse fatally shoots Anthony Huber, a 26-year-old who swung a skateboard at him. 
* After Huber was shot, Gaige Grosskreutz, now 27, stops moving toward Rittenhouse and put his hands in the air. He was holding a handgun. When Grosskreutz resumes advancing, Rittenhouse shoots him, severing most of his bicep. Rittenhouse testified that Grosskreutz had his pistol pointed at his head.

* Rittenhouse then walks toward the police with his hands up and the rifle slung across his body. Police order him to get out of the way and one officer pepper sprays Rittenhouse when he approaches the window of the patrol car. The police then drive off, believing the active shooter was elsewhere.
* Around 1:30 a.m. on Aug. 26, Rittenhouse, accompanied by his mother, turns himself into a police station in his hometown of Antioch, Illinois.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The ""stiff competition"" between the United States and China in the Indo-Pacific does not have to turn into a new Cold War, U.S. national security advisor Jake Sullivan said on Thursday, describing the United States as ""doubling down"" on its presence in the region.
Earlier on Thursday China's President Xi Jinping said the Asia Pacific region must not return to the tensions of the Cold War era, and warned against forming small circles on geopolitical grounds.
In a speech delivered via videolink to Australia's Lowy Institute, Sullivan said the United States had quit Afghanistan to put more emphasis on the Indo Pacific where it wanted to minimise the potential for conflict. 
Responding to questions, Sullivan sought to downplay fears about the risk of a new Cold War developing with China.
""All of this talk of the United States and China going into a new cold war and we are on our way to conflict... we have the choice not to do that,"" Sullivan said.
""We have the choice instead to move forward with what President Biden says is stiff competition, where we are going to compete vigorously across multiple dimensions, including economics and technology, where we are going to stand up for our values, but we also recognise China is going to be a factor in the international system for the forseeable future.""

A U.S. strategy to build a ""latticework of alliances"" globally led it to form the Aukus pact with Australia and Britain to share nuclear submarine technology; work with the Quad democracies of Australia, India and Japan to deliver COVID-19 vaccines to the region; and form a U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council to push back against China on emerging technology, he said.
While the Aukus deal showed the more intensive engagement in the Indo Pacific, this didn't mean the U.S. was turning its back on other regions of the world, particularly Europe, Sullivan said.

CHENNAI/COLOMBO (Reuters) -Heavy rains across southern India and Sri Lanka have killed at least 41 people, authorities said on Thursday, with weather forecasters expecting the downpours to ease in the next few days as stricken communities pumped out the deluge.
The Indian Meteorological Department forecast light to moderate rain in most affected areas, with occasional flooding of some roads and low-lying areas. 
Counterparts in neighbouring Sri Lanka said rain there was expected to ease from Thursday as the low pressure that brought the bad weather moved away.
""The worst is over and occasional rains will happen,"" said Pradeep John, an amateur forecaster who is widely followed in Tamil Nadu, India's worst-affected state. 
""Today rains will be on and off, with large breaks and nothing alarming."" 
The rains have killed 25 people in the island nation of Sri Lanka, most of whom drowned, while landslides injured five, officials said.
Sixteen people were killed in Tamil Nadu, state disaster management minister KKSSR Ramachandran told a news conference.
Many parts of the state capital Chennai, which is India's auto manufacturing centre, were waterlogged and government officials used pumps to drain some communities that had been stranded waist deep.
Thousands of people in low lying areas were moved to safety, officials said. 

Many schools and colleges in Tamil Nadu remained closed while some train services were still suspended. 
India's northeast monsoon usually runs from October to December, bringing heavy rain, particularly to the south.

Advertised as Scotland's other national drink, the first being whisky, Irn-Bru is 100 years old and is colloquially known as a hangover cure.
""I like it! Will bring some cans home to NY (New York) for sure!,"" the U.S. congresswoman wrote in an Instagram post on Wednesday, alongside a video of her trying the bright orange fizzy soda.
Ocasio-Cortez said earlier on the social media platform that she was trying to get her hands on the drink, in response to a question on whether she had tried any Irn-Bru during her visit to Glasgow for the climate summit.
""Where do I find it?? Do y'all have bodegas here??"" she added jokingly.
Sturgeon then joined in the fun by posting on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) a picture of herself handing Ocasio-Cortez a can of Irn-Bru.
Irn-Bru has 32 flavouring agents, its maker A.G. Barr PLC says on its website, and even has its own orange and blue tartan.
The tartan is a symbol of Scotland and its historical roots, with the country's various clans each having a separate pattern.

In the video, Ocasio-Cortez says the drink reminds her of Kola Champagne, another soda popular in Latin America.
""I was so shocked at having something in Glasgow that tasted like HOME,"" she wrote on the Instagram post. ""Count me in, I love it!""

WELLINGTON (Reuters) -The Asia-Pacific region must not return to the tensions of the Cold War era, Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Thursday, ahead of a virtual meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden expected as soon as next week. 
Xi, in a recorded video message to a CEO forum on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit hosted by New Zealand, said attempts to draw ideological lines or form small circles on geopolitical grounds were bound to fail.
""The Asia-Pacific region cannot and should not relapse into the confrontation and division of the Cold War era,"" Xi said.
Xi's remarks were an apparent reference to U.S. efforts with regional allies and partners including the Quad grouping with India, Japan and Australia, to blunt what they see as China's growing coercive economic and military influence. 
China's military said on Tuesday it conducted a combat readiness patrol in the direction of the Taiwan Strait, after its Defense Ministry condemned a visit by a U.S. congressional delegation to Taiwan, the democratically governed island claimed by Beijing. 
Combative U.S. diplomatic exchanges with China early in the Biden administration unnerved allies, and U.S. officials believe direct engagement with Xi is the best way to prevent the relationship between the world's two biggest economies from spiraling toward conflict.
A date has not been announced for the Xi-Biden meeting, but a person briefed on the matter said it was expected to be as soon as next week.
The week-long annual forum, culminating in a meeting of leaders from all 21 APEC economies on Friday, is being conducted entirely online by hosts New Zealand, a country with hardline pandemic control measures that has kept its borders closed to almost all travellers for 18 months.
Xi has only appeared by video, and has not left China in about 21 months as the country pursues a zero-tolerance policy towards COVID-19. The Chinese president is also participating this week in a meeting of the ruling Communist Party that is expected to further cement his authority https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-xinhua-lauds-xi-ahead-key-communist-party-meeting-2021-11-06. 
Xi said emerging from the shadow of the pandemic and achieving steady economic recovery was the most pressing task for the region, and that countries must close the COVID-19 immunisation gap.
""We should translate the consensus that vaccines are a global public good into concrete actions to ensure their fair and equitable distribution,"" Xi said.
APEC members pledged at a special meeting in June to expand sharing and manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines and lift trade barriers for medicines.
TRADE DEALS
Taiwan's bid to join a regional trade pact, the Comprehensive and Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), is expected raise tensions at the APEC leaders' meeting later in the week.
China, which has also applied to join CPTPP, opposes Taiwan's membership and has increased military activities near the island which Beijing claims. The United States pulled out of CPTPP under former President Donald Trump. 
A 15-nation regional trade pact backed by China, the Regional Comprehensive Partnership Agreement (RCEP), will also take effect from Jan. 1.
Xi said in the lead-up to RCEP implementation and CPTPP negotiations that China would ""shorten the negative list on foreign investment, promote all-round opening up of its agricultural and manufacturing sectors, expand the opening of the service sector and treat domestic and foreign businesses as equals in accordance with law.""
The United States has offered to host APEC in 2023 for the first time in over a decade as President Joe Biden turns resources and attention to the Asia-Pacific following the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan.
However, no consensus has yet been reached among APEC members on the offer.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Climate change has been a key item on the agenda at the summit, which is taking place in parallel with the United Nations' COP26 meeting in Glasgow.

Xi said China would achieve its carbon neutrality targets within the time frame it has set and its carbon reduction action would require massive investment.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in her opening address that APEC had taken steps to wean the region's industries off fossil-fuel subsidies.

622,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 10:07PM ET</span>",,,,,,"NAIROBI (Reuters) -Ethiopian authorities have rounded up high-profile Tigrayans - from a bank CEO to priests - as well as United Nations staff in a mass crackdown on suspected supporters of rebellious northern forces, according to people linked to the detainees.
Police denied targeting the Tigrayan ethnic group, saying those arrested were believed to have links to the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which has fought central government https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/addis-ababa-government-urges-residents-register-arms-media-2021-11-02 for a year. 
The war has killed thousands, forced more than two million people from their homes, sucked in troops from neighbouring Eritrea and left hundreds of thousands in famine. Fighting has spread into neighbouring Afar and Amhara regions, threatening the stability of Ethiopia and the wider Horn of Africa. 
Ethiopia declared a state of emergency https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/addis-ababa-government-urges-residents-register-arms-media-2021-11-02 last week as Tigrayan forces pushed south towards the capital Addis Ababa. That allows for indefinite detentions and requires citizens to carry ID cards that can indicate ethnic origin.
The United Nations said on Tuesday at least 16 Ethiopian staff and dependents were detained https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/un-says-least-nine-staff-dependents-detained-ethiopia-2021-11-09 but has not specified their ethnicity. On Wednesday, it said nine were still in custody. 
The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said the arrests of Tigrayans - the latest in repeated waves https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-conflict-tigrayans-idUSKBN2CO0VF documented by Reuters - were at least in the hundreds, including elderly people and mothers with children. 
The detentions were ""out of control"", one senior Ethiopian official told Reuters. He asked for anonymity for fear of retribution.
BANKERS AND PRIESTS
Government spokesperson Legesse Tulu did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Federal police spokesperson Jeylan Abdi said he was not authorized to comment on detentions, while Addis Ababa police spokesman Fasika Fante said last week those detained ""directly or indirectly"" backed the TPLF. 
The attorney general Gedion Timotheos did not respond to requests for comment but previously told Reuters that the judicial system contained checks and balances to ensure the innocent were freed. 
On Tuesday, police detained Daniel Tekeste, the Tigrayan CEO of Lion Bank along with five other staff, a bank employee told Reuters, adding they were released later that night. 
A branch manager at another private bank told Reuters a policeman visited his office in the capital on Tuesday and asked if any Tigrayans worked there. The manager said he told the officer he did not have that information, and he left.
Three high-level members of the former federally-appointed Tigray administration were detained last week but later released, one said, adding that many lower- and middle-ranking regional Tigrayan government officials were still detained.
Abraha Desta https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-conflict-idAFKBN2GS0FQ, a former cabinet-level member of the Tigrayan administration who had been a prominent critic of the TPLF, was arrested in October after publicly denouncing arrests of Tigrayans. 
A Tigrayan member of the ruling Prosperity Party was called to a meeting on Monday in the Kirkos district of the capital and then arrested, his friend told Reuters.
A list compiled by an imprisoned priest and passed to a family member said 37 priests and religious workers had been arrested from four churches in the capital. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
CAFE ROUND-UP
Tadele Gebremedhin, a Tigrayan lawyer handling the cases of detained journalists and senior TPLF officials, was arrested at his home on Nov. 4, said a colleague. He remains in prison. 
However, most of the arrests reported to Reuters were not high-profile citizens. A resident of Addis Ababa said three Tigrayan friends - a bartender and two real estate brokers - were arrested last week. 
Uniformed police and men in plainclothes arrested the bartender at Aarabon Cafe, the man said, while police arrested the brokers at night at their homes. 
A U.N. spokesperson said that as well as the 16 staff and dependents, 72 drivers contracted by the U.N.'s World Food Programme (WFP) were also arrested in Semera, the capital city of Afar region. 
""Those that have been detained are Ethiopians who violate the law,"" government spokesperson Legesse said of the U.N. staff on Tuesday. He did not return calls for comment on the drivers.
The government has previously accused aid groups of arming Tigrayan forces but never produced proof. 
This month, the Tigrayans joined up with another armed group, the Oromo Liberation Army. The two have threatened to either attack the capital or seize a transport corridor linking landlocked Ethiopia to the region's main seaport.
The war is rooted in a power struggle between Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and the TPLF, which dominated politics for three decades until he took office in 2018 and curbed its power. 

The United States urged an end to military options. 
""There is an opportunity, I hope, for everyone to pull back, to sit down, to get a halt to what's happening on the ground, and ultimately, to produce a ceasefire, to have access for humanitarian assistance and over time to negotiate a more durable political resolution,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken Blinken told reporters.

BIALYSTOK, Poland (Reuters) - Syrian migrant Youssef Atallah feared he would die in the forest on the Polish border after being left without food or water in freezing cold, unable to breathe through his nose after it was broken by what he said was an assault by a Belarusian soldier.
Now in the safety of a migrant centre in the eastern Polish city of Bialystok, Atallah said he was one of many migrants trapped on the frontier after being pushed back into Belarus by Polish guards, only to be blocked by Belarusian security forces who had previously helped them cross into Poland.
""We told them we want to go back to (Belarusian capital) Minsk, we don't want to continue this trip,"" he said. ""They told us there is no going back to Minsk for you. Just go to Poland.""
An Afghan migrant who declined to be named also told Reuters about his experience of being stuck between Belarus and Poland, unable to turn back with the only option being to try again to cross the border with the aid of Belarusian security services.
""The Belarusian soldiers themselves, they force and help migrants to get across the border,"" he said, adding that soldiers had told him this was an order from the state.
The Afghan, who fled his homeland after the Islamist militant Taliban swept to power in August, described how every night the Belarusian military would come and take a group of 30 or 40 migrants from camps and push them to the frontier.
""They have a look at the border and if there is nobody there they give them a bolt-cutter and force them to cut through (Poland's) razor-wire fence,"" he said.
Thaer Rezk, 29, a migrant from Homs in Syria, said Belarusian guards sometimes slashed holes in border fencing themselves to help helped migrant get into Poland or neighbouring Lithuania, and thereby into the European Union.
Despite his ordeal, the Afghan migrant was optimistic about his future having made it to EU soil.

""I feel safer right now. I am sure that I will built a good career here and my son will get a good education - his future will be safe.""
The EU, which has repeatedly sanctioned Belarus for human rights abuses, accuses Minsk of luring migrants from war-torn, deprived countries and sending them as ""pawns"" to cross into Poland to try to sow violent chaos on the bloc's eastern flank.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A former University of Southern California associate professor of dentistry was sentenced on Wednesday to six weeks in prison for filing a false tax return related to the sprawling U.S. college admissions fraud scheme.
Homayoun Zadeh, 60, had been charged by federal prosecutors in Boston with agreeing to pay $100,000 to help his daughter get into USC and falsely representing on a 2017 tax return that some of that money legitimately went to a charity.
Prosecutors said that charity was actually run by the scheme's mastermind, California college admissions consultant William ""Rick"" Singer, and the money was used for bribery to help Zadeh's daughter gain admission to USC as a fake lacrosse player.
""Why on earth would you do that for your daughter?"" U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton told Zadeh. ""It boggles the mind.""
Zadeh, who pleaded guilty in July, told the judge before being sentenced: ""I am deeply sorry.""
Zadeh is among the 57 people charged in the ""Operation Varsity Blues"" investigation, which ensnared business executives and celebrities and exposed inequalities in U.S. higher education.
Singer pleaded guilty in 2019 to facilitating cheating on college entrance exams and helping bribe coaches and athletic officials to secure the admission of children as phony athletes.
Forty-eight people in total have agreed to plead guilty, including actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman. Two parents were recently convicted at trial.
Prosecutors said Zadeh had paid $65,000 toward the $100,000 by the time he was charged in 2019. He deducted $40,000 from his federal income taxes, allowing him to inflate his tax refund.

Gorton had threatened to reject Zadeh's plea agreement, which called for the six weeks in prison plus a $20,000 fine, citing an apparent lack of acceptance of responsibility.
The judge relented after Zadeh's lawyer withdrew objections to a probation department report. Zadeh must also pay $8,400 in restitution to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.

KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) -U.S. teenager Kyle Rittenhouse testified in his murder trial on Wednesday that he fatally shot two men and wounded a third with an AR-15-style rifle during chaotic racial justice protests to protect himself after being attacked, at one point breaking down sobbing on the witness stand.
In dramatic and risky testimony in his own defense, Rittenhouse, 18, portrayed himself as wanting to help others by providing medical aid and extinguishing fires during the protests last year in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He said he used his gun only after being attacked and ambushed.
Prosecutors sought to paint Rittenhouse as a vigilante who carried an assault-style weapon into a volatile melee and wanted to use it, asking him about his ammunition and his playing violent video games. 
""I did what I had to do to stop the person who was attacking me,"" Rittenhouse said under questioning by Kenosha County Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger.
""By killing them?"" Binger asked.
""Two of them passed away but I stopped the threat from attacking me,"" replied Rittenhouse, whose testimony ended on Wednesday in the trial, which the judge said could be finished by Monday or Tuesday.
""By using deadly force?"" Binger asked.
""I used deadly force,"" Rittenhouse said. ""... I didn't know if it was going to kill them. But I used deadly force to stop the threat that was attacking me.""
Rittenhouse is charged in the killing of Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and the wounding of Gaige Grosskreutz, 27, during protests on Aug. 25, 2020. Rittenhouse, 17 at the time of the killings, has pleaded not guilty.
DIVISIVE FIGURE
Rittenhouse has emerged as a divisive figure, with politics coursing through the case. He is a hero to some conservatives who believe in unfettered gun rights and see the shootings as justified during the Kenosha chaos. Many on the left see Rittenhouse as a symbol of an American gun culture run amok.
By the night of the shootings, Kenosha had experienced two nights of tumultuous protests triggered by the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, who was left paralyzed from the waist down.
Several businesses were burned down and there was looting. Police used rubber bullets and tear gas to control crowds, which included men wearing military-style gear and carrying rifles who confronted the sometimes-violent demonstrators. 
Dressed in a navy blue suit and dark blue tie, Rittenhouse initially was composed on the witness stand until his attorney asked him to detail his encounter with Rosenbaum, who he shot four times. Video evidence showed Rosenbaum pursuing and throwing a plastic bag at Rittenhouse before the fatal encounter. Rittenhouse said Rosenbaum grabbed his gun.
""I didn't notice Mr. Rosenbaum until he came out from behind the car and ambushed me,"" Rittenhouse testified, before he started to breathe heavily and lose his composure, shedding tears and sobbing, prompting the judge to call for a break.
Some jurors watched with a look of sympathy as he cried. Rittenhouse's mother sobbed in the courtroom watching her son.
Earlier in the night, Rittenhouse said Rosenbaum had threatened twice to kill him, first by saying that he would kill the teen if he caught him alone and then telling a group he was with ""I'm going to cut your fucking hearts out."" The slain man's fiance testified that Rosenbaum had bipolar disorder. 
Rittenhouse faces a misdemeanor charge of underage possession of his weapon along with five felony counts.
'DON'T GET BRAZEN'
The defense made a motion for a mistrial after Binger asked Rittenhouse about his decision to remain silent until now, as is his right, and about a video recorded two weeks before the shootings in which the teen talked about shooting men he thought were shoplifting at a pharmacy. 
Kenosha County Judge Bruce Schroeder had already ruled the video inadmissible. He erupted at Binger after the jury left the courtroom and said he would consider the mistrial motion.
""When you say you were acting in good faith, I don't believe you,"" the judge said to Binger.
The prosecution pressed Rittenhouse about why he took it upon himself to carry a gun and offer assistance normally provided by local authorities in a hazardous situation.
The teen, who had taken some first aid courses, brought a medical kit and testified to helping people with minor injuries. He said he was there to help guard a used car dealership. 
""I brought the gun for my protection,"" Rittenhouse testified. ""I didn't want to have to kill anybody that night.""
Rittenhouse said when he shot Rosenbaum he had his earlier threats in his mind and was also rattled by a gunshot fired nearby by another man, Joshua Ziminski. Rosenbaum had also wrapped his red shirt around his head, obstructing his face.
Binger repeatedly asked Rittenhouse about whether he understood the power of his rifle and that Rosenbaum and the others could have similarly viewed him as a threat. While acknowledging Rosenbaum was unarmed, he responded that he had no choice. 

""I pointed at him because he kept running at me and I didn't want him to chase me,"" Rittenhouse said. ""I continued to shoot until he was no longer a threat to me.""
Rittenhouse said he shot Huber, who had swung a skateboard at him, because he pulled at his rifle, and fired at Grosskreutz, who was armed with a handgun, because he had pointed the pistol ""directly"" at the teen's head.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Alex Saab, a Colombian businessman close to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro extradited to Miami last month on money laundering charges, met with U.S. law enforcement years ago to provide information on Maduro's government, according to records in the U.S. court case of an alleged ex-associate. 
Bruce Bagley https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-corruption/u-s-charges-miami-professor-in-venezuela-money-laundering-scheme-idUSKBN1XS2G4, a former University of Miami professor who studied drug trafficking in Latin America, was arrested in November 2019 on charges he received $2.5 million in deposits from overseas accounts that were controlled by Saab, and that he retained a commission. He pleaded guilty last year. 
In a document submitted to a Manhattan federal court late on Tuesday in an effort to seek a lenient sentence, Bagley's attorneys said an intermediary - whose name was redacted in the filing - told Bagley the money he received was to pay lawyers who were assisting Saab with his cooperation.
""The purpose of the additional money was to pay Saab's lawyers in the United States who were counseling Saab and accompanying him to meetings with the United States government, during which meetings Saab provided information on the Maduro government,"" his attorneys wrote.
The meetings had begun by 2017, according to the filing.
Saab was detained in Cape Verde last year on a U.S. warrant and was extradited in October. His case, which pits Washington against Maduro's socialist government, has drawn attention because Saab has emerged in recent years as a key broker in helping Caracas bypass U.S. sanctions to import goods.
David Rivkin, an attorney for Saab, said in a statement that Bagley had never worked for his client. 
""Any claims [Saab] has cooperated with the U.S. authorities against the interests of Venezuela are totally false,"" Rivkin said. ""At all times, Alex Saab has been a loyal citizen of Venezuela and has conducted all of his activities with the full knowledge and blessing of the government of Venezuela."" 
Venezuela's information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Another Saab attorney, Henry Bell, had previously said Saab will plead not guilty https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-envoy-saab-plead-not-guilty-money-laundering-lawyer-2021-10-28 to the U.S. charges.
Bagley's assertion that Saab previously met with law enforcement could spur hopes among Venezuela's opposition that he will cooperate with U.S. prosecutors, who have accused Maduro and other Venezuelan officials of drug trafficking.
Bagley's lawyers wrote that the unnamed intermediary between the two men ""told Dr. Bagley that federal law enforcement authorities wanted Alex Saab to provide intelligence with regard to the Venezuelan government, and the meetings had already begun.""
The statement came in a request filed late on Tuesday by attorneys for Bagley, 75, requesting he be sentenced to time served due to his age and ill health. That document was deleted on Wednesday due to instructions by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, and a new version with the references to Saab's meetings with U.S. officials redacted was later filed. 
A representative for Rakoff declined to comment on why the document was deleted. 

Saab may have met with U.S. authorities to avoid criminal charges or explore the possibility of cooperation in exchange for leniency, said Barbara Llanes, a former federal prosecutor and partner at the Gelber Schachter & Greenberg law firm in Miami.
Erick Cruz, a Miami defense attorney, said Saab's statements in any prior meetings with law enforcement would likely not be admissible in his own potential trial.

BRUNSWICK, Ga. (Reuters) -One of the three white men on trial for the killing of Ahmaud Arbery told police that as they chased the Black man around their southern Georgia neighborhood Arbery realized ""he was not going to get away,"" a jury heard on Wednesday.
""He was trapped like a rat,"" Gregory McMichael, 65, told a Glynn County detective a few hours after the deadly pursuit of Arbery, according to an interview transcript read aloud in the county Superior Court.
McMichael, his son Travis McMichael, 35, and their neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52, have pleaded not guilty to murder and other charges.
They say they thought Arbery might have been fleeing a crime when he ran through Satilla Shores, a suburb of the small coastal city of Brunswick (NYSE:BC), on Feb. 23, 2020. Prosecutors say Arbery was an avid runner out for a Sunday afternoon jog.
They pursued Arbery in pickup trucks before the younger McMichael pointed a shotgun and fired as Arbery ran toward him and reached at the weapon. Their lawyers say this was justified self defense. 
""I think he was wanting to flee and he realized that, you know, he was not going to get away,"" the elder McMichael said in the interview with Roderic Nohilly, the county detective. 
Nohilly told the jury he had known McMichael for years: the defendant had previously worked at the local prosecutor's office and would drop off paperwork at the police station.
McMichael said he ""had never laid eyes"" on Arbery before he ran past his driveway, according to the interview transcript.
Nohilly asked McMichael the reason for the chase: ""Did this guy break into a house today?""
""Well that's just it, I don't know,"" McMichael replied.
Prosecutors from the Cobb County district attorney's office are seeking to undermine the defense that the three men were trying to make a citizen's arrest under a state law that was subsequently repealed.
They have drawn jurors' attention to the sometimes sympathetic treatment the McMichaels and Bryan received from the officers and detectives on the scene, most of whom are also white.
On the day of the shooting, Matthew Albenze, a Satilla Shores resident, was in his yard when he noticed Arbery standing outside a nearby house that was under construction.
Albenze told the jury he grabbed his cellphone, put his handgun in his pocket and called the non-emergency number for the county police after seeing Arbery go inside the construction site.
""I did not see an emergency,"" Albenze said when asked by prosecutor Linda Dunikoski why he did not dial 911.
He told the police operator he could see a suspicious Black man in a white T-shirt.
""I just need to know what he was doing wrong,"" the operator asked, according to a recording played in court.

""He's been caught on camera a bunch before, it's kind of an ongoing thing out here,"" Albenze told the operator, saying Arbery was now running off the property.
The operator said police would head over, and Albenze went back home. A few minutes later, Albenze heard gunfire: three shots.

MOSCOW/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union accused Belarus on Wednesday of mounting a ""hybrid attack"" by pushing migrants across the border into Poland, paving the way for widened sanctions against Minsk in a crisis that threatens to draw in Russia and NATO.
Russia took the rare step of dispatching two nuclear-capable strategic bombers to patrol Belarusian airspace in a show of support for its close ally. Poland briefed fellow NATO allies at a closed-door meeting and they pledged their support, an alliance official said.
Migrants from the Middle East, Afghanistan and Africa trapped in Belarus made multiple attempts to force their way into Poland overnight, Warsaw said, announcing that it had reinforced the border with extra guards.
U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet called on states to reduce tensions and resolve the ""intolerable"" crisis.
""These hundreds of men, women and children must not be forced to spend another night in freezing weather without adequate shelter, food, water and medical care,"" she said.
The EU, which has repeatedly sanctioned Belarus for human rights abuses, accuses Minsk of luring migrants from war-torn and impoverished countries and then pushing them to cross into Poland to try to sow violent chaos on the bloc's eastern flank.
""We are facing a brutal hybrid attack on our EU borders. Belarus is weapon migrants' distress in a cynical and shocking way,"" EU Council President Charles Michel said.
The bloc's 27 ambassadors agreed this constituted a legal basis for further sanctions, which could come as early as next week and target some 30 individuals and entities including the Belarusian foreign minister and the national airline.
""Very rapidly at the beginning of next week there will be a widening of the sanctions against Belarus,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters after a meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington.
""We will look into the possibility of sanctioning those airlines who facilitate human trafficking towards Minsk and then the EU-Belarus border,"" she added.
Biden and von der Leyen addressed the humanitarian situation on the European Union's border with Belarus and expressed ""deep concern about the irregular migration flows"", the White House said. Separately, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said: ""The idea that Belarus would weaponize migration is also profoundly objectionable.""
He said Washington will keep pressure on Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko ""as long as the regime is refusing to respect its international obligations, or commitments, as long as it's undermining peace and security in Europe through its actions and as long as it continues to repress and abuse people...""
Lukashenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin have pinned the blame on the EU.
The Kremlin accused Europe of failing to live up to its own humanitarian ideals and trying to ""strangle"" Belarus with plans to close part of the frontier. Moscow said it was unacceptable for the EU to impose sanctions on Belarus over the crisis.
PRESSURE POINT
The crisis strikes the EU in a vulnerable area.
In 2015, the bloc was deeply shaken by an influx of over a million people fleeing conflict in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan that led to deep rifts between member states, strained social security systems and fanned support for far-right parties.
The EU appears more united this time but there are signs of internal friction: some in Brussels have warned Poland that it should not use EU funds to erect border walls and razor wire while others argue the bloc needs to help defend its borders. Michel said on Wednesday the EU needed to make up its mind.
Compared with 2015, the current crisis has an added geopolitical dimension as it is unfolding on the dividing line between NATO to the west and Russia-allied Belarus to the east.
The Tupolev Tu-22M3 bombers that Russia sent to overfly Belarus are capable of carrying nuclear missiles, including hypersonic ones of the kind designed to evade sophisticated Western air defences.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he hoped responsible Europeans would ""not allow themselves to be drawn into a spiral that is fairly dangerous"".
German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters she urged Putin in a phone call to use his influence on Lukashenko ""because people (migrants) are being used, they have become, so to speak, victims of an inhumane policy - and something has to be done about it"". 
The Kremlin said Putin told Merkel that the EU should talk directly to Belarus.
STRANDED FAMILIES
Thousands of people have converged on the border this week, where makeshift razor wire fences and Polish soldiers have repeatedly blocked their entry. Some of the migrants have used logs, spades and other implements to try to break through.
""It was not a calm night. Indeed, there were many attempts to breach the Polish border,"" Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak told broadcaster PR1.
Video from the border obtained by Reuters showed young children and babies among the people stuck there.
""There are lots of families here with babies between two and four months old. They have not eaten anything for the past three days,"" the person who provided the video told Reuters, saying they were a migrant themselves and declining to be identified.
Some migrants have complained of being repeatedly pushed back and forth by Polish and Belarusian border guards, putting them at risk of hypothermia, lack of food and water.
Syrian migrant Youssef Atallah said he feared he would die in the forest at the border after being stranded for days, unable to breathe through his nose after it was broken in what he said was an assault by a Belarusian soldier.

Atallah, who finally reached safety in a migrant centre inside Poland on Wednesday, described almost giving up after being blocked in both directions at the border.
""We told (Belarusian guards) we want to go back to Minsk, we don't want to continue this trip,"" he told Reuters. ""They told us there is no going back to Minsk for you. Just go to Poland.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A former mixed martial artist filmed punching a police officer during the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol received a 41-month prison sentence on Wednesday, the stiffest punishment yet in the almost 700 criminal cases stemming from the siege.
U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth cited the seriousness of New Jersey gym owner Scott Fairlamb's conduct when he sentenced him. Fairlamb was captured screaming at officers by their body-worn cameras before shoving one and then punching him in the face and pleaded guilty in August.
""Had you gone to trial, I don't think there's any jury that could have acquitted you,"" the judge told Fairlamb.
Fairlamb was the first rioter sentenced for violence against police during the attack. Lamberth noted that his sentence will be a benchmark for the more than 120 defendants charged with attacking police during the Capitol assault by thousands of Donald Trump supporters trying to overturn his election defeat.
A Capitol Police officer who had been attacked by protesters died the day after the riot and four police officers who took part in the defense of the Capitol later took their own lives. About 140 police officers were injured.
Fairlamb's lawyer had asked Lamberth to ""take into consideration the approximate 11 months his client has already served in custody"" and not add additional time.
An emotional Fairlamb addressed the judge during the hearing, saying he brought shame upon his family's name.
""I have nothing but remorse,"" Fairlamb said, later adding: ""I just hope you show some mercy on me, sir.""
Federal prosecutors had recommended a 44-month sentence.
Justice Department lawyer Leslie Goemaat highlighted Fairlamb's martial arts training during Wednesday's hearing, as well as earlier run-ins with the law.
""He was trained to throw a punch and was well aware of the injury he could cause,"" Goemaat said.
Goemaat also mentioned a video Fairlamb recorded during the riots in which he said: “What Patriots do? We fuckin’ disarm them and then we storm the fuckin’ Capitol!”
""The defendant's own statements on that day suggest that he came prepared for violence,"" Goemaat said.
'QANON SHAMAN' SENTENCING NEXT WEEK
Most of the guilty pleas in Jan. 6 prosecutions have been in cases involving non-violent misdemeanors, but government lawyers are now seeking prison sentences for some defendants facing more serious felony charges.
Prosecutors in a late-night court filing recommended a four-year, three-month sentence for Jacob Chansley, the participant in the Jan. 6 riots nicknamed the ""QAnon Shaman.""
Lamberth, who is also handling Chansley's case, will sentence him on Nov. 17. 
Chansley’s attorney, Albert Watkins, said in a Tuesday court filing that Chansley should be released ""as soon as possible,"" noting that he will have spent more than 10 months in pretrial detention.
""I can say with confidence that Mr. Chansley is in dire need of mental health treatment,"" Watkins said in the filing, adding that further time behind bars ""jeopardizes his mental stability."" 

Some 210 people have been charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding police officers or employees during the attack, the Justice Department said. Four people have pleaded guilty to assaulting law enforcement.
The assault on the Capitol followed a fiery speech in which Trump repeated his false claims that his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud. Multiple courts, state election officials and members of Trump's own administration have rejected those claims as unfounded.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ghislaine Maxwell on Wednesday lost her bid to exclude a psychologist who has studied the ""grooming"" of sexual crimes victims from testifying at her upcoming trial. 
Prosecutors have said they may call Lisa Rocchio, a psychologist who specializes in treating patients who have suffered sexual abuse, as a witness at the trial.
Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to charges that she groomed underage girls for the late financier Jeffrey Epstein to abuse.
Jury selection in the case is under way and opening arguments are expected to kick off on Nov. 29 in Manhattan federal court.
One of Maxwell's attorneys, Jeffrey Pagliuca, said on Wednesday the defense intends to question the credibility of witnesses based on any prior histories of substance abuse or failures to disclose their accusations against Maxwell promptly.
During a hearing on Wednesday, Rocchio said adolescents were particularly likely to disclose sexual abuse later in life. She said false allegations of sexual abuse can occur, but that they represent a ""very small minority"" of accusations. 
Lawyers for the British socialite had said Rocchio's opinions are inadmissible, arguing they were based mainly on her personal experience as a practitioner and lacked scientific backing.
They said they plan to call their own experts https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ghislaine-maxwell-challenge-claims-she-groomed-underage-girls-epstein-2021-11-08 who would argue that the suggestion Maxwell committed ""grooming by proxy"" - by winning the alleged victims' trust in order to manipulate them into having encounters with Epstein - had no support in the scientific community.

Following questioning, U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan said she would largely allow Rocchio's testimony, in a blow to Maxwell's defense.
Epstein, who counted former President Bill Clinton and Britain's Prince Andrew among his associates, died by suicide in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 at the age of 66 while awaiting his own trial on sex crimes charges.

631,"<span>Nov 10, 2021 04:18PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping is set to deliver the first resolution on Communist Party history in 40 years, giving him the mandate to potentially rule for life as a major summit wraps in Beijing.
The landmark document that could change the course of China is expected to be announced in a communique Thursday, as the party wraps up a four-day meeting. Only Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping have authored a so-called historical resolution, and both used their works to dominate party politics until they died.
The party’s powerful Central Committee has been huddled at a military hotel in Beijing since Monday, for the final major gathering before a leadership congress late next year, where Xi will seek a precedent-defying third term.
Getting that group of 400 mostly male political elites, including state leaders, military chiefs, provincial bosses and top academics, to endorse his vision of the party’s past and future will send a strong signal that Xi has the power base to remain in office.
This week’s event -- the current Central Committee’s sixth full session, or “plenum” -- is one of seven major summits in China’s five-year political cycle and regarded as the most important. It represents the last chance for horse-trading before the 2022 leadership congress.
Mao’s doctrine, published in 1945, focused on dismissing political enemies and establishing that only he had the “correct political line” to lead the party, four years before the People’s Republic was founded. Deng’s document weaved a more complicated narrative that condemned the chaos of Mao’s Cultural Revolution without totally discrediting him, and helped clear his own path to power.
“In both cases, the winners, Mao and Deng Xiaoping, used the Central Committee meetings and resolutions to underline the defeat of political opponents and their own pre-eminent power,” former diplomat Charles Parton, a James Cook associate fellow in Indo-Pacific geopolitics, wrote this month in a report for the Council on Geostrategy. 
Xi has few political challengers to dismiss. A vast anti-corruption campaign has peeled off rivals over the past decade, meaning no one in the Standing Committee, the country’s top decision making body, has the age or experience to be a successor. 
Instead, his text will celebrate a century of party history, according to previews in state media, including party tabloid the Global Times, which said this week the resolution would ask two questions: “Why were we successful in the past? How can we continue to succeed in the future?” The answer to the latter is likely to be Xi’s continuing rein. 
Yu Jie, senior research fellow on China at Chatham House, said the resolution would justify an even stronger centralization of power around the party. “It also marks a real New Era of China under him, which is economically more affluent with stronger confidence to play a larger international role,” she said. 
All that could have global ramifications. Whereas China was a largely sealed-off country with a tiny global financial impact when Mao and Deng dropped their documents, today Xi leads the world’s second-largest economy, one-fifth of its people and one of its most powerful militaries.
With a historical resolution under his belt, China’s most-powerful man will be emboldened to push his “common prosperity” campaign to close the wealth gap and cut dependence on the U.S. 
Beijing and Washington are already clashing on everything from tech to trade and the fate of Taiwan, which China considers a breakaway province and has vowed to take by force, if necessary. While the prospect of a war remains remote, the democratically governed island has become the biggest potential flash point between the two sides.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The city of Washington has reached an agreement with the U.S Marshals Service to improve its jail facility, after a surprise federal inspection last month uncovered substandard conditions, Mayor Muriel Bowser said on Wednesday.
“We all agree: everyone who is in our jail or under our supervised care should be treated humanely and have safe conditions,” Bowser said in a statement. 
The accord comes after the inspection's findings led the U.S. Marshals Service, part of the Justice Department, to remove 400 federal inmates https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-marshals-remove-400-detainees-dc-jail-due-poor-conditions-2021-11-02 from one of the D.C. Department of Corrections facilities and relocate them to a federal prison in Pennsylvania.
The D.C. jail has come under scrutiny in recent months, with attorneys for some of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot defendants complaining about poor conditions, lack of access to medical care and challenges with their clients being able to review evidence and assist in their own defense.
In one case, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-judge-says-dc-jail-violated-civil-rights-jan-6-defendant-2021-10-13 held top Department of Correction officials in contempt for impeding access to medical care for one defendant.
He also referred the matter to the Justice Department for a civil rights inquiry.
The inspection, which took place in the week of Oct. 18, looked at two D.C. facilities - a treatment facility and the Central Detention Facility.

It did not uncover problems in the facility where Jan. 6 defendants are housed but did uncover problems with the Central Detention Facility.
Under the memorandum of understanding between the city and the Justice Department announced on Wednesday, they agreed to work together to assess the conditions and remediate them.

SUPRASL, Poland (Reuters) -Migrants trapped in Belarus made multiple attempts to force their way into Poland overnight, Warsaw said on Wednesday, announcing that it had reinforced the border as the European Union prepares to impose sanctions on Belarus over the crisis.
The bloc's 27 ambassadors are set to agree on Wednesday that the growing numbers of migrants flying to Belarus to reach the EU border amount to ""hybrid warfare"" by President Alexander Lukashenko - a legal basis for new sanctions.
""Mr. Lukashenko ...unscrupulously exploits people seeking refuge as hostages for his cynical power play,"" Germany's acting Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
He described images from the Belarusian border, where people are stuck in freezing conditions with little food and shelter, as ""horrific"" but said the EU could not be blackmailed.
The EU accuses Belarus of encouraging the migrants - from the Middle East, Afghanistan and Africa - to try to illegally cross the frontier in revenge for earlier sanctions imposed on Minsk over human rights abuses.
Lukashenko has denied using the migrants as weapons and on Wednesday won a fresh show of support from his most powerful ally, Russia, which blamed the EU for the crisis and sent two strategic bombers to patrol Belarusian airspace.
""It is apparent that a humanitarian catastrophe is looming against the background of Europeans' reluctance to demonstrate commitment to their European values,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a briefing.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging Moscow to put pressure on Belarus over the situation at the border, a German government spokesperson said. Putin's office said he suggested to Merkel that EU members discuss the crisis directly with Minsk. 
Thousands of people have converged on the border this week, where razor wire fences and Polish soldiers have repeatedly blocked their entry. Some of the migrants have used logs, spades and other implements to try to break through.
""It was not a calm night. Indeed, there were many attempts to breach the Polish border,"" Polish Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak told broadcaster PR1.
Video from the border obtained by Reuters showed young children and babies among the people stuck there.
""There are lots of families here with babies between two or four months old. They have not eaten anything for the past three days,"" the person who provided the video told Reuters, saying they were a migrant themselves and declining to be named.
REINFORCEMENTS
The Polish border guards service reported 599 illegal border crossing attempts on Tuesday, with 9 people detained and 48 sent back. Blaszczak said the force of Polish soldiers stationed at the border had been strengthened to 15,000 from 12,000.
After midnight, two groups of migrants were turned back. One that was around 200 people near the town of Bialowieza and another of around two dozen was turned back near Dubicze Cerkiewne, a spokeswoman told Reuters. 
Neighbouring EU state Lithuania, which followed in Poland's footsteps by imposing a state of emergency at its border on Tuesday, reported 281 migrants were turned back that day, the highest figure since August when such pushbacks began.
The EU accuses Lukashenko of using ""gangster-style"" tactics in the months-long border standoff, in which at least seven migrants have died. The new EU sanctions would target around 30 individuals and entities including the Belarusian foreign minister, three EU diplomats told Reuters.
Lukashenko's government blames Europe and the United States for the plight of the people stranded at the border. 
The crisis erupted after the EU, United States and Britain imposed sanctions on Belarus over its violent crackdown on mass street protests that were sparked by Lukashenko's disputed election victory in 2020. 
Lukashenko turned to traditional ally Russia for support and financing to ride out the protests. The migrant crisis has given Moscow an opportunity to double down on its support for Belarus, a country it regards a strategic buffer against NATO, and criticise the EU. 
Peskov accused the EU of trying to ""strangle"" Belarus. 
Poland denies accusations by humanitarian groups that it is violating the international right to asylum by hustling migrants back into Belarus instead of accepting their applications for protection. Warsaw says its actions are legal.
Some migrants have complained of being repeatedly pushed back and forth by Polish and Belarusian border guards, putting them at risk of exposure, lack of food and water. 

""Yesterday we helped to secure and evacuate one group of immigrants,"" said Michal Swiatkowski, 30, a member of the Polish Red Cross rescue group from Ostrowiec Swietokrzyski.
""There were 16 people, most of them were children. They did not require medical attention, although we donated warm clothes, blankets and some food,"" he told Reuters.

PARIS (Reuters) - Former French president Francois Hollande on Wednesday told a court there had been intelligence failures ahead of an Islamic State attack against Paris in 2015, and took a swipe at Belgium for hindering efforts to shut their shared border. 
Hollande was watching a France-Germany soccer match at the Stade de France on the evening of Nov. 13, 2015, when the first blast outside the stadium detonated. The militants went on to attack bars, restaurants and a concert hall, killing 130 people.
Even before the assault was over, with the death toll rising and the horror of the violence sinking in, Hollande declared a state of emergency and ordered the frontiers closed. Hours later, Salah Abdeslam, today the sole surviving attacker, fled to Belgium.
""It wasn't France's fault, but that of another country,"" Hollande told the court of Abdeslam's escape from France.
Abdeslam proclaimed himself to be an Islamic State ""soldier"" on the first day of his trial. He has previously told investigators he planned to blow himself up but backed out. 
French police on Nov. 14 stopped the car carrying Abdeslam and asked the Belgian police if they had him on a watchlist, but did not get an answer and let him go. He was only arrested in a raid by armed police in the Molenbeek area of Brussels four months later. 
The Belgian interior ministry was not immediately available for comment. The Belgian government has accepted some blame in the past, with the interior and justice ministers offering to resign in 2016 in response to security lapses linked to the 2015 Paris attack and another in Brussels in March 2016. 
HIGH ALERT 
At the time of the Paris attack, France had been on high alert following militant attacks on the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine and a kosher supermarket in the capital in January of the same year.
Several of the 10 attackers slipped into Europe from Islamic State strongholds in Syria, using fake passports and mixing with migrants fleeing war and poverty. 
Hollande told the court there had been gaps in the French intelligence.
""There is clearly a failure when an attack takes place,"" he said.
Abdeslam previously told the court the attack had been to avenge French military action in Syria, ordered by Hollande. 
The court has heard recordings from inside the Bataclan concert hall - where 90 of the victims were killed - during which the jihadists can be heard citing Hollande's name.

Hollande said the attackers' objective had been to divide France and compel him to cease France's military interventions in Iraq and Syria.
""My goal was to safeguard national unity,"" Hollande added.

The meeting, which will be the first summit held by the three countries in five years, will address issues including the COVID-19 pandemic and boosting the competitiveness of supply chains in North America, foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard said.
Mexico will also be focusing on economic development in southern Mexico and Central America, Ebrard told a regular government news conference alongside Lopez Obrador.
Mexico's announcement confirmed a report by Reuters on Tuesday that the meeting was planned for Nov. 18.
It also came a day after the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Ken Salazar, said that he hoped concerns could be resolved which the United States and private companies have expressed over a Mexican legislative initiative to reform the electricity market.
The bill still in Congress championed by Lopez Obrador seeks to give precedence to Mexico's state-owned energy companies over private firms, and the leftist president was asked at the news conference if he would address the matter in Washington.
Lopez Obrador said it was not on the agenda, but that if it did come up, he would explain to Biden that Mexico was taking steps to ensure consumers were not subjected to price hikes.
The president argues that past Mexican governments rigged the electricity market in favor of private capital at the expense of consumers and the Mexican state.
Aside from taking part in the leaders' three-way meeting, Lopez Obrador would also hold bilateral talks with Biden and Trudeau in Washington, Ebrard said.
Mexico was scheduled to host the following summit of the North American leaders in 2023, he added.

The leaders started holding what is informally known as the Three Amigos summit in 2005 and met most years until 2016. The practice ended when U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January 2017.
The countries are bound together by the United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) free trade agreement that governs some $1.5 trillion in North American trade annually.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Tibet's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama criticised the leaders of China on Wednesday saying they ""don't understand the variety of different cultures"" there and there is too much control by the main Han ethnic group.
But he also said he had nothing against ""Chinese brothers and sisters"" as fellow humans and he broadly supported the ideas behind Communism and Marxism.
The 86-year-old Dalai Lama, taking part in an online news conference anchored in Tokyo, was answering a question about whether the international community should consider boycotting the Beijing Winter Olympics over the suppression of minorities, including those in the western region of Xinjiang.
""I know Communist Party leaders since Mao Zedong. Their ideas (are) good. But sometimes they do much extreme, tight control,"" he said from his base in India, adding he thought things would change in China under a new generation of leaders.
""Regarding Tibet and also Xinjiang, we have our own unique culture, so the more narrow-minded Chinese Communist leaders, they do not understand the variety of different cultures.""
Noting that China consisted not only of ethnic Han people but also other, different, groups, he added: ""In reality, too much control by Han people."" 
China seized control of Tibet after its troops entered the region in 1950 in what it calls a ""peaceful liberation"". Tibet has since become one of the most restricted and sensitive areas in the country.
Beijing regards the Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, as a dangerous ""splittist"" or separatist. He has worked for decades to draw global support for linguistic and cultural autonomy in his remote, mountainous homeland.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin, asked at a regular press briefing on Wednesday about relations with the Dalai Lama, referred to ""an out-and-out separatist political group"".
'QUITE DELICATE'
The Dalai Lama said he broadly supported the ideas of Communism and Marxism, laughing as he related an anecdote about how he once thought of joining the Communist Party but was dissuaded by a friend.
When asked about Taiwan, the centre of increased military tension in the region, he said he thought the island was the true repository of China's ancient culture and traditions since on the mainland it was now ""too politicised"".
""Economically Taiwan gets a lot of help from mainland China,"" he said. ""And culture, Chinese culture, including Buddhism, I think mainland Chinese brothers and sisters can learn a lot from Taiwanese brothers and sisters.""
Though the Dalai Lama said he had no plan to meet China's leader, Xi Jinping, he said he would like to visit again to see old friends since ""I am growing older"" - but would avoid Taiwan since relations between it and China are ""quite delicate"".
""I prefer to remain here in India, peacefully,"" he said, praising it as a centre of religious harmony - despite complaints from Muslims in recent years.

In the end, though, he said believed all religions had the same message.
""All religions carry the message of love and use a different philosophy of views. So now the problem (is) the politicians, in cases some economists ... use this difference of religion. So now, religion is also politicised - so that is a problem.""

WASHINGTON - U.S. civil rights groups are asking the White House to broaden a plan to grant clemency to inmates released to home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic, saying its current policy wrongfully excludes people convicted of non-drug-related crimes or those still facing lengthy sentences.
The clemency initiative is an attempt to prevent the return to prison of some 4,800 federal inmates who were released early due to the pandemic emergency, as the Bureau of Prisons scrambled to slow transmission rates in its facilities.
The 29 advocacy groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the Justice Action Network and FAMM - a group that opposes mandatory minimum sentences - are not alone in questioning the return of so many people to prison: U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland has raised the same concerns.
""It would be a terrible policy to return these people to prison,"" Garland told lawmakers last month.
But the Justice Department he leads argues it lacks the legal authority to allow the prisoners to continue to serve their sentences at home after the state of emergency allowed by a March 2020 law expires.
There is no clear date for when that may occur, though the Biden administration expects the public health crisis to last through at least 2021.
The Justice Department and the White House are only allowing the released inmates to apply for clemency if they are low-level non-violent drug offenders with 18 months to four years left on their prison terms. 
That bars drug offenders serving lengthy prison terms, as well as white-collar offenders, such as those convicted of tax evasion, bank or mail and wire fraud.
The White House and Justice Department declined to disclose how many of the 4,800 inmates will be eligible or to explain why they had offered clemency only to that particular class of inmates. 
But criminal justice advocates said they believe just a tiny fraction will be eligible, since federal drug convictions carry steep mandatory minimum sentences.
""We argued for the entire population to get clemency. In response, they came back with this very, very narrow solution,"" said Inimai Chettiar, a director at the Justice Action Network, which advocates for criminal justice reforms.
While the Justice Department typically reviews and makes recommendations for clemency, the White House has the sole power to commute federal sentences or issue pardons.
A White House official told Reuters the clemency review underway is ""just the beginning.""
""This is an initial clemency review, consistent with the president's campaign promise and it's the starting point for our process, leaving the door open for other populations,"" the official said.
Criminal justice advocates have long complained that the president's clemency powers have not been used enough to spare low-level drug offenders, many of whom are often addicts, from lengthy mandatory minimum sentences.
Such strict sentencing requirements for drug offenses have disproportionately impacted African Americans, in part thanks to rules which treated drug crimes involving crack more harshly than those involving cocaine.
In recent years views on how to treat drug offenders have also evolved, with some experts saying people with drug addictions should be rehabilitated rather than locked in prison.
NEED FOR CONGRESSIONAL ACTION
Criminal justice advocates have lobbied the White House and the Justice Department to rescind the memo outlining the department's views on the limits of its home confinement authority, and provide a legal pathway to keep people home, though Bureau of Prisons Director Michael Carvajal has previously said only Congress can change the law.
Without an immediate legislative fix -- and with the bitterly divided Congress facing a steep to-do list -- the groups urged the White House to take action on clemency for all the released inmates.
""We don’t want any arbitrary line-drawing between someone who happened to sell drugs and somebody who failed to pay taxes,"" said Kevin Ring, president of the advocacy group FAMM.
At stake is the future of people like Travis Rogers (NYSE:ROG), who was released from federal prison in Springfield, Missouri, to home confinement in June 2020, but has seven years remaining on his sentence for conspiring to distribute methamphetamine. 
A recovering addict for 11 years, he has built a new life since his return home by landing a job building car engines, reconnecting with his adult daughter and helping care for his aging father.
""I feel like it's unjust,"" Rogers said in an interview, noting he has turned down promotions at work because he fears he could be returned to prison. 

He said that his crimes were driven by addiction, and that he has learned his lesson after serving a decade in prison.
""It would be better to try to rehabilitate drug dealers than throwing them in prison,"" he said.

RENTON, Washington (Reuters) - Ten-year-old Mansoor only narrowly escaped Afghanistan as it fell to the Taliban in August, and while he is now living safely in Washington state with relatives, he asks them every day if he can return. 
In the chaos around the withdrawal of U.S. troops and the evacuation of more than 70,000 Afghans to the United States, Mansoor was separated from his parents and siblings.
Mansoor was carrying his relative Shogofa's toddler, as they entered the airport in Kabul. At that moment, shots rang out and the military closed the gates in between Mansoor and his parents. After three days in the airport, he boarded a plane with Shogofa, who hoped the rest of the family would make it out on a later flight. 
Shogofa ended up on a U.S. military base in New Jersey with her own two young children, Mansoor, and other relatives. After several weeks, they joined her sister, Nilofar, who lives in the Seattle area. Mansoor's parents are currently in hiding in Afghanistan because of his father's former position in the Afghan government.
Now, Mansoor mostly sits by himself and rarely plays with the other children, Nilofar said. The family requested only their first names be published to protect Mansoor's parents and other relatives still in Afghanistan.
Mansoor is among approximately 1,300 children evacuated to the United States from Afghanistan without their parents or legal guardians, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees the care of unaccompanied minors. The figure has not been previously reported.
Many of the Afghan minors were unintentionally separated from their parents in Kabul, advocates said.
The complicated situations of the minors, coupled with language barriers and lack of culturally appropriate foster families for those who don't have sponsors in the United States, is creating a tangled knot of problems for the U.S. government. Primary among them: no clear mechanism for reuniting children who are now in the United States with parents still stuck abroad. 
The administration of President Joe Biden is working on ways to expedite the entry of parents whose children are already in the United States, according to two U.S. officials who requested anonymity.
Without a fast track, parents abroad will likely be stuck in a long backlog of Afghans who are applying for U.S. entry on humanitarian grounds.
Most of the children and adult evacuees have been allowed temporarily into the United States, protecting them from deportation but not giving them permanent legal status. The children will likely have to find legal help to navigate the complex immigration system.
Since August 2021, the government says it has received more than 26,000 requests for temporary entry from Afghan nationals abroad. Fewer than 100 applications have been conditionally approved since July 1, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Afghans have to travel to a third country to even apply because the U.S. embassy in Kabul is closed.
Mansoor's parents have mostly avoided cell phones for fear of being tracked down by the new Islamist militant rulers, Nilofar said. On Nov. 1, the boy spoke with his parents for the first time since he was separated from them in late August.
""To not know what will happen to them, and then also to not know if and how and when their families might escape, and will their families be okay"" is causing huge amounts of stress and trauma for the children, said Jennifer Vanegas, supervising attorney with the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center. 
IN SHELTERS
Most of the unaccompanied migrant children in U.S. government shelters - currently more than 11,000 down from peaks of more than 22,000 earlier in the year - are from Central America. Unlike the Afghan children, minors from Central America have often intentionally set out on their own with the aim of reuniting with parents or other family already in the United States. 
HHS says its aim is to reunite migrant children with U.S. sponsors as quickly and safely as possible. 
More than 1,000 of the unaccompanied children from Afghanistan have been released, the bulk with relatives they were originally traveling with, like Mansoor, according to the HHS.
Typically, unaccompanied migrant children traveling with family members who are not parents or legal guardians are separated and placed in government care. But authorities made an exception to the rule in policy guidance issued on Sept. 4 that said Afghan children could be released to adults with proven ""bona fide"" relationships who had been screened by U.S. officials.
As of Monday, 266 unaccompanied Afghan children remain in government shelters and long-term foster care arrangements around the country, HHS said.
Among them are dozens of children who have no relatives or family friends in the United States who they can be released to. Their cases have been languishing in the system, said Ashley Huebner with nonprofit National Immigrant Justice Center in Chicago, where many Afghan children are being sheltered.
""I think overall the lack of action here is quite shocking,"" she said. Two months since the evacuation, ""it should not be this difficult.""
Vanegas in Michigan said there are currently 126 children at the Starr Commonwealth Emergency Intake Site in the state and as of Tuesday, 27 of them had been there longer than 40 days.
Many potential foster families do not speak the children's native language and are not familiarized with Afghan customs, advocates said. 
Afghan American groups have found people in the community willing to take children in, but are hitting snags in a long and complicated state licensing process for foster families. A coalition of groups sent a letter to HHS on Nov. 3, which was seen by Reuters, asking the agency to ""expedite and demystify reunification and placement processes, such as foster care, sponsorship, and humanitarian parole,"" among other recommendations to minimize the ""displacement, uncertainty, loss and grief"" the children are facing.
HHS said it is working with shelters to ensure facilities are culturally appropriate and is providing mental health care for traumatized kids. At the same time the agency said it is trying to place children according to the wishes of their parents abroad.
ANGUISH
Children such as Sadam Aziz, 15, are dealing with the shock of forced displacement on top of the anguish of not knowing if their parents are safe. Sadam had also expected to travel with his parents, but was separated from them when he went to fetch water during a long wait at Kabul airport. When Sadam came back with the water, his family was gone.
Unable to find them, he approached U.S. soldiers at the airport and asked for help, according to Jamaluddin Rohani, his uncle who lives in Washington state. When they, too, couldn't find his family, the soldiers told him to board a flight to Qatar, and to look for his parents there, Rohani said.
In Qatar, Sadam, who is slightly built and looks young for his age, was moved to a compound for unaccompanied migrant children. 
Rohani said he first heard about his nephew's whereabouts in a call from the United Nations' children's agency UNICEF telling him Sadam was in Qatar on his own. The agency - and Rohani - had no idea where Sadam's parents were. 
""For three days, I didn't sleep,"" Rohani said. 
Finally Rohani got word that his brother - Sadam's father - was alive, but hiding in Afghanistan because he had worked with the Afghan government and the U.S. military. 
There was nowhere else for Sadam to go except to Rohani, an uncle he hadn't seen in years. 
Sadam was first transferred to the emergency children's shelter in Michigan where he was quarantined for COVID-19. ""He called me and said, 'I am scared, there is nothing here,'"" Rohani said. The government case manager told Rohani that Sadam repeatedly asked when his parents would get there to pick him up. 
After several weeks, he was able to join his uncle. Since his arrival, Sadam has been helping around the house and has enrolled in school. But Rohani, who works as a security guard, worries he won't be able to support his nephew long-term. ""For a year, maybe, I can do it, but after that I can't, because I am low income, and I have a big family,"" he said.
Some evacuees who ended up traveling with children who were not their own have said they are not able to care for the children long term. A handful of children who had these relationships break down have ended up in government shelters, according to advocates.

On a recent Saturday, Sadam hung out with his cousins, playing video games and basketball, and watching a neighbor play with a toy remote-controlled car. Rohani said he is doing his best to fit into the rhythm of his new household. 
But Rohani said Sadam still regularly asks ""when are my parents coming?"" Rohani's answer: ""I don't know.""

Retail stores filled up within hours of reopening due to pent up demand while some shoppers reportedly queued up outside malls overnight to take advantage of early bird offers at some stores.
Libraries, museums and zoos were also allowed to receive visitors as the government eased coronavirus restrictions amid a pick-up in vaccination rates and due to mounting pressure from critics calling for more freedom. 
The hospitality sector, however, remained shut. 
In her first visit to the city since it was locked down on Aug. 17, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the hospitality sector will reopen as soon as Auckland hits its vaccination target.
""We have maintained contact with hospitality representatives all the way through...we know how tough it's been,"" Ardern said.
""But the light is at the end of the tunnel. We will see reopenings in the very near future as Auckland starts to hit those targets,"" she said.
Ardern has said the city will move into a new ""traffic-light"" system to manage outbreaks rather than lockdowns once 90% of Aucklanders have been fully vaccinated. So far, about 84% of Aucklanders have received their second doses.
While New Zealand has been criticised for a slow start to its vaccination campaign, nearly 80% of the eligible population has now received a second dose.
Auckland schools can return to face-to-face learning from Nov. 17, the government said. 
Despite its success last year in eliminating COVID-19, New Zealand has struggled to fight off a highly infectious Delta variant this year, forcing Ardern to move from a strategy of zero cases through lockdowns to living with the virus.

New Zealand still has among the lowest coronavirus cases in the world with under 8,000 infections reported so far and 32 deaths.
Apart from the 1.7 million Aucklanders, and residents in some neighbouring regions, life for the rest of the population has largely returned to normal domestically although the country's borders still remain tightly shut.

Acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi will lead a delegation to Islamabad to discuss ""Pakistan-Afghanistan relations with a particular focus ... on enhanced trade, facilitation of transit trade, cross-border movement, land and aviation links, people-to-people contacts, and regional connectivity"", Pakistan's foreign ministry said.
While Pakistan has not formally recognised the Taliban administration after the militants took over in August, it has longstanding ties with the group, though Islamabad officially denies accusations by Afghanistan's old rulers and their Western allies that it backed the Islamists during 20 years of war.
The visit comes as the Taliban seek global recognition.
Pakistan has called on governments to allow development assistance to flow into Afghanistan and to unfreeze billions of dollars in its central bank assets to prevent economic collapse.
Despite the generally good relations between the Taliban and Pakistan, they have had problems.
National carrier Pakistan International Airlines last month suspended operations from Kabul after it accused Taliban officials of interference. 
Traders have also complained that some crossings on their common border have been closing regularly, disrupting flows of goods.
Pakistan's foreign ministry said this week's visit was a follow-up to one last month by its foreign minister to Kabul, who focused on smoothing trade and other ties.

Also on Wednesday, Pakistan's arch-rival India was holding a conference on Afghanistan for regional countries but Pakistan's national security adviser said Pakistan would not attend.
India had close ties with Afghanistan's old U.S.-backed government and the Taliban victory over it represents a significant loss of influence for India in Afghanistan.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is close to imposing more sanctions on Belarus, targeting some 30 individuals and entities including the foreign minister and Belarusian airline Belavia, with approval as early as next week, three EU diplomats said.
The EU and NATO accuse President Alexander Lukashenko of using migrants as a weapon to pressure the West by sending people fleeing the Middle East to Minsk and then onto the borders of Poland and the Baltic states.
The new round of sanctions is set to target Belarusian officials that the EU says have organised the migrant arrivals in revenge for sanctions on Minsk over human rights abuses.
On Wednesday, in a crucial step, the EU's 27 ambassadors are set to formally agree that the swelling numbers of migrants along Belarus' border with Poland amount to ""hybrid warfare"" and can serve as a legal basis on which to build sanctions.
Minsk denies any such operations and rejects all Western accusations of wrongdoing. Sanctions on senior officials have so far not been effective in weakening the rule of Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994 and is a close ally of Moscow. 
EU states are also considering broadening economic sanctions on Belarus imposed in July by targeting the local reinsurance sector and its main company state-owned BelarusRe, diplomats said.
The fifth package of asset freezes and travel bans on Belarusian state officials and businesses would be the EU's latest response to an worsening stand-off with Belarus over what the West and the Belarus opposition was a rigged presidential election in August 2020 by Lukashenko.
EU officials including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are calling for even tighter measures, including on international airlines accused of flying migrants into Minsk, who are then transported to the Belarusian border. 
Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei, who defended Belarus' record at the United Nations General Assembly in September, is one senior official set to be sanctioned because his ministry is accused of handing out Belarusian visas to non-EU nationals, notably Syrians and Iraqis, diplomats said. 
The EU has banned state-owned airline Belavia from EU airspace and EU airports after Minsk forced a Ryanair flight to land to arrest a Belarus opposition journalist. Now, direct sanctions on the airline would prevent it from being able to lease aircraft from Irish, Romanian and Danish companies.

However, there is debate in the EU over whether the sanctions should only apply to new leases or existing contracts.
More sanctions this month would take the total number of people under asset freezes and travel bans in Belarus to almost 200 people - including Lukashenko and his sons - as well as more than a dozen institutions and companies.

Danny Fenster, 37, who was managing editor of Frontier Myanmar, a top independent news site, was detained at Yangon's international airport in May as he attempted to take a flight out of the country.
It was not immediately clear what Fenster was accused of in regard to the new charges, which are the most serious levelled against him.
If found guilty, he could be jailed for up to 20 years under a terrorism law and 20 years for sedition. 
""We don't understand why they added more charges but it is definitely not good that they are adding charges,"" his lawyer, Than Zaw Aung, told Reuters.
""Danny also felt disappointed and sad regarding these new charges.""
The United States has repeatedly pushed for the release of Fenster, who was initially charged with incitement and breaches of a colonial-era unlawful associations act. He is being held at Yangon's notorious Insein prison. 
Authorities overlooked him in a recent amnesty for hundreds of people detained over anti-junta protests, which included some media personnel. 
The military has rescinded media licenses, imposed curbs on the internet and satellite broadcasts and arrested dozens of journalists since its Feb. 1 coup, in what human rights groups have called an assault on the truth. 
""We are as heartbroken about these charges as we have been about the other charges brought against Danny,"" his brother, Bryan Fenster, said in a text message.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations has paid nearly $8 million in salaries to some 23,500 health workers across Afghanistan over the past month, bypassing the Taliban-run health ministry in a test case to inject much needed liquidity into a dire Afghan economy. 
The U.N. development agency UNDP and the Global Fund health aid organization teamed up to resurrect a program that had been funded by the World Bank until it suspended assistance when the Taliban ousted the Western-backed Afghan government in August.
The United Nations has been struggling to get enough cash into Afghanistan to help deliver humanitarian aid to millions of people on the brink of famine and prevent the collapse of the economy and health and education services. 
""Someone had to step in. We were confronted not just with a health system that was collapsing, but also a financial system that was collapsing,"" UNDP Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific, Kanni Wignaraja, told Reuters. 
""Global Fund took the financial risk, we took the implementation risk to make these payments happen,"" she said. ""We've shown it's possible, it can work ... it goes a huge long way to saving at least the people's economy in the country.""
The Global Fund provided $15 million, of which nearly $8 million was used for salaries, while much of the rest was spent on providing basic medical equipment, essential drugs and supplies. UNDP worked out how to get the funds into the country and into the hands of health workers in 31 of Afghanistan's 34 provinces.
Wignaraja said UNDP wired some of the money to the Afghanistan International Bank and then used a large money service provider, which UNDP declined to identify for security reasons, to distribute the rest. 
'PRETTY CRAZY TEST RUN'
The health workers paid so far - working in nearly 2,200 health facilities - had money deposited into bank accounts, while another 2,500 health workers will shortly be paid in cash because they are in remote areas.
""It's given hope to these families. It's reignited healthcare services,"" said Wignaraja, adding that the program would now be run by the World Health Organization and the U.N. children's agency UNICEF for the next three months. 
""Without this, you literally would have all the Afghan doctors, nurses, technicians, heading across borders,"" she added. 
During that time Wignaraja said the United Nations would talk to the World Bank to see if it was then able to take over the program again or find a hybrid solution if the bank is unable to get any approvals needed to do so.
Since the Taliban seized power the economy spiraled into crisis. Afghan banks heavily relied on physical U.S. dollar-shipments, which have stopped, while billions of dollars in Afghan assets were frozen abroad. Development aid was put on hold as donors and institutions seek to avoid violating U.N. and unilateral sanctions and to use it as leverage over the Taliban.
Wignaraja said the payment of health workers salaries over the past month had helped spark the re-opening of some banks.
""The minute you start the local community economic activity and people are able to deposit money and take money these banks are able to open their local branches,"" she said.

After showing it could work, the United Nations would continue using the formal banking system and money service providers to get cash into Afghanistan for the next few months, Wignaraja said, although she added that U.N. agencies were also considering a need to bring U.S. dollars into the country.
""This has been for us a pretty crazy test run of the system,"" she said of the payments to health workers, adding that she hoped international donors were ""watching it really closely.""

The patrol was aimed at the ""seriously wrong"" words and actions of ""relevant countries"" on the Taiwan issue and the activities of pro-independence forces in Taiwan, a Chinese military spokesperson said in a statement.
Cross-strait tensions have been rising in recent months, with Taiwan complaining for a year or more of repeated missions by China's air force near the self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its own.
Taiwan's defence ministry said six Chinese military aircraft entered its southwestern air defence zone on Tuesday, including four J-16 fighter jets and two surveillance planes.
Several Taiwan media outlets reported on Tuesday that unspecified members from both the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate had arrived in Taipei on a U.S. military plane.
When asked about the visit, Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang told reporters on Wednesday that Taiwan-U.S. relations are ""very important"" and that he respects ""mutual visits between friends"".
The government will make ""appropriate arrangement"" based on each others' need, he said, without elaborating. 
The American Institute in Taiwan, the de facto U.S. embassy in the absence of formal diplomatic ties, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
China's defence ministry said in a statement that members of the U.S. Congress had arrived in Taiwan by military plane.
""We firmly oppose and strongly condemn this,"" it said.
A spokeswoman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office similarly condemned the visit, but played down the notion that war is imminent.
""We urge everyone not to believe or spread rumours,"" spokeswoman Zhu Fenglian told a regular press briefing on Wednesday.
In Washington, the Pentagon said it was not uncommon for congressional delegations to be transported in military aircraft. 
Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) did not provide details on who was on the flight, but said this was the second such congressional trip to Taiwan this year.
""It's not unusual,"" Kirby said. 

China has not ruled out using force to bring Taiwan under its control, despite the island's claim that it is an independent country that will defend its freedom and democracy.
In June, China's defence ministry denounced a brief weekend visit by three U.S. senators to Taiwan on a U.S. military aircraft, calling it a ""vile political provocation"" that was irresponsible and dangerous.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -At least 16 United Nations staff and dependents have been detained in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, a U.N. spokesperson said on Tuesday, amid reports of widespread arrests of ethnic Tigrayans.
""We are, of course, actively working with the government of Ethiopia to secure their immediate release,"" U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters in New York. 
He declined to answer a question on the ethnicity of those detained, saying: ""These are United Nations staff members, they're Ethiopians..., and we would like to see them released, whatever ethnicity is listed on their identity cards.""
The state-appointed Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said on Sunday it had received many reports of arrests of Tigrayans in the capital, including elders and mothers with children. 
Daniel Bekele, head of the commission, told Reuters on Tuesday that it was monitoring ""the arrests of hundreds of Tigrayans in Addis Ababa"". 
Police have denied making ethnically motivated arrests, saying they are only targeting supporters of the rebellious Tigrayan forces fighting the central government. 
Fasika Fanta, spokesperson for the Addis Ababa police, and government spokesman Legesse Tulu told Reuters they had no information on the arrests of U.N. staff. 
""Those that have been detained are Ethiopians who violate the law,"" said Legesse. 
The U.S. State Department said Washington finds the reports of arrests of U.N. staff members ""concerning"", adding that harassment and detention on the basis of ethnicity is completely unacceptable.
""The reports do tend to suggest an arrest based on ethnicity and that is something that if confirmed, we would strongly condemn. So whatever we can do to secure the release of these individuals, we will be prepared to do,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters.
The year-long conflict in northern Ethiopia between the government and Tigrayan forces loyal to the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) has intensified in recent weeks after he TPLF pushed southward. Tigrayan forces and their allies have threatened to march on the capital.
Ethiopia declared a state of emergency https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/addis-ababa-government-urges-residents-register-arms-media-2021-11-02 on Nov 2. That permits the government to arbitrarily arrest, without a court order, anyone suspected of collaborating with a terrorist group. Parliament designated the TPLF as a terrorist group earlier this year.
Britain tightened its travel advice on Tuesday, advising citizens to leave Ethiopia while commercial flights are available, after the United States on Nov. 5 advised all citizens to leave Ethiopia as soon as possible.
Zambia evacuated non-essential staff from Ethiopia on Tuesday, its foreign ministry said.
DIPLOMATIC PUSH
Diplomatic efforts continue to try to lay the ground for talks and avert an attack on the Ethiopian capital, home to 5 million people.
""Our position remains that there can be no military solution to this conflict and only dialogue can produce a lasting peace,"" Britain's minister for Africa, Vicky Ford, told journalists. 
Former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo is in Ethiopia on behalf of the African Union to try to facilitate talks. The TPLF's spokesperson, Getachew Reda, told Reuters they had held discussions with him. 
“He wanted to know if we believe there is the possibility of a political solution to this problem. We said yes,” he told Reuters. But, Getachew added, “we are not willing to retreat because of the siege, because of the blockade."" 
The United Nations has accused the government of operating a de facto blockade preventing humanitarian aid from entering Tigray. The government has denied blocking aid. 
Getachew also said that a government air strike had killed dozens in the town of Chefa Robit and there had been drone and air strikes on Wollo University in Dessie and the town of Chifra in Afar.
Reuters was unable to independently confirm his account as communications to those areas are down. Government and military spokespeople did not return calls seeking comment. 
The State Department said Washington believes there is a small window of an opening to work with the African Union to make progress on peacefully resolving the conflict. 

The U.S. Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa, Jeffrey Feltman, returned to Addis Ababa on Monday and remains in Ethiopia, Price said on Tuesday.
Government spokesperson Legesse and foreign affairs ministry spokesperson Dina Mufti did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the talks.

KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) -Shortly after opening fire during racial justice protests in Wisconsin in 2020, teenager Kyle Rittenhouse told a witness in his murder trial that he had no choice but to use his semi-automatic rifle, the jury heard on Tuesday.
Nicholas Smith, the first witness called by Rittenhouse's lawyers after prosecutors rested their case, said he spoke to the teen after he fired his weapon on Aug. 25, 2020, in Kenosha, describing him as nervous, sweating and pale.
""He repeats: ‘I just shot someone,’ over and over."" said Smith, who was among the armed men protecting a used car dealership on the third night of protests sparked by the police shooting and wounding of a Black man, Jacob Blake.
Rittenhouse added: ""I had to. I had to shoot someone,"" Smith said. 
Rittenhouse, 18, is charged in the killing of Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and the wounding of Gaige Grosskreutz, 27. He has pleaded not guilty and is planning to testify that he acted in self-defense, his lawyers have said.
The case is the most high-profile civilian self-defense trial since George Zimmerman was acquitted in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Black teenager, in Florida in 2013. 
Like Zimmerman, Rittenhouse has emerged as a divisive figure and politics has coursed through the case. He is a hero to some conservatives who believe in unfettered gun rights and see the shootings as justified during the chaos in Kenosha, while many on the left see him as a symbol of a gun culture run amok.
FATAL SHOT
During five days of testimony, prosecutors have tried to paint Rittenhouse as a vigilante killer who used deadly force without justification. He was 17 at the time of the shootings and has been charged with underage possession of his gun.
But the two assistant district attorneys prosecuting the case struggled to elicit testimony countering the teen's claims that he feared for his life. Some witnesses they called spoke about the erratic behavior of Rosenbaum that night.
""The state formally rests its case,"" Kenosha County Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger said after questioning Dr. Doug Kelley, a forensic pathologist with the Milwaukee County medical examiner's office.
Kelley conducted the autopsies on Rosenbaum and Huber. While the jury viewed graphic images of the gunshot wounds to their bodies, Kelley described how Rosenbaum died from a bullet to the back and Huber from a shot to his chest.
His testimony contained elements supportive of both the prosecution and the defense cases.
Video evidence showed Rosenbaum chasing Rittenhouse in a parking lot, throwing a plastic bag at him and moving toward the teen as he turned and fired four times. 
Kelley said Rosenbaum took bullets to the groin, hand, back and head. He said the trajectories of the bullets to the back and head indicated Rosenbaum was tilted forward, or ""more horizontal to the ground,"" when hit with the fatal shot. 
Kelley also said soot residue on Rosenbaum's hand suggested the two were close and that Rosenbaum could have touched the barrel. Defense lawyers have sought to establish that Rosenbaum reached for the teen's gun.
Under questioning by Kenosha County Assistant District Attorney James Kraus, Kelley said Rosenbaum could have been falling forward after the shot to the groin and in the process inadvertently touched the rifle with his hand.
But Kelley also acknowledged the evidence was consistent with Rosenbaum propelling forward with his own momentum when the teen fired.

""So if I was charging like a bull and diving, that would be consistent?"" Mark Richards, an attorney for Rittenhouse, asked.
""It would be,"" Kelley responded.

The long-distance summit comes as ties between the world’s two largest economies have quietly improved in recent months, even as the nations spar over Taiwan and alarm grows in Washington over Beijing’s expanding nuclear arsenal. 
The exact date of the summit is still being negotiated, according to two people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified. The session won’t address the issue of whether the U.S. consulate in Chengdu and the Chinese consulate in Houston will reopen, one of the people added. Both buildings were shuttered in July last year amid tit-for-tat feuding between Washington and Beijing. 
White House and State Department spokespeople didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. 
White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre reiterated Monday that there’s “an agreement in principle” for a virtual meeting “before the end of the year.” 
“This is part of our ongoing efforts to responsibly manage the competition between our countries,” she told reporters, and is “not about seeking specific deliverables.”
The White House has previously said it wants to elevate talks to the leader level, in hopes that the two presidents can agree on guardrails for the relationship to ensure competition doesn’t veer into conflict.

It comes almost six months after Biden held an in-person summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva. 
The meeting would also follow the sixth plenum -- a key meeting of Communist Party officials taking place in Beijing this week. That gathering is expected to help smooth the way for Xi to win a third term as party leader next year. 
Biden met Xi repeatedly over the years, including as vice president, and used to tout what he said was his friendship with the Chinese leader. He gave a harsher assessment on the campaign trail last year, calling Xi a “thug” who “doesn’t have a democratic -- with-a-small-‘d’ -- bone in his body.”
Xi hasn’t left China in 21 months, as China continues to push ahead with a Covid-zero policy and as Xi prepares for an important Communist Party meeting scheduled for next year. Xi didn’t attend the recent meeting of Group of 20 leaders in Rome or climate talks in Glasgow.

BRUNSWICK, Ga. (Reuters) -One of the men accused of murdering Ahmaud Arbery in a southern Georgia suburb in 2020 bloodied himself as he examined the Black jogger's body, looking in vain for a weapon, a police officer told a court on Tuesday.
Gregory McMichael, 65, is one of three white men on trial for the killing of Arbery, 25, who they say they suspected may have been fleeing a crime when they pursued him in vehicles, cornered him and shot him on a street in their mostly white neighborhood.
Arbery's family and their supporters say he was targeted because he was Black.
McMichael told police that Arbery was moving fast through the neighborhood. ""I'm talking about a dead run. He’s not jogging,"" Glynn County police officer Jeff Brandeberry quoted McMichael as saying, as he read a transcript of a video recording from his body-worn camera.
McMichael, his son Travis McMichael, 35, and neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52, have pleaded not guilty to charges of murder, aggravated assault and false imprisonment for their deadly pursuit of Arbery on Feb. 23, 2020. They face life in prison if convicted by a jury composed of 11 white people and one Black person.
Prosecutors have said the men ""assumed the worst"" of Arbery as he ran through the Satilla Shores neighborhood just outside Brunswick (NYSE:BC), which had experienced some recent thefts from cars.
After Arbery was trapped by the three men, he was seen on video reaching out for Travis McMichael's shotgun. Travis McMichael shot Arbery three times.
Brandeberry said he arrived on the scene shortly after the shooting and interviewed Greg McMichael, who had blood on his right hand.
The officer testified that McMichael got blood on himself when he moved Arbery's arm as he lay prone on the ground after the shooting to check him for a weapon. 
""I didn't know if he (Arbery) had a weapon or not,"" Gregory McMichael told the officer in explaining why he touched the body, according to the transcript read to the jury.
Arbery was unarmed.
'STOP, STOP, STOP'
McMichael said he shouted from the truck at Arbery to stop running.
""Stop, stop, stop, goddamn it,"" McMichael said, according to the transcript Brandeberry read.
The elder McMichael had been armed with a pistol he fetched after seeing Arbery run down the street. 
""I don’t take any chances,"" McMichael, a former policeman, told the officer, according to the transcript.
Most of Tuesday's testimony was focused on Brandeberry and another Glynn County police officer, Detective Parker Marcy. Both interviewed the elder McMichael.
Gregory McMichael, who began the armed chase of Arbery, told Marcy that he thought Arbery might have committed a crime, the detective told the jury.
McMichael told the detective he ""wanted to hold Arbery for the police, so he could be arrested, or identified at the very least,"" according to a transcript of Marcy's interview at the county police headquarters.
Prosecutor Linda Dunikoski asked whether McMichael ever told the detective that he was trying to ""detain"" or ""arrest"" Arbery.

McMichael did not, Marcy replied.
The defendants have argued they were trying to make a citizen's arrest under a state law that Georgia has since repealed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S.-trained Afghan pilots and other personnel boarded a U.S.-brokered flight out of Tajikistan on Tuesday, ending a nearly three-month detention ordeal that began when they escaped there in their aircraft during the Taliban takeover, Afghan sources said.
The plight of the pilots had attracted U.S. congressional scrutiny - with lawmakers and military veterans frustrated by what they believed was a sluggish U.S. relocation effort.
One pilot shared images of the group boarding the aircraft, saying it was destined for the United Arab Emirates. Flight-tracking data showed it had left the country.
""It's a relief,"" said David Hicks, a retired U.S. brigadier general who is helping lead a charity called Operation Sacred Promise working to evacuate and resettle Afghan air force personnel.
The Afghan personnel in Tajikistan represented the last major group of U.S.-trained pilots who fled abroad and were still known to be in limbo.
The group of evacuees included a U.S.-trained Afghan pilot at an advanced stage of pregnancy, who had expressed fear for her unborn baby in an interview with Reuters https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/exclusive-stranded-tajik-sanatorium-pregnant-afghan-pilot-fears-unborn-baby-2021-10-06.
The group flew to Tajikistan in military aircraft at the end of the war, was detained by Tajik authorities and had been awaiting a U.S. relocation - hoping the transfer to the Middle East will lead to eventual U.S. resettlement.
Reuters detailed accounts from the pregnant pilot and other members of the group https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/exclusive-echoes-uncertainty-afghan-pilots-await-us-help-tajikistan-2021-09-22 about their frustrations with their detention, and was first to report U.S. plans to relocate them https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/exclusive-us-hopes-soon-relocate-afghan-pilots-who-fled-tajikistan-official-says-2021-10-22.
The Pentagon estimated that the expected group of evacuees totaled about 191 - larger than the more than 150 Afghans previously known to be at two sites in Tajikistan. It did not explain the figures.
Afghan air force personnel flew dozens of military aircraft to Tajikistan and to Uzbekistan https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/exclusive-theyll-kill-us-afghan-pilots-held-uzbek-camp-fear-deadly-homecoming-2021-09-03 in August as the Taliban swept to power.
In September, a U.S.-brokered deal allowed a larger group of Afghan pilots and other military personnel to be flown out of Uzbekistan https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/afghan-pilots-start-leaving-uzbekistan-uae-despite-taliban-pressure-source-2021-09-12 to the United Arab Emirates.
Even before the Taliban's takeover, the U.S.-trained, English-speaking pilots had become prime targets of the Taliban because of the damage they inflicted during the war. The Taliban tracked down the pilots and assassinated them off-base https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/afghan-pilots-assassinated-by-taliban-us-withdraws-2021-07-09.
Afghanistan's new rulers have said they will invite former military personnel to join the revamped security forces and that they will come to no harm. But pilots who spoke with Reuters say they believe they will be killed if they return to Afghanistan.
SMUGGLED CELLPHONES
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told a congressional hearing in September he was concerned about the pilots in Tajikistan and would work with the State Department to ""see if we can move this forward.""
But the process of relocating the Afghans from Tajikistan proved to be more time-consuming and complex than the similar effort in Uzbekistan.
A U.S. official told Reuters that the United States faced difficulty securing Tajik authorization to access the pilots.
Republican U.S. Representative Austin Scott, who raised the case of the pregnant pilot in a hearing, expressed relief that the Afghan air force personnel ""are no longer stranded in Tajikistan.""
""I would like to thank everyone who made this release possible for their assistance, especially officials from the Defense Department,"" Scott said.
Most of the Afghan pilots and other personnel were held at a sanatorium in Tajikistan. Those in that group who communicated with Reuters did so on cellphones kept hidden from guards and said the Tajik authorities took away their identity documents.

The pregnant pilot, who is 29, had voiced concerns to Reuters about risks to her and her unborn child at the remote sanatorium. She was subsequently moved to a maternity hospital https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pregnant-afghan-pilot-who-voiced-fears-reuters-moved-tajik-hospital-2021-10-10 before being transferred back to the sanatorium ahead of her departure.
""We are like prisoners here. Not even like refugees, not even like immigrants. We have no legal documents or way to buy something for ourselves,"" she said last month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday tackled the question of whether a decision by Congress five decades ago to exclude Puerto Rico from a federal program that provides benefits to low-income elderly, blind and disabled people was unlawful.
Some of the nine justices posed tough questions during arguments in the case to the lawyer for the U.S. government, which has appealed a lower court ruling that Puerto Rico's Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program exclusion violated a U.S. Constitution mandate that laws apply equally to everyone.
But it remained unclear whether the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, ultimately will rule in favor of Puerto Rican resident Jose Luis Vaello-Madero, who received SSI benefits when he lived in New York but lost eligibility when he moved to Puerto Rico in 2013. 
Many Puerto Ricans have long complained that the Caribbean island's residents are treated worse than other Americans despite being U.S. citizens. Puerto Rico, which is not a state, is the most-populous of the U.S. territories, with about 3 million people.
SSI benefits are available to American citizens living in any of the 50 states, Washington, D.C., and the Northern Mariana Islands, but not the territories of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam.
If Vaello-Madero wins, more than 300,000 Puerto Rico residents could become eligible for the benefit at a cost that the U.S. government has estimated at $2 billion annually.
The Supreme Court has been instrumental in defining the legal status of Puerto Ricans dating to a series of rulings starting more than a century ago called the Insular Cases, some suffused with racist language. The rulings endorsed the notion that the people of newly acquired U.S. territories could receive different treatment than citizens living in U.S. states. 
Vaello-Madero's case gives the justices an opportunity to revisit https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/shadow-us-supreme-court-history-puerto-rican-family-struggles-2021-09-28 those rulings. Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch seemed interested in doing so.
""Why shouldn't we just admit that the Insular Cases were incorrectly decided?"" Gorsuch asked.
Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, whose parents were from Puerto Rico, mentioned the history of Puerto Ricans being treated as second-class U.S. citizens.
""Puerto Ricans are citizens and the Constitution applies to them. Their needy people are being treated different than the needy people in the 50 states,"" Sotomayor said.
The federal government's central argument is that the congressional decision to exclude Puerto Rico was rational based on the fact that Puerto Ricans do not pay many federal taxes, including income tax.
Conservative justices wondered about the repercussions of a ruling favoring Vaello-Madero including whether other benefits would have to be extended to residents of U.S. territories. 
Justice Amy Coney Barrett noted that if there was ""equal treatment across the board"" then questions would be raised over whether Puerto Ricans should pay federal income taxes. Justice Brett Kavanaugh said Vaello-Madero's lawyer made ""compelling policy arguments"" but noted that a clause of the Constitution specifically allows Congress to treat territories differently than states. 
Kavanaugh said it is a part of the Constitution that ""people would want to change"" but that it is not the court's role to do that.
Vaello-Madero is 67 years old and disabled. The government sued him in federal court in Washington in 2017 seeking more than $28,000 for SSI payments he received after moving to Puerto Rico.
Congress decided not to include Puerto Rico when it enacted the program in 1972. Puerto Ricans are eligible for a different government program, called Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled, that allows for more local control but not as much federal funding. 

The appeal originally was filed by Republican former President Donald Trump's administration. His Democratic successor Joe Biden has continued the appeal https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-puertorico/biden-follows-trump-in-defending-puerto-rico-benefits-exclusion-idUSKCN2DJ24D while at the same time urging Congress to extend SSI to Puerto Rico. 
A provision extending SSI benefits to Puerto Rico is being considered as part of Democratic-backed social spending legislation being crafted in Congress. Enactment of the provision would limit the importance of the Supreme Court's eventual ruling, due by the end of June.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday launched an environmental justice investigation into whether Alabama's wastewater disposal practices discriminate against certain Black residents and put their health at greater risk.
The inquiry, which will be led by the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, will focus on the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) and the Lowndes County Health Department.
It marks the first time the Justice Department has ever in history launched a Title VI environmental justice investigation into one of the department's grant recipients.
Under U.S. civil rights law, local governments and other entities that receive federal grants are prohibited from discriminating on the basis of race, color or national origin.
“Sanitation is a basic human need, and no one in the United States should be exposed to risk of illness and other serious harm because of inadequate access to safe and effective sewage management,” Kristen Clarke, Assistant Attorney General in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, said.  
Some of the adverse health effects on Black residents exposed to raw sewage in Lowndes County have included hookworm infections, she told a media briefing.
Residents are not connected to municipal sewer systems because they live in unincorporated rural areas and, as such, rely on private septic tanks in permeable clay soil.
Clarke said the Justice Department received allegations on behalf of county residents alleging the Lowndes and state health departments were aware of the health risks from but had failed to do what was necessary to safely dispose of raw sewage.“State and local health officials are obligated, under federal civil rights laws, to protect the health and safety of all their residents,"" she said.
In an email to Reuters, the Alabama health department said it was reviewing the information provided by the Justice Department and could not comment while the inquiry was ongoing, adding: ""ADPH is committed to cooperating with the investigating agencies to have this matter resolved as quickly as possible.""
Asked to comment, the Lowndes County health department directed Reuters to the state health department.
According to Clarke, Lowndes County, situated between Selma and Montgomery, is a predominantly Black and low-income area with an average median income of just $30,000.

NOGALES, Mexico (Reuters) - Leo fled his hometown in southern Mexico after his uncle was murdered by gang members and he received death threats. Earlier this year, he, his wife and their two children headed to the U.S.-Mexico border hoping to claim asylum.
After months of waiting, he hoped he would finally get his chance on Monday. But even as U.S. borders opened for travelers vaccinated against COVID-19, they remained closed to asylum seekers.
When Leo, 23, and his family approached the port of entry in Nogales, Mexico with his and his wife's vaccination cards in hand, they were told by a border official they could not enter and seek asylum.
""I feel dispirited and sad,"" said Leo, who asked his last name not be published for fear of reprisals from the gang he fled. President Joe Biden ""is just continuing the same policies of Donald Trump.""
Biden has kept in place a controversial U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) order, first implemented by his Republican predecessor Trump in March 2020, that allows migrants to be immediately expelled without an opportunity to seek asylum.
The Biden administration has said the CDC's order, known as Title 42, remains necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19, as asylum seekers are processed in crowded settings at the border.
Any foreign national attempting to enter the United States without proper documentation will be subject to expulsion regardless of vaccination status, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
Advocates have criticized the Biden administration's continuation of the expulsion policy as borders reopen.
The idea that a vaccinated asylum seeker is more of a risk than a vaccinated tourist is laughable, said Noah Gottschalk, global policy lead with Oxfam America, one of the advocacy groups suing the Biden administration to overturn the Title 42 order. Gottschalk said the exclusion of vaccinated asylum seekers strengthens the group's argument that the policy isn't about public health.
In September, a federal judge ordered the Biden administration to stop expelling family units - parents or legal guardians arriving with their children - under the Title 42 order. The administration appealed, and a higher court put the judge's ruling on hold as the case moves forward.
Last month, more than 1,300 medical professionals signed letters to the CDC urging it to end the border expulsions order, saying it lacked epidemiological evidence to justify it and put migrants at risk.
New York-based nonprofit Human Rights First has documented more than 7,600 kidnappings and other attacks on migrants stuck in Mexico who were blocked from entering the United States since Biden took office in January.
Leo has been working in construction to pay rent in Nogales, but he says his earnings are not enough to support his family. ""They abuse you because they know you are not from here, they pay you what they want,"" he said.

He is also worried about his children getting hit by a stray bullet when gunshots ring out at night. The U.S. State Department recommends Americans reconsider travel to the Mexican state of Sonora, where Nogales is located, due to crime and kidnapping.
""We were fleeing a place that was dangerous,"" said Leo. ""And here it is the same.""

GLASGOW (Reuters) -Over and over at the U.N. climate summit in Glasgow, world leaders have stressed the need to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. 
The 2015 Paris Agreement commits countries to limit the global average temperature rise to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and to aim for 1.5°C.
Scientists have said crossing the 1.5°C threshold risks unleashing far more severe climate change effects on people, wildlife and ecosystems. 
Preventing it requires almost halving global CO2 emissions by 2030 from 2010 levels and cutting them to net-zero by 2050 -- an ambitious task that scientists, financiers, negotiators and activists at COP26 are debating how to achieve and pay for. 
But what is the difference between 1.5°C and 2°C of warming? We asked several scientists to explain:
WHERE ARE WE NOW?
Already, the world has heated to around 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels. Each of the last four decades was hotter than any decade since 1850. 
""We never had such a global warming in only a few decades"", said climate scientist Daniela Jacob at the Climate Service Center Germany. ""Half a degree means much more extreme weather, and it can be more often, more intense, or extended in duration.""
Just this year, torrential rains flooded China and Western Europe, killing hundreds of people. Hundreds more died when temperatures in the Pacific Northwest hit record highs. Greenland saw massive melting events, wildfires ravaged the Mediterranean and Siberia, and record drought hit parts of Brazil. 
""Climate change is already affecting every inhabited region across the globe,"" said climate scientist Rachel Warren at the University of East Anglia.
HEAT, RAIN, DROUGHT
More warming to 1.5°C and beyond will worsen such impacts.
""For every increment of global warming, changes in extremes become larger,"" said climate scientist Sonia Seneviratne at ETH Zurich. 
For example, heatwaves would become both more frequent and more severe.
An extreme heat event that occurred once per decade in a climate without human influence, would happen 4.1 times a decade at 1.5°C of warming, and 5.6 times at 2°C, according to the U.N. climate science panel (IPCC). 
Let warming spiral to 4°C, and such an event could occur 9.4 times per decade.
A warmer atmosphere can also hold more moisture, resulting in more extreme rainfall that raises flood risks. It also increases evaporation, leading to more intense droughts.
ICE (NYSE:ICE), SEAS, CORAL REEFS
The difference between 1.5°C and 2°C is critical for Earth's oceans and frozen regions.
""At 1.5°C, there’s a good chance we can prevent most of the Greenland and west Antarctic ice sheet from collapsing,"" said climate scientist Michael Mann at Pennsylvania State University. 
That would help limit sea level rise to a few feet by the end of the century - still a big change that would erode coastlines and inundate some small island states and coastal cities. 
But blow past 2°C and the ice sheets could collapse, Mann said, with sea levels rising up to 10 metres (30 feet)- though how quickly that could happen is uncertain.
Warming of 1.5°C would destroy at least 70% of coral reefs, but at 2°C more than 99% would be lost. That would destroy fish habitats and communities that rely on reefs for their food and livelihoods.
FOOD, FORESTS, DISEASE
Warming of 2°C, versus 1.5°C, would also increase the impact on food production. 
""If you have crop failures in a couple of the breadbaskets of the world at the same time, then you could see extreme food price spikes and hunger and famine across wide swathes of the world,"" said climate scientist Simon Lewis at University College London.
A warmer world could see the mosquitoes that carry diseases such as malaria and dengue fever expand across a wider range. But 2°C would also see a bigger share of insects and animals lose most of their habitat range, compared with 1.5°C, and increase the risk of forest fires - another risk to wildlife.
'TIPPING POINTS' 
As the world heats up, the risk increases that the planet will reach ""tipping points"", where Earth’s systems cross a threshold that triggers irreversible or cascading impacts. Exactly when those points would be reached is uncertain.
Droughts, reduced rainfall, and continued destruction of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) through deforestation, for example, could see the rainforest system collapse, releasing CO2 into the atmosphere rather than storing it. Or warming Arctic permafrost could cause long-frozen biomass to decompose, releasing vast amount of carbon emissions.
""That's why it's so risky to keep emitting from fossil fuels ... because we're increasing the likelihood that we go over one of those tipping points,"" Lewis said.
BEYOND 2°C
So far, the climate pledges that countries have submitted to the United Nations' registry of pledges put the world on track for 2.7°C of warming. The International Energy Agency said Thursday https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/net-zero-methane-pledges-push-world-near-paris-climate-goal-iea-2021-11-04 that new promises announced at the COP26 summit - if implemented - could hold warming to below 1.8°C, although some experts challenged that calculation. It remains to be seen whether those promises will translate into real-world action. 

Warming of 2.7°C would deliver ""unliveable heat"" for parts of the year across areas of the tropics and subtropics. Biodiversity would be enormously depleted, food security would drop, and extreme weather would exceed most urban infrastructure's capacity to cope, scientists said.
""If we can keep warming below 3°C we likely remain within our adaptive capacity as a civilization, but at 2.7°C warming we would experience great hardship,"" said Mann.

NAREWKA, Poland (Reuters) - Hundreds of migrants huddled around forest campfires in freezing temperatures on Tuesday near the Belarus-Poland border where razor wire fences and Polish border guards blocked their entry into the European Union.
The EU vowed more sanctions against Belarus, accusing President Alexander Lukashenko of using ""gangster-style"" tactics in the months-long border stand-off in which at least seven migrants have died.
Poland and other EU member states accuse Belarus of encouraging the migrants - from the Middle East, Afghanistan and Africa - to illegally cross the frontier into the EU in revenge for sanctions slapped on Minsk over human rights abuses.
""The Belarusian regime is attacking the Polish border, the EU, in an unparalleled manner,"" Polish President Andrzej Duda told a news conference in Warsaw.
""We currently have a camp of migrants who are blocked from the Belarusian side. There are about 1,000 people there, mostly young men. These are aggressive actions that we must repel, fulfilling our obligations as a member of the European Union.""
Reuters reporters saw Polish border guards detain a group of Iraqi Kurdish migrants in a forest on the Polish side of the border on Tuesday afternoon. Medics put Red Cross blankets around some of the migrants. One elderly woman could not walk. 
NGO Grupa Granica (Border Group) said there were 16 migrants in the group, nine of them children. It said the group had been pushed back and forth between Polish and Belarusian border guards four times since they reached the border on Oct. 24. 
""I ask for asylum in Poland,"" read a message scrawled in English on a piece of paper held up by a middle-aged man.
Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiekci, who earlier visited Polish troops stationed at the border, said the migrants were being used by Belarus as part of ""a new type of war in which people are used as human shields"".
Lukashenko's government, which is backed by Russia, denies engineering the migrant crisis and blames Europe and the United States for the plight of the people stranded at the border.
It summoned Poland's defence attache on Tuesday to protest what it said were unfounded allegations about the involvement of Belarusian military personnel in the crisis.
'BLACKMAIL'
Lukashenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the situation by phone and expressed concern over the build-up of Polish troops at the border, the Belarusian state news agency Belta reported on Tuesday.
""To conduct a war with these unfortunate people on the border of Poland with Belarus and move forward columns of tanks - it's clear this is either a training exercise or it's blackmail,"" Lukashenko said in televised comments.
""We will calmly stand up to this."" 
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov suggested the EU provide Belarus with financial assistance to stop the migrant flows, referencing an earlier such deal with Turkey. 
The European Commission said around 2,000 migrants had now reached the border. Some could be seen milling around tents and campfires set up just beyond Poland's barbed-wire barrier. 
""This is part of the inhuman and really gangster-style approach of the Lukashenko regime that he is lying to people, he is misusing people...and bringing them to Belarus under the false promise of having easy entry into the EU,"" a Commission spokesperson said. 
EU governments partially suspended a visa facilitation deal for Belarusian officials.
The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR called for an end to the use of vulnerable people as political pawns.
'DANGEROUS EVENTS'
A spokesman for Poland's security services, Stanislaw Zaryn, said Belarusian security personnel were ""firing empty shots into the air, simulating dangerous events"", while also providing tools to the migrants to help them destroy the border fence.
On Monday some migrants used spades and other implements to try to break down the fence.
Poland's Border Guard recorded 309 illegal attempts to breach the frontier on Monday and detained 17 people, mainly Iraqis. 
Lithuania also reported a surge in attempted migrant crossings and followed in Poland's footsteps by declaring a state of emergency along its border with Belarus on Tuesday. 
The move allows border guards to use ""mental coercion"" and ""proportional physical violence"" to stop the migrants.
The crisis erupted after Western powers slapped sanctions on Belarus over its violent crackdown on mass street protests that were sparked by Lukashenko's disputed claim of victory in a presidential election in 2020.
Poland denies accusations by humanitarian groups that it is violating the international right to asylum by hustling migrants back into Belarus instead of accepting their applications for protection. Warsaw says its actions are legal.

""We can never be certain what will happen to people we offer help to in this forest because Polish authorities are breaking the law and the Geneva Convention,"" Grupa Granica's Jakub Sypianski said as Polish police detained migrants nearby.
A poll by IBRiS for Polish daily Rzeczpospolita this week showed 55% of Poles believe migrants who have illegally crossed the border should be sent back.

(Reuters) -U.S. Supreme Court justices on Tuesday appeared divided over a bid by a man sentenced to death for a fatal 2004 stabbing outside a convenience store to have his pastor lay hands on him during his execution in Texas in a case testing how far states must go to accommodate religious requests by condemned inmates.
The justices heard more than 90 minutes of oral arguments in convicted murderer John Henry Ramirez's appeal after Texas officials refused his request to let his Christian pastor touch him and audibly pray as he dies from the lethal injection and lower courts refused to issue a stay of execution. 
The court, which has wrestled in recent years over the religious rights of death row inmates, has a 6-3 conservative majority. Some of the conservative justices raised questions about the sincerity of Ramirez's religious request and how siding with him might affect future cases. The court's liberal justices appeared to sympathize with Ramirez, who was not contesting his guilt in the appeal. 
Lawyers for Ramirez, 37, have argued that the state's actions violate the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of the free exercise of religion as well as federal law. 
Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh questioned whether courts should second-guess a state's interest in trying to reduce the risk of bringing outsiders into an execution chamber. 
Kavanaugh challenged Ramirez's attorney on what other accommodations a state would have to allow, including a minister hugging an inmate or ""bread and wine in the execution room.""
Conservative Justice Samuel Alito wondered which body parts a spiritual advisor would need to touch. 
""We're going to have to go through the whole human anatomy with a series of cases?"" Alito asked.
Conservative Justice Clarence Thomas asked if an inmate's last-minute requests can be seen as ""gaming the system"" to avoid execution and raise questions about sincerity. 
For both Ramirez and his pastor, laying on hands and praying are significant to their religious faith because, ""like many Christians, they believe they will either ascend to heaven or descend to hell at the moment of death,"" the inmate's lawyers said in court papers.
Texas contends that Ramirez's claims are a transparent delay tactic and that its protocol preserves the ""security, integrity and solemnity"" of the process and the execution team's ability to observe signs of distress. 
Liberal justices noted that states and the federal government historically have made accommodations similar to those sought by Ramirez.
""So we have experience and there's never been a problem,"" Justice Stephen Breyer, a death penalty critic, told Texas Solicitor General Judd Stone. 
President Joe Biden's administration has backed Ramirez bid for certain accommodations. But during the arguments, Justice Department lawyer Eric Feigin said Texas may be able to prevent the pastor from touching Ramirez during the injection of lethal chemicals due to the risk of disrupting the intravenous lines. 
""Anything going wrong here would be catastrophic,"" Feigin said.
The case centers on First Amendment religious protections and a 2000 federal law that requires officials to show a compelling interest to deny a prisoner's religious-based request and to do so using the least restrictive means.
Ramirez was sentenced to death for the murder of Pablo Castro, a father of nine who worked nights at a convenience-store in the southern Texas city of Corpus Christi. Needing money to buy drugs, Ramirez stabbed Castro 29 times and made off with $1.25.

For the past four years, Ramirez has been a member of the Second Baptist Church in Corpus Christi, though he cannot attend services in person. Pastor Dana Moore regularly drives about 300 miles (480 km) north to Livingston to pray with Ramirez in prison. 
After Ramirez sued in August, lower courts rejected his requests and declined to block his execution. The Supreme Court issued a stay in September, putting his scheduled execution on hold.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration plans to announce new U.S. sanctions and other punitive actions ""very soon"" in response to Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega's re-election in a vote that Washington has denounced as a sham, a senior State Department official told Reuters on Tuesday.
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the measures would be the first in a series of steps that the U.S. government will ""ramp up over time."" 
Washington expects a strong resolution against Ortega when the Organization of American States meets this week in Guatemala but is not likely to use the event to formally seek Nicaragua's suspension from the bloc, the official said.
President Joe Biden is expected in the coming days or hours to sign congressional legislation aimed at ratcheting up pressure on Nicaragua, the official said.
Ortega, a former Marxist guerrilla leader, clinched https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/nicaraguas-ortega-coasting-victory-after-contentious-election-2021-11-08 a fourth consecutive term in Sunday's election after jailing political rivals ahead of a vote that drew international condemnation.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday that Washington will coordinate with other governments and was ready to use a range of tools, including sanctions and visa restrictions against those complicit in ""undemocratic acts.""
""We'll see some actions we take very soon,"" the State Department official said. ""I don't want to leave people the impression that it's going to be kind of one announcement and done... This will continue to go over time.""
The official declined to elaborate on the types of sanctions in the works. But a U.S. government source last week said initial targets would likely be individuals, security force members and government-controlled companies.
Ricardo Zuniga, U.S. special envoy for Central America, told reporters the United States was evaluating measures to hold Ortega's government accountable. He declined to say whether Ortega might be personally sanctioned.
Ortega on Monday night derided his U.S. critics as ""Yankee imperialists"" and accused them of trying to undermine Nicaragua's electoral process. Cuba, Venezuela and Russia all have offered Ortega their backing.
U.S. SEEKS OAS UNITED FRONT
Twenty-six OAS members voted https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/ortegas-government-is-undermining-nicaraguan-election-oas-says-2021-10-20 last month on a resolution that expressed alarm at Ortega's actions but seven countries abstained. Washington is working to forge a more united stand at the bloc's general assembly.
The State Department official said ""realistically, in terms of the votes,"" now is not the time to seek Nicaragua's suspension.
Asked if Nicaragua could be kicked out, Zuniga said it would be important for OAS members to jointly define next steps, calling expulsion a ""very serious matter."" Biden’s aides are wary because such action against Cuba in the 1960s failed to change Havana’s course. 
Biden is poised to sign into law the so-called RENACER Act, which received bipartisan approval last week in the U.S. House of Representatives, the official said.
The legislation calls for sanctions on Nicaraguans deemed responsible for unfair elections, increased coordination of such measures with the European Union and Canada, and expanded U.S. oversight of international lending to Managua.

Zuniga said elements of the bill correspond well to the administration's views. It would also require U.S. government reports on alleged corruption by the Ortega family, human rights abuses by security forces and Russian activities in the country, including military sales.
In addition, the administration is asked to review Nicaragua's participation in the Central America Free Trade Agreement, which gives preferential treatment to exports to the United States.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -A former U.S. Marine serving a nine-year jail sentence in Russia has started a hunger strike to protest against his incarceration and alleged violations of his rights, his family said, a statement Russian prison authorities said was untrue. 
Trevor Reed, a university student from Texas, was last year convicted of endangering the lives of two policemen in Moscow while drunk on a visit in 2019. He denied the charge and Washington called his trial a ""theatre of the absurd"".
""We have received a report from an attorney that Trevor has begun a hunger strike to protest his arbitrary detention and Russian authorities' numerous and flagrant violations of his basic human rights and his rights under Russian law,"" his family said in a statement late on Monday. 
Regional prison authorities in Mordovia, where Reed is being held, denied his rights were being abused or that he was on hunger strike. ""He is eating in line with the daily schedule,"" they said in a statement to Reuters. 
The Kremlin declined to comment. 
The family said that Reed was being held in a small room with a hole in the floor for a toilet, that he had not been allowed to speak to his parents by phone for 116 days, and that he was not being allowed to receive books or letters. 
The U.S. Embassy tweeted: ""We are aware of reports that #TrevorReed is on a hunger strike. We remain very concerned about his treatment & are monitoring closely. We urge the Russian government to do the right thing and return him to his family.""
Reed and Paul Whelan, an American who was jailed in Russia on spying charges he denied, have been touted as possible candidates for a prisoner swap between Moscow and Washington. 
Whelan's lawyer told Reuters on Monday that there had been talks on a deal concerning his client, but they had stalled. 
Reed's (NASDAQ:REED) family said in its statement it had met officials in Washington last month and urged them to strike a deal with Russia that would see Russians held in U.S. jails freed. 

Russian media have touted Konstantin Yaroshenko, a pilot serving 20 years for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine, and Viktor Bout, a Russian arms trafficker serving a 25-year prison sentence, as possible candidates for a deal. 
""Both Russian men whom Russian media have floated as potential targets for a 'trade' have served more than half of their lengthy sentences and are now senior citizens who would pose no threat to Americans if 'traded',"" Reed's family said.

SAN JOSE (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's efforts to tackle migration from Central America by promoting the rule of law took a hit with the contentious re-election of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, the clearest example yet of the region's democratic drift.
Ortega's election https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/nicaraguas-ortega-coasting-victory-after-contentious-election-2021-11-08 on Sunday for a fourth straight term followed the arrests of political rivals and closing down of political parties in recent months. 
U.S. sanctions and calls for a free vote had little effect. Ortega - a former left-wing guerrilla who fought Washington-backed right-wing 'Contra' insurgents in the 1980s - accused his opponents of being U.S. pawns. 
A similar disconnect is visible elsewhere. In El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, collectively known as the Northern Triangle, government allies have undermined, fired or transferred prosecutors and judges backed by Washington.
There is ""some frustration"" within Biden's government over this resistance to its efforts to promote anti-corruption measures and good governance in the region, said one U.S. official inside the administration.
Under Biden, the United States has identified weak governance as a root cause of migration from Central America, a long-term policy challenge to be tackled at the same time as managing record flows of migrants in the short term. 
A senior State Department official said that ""we definitely were not surprised"" by the pushback from Central American governments and acknowledged the region was going through a ""tough moment,"" including the COVID-19 pandemic and other ""destabilizing"" events.
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, insisted the administration would stick to its multi-year, multibillion-dollar plan to address the short- and long-term migration issues.
The Biden administration also plans https://www.reuters.com/world/exclusive-us-announce-new-nicaragua-sanctions-very-soon-official-2021-11-09 to announce new U.S. sanctions and other punitive actions ""very soon"" in response to Ortega's re-election, the official told Reuters.
Laura Chinchilla, former president of Costa Rica, said that Central America was passing through its most delicate moment since Cold War civil wars rocked the region in the 1980s, with Washington's policy focus ""swallowed up"" by the migration issue.
""(Former U.S. presidents) Obama and Trump failed because they had quite limited perspectives on security and migration, and lacked a more comprehensive approach,"" she said.
Nearly 10 months into the Biden administration, and with numbers of migrants arrested at the U.S.-Mexico border at record levels https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-under-pressure-us-mexico-border-arrests-reach-record-highs-2021-10-20, it was still unclear if actions would back up new promises for the region, Chinchilla added.
The situation, uncomfortable for a superpower used to getting its way in Central America, reflects a loss of leadership after the administration of President Donald Trump reduced the emphasis on democratic values, said Tiziano Breda of International Crisis Group, a think tank looking at conflict globally.
""It will take more than strong statements and public shaming, etc., to overturn this trend,"" Breda said.
WEAK SPOT
It also potentially reveals a weak spot in U.S. strategy towards the region. As shown by the Trump presidency, effective Republican swipes at Biden over border management can be a make-or-break issue in U.S. politics.
Central American governments may be using this reality as leverage, calculating there is only so far the United States will be willing to push for fear of losing cooperation on immigration, said Jose Miguel Vivanco of advocacy group Human Rights Watch.
They also appear to be learning from each other that the consequences of backsliding on issues such as the separation of branches of government are not unbearable, analysts say.
The State Department official expressed the administration's concern that other Central American ""actors"" could feel emboldened by Ortega's strategy.
But the official denied that Central American governments were using U.S. concerns over migration as leverage to push back on governance: ""That's not what we're seeing."" 
""These governments cooperate with us on migration because it's in their national interest as well,"" the person said.
For Ryan Berg, a researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a foreign policy think tank, Ortega was offering a ""playbook... for other wannabe authoritarians in Central America.""
""We fear that if there's no cost for what happened in Nicaragua... if there's no regional response to these events, then it could happen in other countries,"" said U.S. special envoy for Central America Ricardo Zuniga to reporters on Tuesday.
In El Salvador, President Nayib Bukele has stoked concerns https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/thousands-protest-el-salvador-against-bukele-government-2021-10-17 that he is steadily concentrating power. Supreme Court judges appointed by his party recently ruled that the president could seek a second consecutive term, contrary to the constitution, and Bukele has sent troops into the parliament to press for legislation.

""Relations with El Salvador are not solid,"" Jean Manes, the U.S. charge d'affaires ad interim told reporters on Monday. ""We simply can't look away when there's a decline in democracy.""
Government representatives for El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras did not immediately respond to requests for comment. They have each in the past warned that U.S. pressure over their domestic decisions has the potential to put at risk progress on common policy goals.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday rejected Ghislaine Maxwell's request for bail ahead of her Nov. 29 criminal trial on charges she helped enable Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse underage girls.
U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan has denied bail to Maxwell four times since the British socialite was arrested in July 2020.
Nathan cited her prior reasoning for the fourth denial, including that Maxwell was a ""significant risk of flight"" and that not even her proposed $28.5 million bail package would ensure her appearance in court.
A federal appeals court has twice rejected bail for Maxwell.
The 59-year-old has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and other charges related to Epstein's alleged abuse between 1994 and 2004 of four girls under 18. If convicted, she faces up to 80 years in prison.
Maxwell's lawyer Bobbi Sternheim had likened her client's ""reprehensible"" living conditions at a Brooklyn jail to those of Hannibal Lecter, the fictional serial killer made famous by Anthony Hopkins in the 1991 film ""The Silence of the Lambs.""
She also called it unfair to lock Maxwell up after former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and comedian Bill Cosby had remained free on bail during their respective criminal trials.

Prosecutors countered that Maxwell's bail request largely repeated arguments Nathan had previously rejected, and resorted to ""rhetoric and anecdotes better suited to tabloids than briefs.""
Epstein died in a Manhattan jail at age 66 in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. A medical examiner called the financier's death a suicide.

(Reuters) - Max Cleland, a veteran who lost an arm and both legs during the Vietnam War and went on to become a U.S. senator from Georgia, died on Tuesday at the age of 79.
His death was confirmed by one of the current senators from Georgia, Jon Ossoff, who described Cleland as ""a patriot, a public servant, and a friend."" President Joe Biden, in a statement after Cleland's death, described him as a ""hero"" who provided ""fearless service.""
Cleland died at his home in Atlanta from congestive heart failure, his friend and personal assistant told the media.
As a 25-year-old serving in the 1st Cavalry Division of the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War, Cleland lost both his legs and his right arm in a grenade explosion at Khe Sanh in 1968.
""When my eyes cleared I looked at my right hand. It was gone. Nothing but a splintered white bone protruded from my shredded elbow,"" Cleland wrote in his 1980 memoir, ""Strong at the Broken Places.""
Cleland spent 18 months recuperating. He later led the U.S. Veterans Administration, now the Department of Veterans Affairs, appointed in 1977 and holding the post until 1981. He also served in the Georgia Senate from 1971 to 1975 and was Georgia's secretary of state from 1983 until 1996.
Cleland, a Democrat, served one term in the U.S. Senate and lost a 2002 re-election bid to Republican Saxby Chambliss.

""After grueling months in the hospital, enduring multiple surgeries and a long road back to recovery, Max turned his pain into purpose,"" Biden said.
Cleland also went on to serve as a director of the Export-Import Bank and was appointed by former President Barack Obama to be secretary of the American Battle Monuments Commission.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand beefed up security measures at its parliament on Tuesday as thousands of people gathered to protest against COVID-19 vaccine mandates and government lockdowns aimed at controlling the pandemic.
All but two entrances to the parliament building, known as the Beehive, were closed off in unprecedented security measures, as mostly unmasked protesters marched through central Wellington and congregated outside parliament.
While the demonstration was peaceful, many people were seen holding signs and placards with messages like ""Freedom"" and ""Kiwis are not lab rats"" and shouting slogans as they demanded the government roll back compulsory vaccination and lift restrictions. 
Placards showing support to former U.S. President Donald Trump and slamming the media as ""fake"" and lying were also displayed.
""I will not be coerced and I will not be forced into taking something I don't want in my body,"" a protester said outside parliament.
""I'm asking (the government) to give us back 2018. Simple as that. I want my freedoms back.""
New Zealand has struggled to fight off a highly infectious outbreak of the Delta variant this year, forcing Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to move from its strategy of elimination through lockdowns to living with the virus with higher vaccinations.
Ardern last month said the country would require teachers and workers in the health and disability sectors to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, inviting criticism from people calling for more freedoms and for ending mandatory vaccine requirements.
""Treat us like people!"" another protester exclaimed when asked about the government's stance on mandating the vaccine.
""I'm here for freedom. The government, what they're doing, is anti-freedom.""
Speaking to reporters inside parliament, Ardern said: ""What we saw today was not representative of the vast bulk of New Zealanders.""
But the prime minister has been facing growing political pressure and public protests to ease pandemic measures ahead of the Christmas holidays. 

She plans to travel to Auckland on Wednesday when the lockdown measures enforced on the city nearly three months ago eases. She is expected to face more protests during her visit.
New Zealand still has among the lowest COVID-19 cases in the world with under 8,000 cases reported so far and 32 deaths. It reported 125 new cases on Tuesday and its total double-dose vaccination rate had reached nearly 80% of its eligible population.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Last month, the family of Mawlavi Ezzatullah, a member of Afghanistan's Hizb-e Islami party, received a WhatsApp message from his phone: ""We have slaughtered your Mawlavi Ezzat, come and collect his body.""
Ezzatullah's killing, in the eastern province of Nangarhar, was one of a steady stream of assassinations and bombings that have undermined Taliban claims that they have brought greater security to Afghanistan after 40 years of war.
Victims have ranged from former security officials from the ousted government to journalists, civil society activists, mullahs, Taliban fighters and apparently random targets like Ezzatullah, whose family said he had no enemies they knew of.
The Taliban have said their victory has brought stability to Afghanistan, where thousands of people were killed in fighting between the group and Western-backed forces between 2001 and 2021 before the hardline Islamists emerged victorious.
But on just one day last week, pictures from Jalalabad - the provincial capital of Nangarhar - appeared online showing two bodies swinging from a rope. Residents also reported a mullah's murder and video footage was circulated of a group of gunmen firing into a car, apparently killing its occupants, one of whom was identified by local journalists as a Taliban official.
Reuters was unable to verify the images and footage independently.
On Sunday, according to locals, three bodies were brought into a hospital in Jalalabad after a roadside bomb explosion that apparently targeted Taliban fighters in a pickup truck.
Later that day, gunmen shot a former Afghan army soldier in front of his house, killing him and two friends standing nearby.
The Taliban have downplayed such incidents, saying that after decades of war, it will take time for the country to be completely pacified.
""There are 34 provinces in the country and in a week, 20 cases will be prevented for every one that takes place,"" said spokesman Bilal Karimi. ""We have had 20 years of revolution and invasion and the level of these incidents will go down.""
Some former soldiers and intelligence officers from the ousted government blame members of the Taliban for targeting them since taking over. The group has promised there would be no reprisals, but accepts rogue fighters may have acted alone.
Many targeted killings remain unclaimed and some may be the result of local vendettas.
But others look the result of increasingly open conflict between the Taliban and a local affiliate of Islamic State, a development which the new U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan, Tom West, said on Monday was causing concern https://www.reuters.com/world/us-says-worried-about-increase-attacks-by-isis-k-afghanistan-2021-11-08 in Washington.
The militant jihadi group has claimed some of the deadliest attacks in Afghanistan in recent months in which hundreds of people have been killed, mainly in big cities.
""They are trying to undermine and discredit the Taliban Emirate. The Emirate promised security and they're trying to show they can't deliver it,"" said Antonio Giustozzi, a specialist in jihadi groups from the Royal United Services Institute in London.
He said Islamic State, which he estimated to have around 4,000 fighters, had been carrying out a campaign of targeted killings since around the summer of 2020 and had continued since the Taliban victory in August on a ""roughly comparable scale"".
'BIDEN HIRELINGS'
For many going about their business, the violence feels particularly menacing.
""I have never been as terrified as I am now,"" said a university professor in Nangarhar who has also worked as a journalist and who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted. He described events in Nangarhar as ""total chaos.""
The violence has fuelled fears that Afghanistan could collapse into anarchy and even return to a new phase of civil war, creating a haven for militant groups to launch attacks in neighbouring countries and the West.
""This is the scenario that has everyone worried,"" said one Western official with long experience of the region.
Islamic State, which first appeared in Afghanistan in late 2014 and adopted the title Islamic State Khorasan after an ancient name for the region, has been trying to recover from a bruising series of defeats in 2018 and 2019.
The group has claimed a series of strikes against Shi'ite mosques and other targets since the Taliban's victory in August, most recently on the main military hospital in Kabul which killed at least 25 people.
Less commonly reported are frequent, smaller atrocities which have been taking place not only in Nangarhar, long a stronghold of Islamic State.
Areas affected include Ghazni in central Afghanistan, Herat in the west, Balkh in the north, and Paktia, Paktika and Khost in the southeast.
""The Taliban militia are lost in panic, they do not know how to conceal their shame,"" an Islamic State video posted on the group's Telegram channel on Sunday said, accusing the Taliban of being ""Biden hirelings"".
As an insurgency the Taliban proved an effective and cohesive fighting force. Keeping the peace in a country in crisis presents fresh challenges, including uniting different factions, values and norms within the movement.

Giustozzi, who wrote a book on Islamic State in Afghanistan, said the group, which had retreated into remote strongholds in the east and northeast of the country, was trying to hit the Taliban while the group is still grappling with the transition from insurgency to government.
""They know that if they allow the Taliban Emirate to consolidate, next spring the Taliban will move to destroy them,"" he said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Tuvalu is looking at legal ways to keep its ownership of its maritime zones and recognition as a state even if the Pacific island nation is completely submerged due to climate change, its foreign minister said on Tuesday.
""We're actually imagining a worst-case scenario where we are forced to relocate or our lands are submerged,"" the minister, Simon Kofe, told Reuters in an interview.
""We're looking at legal avenues where we can retain our ownership of our maritime zones, retain our recognition as a state under international law. So those are steps that we are taking, looking into the future,"" he said.
Images of Kofe recording a speech to the United Nations COP26 climate summit standing knee-deep in the sea have been widely shared on social media over recent days, pleasing the tiny island nation which is pushing for aggressive action to limit the impact of climate change.
    ""We didn't think it would go viral as we saw over the last few days. We have been very pleased with that and hopefully that carries the message and emphasises the challenges that we are facing in Tuvalu at the moment,"" Kofe said.
Tuvalu is an island with a population of around 11,000 people and its highest point is just 4.5m (15 ft) above sea level. Since 1993, sea levels have risen about 0.5cm (0.2 inches) per year, according to a 2011 Australian government report.
Kofe said he delivered the video address, scheduled to be aired at COP26 on Tuesday, in a place that used to be dry land, adding that Tuvalu was seeing a lot of coastal erosion. 

When asked what Tuvalu's people think about the rising sea levels, Kofe said some of the older generation say they are happy to go down with the land, while others are leaving. 
""The one thing is clear is that the people have a very close tie to their land,"" Kofe said.

HANOI (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s parent company said on Tuesday it had unblocked the hashtag for celebrity chef Nusret Gokce's nickname '#saltbae', having found the tag had been blocked globally days after a video was posted online of Gokce feeding a gold-encrusted steak to a senior Vietnamese Communist Party official in London.
""We've unblocked this hashtag on Facebook and we're investigating why this happened,"" a spokesperson for Facebook operator Meta told Reuters, confirming the tag had been blocked for all Facebook users around the world, not just in Vietnam.
It wasn't immediately clear why the tag had been blocked, and the spokesperson declined to comment on potential reasons. While it was blocked, a search for the hashtag generated a message saying community standards had been violated.
In a U.S. Congress hearing earlier this year, Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said artificial intelligence plays a major role in ""content moderation"", responsible for taking down more than 90% of content deemed to be against Facebook guidelines.
The video, originally posted on Gokce's official TikTok account, showed Vietnam's Minister of Public Security, To Lam, filmed last week being fed a gold leaf encrusted steak by the Instagram-famous chef - often pictured theatrically seasoning and slicing cuts of meat - at his London restaurant, where a steak sells for up to 1,450 pounds ($1,960).
Lam, 64, was in Britain during a visit by senior Vietnamese officials to the U.N. climate conference, COP26, in Glasgow. But images of him chewing on the gilded beef caused a stir both on and offline in Vietnam, with many questioning how such a high-ranking Party official allowed himself to be caught on camera indulging in food carrying such a high price tag amid a state crackdown on corruption.
In one Facebook post, user Nguyen Lan Thang, with nearly 150,000 followers, changed his profile picture to a screenshot of the video, and pointed out that local media had been staying quiet over the incident.
""Security officers following this account, have you seen the video of minister To Lam eating salt-sprayed beef? Do you know how many months salary you'd have to spend for just one piece of that steak?"" Thang wrote in one post.
It was not clear who paid for the meal. To Lam did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Vietnam's foreign ministry, which handles foreign media enquiries.
The original video was removed from Gokce's TikTok account shortly after it was uploaded, and further copies have been removed from the app for violating ""community standards"", Vietnamese TikTok users told Reuters.
TikTok and Gokce declined to comment.
""It's not unusual that a government official is super-rich in Vietnam, but a minister seen widely opening his mouth to bite a golden steak is shameful,"" said a customer at one cafe in northern Vietnam who declined to be named, citing safety concerns.
Vietnam is defined as a lower middle income country by the World Bank. A minister in the country is paid an official monthly salary of around 16 million dong ($705.47).
SHUTDOWN THREAT
Vietnam routinely asks social media companies to censor content it deems to be ""anti-state"". Last year, Vietnam threatened to shut down Facebook in the country if it did not remove more local political content from its platform.
Facebook declined to comment on whether the Vietnamese government had requested that the video be removed. 
Vietnam operates one of the largest and most sophisticated online influence networks in Southeast Asia. 
Earlier this year, Facebook said it had removed some groups identified by Reuters as being part of a government influence operation for ""coordinating attempts to mass-report content"".
To Lam is one of the most powerful officials in Vietnam, his ministry containing both Vietnam's police and the agencies tasked with suppressing dissent and investigating corruption.
He had been touted as a potential candidate for state president in January's leadership reshuffle, and has in his capacity as security minister worked to arrest Vietnamese officials accused of corruption and overt displays of opulence.

Earlier last week, To Lam had led a delegation of officials to the grave of Karl Marx to ""remember the source of the water we drink"", the Communist-ruled country's state media reported, citing a Vietnamese proverb about paying respects, 
""General To Lam's visit to Karl Marx's grave affirms the Vietnamese people's tradition of 'remembering the source of the water we drink' for the figures who contributed to the direction of a dominated and suppressed nation,"" the security ministry's official mouthpiece said.

KYIV (Reuters) -Thousands of migrants were massing near the Belarus border on Monday, Polish authorities said, as European Union member states called for more sanctions against Minsk and security forces braced for more attempts to force through the frontier.
Warsaw has accused Belarus of trying to spark a major confrontation, with video clips showing hundreds of migrants walking towards the Polish border and some trying to breach the fence using spades and other implements.
""We expect that in the coming hours attacks on our border will be renewed by groups of several hundred people,"" Pawel Soloch, the head of Poland's National Security Bureau, told reporters.
Polish government spokesman Piotr Muller said that there were currently 3,000-4,000 migrants near the border, and more than 10,000 others across Belarus ready to try and cross into Poland.
Warsaw said it had deployed additional soldiers, border guards and police, while neighbouring Lithuania said it might introduce a state of emergency on its border with Belarus.
Poland said it had withstood the first attempts on Monday by the migrants to force their way across the border. 
The Polish Border Guard announced that as of 0600 GMT on Tuesday the crossing at Kuznica, near the site where migrants tried to force their way through, would be closed.
""We have three border crossings with Belarus,"" Deputy Interior Minister Maciej Wasik told private broadcaster Polsat News. ""The closure of one of them can... be treated as a kind of economic sanction.""
Wasik said there should be tougher EU sanctions against Minsk following the escalation of tensions on the border. The Baltic states Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have issued similar calls. 
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she was calling for member states to approve extended sanctions against the Belarusian authorities. 
The EU also wants to target airlines from third countries that help transport the migrants from the Middle East to Belarus.
The European Union accuses Minsk of encouraging migrants from the Middle East and Africa to cross into the EU via Belarus, as a form of hybrid warfare in revenge for Western sanctions on President Alexander Lukashenko's government over human rights abuses.
A video distributed by Polish authorities showed one man cutting part of a barbed wire fence, another attacking the fence with a spade, while a Polish soldier sprayed an unidentified substance from a can. 
In an earlier video, shared by the Belarusian blogging service NEXTA, migrants carrying rucksacks and wearing winter clothing were seen walking on the side of a highway. Other videos showed large groups of migrants sitting by the road and being escorted by armed men dressed in khaki.
Lithuania said it also was moving additional troops to the border to prepare for a possible surge in migrant crossings. Latvia said the situation was ""alarming"".
'INHUMANE ATTITUDE'
Lukashenko's government has repeatedly denied manufacturing a migrant crisis, blaming the West for the crossings and treatment of migrants.
The Belarusian state border committee confirmed on Monday that many refugees were moving towards the Polish border, but said Warsaw was taking an ""inhumane attitude"". 
Poland has stationed more than 12,000 troops at the border, its defence minister said, while sharing aerial footage of migrants clustered on the Belarusian side.
""They throw tree trunks on the fence so as to reduce the height of this fence to breach it,"" said Katarzyna Zdanowicz, spokeswoman for Polish border guards in the area.
The EU, the United States and Britain imposed sanctions on Belarus after Lukashenko unleashed a violent crackdown on mass protests following a disputed election last year. 
The U.S. State Department on Monday said it was concerned with disturbing images and reports from the border, and called on the government of Belarus to immediately halt its campaign of orchestrating and coercing irregular migration flows across its borders.
The United Nations called the scenes at the border ""deeply concerning"".
Lukashenko has defied opposition calls to resign, buttressed by money and diplomatic support from traditional ally Russia.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday defended Minsk's handling of the migrant issue, saying Belarus was taking all necessary measures to act legally. 
Charities say the migrants face freezing weather conditions and a lack of food and medical attention. 
Poland said seven migrants had been found dead on its side of the border, with reports of more deaths in Belarus.

Humanitarian groups accuse Poland's ruling nationalists of violating the international right to asylum by pushing migrants back into Belarus instead of accepting their applications for protection. Poland says its actions are legal. 
Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB): ""The Polish border is not just a line on a map. The border is sacred - Polish blood has been spilled for it!"".

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Houston's police chief said on Monday he met briefly with hip-hop star Travis Scott to voice his ""public safety concerns"" before the rapper took the stage for a weekend performance that ended with eight people killed and dozens more injured in a stampede.
Chief Troy Finner publicly disclosed conveying words of caution to Scott in person as legal action mounted on behalf of concertgoers crushed in Friday's deadly crowd surge, while police pursued a criminal probe of the tragedy.
Scott, the hometown recording star who was performing on stage as headliner of his Astroworld festival when the incident occurred, canceled an appearance scheduled for this weekend at a similar outdoor event in Las Vegas, a source close to Scott said.
Scott said on Monday he would cover all funeral costs and offer aid to those affected. He is also working with law enforcement and city officials to ""respectfully and appropriately connect"" with victims and their families, according to a statement.
The victims were crushed in a surge of fans near the stage at NRG Park at around 9:30 p.m., with some unable to breathe and others trampled underfoot. Hundreds of others in the sellout crowd of 50,000 were injured throughout the day.
Fans described a chaotic scene after a steady escalation of disruptive behavior over several hours.
Finner said in a statement released via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that he met with Scott and his head of security ""for a few moments"" prior to the headliner's ill-fated performance.
""The meeting was brief and respectful and a chance for me to share my public safety concerns as chief of police,"" Finner wrote, making no explicit mention of concertgoers' accounts of gate-crashing and increasingly unruly behavior throughout the day among the largely young crowd.
LAWSUITS CLAIM NEGLIGENCE
The eight fans who lost their lives ranged in age from 14 to 27 and included a high school baseball player, a high school band member who loved to dance and several college students from across the country.
Although he paused the music multiple times after spotting fans who needed medical attention, Scott completed his set. The show continued for 37 minutes after officials declared a ""mass casualty event,"" according to a Houston Chronicle timeline.
Scott released a short video late on Saturday, saying that while he was on stage, ""I could just never imagine the severity of the situation."" He also posted a statement on Twitter saying he was ""devastated"" and would cooperate fully with authorities.
More than a dozen lawsuits from victims and their families have already been filed against several defendants, including Scott and concert promoters Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV) Inc and ScoreMore. 
The lawsuits generally accuse Live Nation of acting negligently by failing to create and enforce sufficient safety protocols, failing to provide adequate security and failing to maintain proper crowd control.
Live Nation issued a statement on Monday saying the company ""would address all legal matters at the appropriate time."" Scott's representatives declined comment on civil suits filed.
'PURE, UTTER CHAOS'
Houston-based attorney Tony Buzbee told a news conference on Monday his firm planned to sue on behalf of Axel Acosta, 21, who died at the festival, and at least 34 other victims.
""It's self-evident that this concert was planned incredibly poorly,"" Buzbee told reporters, saying that video footage of the event posted to social media before and during Friday's deadly crowd surge showed scenes of ""pure and utter chaos.""
""Axel died on the muddy ground of a concert that he attended for fun,"" Buzbee said. ""Neither Travis Scott nor his handlers, entourage ... promoters, organizers or sponsors cared enough about Axel to make even a minimal effort to keep him and others at the concert safe,"" Buzbee said.
Basil Baig, whose brother, Danish, died at the festival, told reporters that Scott and concert organizers ""have blood on their hands.""
Live Nation's stock fell 5.4% on Monday.
The company said in a statement on Monday that it had met with authorities and handed over all video footage of the concert. Live Nation also said it had offered refunds to attendees and planned to provide mental health counseling and help pay for medical expenses for victims.
Police have opened a criminal investigation into the incident, and Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, the chief executive for the county that includes Houston, has called for an independent inquiry.
Roderick Payne, a crowd control expert whose firm provides security for large-scale events, told Reuters that authorities would review the security plan and determine whether mistakes were made. 

But he also said there are limits to how much security can do when dealing with such a large crowd.
""You can't prevent 50,000 people from trampling anybody,"" he said.

The annual exercises concluded on Tuesday, a few weeks before resumption of talks between Tehran and world powers to revive a 2015 nuclear deal.
""These aircraft (RQ-4 and MQ-9 U.S. drones) changed their route after approaching the borders of the Islamic Republic of Iran following the air defence's interception and decisive warning,"" IRIB reported.
The exercises stretched from the east of the Strait of Hormuz to the north of the Indian Ocean and parts of the Red Sea. About a fifth of oil that is consumed globally passes through the strategic Strait of Hormuz waterway in the Gulf. 
Periodic confrontations have taken place between Iran’s military and U.S. forces in the Gulf since 2018, when former U.S. President Donald Trump exited the nuclear pact and reimposed harsh sanctions against Tehran. 

Iran has reacted by breaching the deal's limits on its nuclear programme. 
Indirect talks between Iran and U.S. President Joe Biden's administration to revive the pact, which were put on hold since the election of Iran's hardline President Ebrahim Raisi in June, are set to resume in Vienna on Nov. 29.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - China's armed forces are capable of blockading Taiwan's key harbours and airports, the island's defence ministry said on Tuesday, offering its latest assessment of what it describes as a ""grave"" military threat posed by its giant neighbour.
China has never renounced the use of force to bring democratic Taiwan under its control and has been ramping up military activity around the island, including repeatedly flying war planes into Taiwan's air defence zone. 
Taiwan's defence ministry, in a report it issues every two years, said China had launched what it called ""gray zone"" warfare, citing 554 ""intrusions"" by Chinese war planes into its southwestern theatre of air defence identification zone between September last year and the end of August.
Military analysts say the tactic is aimed at subduing Taiwan through exhaustion, Reuters reported last year.
At the same time, China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) is aiming to complete the modernisation of its forces by 2035 to ""obtain superiority in possible operations against Taiwan and viable capabilities to deny foreign forces, posing a grave challenge to our national security"", the Taiwan ministry said.
""At present, the PLA is capable of performing local joint blockade against our critical harbours, airports, and outbound flight routes, to cut off our air and sea lines of communication and impact the flow of our military supplies and logistic resources,"" the ministry said. 
China views Taiwan as Chinese territory. Its defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen says Taiwan is already an independent country and vows to defend its freedom and democracy. 
Tsai has made bolstering Taiwan's defences a priority, pledging to produce more domestically developed weapons, including submarines, and buying more equipment from the United States, the island's most important arms supplier and international backer.
In October, Taiwan reported 148 Chinese air force planes in the southern and southwestern theatre of the zone over a four-day period, marking a dramatic escalation of tension between Taipei and Beijing. 
The recent increase in China's military exercises in Taiwan's air defence identification zone is part of what Taipei views as a carefully planned strategy of harassment.
""Its intimidating behavior does not only consume our combat power and shake our faith and morale, but also attempts to alter or challenge the status quo in the Taiwan Strait to ultimately achieve its goal of 'seizing Taiwan without a fight',"" the ministry said.

To counter China's attempt to ""seize Taiwan swiftly whilst denying foreign interventions"", the ministry vowed to deepen its efforts on ""asymmetric warfare"" to make any attack as painful and as difficult for China as possible.
That includes precision strikes by long-range missiles on targets in China, deployment of coastal minefields as well as boosting reserve training.

KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) -The only protester shot by Kyle Rittenhouse to survive testified on Monday that he believed the U.S. teenager was an ""active shooter"" and was trying to disarm Rittenhouse when a bullet from the teen's semi-automatic rifle severed part of his arm.
Gaige Grosskreutz, 27, also testified that he had pointed his Glock pistol in Rittenhouse's direction but that he never intended to use his weapon and only advanced on the teenager as a last resort because he thought he ""was going to die.""
Rittenhouse, 18, has been charged in the deaths of two men and with attempting to kill Grosskreutz during racial justice protests https://www.reuters.com/world/us/case-us-teenage-gunman-kyle-rittenhouse-2021-11-01 on Aug. 25, 2020, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where police shot and wounded a Black man, Jacob Blake.
Grosskreutz, a former paramedic, was carrying a medical kit and said he had come to help the injured, as he had at dozens of Black Lives Matter protests prior to that night. He said he followed Rittenhouse because he saw the potential for trouble and thought he might need to provide medical aid. 
""I thought that the defendant was an active shooter,"" Grosskreutz told the jury. 
His testimony was seen as critical in the most high-profile civilian self-defense trial since George Zimmerman was acquitted in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Black teenager, in 2013.
Grosskreutz represented the only chance for lawyers from both sides to question a survivor and elicit testimony on his mindset and actions, which is crucial to determining whether Rittenhouse had reason to fear for his life. 
Rittenhouse's lawyers sought to portray Grosskreutz as dishonest, noting that he had did not tell the police in his initial interview that he was armed, and pointing out some inconsistencies in his early accounts of that night.
The jury was shown video of an earlier encounter between Rittenhouse and Grosskreutz in which the teen said he was going to the police.
Grosskreutz did not know at the time that Rittenhouse had just fatally shot Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, but he had heard gunfire and said he began to worry for the teen's safety as protesters pursued him down the street.
Grosskreutz said he followed Rittenhouse as protesters shouted things like ""Get his ass!"" and as the teen stumbled to the ground. Grosskreutz said he saw Rittenhouse shoot Anthony Huber, 26, who had swung a skateboard at him, and that caused him to freeze, take a step back and put his hands in the air.
Grosskreutz, who was holding his pistol during the encounter, said on Monday that he believed Rittenhouse had ""re-racked"" his rifle, effectively loading another round into the chamber so it was ready to fire. Grosskreutz said he interpreted that to mean the ""defendant wasn’t accepting my surrender.""
""At that moment, I felt that I had to do something to try and prevent myself from being killed or shot,"" Grosskreutz said, adding he was thinking of trying to wrest the gun from Rittenhouse or to detain him.
Rittenhouse, who has been charged with killing Huber and Rosenbaum and attempting to kill Grosskreutz, has pleaded not guilty and is expected to testify he acted in self-defense. Sitting next to his lawyers, the teen took detailed notes when Grosskreutz spoke about being shot.
PRESSING FOR INCONSISTENCIES
Under cross-examination, Rittenhouse's attorney sought to establish that Grosskreutz had pursued the teen with intent to harm him - an assertion Grosskreutz denied. The attorney, Corey Chirafisi, also pressed Grosskreutz on why he did not tell police in an interview right after the shooting that he was armed. 
Chirafisi showed a photo around the time Rittenhouse fired his AR-15-style rifle to try to portray Grosskreutz as a threat, saying the teen did not fire when his hands were up and only did so when he dropped his hands and moved toward Rittenhouse.
Grosskreutz said initially that the still image showed his ""bicep being vaporized"" and denied it was the act of pointing his pistol in Rittenhouse's direction that caused the defendant to fire.
But Chirafisi pressed Grosskreutz further, asking: ""When you were standing 3 to 5 feet from him with your arms up in the air, he never fired, right?"" 
""Correct,"" Grosskreutz responded.

""It wasn't until you pointed your gun at him, advanced on him, with your gun, now your hands down pointed at him, that he fired, right?"" Chirafisi continued.
""Correct,"" Grosskreutz said.

BRUNSWICK, Ga. (Reuters) -One of the three white men in pickup trucks who pursued Ahmaud Arbery through their southern Georgia neighborhood told police the Black jogger appeared tired from the chase before he was shot dead, a jury heard on Monday at the men's trial.
Police body-worn camera footage of the first moments following Arbery's killing was played, giving jurors a glimpse of the demeanor of defendants Gregory McMichael, 65; his son Travis McMichael, 35; and their neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52.
""You had no choice,"" Gregory McMichael could be heard telling his son, hands on his shoulders, as the first police officer on the scene walked over. Arbery's body lay in a pool of blood in the middle of the road a few steps away. 
Jurors were also shown graphic police photographs showing close-ups of large gaping shotgun wounds in the center of Arbery's chest, below his left armpit and in one of his wrists.
The three men have pleaded not guilty in Glynn County Superior Court to charges of murder, aggravated assault and false imprisonment. They face life in prison if convicted on the most serious charge by the jury, which is composed of 11 white people and one Black person.
The men say they thought Arbery might have been fleeing from a crime when he ran through Satilla Shores, a quiet cluster of family homes outside the small coastal city of Brunswick (NYSE:BC), on a Sunday afternoon in February 2020.
Prosecutors say they had unfairly assumed the worst about a 25-year-old Black man out for a Sunday run.
The men pursued Arbery in pickup trucks for several minutes before the younger McMichael opened fire with his shotgun as Arbery ran toward him and appeared to reach for the weapon.
Larissa Ollivierre, a prosecutor from the Cobb County District Attorney's Office, sought to undermine the defense argument that the men were trying to detain Arbery under a citizen's arrest law, which requires a person to have reasonable suspicion that a felony has just been committed.
Bryan told county police officer Ricky Minshew, the first officer to arrive at the shooting, that he never heard a word from Arbery, but he heard one of the McMichaels call out to Arbery: ""What'd you steal? What'd you do?""
""Did he ever say that he told Ahmaud he was under arrest for anything?"" Ollivierre asked Minshew.
""No, ma'am,"" Minshew said.
Later, Bryan's lawyer, Kevin Gough, asked Minshew about Bryan's reason for pulling out his cellphone to record the shooting.
""Well, I thought he was going to get away,"" Bryan told Minshew at the scene, ""so that was the reason.""
'SUSPICIOUS BLACK MALE'
Minshew said he was checking out a report of a ""suspicious Black male"" in a white T-shirt in Satilla Shores when he heard gunshots as he drove into the neighborhood. He found the McMichaels and Bryan ""pacing"" near Arbery's body. 
Bryan told the officer that he recognized neither Arbery when he ran by Bryan's driveway, nor the McMichaels as they drove by in pursuit in their pickup truck, Minshew testified.
""He said he hollered at the truck: 'Y'all got him?'"" before jumping in his own truck to join the chase, Minshew said, referring to a transcript of the body-camera video.
""Should I have been chasing him? I don't know,"" Bryan told Minshew minutes after the shooting, a few steps away from Arbery's body in the road. Bryan noted he never put on his seatbelt, and could have been ""thrown through the damn windshield trying to chase this joker,"" according to the transcript.

Bryan noticed Arbery stop to catch his breath. 
""When I rounded the corner out there, it was almost like the Black guy was tired of running,"" Bryan told Minshew. Bryan also told the officer that Arbery tried to open his truck door at one point.

(Reuters) - The Biden administration told a court on Monday it has clear authority to impose a COVID-19 vaccine rule on employers with at least 100 staff and that a court's order on Saturday blocking the rule could cost dozens or even hundreds of lives daily.
People are increasingly returning to work and they risk accelerating the spread of COVID-19 without the rule, said the filing in the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals by government lawyers.
""With the reopening of workplaces and the emergence of the highly transmissible Delta variant, the threat to workers is ongoing and overwhelming,"" said the filing.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) last week announced the rule, which also provides for a testing and masking alternative to vaccination and a Jan. 4 deadline. The agency said it was necessary to prevent 250,000 hospitalizations.
Republican governors, trade groups, private employers and religious organizations sued in various federal courts of appeal, arguing the administration overstepped its authority.
On Saturday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans suspended the rule, citing ""grave statutory and constitutional"" issues.
The government filing was in response to a request by the plaintiffs for an injunction permanently blocking the rule. The government lawyers said that request was a premature.

The government lawyers noted that various cases that have been filed must be consolidated in one venue and it remains unclear which court will hear the cases. 
A White House press secretary on Monday urged employers to push ahead with vaccinations despite the legal challenges.

Marijuana Moment reported that the bill attempts to mark a compromise measure that would not be as far-reaching as more comprehensive bills others in Congress have been seeking.
Aides to Mace were not immediately available for comment and Reuters has not confirmed either the contents of a potential bill she might be working on or whether she is close to introducing any such bill.
Eighteen U.S. states, most recently Connecticut in June, as well as the District of Columbia, have legalized the recreational use of marijuana. Marijuana, which remains prohibited by federal law, has been approved for medical use in 36 states and the District of Columbia.
On Friday, Marijuana Moment reported that a draft of the ""States Reform Act"" legislation was being circulated, with a final version being readied within weeks.
Cannabis stocks advanced on Monday after reports of legislation being drafted.
Mace is a first-term House member. According to Marijuana Moment, her bill would put the interstate regulation of marijuana under the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which is an agency within the Treasury Department. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also would have a limited role in regulating products, according to the report.

Recreational cannabis use would be limited to those 21 and older and much like federal controls on alcohol, there would be advertising restrictions on marijuana.
There are few legislative weeks remaining in this session of the deeply divided Congress and it was unclear how much lawmakers will be able to get done once the 2022 midterm election campaigns get started early next year.

""For everybody watching at home right now, I want everybody to feel how we do it in Houston real quick,"" Scott told the audience moments before the tragedy unfolded, according to video of the concert posted online.
An aerial shot from the video showed a tightly knit tangle of concert-goers about 18 minutes into footage that was uploaded by a YouTube user but later removed for copyright violation by Saturday morning.
""I wanna see some ragers, man. Who wanna rage?"" Scott called out to the audience less than a half hour into his performance before the sold out crowd at Houston's NRG Park, according to the videos of the concert. 
Audience members could be seen jumping and swaying to the music, with some body-surfing above the crowd, according to the videos, which carried an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Music watermark. 
At around the half hour mark in the footage uploaded to YouTube, Scott pauses the show for the first time: ""There's an ambulance in the ... whoah whoah,"" he said. In an aerial shot, the white top of what appears to be an emergency vehicle could be seen swallowed up in the crowd. 
Moments later, Scott continues the show, re-energizing the audience: ""Two hands to the sky, I want to make this ... ground shake."" 
But less than fifteen minutes later, he stops the show again. 
""We need somebody to help, somebody passed out right here. ... Don't touch him, don't touch him, everybody just back up. Security, somebody help, jump in real quick,"" Scott calls out as yellow-clad security guards below him appear to be trying to pull people from the crowd. 
The show continues moments later. 
Again, Scott calls on the audience to make the ""earth quake,"" before sharing the stage with Canadian rapper, songwriter and actor Drake toward the end of the concert. 

In a social media post on Saturday morning, Scott said he was ""absolutely devastated"" by what happened, would support the police as they investigate the incident, and wanted to help the community heal.
""My prayers go out to the families and all those impacted,"" he wrote. ""Love You All.""

For nearly two years, the unprecedented restrictions have prevented families from gathering in person to celebrate weddings, grieve at funerals, or meet new babies.

KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) - When George Zimmerman faced life in prison for killing Trayvon Martin, his lawyers chose not to have him testify, a decision some legal experts say contributed to his acquittal in 2013 in the last highly divisive civilian self-defense trial.
Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager on trial for killing two protesters and wounding a third in Wisconsin last year, appears set to try a different tack. His lawyer, Mark Richards, said in court last week that he would take the stand in his own defense. 
Legal experts say it is obviously risky for Rittenhouse to give evidence. For starters, it would open him up to wide-ranging cross-examination about his past statements and actions.
""The annals of criminal law are full of cases where defendants insisted on taking the stand and paid the price,"" Daniel Medwed, a professor of criminal law at Northeastern University.
For example, California woman Jodi Arias was convicted in 2013 of murdering her ex-boyfriend and sentenced to life without parole, after testifying that she had done so in self-defense. 
The potential upside for Rittenhouse is that jurors would be able to hear in his own words why he believed he had to shoot for his own safety.
Rittenhouse, 18, is charged with reckless and intentional homicides in the killing of Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and attempted homicide for wounding Gaige Grosskreutz, now 27, with a bullet to the arm.
Like Zimmerman, Rittenhouse is a divisive figure. He is a hero to some conservatives who believe in unfettered gun rights and see the shootings as justified, while many on the political left have labeled him a vigilante killer.
If convicted, he faces a sentence of life in prison. His lawyers have said they will show Rittenhouse acted in self-defense: that he fired the deadly shots out of fear for his own life during chaotic protests that were sparked by the police shootings of a Black man in Kenosha.
Rittenhouse's lawyers may ultimately decide that putting him on the stand is not worth the risk, especially if the trial appears to be moving in their favor.
During the first week of the trial, they elicited testimony from multiple witnesses supporting their argument that Rosenbaum provoked the teen, a critical element towards justifying the use of deadly force.
The exact number of criminal defendants who take the stand at their trials is not clear. One study, published in the Cornell Law Review in 2009 by professors Theodore Eisenberg and Valerie Hans, found that in 300 criminal trials in four counties, about half of defendants testified.
They found that 60% of defendants without criminal records testified, compared to 45% of those with criminal records, which the authors said likely reflected defendants' worry that their records would be used to undermine them. About 77% of defendants who testified were convicted, compared to about 72% of those who did not.
Though Rittenhouse did not have a criminal record before the shootings on Aug. 25, 2020, Medwed said attacks on cross-examination could extend to ""any instances where Rittenhouse has lied, or is rumored to have lied."" For that reason, Medwed said, lawyers often counsel their clients against testifying.
Still, he said, the risk of testifying can be worthwhile because jurors ""naturally want to hear the other side,"" even though a defendant has no legal obligation to prove innocence. That may apply especially when a defendant, like Rittenhouse, is asserting self-defense.
""In a self-defense case, it is often extremely hard for the defendant to win without testifying simply because there is no other way for the jurors to learn about the circumstances that led the defendant to think that self-protective force was necessary,"" said Michael O'Hear, a professor at Marquette Law School.
Another key factor is more subjective: will the jury like the defendant?
Don West, one of Zimmerman's trial lawyers, said the defense decided they did not need Zimmerman's testimony because forensic evidence and statements Zimmerman had made to police were enough to support his case.
But West also said he believed Zimmerman would not have been treated fairly had he taken the stand.
""He was reviled. He was the most hated man for a long time,"" West said. ""The focus would have been so intense on him that he wouldn't have gotten the benefit of any doubt.""
On Feb. 26, 2012, Zimmerman, who was then a neighborhood watch captain in a gated community in Sanford, Florida, fatally shot Martin after the teen's trip to a convenience store to buy snacks. The incident helped spark the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement.

Patrick Cafferty, a criminal defense attorney in Wisconsin, said he thinks Rittenhouse will testify. He said he saw value in the teen telling the jury directly that he feared for his life. 
""I think the reward outweighs the risk,"" Cafferty said.

Fearing retaliation by the authorities for his work, Gaston decided to flee, heading to the U.S.-Mexico border to seek asylum in the United States. On Aug. 8, he waded across the Rio Grande into Texas, hoping to surrender to U.S border officials. 
Instead he was arrested by Texas state troopers, court records show. It was one of roughly 1,600 trespassing arrests of recent border-crossers in Texas since July under an immigration crackdown by Republican Governor Greg Abbott, dubbed Operation Lone Star. 
Abbott has said the administration of Democratic President Joe Biden promotes a ""catastrophic open border"" policy culminating in record crossings that have stoked local anger this year. Two Texas counties - Val Verde and Kinney - have rallied to the governor's call for local police to arrest migrants for criminal trespassing.
Immigration advocates say Abbott is improperly taking immigration enforcement, a federal responsibility, into his own hands. They have also raised concerns about migrants being held for months in jail while waiting for their case to be heard. 
But many of the trespassing cases appear to be falling apart on their own, a Reuters review found. Defense lawyers and at least one county prosecutor have cited problems with many of the cases, including imprecise details of the alleged misdemeanors on charging documents and lack of clarity about whether migrants were properly given notice that they were about to potentially trespass. 
In Val Verde county, where Gaston crossed, County Attorney David Martinez told Reuters his office has declined to pursue around 105 cases out of 231 migrant trespassing arrests turned over to his office as of late October. 
""Where I can determine that the violation appears to be as simple as someone walking across somebody's property to get to a public road area, and they've not damaged a fence, they've not harassed anyone,"" Martinez, a Democrat in a bilingual and heavily Hispanic county, said, ""they deserve to be let out."" He said migrants are often looking for law enforcement so they can ask about submitting an asylum request. 
There was no immediate response to Reuters requests for data on the outcomes of cases that have gone before judges in the county.
WEEKS BEHIND BARS 
Gaston was held in a Texas state prison in the town of Dilley for a month until Martinez dropped his case, citing his legal right to request asylum. Gaston said he spent another three weeks in custody of U.S. federal immigration agencies before being released on Sept. 29 so he can pursue his claims in immigration court. 
""I had never been detained, least of all in a high-security prison. It's treatment for a criminal, not a migrant,"" said Gaston, now in Florida. He asked that he only be identified by his first name to protect his wife and children still in Venezuela. 
The bulk of the 1,600 trespassing arrests statewide have been in Val Verde's neighboring Kinney County, a smaller and more conservative county where officials said they have more than 1,000 active cases. 
Some of the same concerns about the legal validity of the charges have also emerged there. 
Kristin Etter, a lawyer with Texas RioGrande Legal Aid, said all of the more than 100 charges brought in Kinney County that her group has seen had ""defective"" elements, including lack of basic details such as where the offense was allegedly committed.
Kinney County Attorney Brent Smith disputed that, saying the issue is that judges assigned to the cases have asked for more information than is typically requested for criminal trespass. 
""We expect to refile all of the cases we can,"" said Smith, a Republican. 
County Judge Tully Shahan did not respond to requests for comment on case outcomes. 
The Kinney County sheriff, Brad Coe, stressed that local landowners were tired of dealing with what he said was trash and cut fences left behind by growing numbers of crossing migrants. This fiscal year, 1.7 million migrants were encountered at the southwest border, the highest number ever recorded, though many may be repeat crossers.
The Texas Department of Public Safety said it was up to prosecutors whether to pursue a case and added that the department remained committed to Operation Lone Star. Abbott's office said in a statement that Texas would continue to invest resources in securing the border. 

A two-term Republican, Abbott is seeking to build on former Republican President Donald Trump's anti-immigration legacy ahead of unexpectedly competitive Republican primaries in March 2022 and a gubernatorial vote in the state in November.
""We are the first & last line of defense at our border,"" Abbott wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Tuesday.

681,"<span>Nov 08, 2021 01:41PM ET</span>","MOSCOW (Reuters) - A top Russian human rights lawyer who defended the Anti-Corruption Foundation of jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny was added to the Justice Ministry's list of ""foreign agents"" on Monday.
Ivan Pavlov and four other lawyers were placed on the list, now comprising 93 names, of rights activists, journalists, media outlets and others who the ministry says are receiving foreign funding to carry out political activity.
Those listed are subjected to stringent financial reporting requirements and obliged to preface anything they publish with a disclaimer stating they are foreign agents, a term with negative connotations suggestive of spying.
On his social media channel, Pavlov greeted it as a badge of honour.
""To become a 'foreign agent' today is almost like receiving a state prize for special services in the area of freedom of speech and information,"" he said. ""The long list of honorees includes so many brilliant journalists and rights defenders that it would even be kind of hurtful not to be one of them.""
Pavlov came under criminal investigation in April after he was accused of disclosing classified information in his defence of former journalist Ivan Safronov, who is being held on treason charges that he denies.
Earlier this year, Pavlov led the defence of Navalny's political network at a series of hearings that were closed to the public, which resulted in the groups being banned as ""extremist"".

Navalny himself is in jail for parole violations over an embezzlement case he says was trumped up. He was arrested in Moscow this year after flying back from Germany where he had been recovering from a nerve agent poisoning in Russia.
The Kremlin rejects the idea that media are being persecuted and says the ""foreign agent"" legislation is needed to protect Russia from foreign meddling.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices on Monday appeared reluctant to block religious discrimination claims brought by three Muslim men from California who accused the FBI of illegally conducting surveillance on them following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.
The justices heard about two hours of arguments in the FBI's appeal of a lower court's 2019 ruling that let various claims made by the men proceed in the lawsuit. Some of the nine justices seemed inclined to rule narrowly in favor of the FBI without tossing out all the claims.
The justices must decide whether to reject the bulk of the claims based on the government's so-called state secrets privilege, a legal doctrine sometimes asserted when national security interests are invoked. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2020 ruled against the FBI on that point, though the Supreme Court could overturn that decision.
Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch said there is ""a pretty good argument"" that the government is using the state secrets privilege as a way to block the lawsuit without giving the allegations a full airing.
Liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said it would be premature to dismiss the claims without the trial judge getting a chance to properly review certain documents related to the case.
""My point is there should be a way to look at the information ... and decide what to do,"" Breyer said.
A ruling is due by the end of June.
The 2011 lawsuit accused the FBI of infiltrating mainstream mosques in Southern California and targeting Muslim Americans for surveillance because of their religion. It accused the FBI of engaging in religious discrimination https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-takes-up-fbi-bid-block-muslim-civil-rights-suit-2021-06-07 in violation of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment by targeting Muslims, as well as violating the Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures. 
The plaintiffs are: Eritrean-born U.S. citizen Yassir Fazaga, an imam at the Orange County Islamic Foundation in Mission Viejo; native-born U.S. citizen Ali Uddin Malik, who attended the Islamic Center of Irvine; and Yasser Abdel Rahim, a U.S. permanent resident from Egypt who also attended the Islamic Center of Irvine. They are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and others.
The lawsuit focuses upon a 14-month period in 2006 and 2007 when the FBI paid an informant named Craig Monteilh to gather information on Muslims as part of a post-Sept. 11 counterterrorism investigation. Monteilh met with Muslims in southern California, adopted a Muslim name and said he wanted to convert to Islam, according to court papers. Monteilh also recorded conversations and conducted surveillance, according to court papers.
The arrangement unraveled when Monteilh started making statements about wanting to take violent action. Community members reported him to the local police and obtained a restraining order against him, according to court papers.
In a 2012 ruling, a federal judge dismissed the claims against the FBI, determining that they were barred under the state secrets privilege. The judge did permit claims accusing some individual FBI agents of violating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, known as FISA, which regulates how the government conducts electronic surveillance.

The 9th Circuit ruled that the religious claims should instead be analyzed under a section of the FISA law that lets judges review the legality of surveillance. The 9th Circuit also allowed the unlawful search claims, not at issue before the Supreme Court, to move forward.
The Supreme Court in October heard arguments https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-supreme-court-justices-ask-why-guantanamo-detainee-cannot-testify-2021-10-06 in another case involving the state secrets privilege. In that case, the government is seeking to prevent two former CIA contractors from being questioned in a criminal investigation in Poland over their role in interrogating a suspected high-ranking al Qaeda figure who was repeatedly subjected to waterboarding, a form of simulated drowning widely considered to be torture.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ghislaine Maxwell plans at her criminal trial to challenge prosecution claims that she ""groomed"" underage girls for the late financier Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse, and to offer testimony that her accusers might have faulty memories.
According to a letter from Maxwell's lawyers made public on Monday, a former president of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law would testify that Maxwell's alleged effort to win her accusers' trust did not automatically reflect an intent they be abused.
The letter said the former president, Park Dietz, would testify that the suggestion Maxwell committed ""grooming-by-proxy"" - by recruiting underage girls to give sexualized massages to Epstein - had no support in the scientific community.
It also said Elizabeth Loftus, a psychologist specializing in memory issues, would testify about ""false memories"" of sexual abuses that people could describe on the witness stand with ""confidence, detail, and emotion,"" without deliberately lying.
A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in Manhattan, whose office is prosecuting Maxwell, declined to comment.
The letter from Maxwell's lawyer Jeffrey Pagliuca outlines possible defenses to charges the British socialite helped recruit and groom four underage girls for Epstein to abuse from 1994 to 2004, and engaged in sex trafficking of the fourth girl.
Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty. A hearing on admitting expert testimony is scheduled for Wednesday. The trial begins on Nov. 29 and may last six weeks.
Epstein, a convicted sex offender, killed himself at age 66 in a Manhattan jail in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. A medical examiner called the death a suicide.

Pagliuca said Dietz could also testify about how Epstein, like others with ""great power and wealth,"" might have radiated a ""Halo effect"" that let him surround himself with people who served his needs. 
""The materials reviewed reflect that Jeffrey Epstein was a brilliant man who was flawed by enduring personality traits ... found among those with antisocial, narcissistic, borderline, and histrionic personality disorders,"" the letter said.

684,"<span>Nov 08, 2021 12:41PM ET</span>","BAGHDAD (Reuters) - A drone attack that targeted the Iraqi prime minister on Sunday was carried out by at least one Iran-backed militia, Iraqi security officials and militia sources said, weeks after pro-Iran groups were routed in elections they say were rigged.
But the neighbouring Islamic Republic is unlikely to have sanctioned the attack as Tehran is keen to avoid a spiral of violence on its western border, the sources and independent analysts said.
Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi escaped unhurt when three drones carrying explosives were launched at his residence in Baghdad. Several of his bodyguards were injured.
The incident whipped up tensions in Iraq, where powerful Iran-backed paramilitaries are disputing the result of a general election last month that dealt them a crushing defeat at the polls and greatly reduced their strength in parliament.
Many Iraqis fear that tension among the main Shi'ite Muslim groups that dominate government and most state institutions, and also boast paramilitary branches, could spiral into broad civil conflict if further such incidents occur.
Baghdad's streets were emptier and quieter than usual on Monday, and additional military and police checkpoints in the capital appeared intent on keeping a lid on tensions.
Iraqi officials and analysts said the attack was meant as a message from militias that they are willing to resort to violence if excluded from the formation of a government, or if their grip on large areas of the state apparatus is challenged.
""It was a clear message of, 'We can create chaos in Iraq - we have the guns, we have the means',"" said Hamdi Malik, a specialist on Iraq’s Shi’ite Muslim militias at the Washington Institute.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack. Iran-backed militia groups did not immediately comment and the Iranian government did not respond to requests for comment. 
Two regional officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said Tehran had knowledge about the attack before it was carried out, but that Iranian authorities had not ordered it.
Militia sources said the commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards overseas Quds Force travelled to Iraq on Sunday after the attack to meet paramilitary leaders and urge them to avoid any further escalation of violence.
Two Iraqi security officials, speaking to Reuters on Monday on condition of anonymity, said the Kataib Hezbollah and Asaib Ahl al-Haq groups carried out the attack in tandem. 
A militia source said that Kataib Hezbollah was involved and that he could not confirm the role of Asaib.
Neither group commented for the record.
INTRA-SHI'ITE TENSIONS
The main winner from the election, Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, is a rival of the Iran-backed groups who, unlike them, preaches Iraqi nationalism and opposes all foreign interference, including American and Iranian.
Malik said the drone strike indicated that the Iran-backed militias are positioning themselves in opposition to Sadr, who also boasts a militia - a scenario that would hurt Iran's influence and therefore would likely be opposed by Tehran.
""I don't think Iran wants a Shi'ite-Shi'ite civil war. It would weaken its position in Iraq and allow other groups to grow stronger,"" he said.
Many Iran-aligned militias have watched Sadr's political rise with concern, fearing he may strike a deal with Kadhimi and moderate Shi'ites allies, and even minority Sunni Muslims and Kurds, that would freeze them out of power. 
The Iran-backed groups, which like patron Iran are Shi'ite, regard Kadhimi as both Sadr's man and friendly towards Tehran's arch-foe the United States.
Iran-backed militias have led cries of fraud in the Oct. 10 election but offered no evidence. Since then their supporters have staged weeks of protests near Iraqi government buildings. 
MADE IN IRAN
One of the Iraqi security officials said the drones used were of the ""quadcopter"" type and that each was carrying one projectile containing high explosives capable of damaging buildings and armoured vehicles.

The official added that these were the same type of Iranian-made drones and explosives used in attacks this year on U.S. forces in Iraq, which Washington blames on Iran-aligned militias including Kataib Hezbollah.
The United States last month targeted Iran's drone programme with new sanctions, saying Tehran's elite Revolutionary Guards had deployed drones against U.S. forces, Washington's regional allies and international shipping.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Olympic champion Peres Jepchirchir won the 50th running of the New York City Marathon on Sunday, surviving a thrilling three-way battle before sprinting for the finish line, and fellow Kenyan Albert Korir won the men's race.
Jepchirchir is the first athlete to pick up Olympic gold and win the famed five-borough race in the same year as she crossed the finishing line in two hours, 22 minutes and 39 seconds, with compatriot Viola Cheptoo and Ethiopian Ababel Yeshaneh finishing second and third respectively.
""After I won Olympic marathon I was not expecting to win,"" said Jepchirchir, who had just 13 weeks in between the Games and New York. ""I tried my best to make sure I complete my workouts, my preparations... I'm so happy today.""
American Molly Seidel, who took home the bronze from the Tokyo Games, finished fourth and disclosed after the race that she broke two of her ribs a month ago and had considered withdrawing.
""Probably two weeks ago it was extremely painful and it was hindering my ability to do anything,"" said Seidel.
Korir, who finished second in 2019, was trailing 52 seconds behind the leaders at the halfway point but had established a 17-second lead through the 35-kilometre mark. 
He leapt into the air as he broke the tape in 2:08:22 in Central Park, with Moroccan Mohamed El Aaraby finishing 44 seconds behind and Italian Eyob Faniel finishing third.
""In 2021 we had some training, some races were cancelled, but we keep on training,"" said Korir, who did not compete last year. ""When I had a chance to race in New York… I put more effort.""
The temperature hovered around 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.44°C) on Staten Island at the start of the marathon at 8 a.m. ET, after going on hiatus for a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Swiss Marcel Hug won the men's wheelchair division for the fourth time in 1:31:24 and Paralympic champion Madison de Rozario was the first Australian to win the women's wheelchair race, finishing in 1:51:01.
Sunday's race went off 13 weeks after the Tokyo Games and capped a chaotic year for the marathon majors after London and Boston were moved from their traditional April dates to October due to the pandemic.

Hug, who picked up his second successive Paralympic marathon gold in Tokyo, has enjoyed a blockbuster 2021, also winning the Boston Marathon and Berlin Marathon.
""It's definitely a crazy season,"" said Hug. ""The toughest season I've had so far.""

Aug. 23, 2020 - A white police officer responding to a domestic dispute in Kenosha shoots Jacob Blake seven times at close range, paralyzing the Black man and setting off protests.
Aug. 25, 2020 - As Kenosha braces for a third night of protests, Rittenhouse, then 17, takes his rifle and joins other armed men on the streets. Rittenhouse says he was asked to help guard a used-car dealership. Shortly before midnight, Rittenhouse fatally shoots Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, after Rosenbaum appears to have chased him and tried to grab his rifle, according to video evidence. As he runs down the street, Rittenhouse shoots and kills Anthony Huber, 26, who was swinging a skateboard at him, and shoots Gaige Grosskreutz, now 27, in the arm. Grosskreutz, who was holding a pistol at the time of the shooting, survives. 
Aug. 27-28, 2020 - Kenosha County district attorney charges Rittenhouse with six criminal counts, including reckless and intentional homicides.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) -Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi escaped unharmed from an armed drone assassination attempt in Baghdad, officials said on Sunday, in an incident that raised tension in Iraq weeks after a general election disputed by Iran-backed militia groups.
Kadhimi appeared in a video footage published by his office on Sunday chairing a meeting with top security commanders to discuss the drone attack.
""The cowardly terrorist attack that targeted the home of the prime minister last night with the aim of assassinating him, is a serious targeting of the Iraqi state by criminal armed groups,"" his office said in a statement after the meeting. 
Six of Kadhimi's guards outside his residence in the fortified Green Zone were wounded, security sources told Reuters.
Three drones were used in the attack, including two that were downed by security forces while a third drone hit the residence, state news agency INA quoted an interior ministry spokesperson as saying.
A spokesperson for the armed forces commander in chief said that after the attack the security situation was stable in the Green Zone, which houses the residence, government buildings and foreign embassies.
No group immediately claimed responsibility.
The attack came two days after clashes in Baghdad between government forces and supporters of Iran-backed political parties that lost dozens of parliamentary seats after an Oct. 10 general election. Most of the parties have armed wings.
Kadhimi ordered a probe https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/baghdad-clashes-hurt-30-iran-aligned-parties-dispute-iraq-vote-results-2021-11-05 into the deaths and injuries of demonstrators and security forces in those clashes. 
President Barham Salih condemned the attack as a heinous crime against Iraq. ""We cannot accept that Iraq will be dragged into chaos and a coup against its constitutional system,"" he said in a tweet.
Shi'ite Muslim cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, whose party was the biggest winner in last month's election, called the attack a terrorist act against Iraq's stability that aimed to ""return Iraq to a state of chaos to be controlled by non-state forces"".
The United States, United Nations, Saudi Arabia and Iran condemned the attack.
DAMAGE TO RESIDENCE
Video released by the prime minister's office showed damage to parts of the residence, unexploded ordnance on the roof, and a damaged SUV vehicle parked in the garage.
Security forces retrieved the remains of a small explosive-laden drone, a security official with knowledge of the attack told Reuters.
""It's premature now to say who carried out the attack,"" the official said on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to comment on security details.
The Iraqi military said in a statement the attack targeted Kadhimi's residence and that he was in ""good health,"" giving no further detail. 
Two government officials said Kadhimi's residence was hit by at least one explosion.
Western diplomats based nearby in the Green Zone said they heard explosions and gunfire.
U.S. CONDEMNATION
The United States offered assistance with the investigation.
""The perpetrators of this terrorist attack on the Iraqi state must be held accountable. I condemn in the strongest terms those using violence to undermine Iraq’s democratic process,"" U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement, praising Kadhimi's call for ""calm, restraint and dialogue.""
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on Iraqis ""to exercise utmost restraint and reject all violence and any attempts to destabilize Iraq,"" his spokesperson said, adding that Gutteres urged all sides to resolve differences through dialogue.
Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry said the attack was a ""cowardly terrorist act"", Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya TV reported. Iran's top security official, Ali Shamkhani, condemned the attack, calling it ""a new sedition"" in a tweet.
The groups leading protests about the Oct. 10 vote are heavily armed Iran-backed militias that lost much of their parliamentary power in the election. They have alleged voting and vote-counting irregularities, allegations rejected by Iraqi election officials.
Demonstrations by their supporters turned violent on Friday when protesters pelted police with stones near the Green Zone, injuring several officers.
The police responded with tear gas and live gunfire, killing at least one demonstrator, according to security and hospital sources in Baghdad.
Analysts say the election results reflected anger towards the Iran-backed armed groups, which are widely accused of involvement in the killing of nearly 600 protesters who took the street in separate, anti-government demonstrations in 2019.

Heads of various political parties, most of which have armed wings and are aligned with Iran, denounced the drone attack and called on the government to investigate and hold the perpetrators to account.
A security official from the Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah group in Iraq dismissed suggestions on Sunday that Iraqi groups were behind the attack on Kadhimi.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's military has built mockups in the shape of a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier and other U.S. warships, possibly as training targets, in the desert of Xinjiang, satellite images by Maxar showed on Sunday.
These mockups reflect China's efforts to build up anti-carrier capabilities, specifically against the U.S. Navy, as tensions remain high with Washington over Taiwan and the South China Sea.
The satellite images showed a full-scale outline of a U.S. carrier and at least two Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers had been built at what appears to be a new target range complex in the Taklamakan Desert.
The images also showed a 6-meter-wide rail system with a ship-sized target mounted on it, which experts say could be used to simulate a moving vessel.
The complex has been used for ballistic missile testing, the U.S. Naval Institute reported https://news.usni.org/2021/11/07/china-builds-missile-targets-shaped-like-u-s-aircraft-carrier-destroyers-in-remote-desert, quoting geospatial intelligence company All Source Analysis.
For a graphic, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/3wmFA9i
China's anti-ship missile programs are overseen by the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF). China's defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
According to the Pentagon's latest annual report on China's military, the PLARF conducted its first confirmed live-fire launch into the South China Sea in July 2020, firing six DF-21 anti-ship ballistic missiles into the waters north of the Spratly Islands, where China has territorial disputes with Taiwan and four Southeast Asian countries.
The tests at sea may have shown China ""they are still far from creating an accurate ASBM,"" said Collin Koh, a research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. ""I don't think the desert targets are going to be the final stage. It's meant for further refinement.""
An anti-ship ballistic missile test in the desert would not reflect the realistic conditions of a marine environment, which could affect sensors and targeting, but would allow China to carry out the tests more securely, Koh said.
""The best way to test it and keep it out of the prying eyes of the U.S. military and intelligence assets is to do it inland,"" he said.

Neighbouring countries, concerned about the missiles hitting other ships around the target, might also object to China's testing at sea, he added.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in July this year that the United States will defend the Philippines if it comes under attack in the South China Sea and warned China to cease its ""provocative behaviour"".

SAN JOSE (Reuters) -Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega was set to win re-election on Sunday after jailing top rivals and criminalizing most dissent, following a vote that the United States said was a sham whose outcome had been long predetermined.
Costa Rica, the country's southern neighbor, also rejected the election even before preliminary results were announced.
Polls in Nicaragua closed at 6 p.m. (0000 GMT). Lines of voters had formed in the capital, Managua, at some polling places in the morning, but then eased considerably, consistent with expectations of a historically low turnout. 
Ortega, 75, a onetime revolutionary who helped depose the right-wing Somoza family dictatorship in the late 1970s, is already the Americas' longest-serving leader, with 15 consecutive years in power. He has ruled alongside his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo, 70, the government's official spokesperson, since early 2017.
Seated next to her on Sunday afternoon at an event broadcast by state television, an open-collared Ortega hailed the election as a victory over terrorism delivered by the ""immense majority of Nicaraguans,"" before launching into his critics. 
""They didn't want us to be able to hold these elections,"" he said, referring to his domestic opponents and their foreign backers. ""They are demons who don't want peace for our people and instead opt for slander and disqualifications. Why? So that Nicaragua is embroiled in violence.""
But U.S. President Joe Biden ripped into the Nicaraguan leader, saying in a statement issued before results were announced that Ortega and Murillo were ""no different from the Somoza family"" and had orchestrated a ""pantomime election that was neither free nor fair, and most certainly not democratic.""
Ortega was president in the 1980s before losing in a 1990 upset. He returned to the top job in 2007.
Since May, Ortega's police have imprisoned dozens of leading opposition figures, including seven presidential hopefuls, business leaders, journalists and even some of his old rebel allies.
Last week, U.S. officials said new sanctions were being considered against the couple's government, a sentiment echoed by European Union leaders, in addition to a future review of Nicaragua's status in the CAFTA regional trade pact. 
Biden called for Ortega to take immediate steps to restore democracy and to release detained opposition figures.
""Until then, the United States, in close coordination with other members of the international community, will use all diplomatic and economic tools at our disposal to support the people of Nicaragua and hold accountable the Ortega-Murillo government and those that facilitate its abuses,"" he said.
Costa Rica's government was the first from Central America to weigh in, rejecting the process as undemocratic and calling on Ortega's government to ""immediately free"" all political prisoners and restore their civil rights in a statement released Sunday night.
MIGRATION RISK
Ortega's only opposition on the ballot comes from five little-known candidates of small allied parties with the strongman's Sandinista movement. About 4.5 million Nicaraguans were eligible to vote.
Up for grabs as well on Sunday's ballot were 92 seats in the unicameral Congress, also firmly controlled by Ortega's allies.
In Costa Rica, where tens of thousands of Nicaraguan exiles have fled in recent years, about 2,000 anti-Ortega demonstrators marched along a main thoroughfare in downtown San Jose chanting: ""Long live a free Nicaragua"" as festive marimba music blared from speakers.
""We have a dictatorship, like Cuba or Venezuela"" said Carmen Vivas, a Nicaraguan who lives in Costa Rica and participated in the march. ""We know these elections don't represent any kind of future for Nicaragua,"" she said.
Prolonged social and political unrest is seen driving the already growing ranks of Central American migrants, both south to Costa Rica, or north to the United States.
Nicaraguans reaching the U.S. border this year have already hit a high of about 50,000, according to official data.
Jose Miguel Vivanco, the Americas head for Human Rights Watch, dismissed the election as a ""farce"" in posts on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
He predicted Ortega would extend his rule ""by force of repression, censorship and fear,"" and called on other countries to confront his government.
""It's essential to redouble international pressure to demand the release of political prisoners, and to re-establish democracy in Nicaragua,"" he said.
Ortega's government took an especially repressive turn in 2018, when it quashed largely peaceful protests by those initially upset over spending cuts, killing more than 300 people and wounding thousands more.
Last year, the ruling party enacted a law that prohibits speech that Ortega's judges deem hurtful to the economy or to ""public order,"" and international journalists have been barred in recent months from entering the country.
One Reuters reporter was turned back by border agents last Friday, while another, a Nicaraguan citizen, was turned away in September.

In a Sunday post on social media, the Ortega-allied electoral authority celebrated more than 200 ""election companions"" from 27 countries plus 600 journalists of all nationalities covering the vote, without providing details.
International observers from the EU and the Organization of American States were not allowed to participate.

(Reuters) -Police at three elite Ivy League universities in New York and Rhode Island gave the all clear and said activities could resume normally at the schools on Sunday after each received separate bomb threats. 
Several buildings were evacuated on the campuses of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and Columbia University in New York City after bomb threats were phoned into each school. 
Hours later, police at each campus said the threats were not credible. 
""Law enforcement has concluded search of the Ithaca campus; no credible threats were found. It is safe to resume all normal activities,"" Cornell University, a school of 21,000 students, said in a tweet. 

It is unclear if the threats were connected. 
On Friday, Yale University, an Ivy League school in New Haven, Connecticut, received bomb threats that were also later found not to be credible.

Some demonstrators denounced the United States, one of the foreign powers that has called for a ceasefire to a year-long war, which has intensified amid advances by rebellious forces in the past week.
The U.N. Security Council, the African Union, and Kenya and Uganda have also called for a ceasefire in the conflict that has killed thousands of people.
Canada, calling the situation in Ethiopia ""rapidly evolving and deteriorating"", has withdrawn the families of its embassy staff and non-essential Canadian employees, the foreign ministry said on Sunday. Its embassy remains open in the capital. 
Abiy's government, which has pledged to keep fighting, said on Friday it had a responsibility to secure the country and urged foreign powers to stand with Ethiopia's democracy.
The state-appointed Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said on Sunday the authorities appeared to be using a state of emergency declared on Tuesday to arrest people based on ethnic identity.
""In some police stations, the families are denied access to the detainees, and they can't deliver food and clothing. On top of that, elders and mothers with children are among the detainees,"" the commission said in a statement.
The government spokesperson Legesse Tulu and federal police spokesperson Jeylan Abdi did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Police spokesperson Fasika Fante denied on Thursday that arrests were ethnically motivated, saying those detained ""directly or indirectly"" backed the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), an outlawed party that was once part of Ethiopia's government and is now battling federal forces.
Some of those gathered for the rally in Meskel Square in Addis Ababa draped themselves in the national flag.
""Shame on you USA,"" read one placard, while another said the United States should stop ""sucking Ethiopia's blood"".
'THEY WILL NEVER SUCCEED'
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration on Tuesday accused Ethiopia of ""gross violations"" of human rights and said it planned to remove the country from a U.S. trade pact.
The conflict in the north of the country started a year ago when forces loyal to the TPLF seized military bases in the Tigray region. In response, Abiy sent troops, who initially drove the TPLF out of the regional capital, Mekelle, but have faced a sharp reversal since June this year.
Some demonstrators voiced anger over a U.S. call for the government and TPLF to negotiate.
""They want to destroy our country like they did to Afghanistan. They will never succeed, we are Ethiopians,"" said 37-year-old Tigist Lemma.
Addis Ababa Mayor Adanech Abiebe addressed protesters and cited Ethiopia's history of resisting colonial power to justify the war.
The conflict has killed thousands of people, forced more than 2 million from their homes and left 400,000 people in Tigray facing famine.
U.N. aid chief Martin Griffiths travelled to Mekelle on Sunday and met women affected by the fighting and humanitarian partners, the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said.
OCHA said he ""engaged with de facto authorities on the need for humanitarian access and protection of civilians through all areas under their control, and respect for humanitarian principles.""
'ASK FOR RECONCILIATION'
A humanitarian source in Ethiopia and one person familiar with the matter told Reuters that the AU's special envoy to the Horn of Africa, Olusegun Obasanjo, was also on the trip.
The AU and government spokesperson Legesse did not respond to a request for comment. TPLF spokesperson Getachew Reda told Reuters that Griffiths and Obasanjo visited Mekelle.
At the Addis Ababa rally, popular musician Tariku Gankisi, whose songs call for Ethiopian unity, urged restraint.
""Let no youth go to the front lines to fight, let the elders go holding the fresh grass and ask for reconciliation,"" Tariku told the crowd, before his microphone was switched off, it was unclear by whom. Fresh grass is a symbol of peace in Ethiopia.
Under a state of emergency declared on Tuesday, the government can order citizens of military age to undergo training and accept military duties.
Reuters has not been able to confirm independently the extent of the TPLF advance. The TPLF and their allies told Reuters last week they were 325 km (200 miles) from the capital. The government accuses the group of exaggerating its gains.

The government has also complained about foreign media coverage of the conflict and some people at the rally held signs denouncing ""fake news"" in Ethiopia.
Billene Seyoum, Abiy's spokesperson, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Saturday: ""Orchestrated media propaganda against Ethiopia is escalating ... Despite it all Ethiopia will overcome!""

TIJUANA (Reuters) - Emboldened by news that the United States and Mexico will reopen shared land-border crossings, hundreds of migrants have arrived at Mexican border cities like Tijuana, hoping the reset will make it easier to cross and seek U.S. asylum.
Starting on Monday, the nearly 2,000-mile (3,200-km) border will be open again to non-essential travel after a 20-month closure aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19. Both countries have succeeded in lowering new infections and vaccinating border communities.
Another drive to enter the United States could increase pressure on Washington to tighten the border after a jump in migrants this year from troubled areas of Central America and the Caribbean tested President Joe Biden.
""I'm going to try. We want to get across the border. I can't be in Mexico anymore. There's a lot of violence here,"" said Andrea Morales, a Guatemalan who has been living in a makeshift camp for a month next to Tijuana's El Chaparral border crossing.
""Four days ago, the government took away our lights and fenced us in like animals. I put my faith in God so I can cross and give my kids a better life,"" Morales said as she stood nursing her baby amid dozens of tents. 
    Local authorities angered migrants last week when they threw away tents and other belongings that had been left in the camp they have occupied since February.
'MISINFORMATION'
Migrant advocates say many people have been misled about what the border restart means for their asylum prospects.
""There's a lot of misinformation. We have explained to them that the reopening of the border is for people who have papers, a visa, to cross and it's not a reopening for people to cross and ask for asylum and humanitarian aid,"" said Jose Garcia, head of migrant shelter Movimiento Juventud 2000 in Tijuana.
""They haven't listened to us and they don't want to wait,"" he added, saying the number of migrants in the shelter had risen by a third since the reopening was announced on Oct. 15.
Mexicans are also arriving.
Many migrants in Tijuana said they were fleeing violence in Mexican states such as Michoacan and Guerrero, and aimed to cross on Monday to ask for asylum.
In 2020, 9,700 Mexicans were displaced by violence, a jump of over a third from the previous year, according to the Geneva-based Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre.

The pandemic, along with a surge in U.S. asylum requests, has meant thousands of migrants spend months in Mexico waiting for a response to their petitions or just a chance to file them. 
    ""I never left with the intention of staying in Mexico. It's like Honduras,"" said Augusto Martinez, a Honduran who arrived in Tijuana three weeks ago with his wife and five children. ""We're definitely going to try and cross.""

It is the latest step in the United Arab Emirates -- where personal status laws on marriage and divorce had been based on Islamic sharia principles, as in other Gulf states -- to maintain its competitive edge as a regional commercial hub.
The decree from Abu Dhabi's Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahayan, who is also president of the UAE federation of seven emirates, said the law covers civil marriage, divorce, alimony, joint child custody and proof of paternity, and inheritance.
It aims to ""enhance the position and global competitiveness of the emirate as one of the most attractive destinations for talent and skills"", WAM said. 
The report described the civil law regulating non-Muslim family matters as being the first of its kind in the world ""in line with international best practices"". 
A new court to handle non-Muslim family matters will be set up in Abu Dhabi and will operate in both English and Arabic.

The UAE last year introduced a number of legal changes at the federal level, including decriminalising premarital sexual relations and alcohol consumption, and cancelling provisions for leniency when dealing with so-called ""honour killings"".
These reforms, alongside measures such as introducing longer-term visas, have been seen as a way for the Gulf state to make itself more attractive for foreign investment, tourism and long-term residency.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government rejected fresh accusations of corruption on Sunday after a newspaper investigation found major donors to his Conservative Party were offered seats in parliament's upper chamber. 
The government has been embroiled in a corruption row over the past week, with Johnson forced to abandoned plans pushed through parliament to protect one of his lawmakers who was found to have broken lobbying rules.
The Sunday Times reported that all but one of the 16 Conservative treasurers over the last two decades had donated more than 3 million pounds ($4.05 million) to the party and then been been offered a seat in the House of Lords.
The role of Conservative treasurer has become the most ennobled job in Britain, the newspaper said, ahead leaders of the country's institutions and charitable organisations and even former prime ministers.
""Boris Johnson's Conservative Party is corrupt, dodgy, sleazy and on the take,"" opposition Labour Party deputy leader Angela Rayner said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Environment minister George Eustice rejected the accusations, telling the BBC: ""They are philanthopsts who give huge amounts to charity, who have been very successful in business and therefore on those grounds ought to be considered for the Lords.""
Eustice also described the furore over Conservative lawmaker Owen Paterson, who quit parliament after the government's U-turn on plans to overhaul the system for combating parliamentary corruption, as a ""storm in a teacup"".
The row has raised fresh questions about Johnson's ethics. He has faced other accusations of wrongdoing, including plans to have party donors secretly contribute to a luxury renovation of his Downing Street flat. Johnson has said the government followed the rules over the refurbishment.
Johnson's personal approval rating has fallen to its lowest level on record, according to an Opinium poll for the Observer newspaper, while the Conservative's lead over Labour has fallen to a single percentage point. 
Parliament is due to hold an emergency debate on standards on Monday.
""The prime minster is trashing the reputation of our democracy and our country,"" Labour leader Keir Starmer told BBC television on Sunday.

""It is a pattern of behaviour from a prime minister who doesn't know how to uphold standards in public life.""

UPALA, Costa Rica (Reuters) - Nicaraguans forced to flee across the country's southern border into Costa Rica expressed a mix of anger, pain and resignation ahead of Sunday's election, where President Daniel Ortega is expected to extend his long rule after cracking down on rivals. 
Francisca Ramirez and over 40 of her relatives belong to a diaspora of tens of thousands of exiles in Costa Rica and beyond that could grow if Ortega tightens his grip.
She fled south three years ago with her husband and six children, fearing she would be imprisoned for protesting against Ortega's rule. Since June, Ortega's police have put opponents behind bars or under house arrest, spurring more to leave https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/lost-hope-ortegas-crackdown-nicaragua-stirs-fast-growing-exodus-2021-09-02. 
Ramirez thought the move would be temporary. But she and some 80 others now live just south of the border in a makeshift compound of wooden homes that appears increasingly permanent.
""Tomorrow there won't be elections... there will be voting imposed by a terrorist,"" said Ramirez, 45. She is helping to bring several hundred people to an anti-Ortega protest in the Costa Rican capital to coincide with voting.
Ortega, a former Marxist guerrilla and Cold War antagonist of the United States, argues he is defending Nicaragua from adversaries plotting with foreign powers to oust him.
Ramirez wants international pressure to make Ortega release political prisoners, dismantle paramilitary forces, let exiles return and for authorities' abuses to be investigated.
If the United States and other world powers do not act, she said, Nicaragua would become ""a total failure.""
On the border near Costa Rica's Pacific coast, Nicaraguan exile Carlos Cardoza, 42, works as a driver.
""There's so much pain, and so much resentment,"" Cardoza said, referring to those killed during the suppression of anti-Ortega protests in 2018 that claimed over 300 lives.
He said five of his six siblings also live in Costa Rica.
Living off the land among turkeys and hens on a dirt road near the town of Upala further east, Ramirez said she and her family had fought a plan to seize their lands for the construction of a trans-oceanic canal championed by Ortega.
Ramirez's husband, Migdonio Lopez, calls the cluster of wooden homes with dirt floors ""little Nicaragua.""

None of it was intended to be permanent.
""When Nicaragua is free,"" the 55-year-old Lopez said, ""the plan is to go back.""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel stepped up its public opposition on Saturday to a plan by President Joe Biden's administration to reopen a U.S. consulate for Palestinians in Jerusalem, suggesting such a mission should be in the occupied West Bank.
Under former President Donald Trump, Washington delighted Israelis and outraged Palestinians by closing the Jerusalem consulate and placing its staff within the U.S. Embassy to Israel that was moved to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv in 2018.
Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state and saw the U.S. initiative to move its embassy as undermining that aspiration. Israel, which captured East Jerusalem in 1967, calls Jerusalem its indivisible capital.
Seeking to repair ties with Palestinians, the Biden administration has said it would reopen the consulate, although it has not given a date.
""My position, and it was presented to the Americans ... is that there is no place for a U.S. consulate which serves the Palestinians in Jerusalem. We are voicing our opinion consistently, quietly, without drama,"" Prime Minister Naftali Bennett told reporters.
Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, speaking next to Bennett, proposed reopening the consulate in the de-facto seat of Palestinian government in Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank.
""If they (the United States) want to open a consulate in Ramallah, we have no problem with that,"" he said.
In Ramallah, the spokesman of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas rejected Lapid's comments.
""We will only accept a U.S. consulate in Jerusalem, the capital of the Palestinian state. That was what the U.S. administration had announced and had committed itself to doing,” Nabil Abu Rudeineh told Reuters.
Spokespeople for the U.S. Embassy did not immediately comment.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last month Washington would ""be moving forward with the process of opening a consulate as part of deepening of those ties with the Palestinians"", although one of his senior staff also said Israel's rejection of the plan was an obstacle.
""My understanding (is) that we need the consent of the host government to open any diplomatic facility,"" Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources Brian McKeon said during a U.S. Senate hearing when queried on the consulate standoff.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden is getting ready to deliver on a key campaign promise by convening a Summit for Democracy: a first-of-its kind gathering of more than 100 countries to help stop democratic backsliding and erosion of rights and freedoms worldwide.
But rights advocates are questioning whether the virtual event can push those world leaders who are invited, some accused of harboring authoritarian tendencies, to take meaningful action.
""If the summit is to be anything more than just another meeting, each attendee, including the United States, will need to follow through on meaningful commitments on democracy and rights issues in the year ahead,"" said Annie Boyajian, vice president for policy and advocacy at Freedom House, a non-profit group specializing in human rights and democracy.
Administration officials say the December event is just the ""launch"" of a longer conversation about democracy and that countries will need to fulfill the reforms they pledged to be invited to the follow-up summit planned next year.
The event - to be held on Dec. 9 and 10 - is a test of Biden's longstanding claim, announced in his first foreign policy address as president in February, that the United States would return to global leadership under his tenure to face down authoritarian forces led by China and Russia.
A tentative invite list first reported by Politico and confirmed by a source familiar with the matter shows that the event will bring together mature democracies such as France and Sweden but also countries including Philippines and Poland, where activists say democracy is under threat. In Asia, some U.S. allies such as Japan and South Korea were invited, while others like Thailand and Vietnam were not.
Representation from the Middle East was slim with Israel and Iraq among the few countries invited and notable U.S. allies such as Egypt and NATO partner Turkey absent from the list.
Rights groups praise Biden's pledge to reinstate the promotion of rights and freedoms as a foreign policy priority, after the disinterested approach of his predecessor Donald Trump, who openly praised strongmen such as Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi and Russian leader Vladimir Putin. 
They also say the invitation to countries with problematic human rights records raises doubts about the credibility of the event, but at the same time illustrates the administration's struggle to balance wider U.S. national security interests, such as countering a rising China, with higher ideals.
""Clearly, strategic considerations about countering China are at play in inviting very troubled, backsliding democracies like India and the Philippines that are in China's neighborhood,"" said Amy Hawthorne, research director at the Project on Middle East Democracy, an advocacy group.
""The same might be true for inviting deeply flawed democracy Iraq, the neighbor of U.S. adversary, the Iranian theocracy,"" she added.
'MAKE CHOICES'
Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, who has in the past stated he does not ""care about human rights"", and Indian President Narendra Modi, who advocacy group Freedom House said is driving India toward authoritarianism, will be among those discussing with Biden how to help democracy flourish globally.
An official at the Philippines' foreign ministry confirmed Duterte was invited to the online forum and said Washington had imposed ""absolutely no conditions"" on his attendance. The country's government was still considering whether to participate, the official said. 
A senior U.S. official involved in the planning of the summit told Reuters that invites were sent to countries with different experiences of democracy from all regions of the world. ""This was not about endorsing, 'You're a democracy, you are not a democracy.' That is not the process we went through,"" the official said.
Biden administration officials say they had to ""make choices"" to ensure regional diversity and broad participation.
Human rights groups said that with only weeks until the summit it was unclear how Washington would monitor implementation of commitments and hold the leaders who participate to their word.
'A PLACE OF HUMILITY'
Poland, which is locked in a feud with the European Union over what Brussels says is democratic backsliding, was invited, but officials there took umbrage at an earlier message from Washington that appeared to place conditions on the invitation, according to a Polish government source.
The earlier email contained a list of suggested actions that would demonstrate Poland's commitment to freedom and democracy, including respect for LGBTQI rights - a major sore point in Washington's dealings with Poland's right-wing government that has moved to restrict gay rights. 
U.S. officials said they did not dictate any conditions but called on invited countries to come forward with commitments to take action.
""The idea has never been to prescribe or to be prescriptive,"" said one of the officials. 

The United States would also make its own commitments, the official added, as Washington faces skepticism about the health of its own democracy. After losing the November 2020 election to Biden, Trump's false claims of fraud paved the way for his supporters' Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, an unprecedented episode that stunned foreign governments and armed authoritarian leaders with cause to question the robustness of American democracy.
""In all of our diplomatic communications around the summit, we are starting from a place of humility and recognizing that no democracy, including of course the United States, is perfect,"" said a second administration official.

DEL RIO, Texas (Reuters) - Gaston, a 57-year-old Venezuelan human rights lawyer, spent years visiting the country's most squalid prisons as he defended students jailed for protesting its socialist government.
Fearing retaliation by the authorities for his work, Gaston decided to flee, heading to the U.S.-Mexico border to seek asylum in the United States. On Aug. 8, he waded across the Rio Grande into Texas, hoping to surrender to U.S border officials. 
Instead he was arrested by Texas state troopers, court records show. It was one of roughly 1,600 trespassing arrests of recent border-crossers in Texas since July under an immigration crackdown by Republican Governor Greg Abbott, dubbed Operation Lone Star. 
Abbott has said the administration of Democratic President Joe Biden promotes a ""catastrophic open border"" policy culminating in record crossings that have stoked local anger this year. Two Texas counties - Val Verde and Kinney - have rallied to the governor's call for local police to arrest migrants for criminal trespassing.
Immigration advocates say Abbott is improperly taking immigration enforcement, a federal responsibility, into his own hands. They have also raised concerns about migrants being held for months in jail while waiting for their case to be heard. 
But many of the trespassing cases appear to be falling apart on their own, a Reuters review found. Defense lawyers and at least one county prosecutor have cited problems with many of the cases, including imprecise details of the alleged misdemeanors on charging documents and lack of clarity about whether migrants were properly given notice that they were about to potentially trespass. 
In Val Verde county, where Gaston crossed, County Attorney David Martinez told Reuters his office has declined to pursue around 105 cases out of 231 migrant trespassing arrests turned over to his office as of late October. 
""Where I can determine that the violation appears to be as simple as someone walking across somebody's property to get to a public road area, and they've not damaged a fence, they've not harassed anyone,"" Martinez, a Democrat in a bilingual and heavily Hispanic county, said, ""they deserve to be let out."" He said migrants are often looking for law enforcement so they can ask about submitting an asylum request. 
There was no immediate response to Reuters requests for data on the outcomes of cases that have gone before judges in the county.
WEEKS BEHIND BARS 
Gaston was held in a Texas state prison in the town of Dilley for a month until Martinez dropped his case, citing his legal right to request asylum. Gaston said he spent another three weeks in custody of U.S. federal immigration agencies before being released on Sept. 29 so he can pursue his claims in immigration court. 
""I had never been detained, least of all in a high-security prison. It's treatment for a criminal, not a migrant,"" said Gaston, now in Florida. He asked that he only be identified by his first name to protect his wife and children still in Venezuela. 
The bulk of the 1,600 trespassing arrests statewide have been in Val Verde's neighboring Kinney County, a smaller and more conservative county where officials said they have more than 1,000 active cases. 
Some of the same concerns about the legal validity of the charges have also emerged there. 
Kristin Etter, a lawyer with Texas RioGrande Legal Aid, said all of the more than 100 charges brought in Kinney County that her group has seen had ""defective"" elements, including lack of basic details such as where the offense was allegedly committed.
Kinney County Attorney Brent Smith disputed that, saying the issue is that judges assigned to the cases have asked for more information than is typically requested for criminal trespass. 
""We expect to refile all of the cases we can,"" said Smith, a Republican. 
County Judge Tully Shahan did not respond to requests for comment on case outcomes. 
The Kinney County sheriff, Brad Coe, stressed that local landowners were tired of dealing with what he said was trash and cut fences left behind by growing numbers of crossing migrants. This fiscal year, 1.7 million migrants were encountered at the southwest border, the highest number ever recorded, though many may be repeat crossers.
The Texas Department of Public Safety said it was up to prosecutors whether to pursue a case and added that the department remained committed to Operation Lone Star. Abbott's office said in a statement that Texas would continue to invest resources in securing the border. 

A two-term Republican, Abbott is seeking to build on former Republican President Donald Trump's anti-immigration legacy ahead of unexpectedly competitive Republican primaries in March 2022 and a gubernatorial vote in the state in November.
""We are the first & last line of defense at our border,"" Abbott wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Tuesday.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) -Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi escaped unharmed in an assassination attempt by armed drone in Baghdad on Sunday, officials said, in an incident that dramatically raises tension in the country weeks after a general election disputed by Iran-backed militia groups.
Six members of Kadhimi's personal protection force stationed outside his residence in the Green Zone were wounded, security sources told Reuters.
Three drones were used in the attack, including two that were intercepted and downed by security forces while a third drone hit the residence, state news agency INA quoted a spokesman for the interior ministry as saying.
A spokesman for the armed forces commander in chief said the security situation was stable inside the fortified Green Zone, which houses the residence, government buildings and foreign embassies, after the drone attack.
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.
It came two days after violent clashes in Baghdad between government forces and supporters of Iran-backed political parties, most of which have armed wings, since those groups lost dozens of seats in parliament after a general election on Oct. 10.
Kadhimi has ordered an investigation into the deaths and injuries of demonstrators and security forces in those clashes. 
President Barham Salih condemned the attack as a heinous crime against Iraq. ""We cannot accept that Iraq will be dragged into chaos and a coup against its constitutional system,"" he said in a tweet.
Shi'ite Muslim cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, whose party was the biggest winner in last month's election, calling the attack a terrorist act against Iraq's stability that aimed to ""return Iraq to a state of chaos to be controlled by non-state forces"".
The U.S. State Department condemned the attack and offered assistance with the investigation.
""This apparent act of terrorism, which we strongly condemn, was directed at the heart of the Iraqi state,"" spokesman Ned Price said in a statement. 
Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry said the attack was a ""cowardly terrorist act"", Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya TV reported.
DAMAGE TO RESIDENCE
Images published by INA showed damage to some parts of the prime minister's residence and a damaged SUV vehicle parked in the garage.
Remains of a small explosive-laden drone used in the attack were retrieved by security forces to be investigated, a security official with knowledge of the attack told Reuters.
""It's premature now to say who carried out the attack,"" the security official on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to comment on security details. 
""We're checking our intelligence reports and waiting for initial investigation results to point the finger at perpetrators.""
The Iraqi military said in a statement the attack targeted Kadhimi's residence and that he was in ""good health"". It provided no further detail. Kadhimi's official Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account said the prime minister was safe, and called for calm.
Two government officials said Kadhimi's residence had been hit by at least one explosion.
Western diplomats based nearby in the Green Zone said they heard explosions and gunfire in the area.
The groups leading protests and complaints about the result of the Oct. 10 vote are heavily armed Iran-backed militias that lost much of their parliamentary power in the election. They have alleged voting and vote-counting irregularities, allegations rejected by the country's election officials.
Demonstrations by their supporters turned violent on Friday when protesters pelted police with stones near the Green Zone, injuring several officers.

The police responded with tear gas and live gunfire, killing at least one demonstrator, according to security and hospital sources in Baghdad.
Independent analysts say the election results were a reflection of anger towards the Iran-backed armed groups, which are widely accused of involvement in the killing of nearly 600 protesters who took the street in separate, anti-government demonstrations in 2019.

Although limited to people who are fully inoculated, the relaxation in the state of New South Wales, home to Sydney, lifts limits on house guests or outdoor gatherings, among other measures. 
""We're leading the nation out of the pandemic,"" said state premier Dominic Perrottet, as he called for a ""final push"" to reach, and even surpass, a milestone of 95% vaccinations. 
Several hundred people held an anti-vaccine protest on Sunday in the state's capital of Sydney, but such opposition is slight in Australia, where polls show vaccination opponents number in the single digits. 
The southeastern state of Victoria recorded the majority of Australia's 1,417 new coronavirus cases, with public health figures showing 10 more deaths.
There were no new infections in the remote Northern Territory, where a snap lockdown was extended until midnight on Monday to tackle a small outbreak in some areas. 
Australia crossed the 80% mark of full inoculations on Saturday. 
""That should give us all confidence in terms of opening up,"" federal finance minister Simon Birmingham told broadcaster Channel 9 in an interview on Sunday. 
Australia eased international border curbs on Monday for the first time during the pandemic, but only for its vaccinated public from states with high levels of inoculation.
However domestic travel is still hindered, as most states and territories keep internal borders shut. Western Australia state will re-open when it hits the 90% level of double vaccine doses, its premier said. 

Despite the Delta outbreaks that brought lockdowns for months in the two largest cities of Sydney and Melbourne, Australia's tally of COVID-19 infections is far lower than many developed nations, at just over 180,000 cases and 1,597 deaths.

The capital Beijing welcomed its first snow of the season 23 days earlier than normal years, while temperatures on Sunday night are expected to fall to their lowest for the period in the past decade.
A cold snap is also sweeping from Beijing to Shanghai to Guangzhou, pushing down temperatures by as much as 14 degrees (25 degrees Fahrenheit) Celsius on Sunday, the weather agency said. 
The cold wave, which could increase the risk of flu, comes just as more than 20 cities in northern China reported COVID-19 cases and sporadic outbreaks in the southwestern - in Chongqing and the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan, since mid-October.

Hundreds of thousands of people came outdoors in Beijing to enjoy snowy tourist spots, such as the Forbidden City and Universal Studios Resort, despite COVID-19 restrictions as the 300-plus members of the Communist Party's Central Committee prepare to gather from Monday to Thursday.
Snow piling up in communities under COVID-19 lockdowns may not be moved outside the control zones, the local government-backed Beijing Daily reported.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -A stampede of fans surging toward the stage during rap star Travis Scott's Astroworld music festival in Houston killed at least eight people and injured dozens more as panic rippled through the crowd of largely young concertgoers, officials said on Saturday.
City Police Chief Troy Finner said his department has opened a criminal investigation by homicide and narcotics detectives following unconfirmed reports that someone in the audience ""was injecting other people with drugs.""
The disaster unfolded at NRG Park at around 9:30 p.m. on Friday during the headline performance by Scott, a Grammy-nominated singer and producer, following what police and members of the crowd described as an escalation of unruly behavior throughout the day.
As fans in the sold-out audience of about 50,000 pressed toward the stage, people began to fall unconscious https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/travis-scotts-astroworld-concert-pauses-then-restarts-amid-deaths-injuries-2021-11-06, some apparently suffering cardiac arrest or other medical issues, officials told reporters outside the venue. Minutes later the chaos was declared a ""mass casualty incident.""
""It happened all at once. It seemed like it just happened ... over the course of just a few minutes,"" said Houston Police Executive Assistant Chief Larry Satterwhite, who was at the front of the event when the situation began.
Satterwhite said he immediately met with promoters and they agreed to halt the show. Officials said the concert was brought to an end by 10:10 p.m.
Finner said that among the ""narratives"" under review by police were reports suggesting ""some individual was injecting other people with drugs.""
One report involved a security officer ""who felt a prick in his neck"" as he was trying to restrain or grab someone and then fell unconscious, only to be revived with a dose of the opioid antidote naloxone, Finner said, citing an account from medical personnel who treated the officer.
Finner said the medical staff also noticed what appeared to be a needle mark on the officer's neck.
It was not clear whether authorities suspected such an episode played a role in the crowd surge, but Finner said, ""we're going to get down to the bottom of it.""
Police were awaiting autopsies to determine the causes of death, but said some victims were trampled.
Scott released a 90-second video on social media late on Saturday, saying that while on stage ""I could just never imagine the severity of the situation.""
City Fire Chief Samuel Peña said it appeared the venue had ample exit routes for fans and that none was obstructed.
Twenty-five people were taken to hospitals by ambulance after the crush began, some of them in cardiac arrest, with 13 still hospitalized on Saturday - five under age 18 - following the discharge of four patients, Mayor Sylvester Turner told reporters. Eight people died. Most ranged in age from 14 to 27, though one victim's age was not immediately known, Turner said.
'IT FELT LIKE A RIOT'
After mobbing entrance gates and merchandise booths early in the day, the crowd grew increasingly unruly https://www.reuters.com/world/us/countdown-clock-choke-points-led-chaos-houston-rap-concert-2021-11-06 as performers took the stage, according to 19-year-old festivalgoer Hamad Al Barrak.
""There were just too many people,' said Al Barrak, who described chaos as he tried to buy festival gear. ""We were all pressed together. You felt like you couldn't breathe.""
Albert Merza, 43, part of a group of eight people from Detroit attending the festival, recounted seeing ""a lot of drinking and crazy behavior.""
""It felt like a riot,"" he said, adding that it appeared about half the crowd were under age 21. ""There were people throwing out stuff, objects flying everywhere.""
Nick Johnson, 17, said he witnessed a steady rise of disruptive behavior before the stampede.
""It was going on for over two hours, and it just got worse and worse,"" he said.
An incident earlier in the day in which fans started ""rushing"" the festival gates was brought under control relatively quickly, said Finner, the police chief, adding it appeared unrelated to the deadly stampede.
Finner said police had 528 officers assigned to the festival on Friday, along with 755 private security personnel.
Throughout the day, 25 arrests were made - one each for marijuana possession and public intoxication and the rest for trespassing, Finner said. Three-hundred people were treated at an on-site medical clinic for various injuries and illnesses, including several apparent drug overdoses, according to Peña.
The venue could have held up to 200,000, but organizers limited the crowd to 50,000, based on ticket sales, Peña said.
'ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED'
Houston-born Scott said he was ""absolutely devastated"" and vowed to support the police as they investigate.""
""My prayers go out to the families and all those impacted,"" Scott wrote https://twitter.com/trvisXX/status/1457018948109705217 on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Peña described how the crush of fans quickly overwhelmed the private medical personnel for the festival, a two-day affair that was scheduled to culminate on Saturday https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/deadly-texas-concert-crush-who-is-travis-scott-what-is-astroworld-2021-11-06, but was canceled after Friday night's tragedy.
Videos posted to social media showed pandemonium as fans and staff tried to bring attention to injured concertgoers. One video showed fans attempting to make camera operators aware of the dangerous situation. Another video showed people waving toward the stage and chanting ""Stop the show!""
The investigation is likely to focus on security and safety protocols. Two weeks ago, another Houston concert was canceled after fans pushed into a Playboi Carti show being held within the same NRG Park complex.
Jennifer Ortega, 22, who arrived at Friday's event at about 1 p.m. said access was orderly at that time. But by 4 p.m. the crowd at the smaller of the festival's two stages ""got pretty reckless,"" with people throwing water bottles. She said she saw about three people leaving the area with bloody noses and missing teeth.
Organizers said they were cooperating with police.
""We are focused on supporting local officials however we can,"" Astroworld Fest, an event organized by Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV), said on Twitter.
Scott stopped multiple times during his 75-minute performance when he spotted fans in distress and asked security to ensure their safety, video posted online showed. Emergency vehicles, lights and alarms flashing, cut through the audience several times.
""We need somebody to help. Somebody passed out right here,"" Scott said, according to video of his set, which included a guest appearance by Canadian rapper Drake. ""Security, somebody, jump in here real quick.""
Another video clip showed police performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation on several people even as music blared in the background.
The tragedy harkens back to a 1979 concert by British rock band The Who in which 11 people were killed when fans stampeded into the Riverfront Coliseum in Cincinnati before the event.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean mechanized troops held an artillery fire competition over the weekend as part of efforts to boost the country's defence capabilities, state media reported on Sunday
The drills were conducted on Saturday, state news agency KCNA said, and come as North Korea increasingly complains over what it sees as a double standard where its military activities invite international criticism when similar exercises by South Korea and the United States usually do not.
Analysts say Pyongyang is seeking to normalize its defence activities, with the aim of eventually winning international acceptance of its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile arsenals, which have been sanctioned by U.N. Security Council resolutions.
Much of North Korea's large conventional artillery force http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/NORTHKOREA-MISSILES/010041BR2VH/index.html is deployed along the fortified border with South Korea, where they have the range to reach as far as the heavily populated capital city of Seoul. 
The drills come ""at a time when the enthusiasm to undergo intensive training prevails throughout the Korean People's Army (KPA) for ushering in a new heyday in strengthening the state defence capabilities under the banner of self-defence,"" KCNA reported.
They were overseen by Pak Jong Chon, member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau and secretary of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers' Pary of Korea, KCNA said. 
Pak is a general long seen as a rising star in the country's powerful military and a major player in its missile programme who was promoted to his current positions in September.

General Rim Kwang Il, chief of the General Staff of the KPA, and commanders of the participating units, observed the drills with Pak, KCNA said.
""As soon as the firing orders were given by the commanders of the combined units, gun barrels to annihilate the enemy competitively shelled the target to accurately hit it,"" the report said.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Crowds surging forward as the main performer took to the stage at the Astroworld Festival led to chaos and crushed bodies in the darkness of the outdoor concert, say attendees who escaped the tragedy on Friday night.
At least eight people died and scores were injured during the first day of a weekend event that attracted tens of thousands. Police have opened a criminal investigation. About 300 people were treated for injuries including 11 taken to hospitals suffering from cardiac arrest. 
Eyewitnesses interviewed by Reuters pointed to fans being crushed and trampled at times during the day, before the main act took the stage. The crowd was already on edge and throwing water bottles when faced with choke points at a COVID-19 test center and merchandise sales areas, attendees said. 
There was ""chaos"" throughout the day as crowds overwhelmed the facilities and security on site, said Anthony Mendiola, 22, from San Antonio, Texas. While police and security teams were present throughout the park, ""there just wasn't enough,"" he said. 
There were 528 Houston police and 755 private security members hired by festival organizer Live Nation working at the event, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said at a briefing on Saturday.
“It felt like a riot. There were people throwing out stuff, objects flying everywhere,” said Albert Merza, 43, a supermarket manager, who saw fans attempting to jump fences to get inside and a ""lot of crazy behavior."" 
A countdown clock that signaled headliner Travis Scott was to perform that night pulled scores toward the main stage, crushing fans at the front, said Jonathan De Leon, who moved away as fans up front were pushed from behind, some falling to the ground.
Job Ramos, 21, from Kennewick, Washington, also had attended last month's Rolling Loud festival in New York, which billed itself as the world's largest rap festival. Houston's had more people, he said, and the mosh pits where fans dance and jump were frightening enough to keep the regular concert-goer away. 
Pablo Longoria, 19, a college student from Houston, said the crowd erupted when rap superstar Drake appeared unexpectedly on stage with Travis Scott. 

""All of a sudden it was like there was 13 mosh pits,"" said Longoria. ""People were falling down"" into piles, he said, including one woman who fell to the ground and was covered by three others who toppled after her. 
""It's not easy getting out of those mosh pits,"" said Ramos. ""When you're in a mosh pit, you feel like you can't get oxygen. All you are breathing is CO2.""

Denmark and Italy also asked their citizens in Ethiopia to leave while commercial flights were still available, as rebellious Tigrayan forces and their allies have advanced towards the capital Addis Ababa.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government, which has been embroiled in a year-long war against Tigrayan forces, has promised to keep fighting despite calls for a ceasefire from African nations, Western states and the U.N. Security Council.
""Incidents of civil unrest and ethnic violence are occurring without warning. The situation may escalate further and may cause supply chain shortages, communications blackouts, and travel disruptions,"" the U.S. Embassy said on its website.
Government spokesperson Legesse Tulu and Abiy's spokesperson Billene Seyoum did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment.
Municipal authorities in the capital ordered residents who own firearms to register their weapons this week, to bolster defences in case the city is attacked. Addis Ababa has registered more than 10,000 weapons, Yonas Zewde, a spokesperson for the city administration, told state broadcaster EBC on Saturday.
Abiy's government declared a national state of emergency on Tuesday, saying it was locked in an ""existential war"" with forces from the northern Tigray region and their allies.
Getu Argaw, police commissioner for the capital, told EBC it was ""only a dream"" for the TPLF to think it could capture the city. He said police had confiscated weapons and uniforms from people in the capital.
Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) spokesperson Getachew Reda accused Abiy of using the state of emergency to arrest ""thousands of Tigrayans and Oromos"". 
The government spokesperson and the federal police spokesperson Jeylan Abdi did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment on Getachew's remarks but police have denied that arrests in the capital are ethnically motivated.
""We are only arresting those who are directly or indirectly supporting the illegal terrorist group,"" police spokesperson Fasika Fante said on Thursday, a reference to the TPLF. ""This includes moral, financial and propaganda support.""
The TPLF unveiled an alliance with other factions on Friday aiming to remove Abiy from power, saying this would be done by force if needed.
The government condemned the move, saying Abiy had a mandate to rule based on a landslide election win in June. It urged international partners to help protect Ethiopia's democracy.
The conflict in the north of Ethiopia started a year ago when forces loyal to the TPLF seized military bases in the Tigray region. In response, Abiy sent troops, who initially drove the TPLF out of the regional capital but have faced a sharp reversal since June this year.
Reuters has not been able to confirm independently the extent of the TPLF advance. The TPLF and their allies told Reuters this week they were now in the town of Kemise in Amhara state, 325 km (200 miles) from the capital. The government accuses the group of exaggerating its territorial gains.
The conflict has killed thousands of people, forced more than 2 million more from their homes and left 400,000 people in Tigray facing famine.
Social media companies Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) have taken action to limit what they call violations of their policies by Ethiopian accounts, including removing a post by Abiy's official Facebook account.

Twitter said on Saturday it had temporarily disabled the Trends section of its service in Ethiopia, which showcases the most tweeted subjects, because of threats of physical harm.
""Inciting violence or dehumanizing people is against our rules ... Given the imminent threat of physical harm, we've also temporarily disabled Trends in Ethiopia,"" the company said.

WARSAW (Reuters) - The death of a pregnant Polish woman has reignited debate over abortion in one of Europe's most devoutly Catholic countries, with activists saying she could still be alive if it were not for a near total ban on terminating pregnancies.
Tens of thousands of Poles took to the streets to protest in January this year when a Constitutional Tribunal ruling from October 2020 that terminating pregnancies with foetal defects was unconstitutional came into effect, eliminating the most frequently used case for legal abortion.
Activists say Izabela, a 30-year-old woman in the 22nd week of pregnancy who her family said died of septic shock after doctors waited for her unborn baby's heart to stop beating, is the first woman to die as a result of the ruling.
The government says the ruling was not to blame for her death, rather an error by doctors.
Izabela went to hospital in September after her waters broke, her family said. Scans had previously shown numerous defects in the foetus.
""The baby weighs 485 grams. For now, thanks to the abortion law, I have to lie down. And there is nothing they can do. They'll wait until it dies or something begins, and if not, I can expect sepsis,"" Izabela said in a text message to her mother, private broadcaster TVN24 reported.
When a scan showed the foetus was dead, doctors at the hospital in Pszczyna, southern Poland, decided to perform a Caesarean. The family's lawyer, Jolanta Budzowska, said Izabela's heart stopped on the way to the operating theatre and she died despite efforts to resuscitate her.
""I couldn't believe it, I thought it wasn't true,"" Izabela's mother Barbara told TVN24. ""How could such a thing happen to her in the hospital? After all, she went there for help.""
Budzowska has started legal action over the treatment Izabela received, accusing doctors of malpractice, but she also called the death ""a consequence of the verdict"". 
In a statement on its website, the Pszczyna County Hospital said it shared the pain of all those affected by Izabela's death, especially her family.
""It should ... be emphasised that all medical decisions were made taking into account the legal provisions and standards of conduct in force in Poland,"" the hospital said.
On Friday, the hospital said it had suspended two doctors who were on duty at the time of the death.
The Supreme Medical Chamber, which represents Polish doctors, said it was not immediately able to comment.
NOT ONE MORE
When the case came to public attention as a result of a tweet from Budzowska, the hashtag #anijednejwiecej or 'not one more' spread across social media and was taken up by protesters demanding a change to the law.
However, Poland's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party rejects claims that the Constitutional Tribunal ruling was to blame for Izabela's death, attributing it to a mistake by doctors.
""When it comes to the life and health of the mother ... if it is in danger, then terminating the pregnancy is possible and the ruling does not change anything,"" Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Friday.
PiS lawmaker Bartlomiej Wroblewski told Reuters that the case should not be ""instrumentalised and used to limit the right to life, to kill all sick or disabled children"". 
But activists say the ruling has made doctors scared to terminate pregnancies even when the mother's life is at risk.
""Izabela's case clearly shows that the ruling of the Constitutional Tribunal has had a chilling effect on doctors,"" Urszula Grycuk of the Federation for Women and Family Planning told Reuters.
""Even a condition that should not be questioned - the life and health of the mother - is not always recognised by doctors because they are afraid.""
In Ireland, the death of 31-year-old Savita Halappanavar in 2012 after she was refused a termination provoked a national outpouring of grief credited by many as a catalyst for the liberalisation of abortion laws.
Budzowska told Reuters that a debate similar to the one that took place in Ireland was underway in Poland.

""Both Izabela's family and I personally hope that this case ... will lead to a change in the law in Poland,"" she said. 
Poland's president proposed changing the law last year to make abortions possible in cases where the foetus was not viable. The Law and Justice dominated parliament has yet to debate the bill.

FREETOWN (Reuters) -At least 99 people were killed and more than 100 injured in the capital of Sierra Leone late on Friday when a fuel tanker exploded following a collision, local authorities said.
Emergency crews worked to clear the scene on Saturday in Freetown's eastern suburb of Wellington where a burnt body and the blackened shells of cars and motorbikes blocked the road following the crash, a Reuters reporter said. 
The wounded were treated in hospitals and clinics across the capital, deputy health minister Amara Jambai told Reuters.
Victims included people who had flocked to collect fuel leaking from the ruptured vehicle, Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr, mayor of the port city, said in a post on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), although that post was later edited to remove the reference.
""We've got so many casualties, burnt corpses,"" said Brima Bureh Sesay, head of the National Disaster Management Agency, in a video from the scene shared online. ""It's a terrible, terrible accident.""
Videos shared online shortly after the explosion showed people running through clouds of thick smoke as large fires lit up the night sky. Reuters was not able immediately to verify the images, but witnesses described the horror. 
""We are all in shock. A lady I had just bought bread from died. A lovely woman. I can’t get over this grief,"" said Abdul Kabia, crying at the crash site surrounded by mangled vehicles. 
HOSPITAL OVERWHELMED
The crash provided a major challenge for Freetown's health service already creaking from years of underfunding. The 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic gutted the country's ranks of medical staff, 250 of whom died, and the system has not recovered. 
Connaught Hospital was overwhelmed with the influx of patients, so some of the injured were moved to other locations, including a military hospital, said Swaray Lengor, a programme manager at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. 
""The situation at the hospital, especially Connaught hospital ... is overwhelming. Inadequate medical consumables and bed capacity,"" Lengor told Reuters by text message. ""NGO partners were requested to support with equipment, medical commodities and food.""
The death toll would likely rise, he said. 
The World Health Organization said it would send supplies and deploy specialists in burn injuries.
""We will provide more support as needed at this terrible time for the people of Sierra Leone,"" it said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
Accidents with tanker trucks in Sub-Saharan Africa have previously killed scores of people who gathered at the site to collect spilled fuel and were hit by secondary blasts.

In 2019, a tanker explosion in Tanzania killed 85 people, while around 50 people were killed in a similar disaster in Democratic Republic of Congo in 2018. 
""My profound sympathies with families who have lost loved ones and those who have been maimed as a result,"" President Julius Maada Bio tweeted. ""My government will do everything to support affected families.""

GLASGOW (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of protesters marched on Saturday through rainy downtown Glasgow, and in many other cities around the world, to demand bolder action at the U.N. climate conference.
Students, activists and climate-concerned citizens linked arms as they moved slowly through the streets of the Scottish city, host of the COP26 meeting that began on Monday. 
Some pushed children in strollers, some danced to stay warm. Police watched the procession from the flanks. 
""It's good to have your voice heard,"" said Kim Travers of Edinburgh. ""Even with the rain, I think it makes it a bit more dramatic."" 
Just a few blocks from the procession, back-room negotiations continued at the COP26 meeting. On stage, speakers sounded the alarm over the threat of global warming to food security. 
Since the climate talks began, national delegations have been working to agree on technical details for the final pact, to be announced at the end of the conference after more negotiations this week. 
The first week also saw countries make a slew of promises to phase out coal, slash emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane and reduce deforestation. Business leaders and financiers, meanwhile, pledged to invest more in climate solutions. 
But activists have demanded that the meeting make more progress.
Ros Cadoux, a grandmother from Edinburgh, said she came to march for future generations. ""If you've got kids and grandkids - my God, What else could you do?"" 
Colorful banners bore slogans ranging from earnest calls for ""Climate Justice Now,"" to the more comical: ""No planet = no beer"". 
One group bounced along to the sound of a drum and chanted ""Get Up, Get Down, Keep that Carbon in the Ground.""
""The climate crisis is about the survival of humanity as we know it,"" said Philipp Chmel, who traveled from Germany for the march. ""It's up to the youth and the workers, the working class, to bring about the change that is necessary."" 
One group of youths - some with bullhorns - blamed companies for the climate crisis and chanted calls in favour of socialism while punching their fists in the air.
Around midday, the rain cleared for a few hours, and an enormous rainbow streaked across the sky.
""If ever there was a time for activism, and if ever there was a time for the people to come out onto the streets, then it is today,"" said University of Glasgow student Theo Lockett, 20. 
Climate activists held rallies in many other cities, including Seoul, Melbourne, Copenhagen and London.
CONFERENCE HALLS
During a panel of speeches on Saturday, Democratic U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse urged companies to rein in groups lobbying politicians to block climate action. 
""Corporate members who made big promises here at this COP have got to get their trade associations under control so they're not undercutting our work in Congress,"" said Whitehouse, who was at COP26 with a bipartisan group of Congress members. 
He also told journalists that it was crucial to resolve a carbon price for carbon markets -- one of the key sticking points in the negotiations.
Earlier at the conference, actor Idris Elba acknowledged that he had few credentials to speak on climate change, but said he was at COP26 to amplify the climate threat to global food security.
Sitting on the same panel, climate justice campaigner Vanessa Nakate of Uganda implored the world to stop burning fossil fuels, the main cause of rising global temperatures. 
""We are watching farms collapse and livelihoods lost due to floods, droughts and swarms of locusts,"" she said - all of which scientists say are being exacerbated by climate change. 
""The climate crisis means hunger and death for many people in my country and across Africa.""
Civil society leaders and representatives from companies like Unilever (NYSE:UL) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) spoke about corporate responsibility in making trade and commerce less of a burden on nature. 

Speaking about using satellite technology to monitor global landscapes, the director and founder of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Earth Outreach urged better stewardship of the world's forests.
""We don't want to be writing the obituary of our planet in high resolution,"" Rebecca Moore said.

A ruling by Poland's Constitutional Tribunal that abortion on the grounds of foetal defects contravened the constitution came into effect in January, triggering a near total ban on pregnancy terminations and widespread protests.
People holding candles and carrying banners saying 'not one more' and 'indifference is complicity', marched through dozens of towns and cities on Saturday, according to organisers, including Pszczyna, southern Poland, where the woman lived.

'Her heart was beating too' read slogans on banners and in information shared by protest organisers. 
""...the anti-abortion law in Poland kills Polish women. It is cruel, it is terrifying,"" a woman attending a protest in Pszczyna said in a comment aired by a private broadcaster TVN24. 
""It is inhuman and I hope that this situation will contribute in some way, so that Polish women will not have to die,"" she added. 
On Saturday, the news website Onet.pl published an interview with a husband of another woman who he claimed died in June in similar circumstances. 
The government says the court ruling was not to blame for Izabela's death, rather an error by doctors. Poland's health minister Adam Niedzielski pledged to issue guidelines to make it clear when terminations were legal.
""I asked the National Consultant for Gynecology and Obstetrics to issue such guidelines...that will be unambiguous about the fact that the safety of a woman, in such a case as happened, is a reason to terminate the pregnancy,"" he told private radio RMF FM. 

Poland's president proposed changing the law last year to make abortions possible in cases where the foetus was not viable. In September a draft bill introducing a total ban on abortion was submitted to parliament by a group of citizens. 
""...let's finally change the law that kills women, deprives families of mothers, wives and sisters,"" Agnieszka Dziemianowicz-Bak, a left-wing lawmaker, was quoted as saying ahead of protests by news agency PAP.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -It was a split second decision. Mirza Ali Ahmadi and his wife Suraya found themselves and their five children on Aug. 19 in a chaotic crowd outside the gates of the Kabul airport in Afghanistan when a U.S. soldier, from over the tall fence, asked if they needed help.
Fearing their two-month old baby Sohail would get crushed in the melee, they handed him to the soldier, thinking they would soon get to the entrance, which was only about 16 feet (5 meters) away.
But at that moment, Mirza Ali said, the Taliban - which had swiftly taken over the country as U.S. troops withdrew - began pushing back hundreds of hopeful evacuees. It took the rest of the family more than a half hour to get to the other side of the airport fence.
Once they were inside, Sohail was nowhere to be found.
Mirza Ali, who said he worked as a security guard at the U.S embassy for 10 years, began desperately asking every official he encountered about his baby's whereabouts. He said a military commander told him the airport was too dangerous for a baby and that he might have been taken to a special area for children. But when they got there it was empty. 
""He walked with me all around the airport to search everywhere,"" Mirza Ali said in an interview through a translator. He said he never got the commander's name, as he didn't speak English and was relying on Afghan colleagues from the embassy to help communicate. Three days went by. 
""I spoke to maybe more than 20 people,"" he said. ""Every officer - military or civilian - I came across I was asking about my baby."" 
He said one of the civilian officials he spoke to told him Sohail might have been evacuated by himself. ""They said 'we don't have resources to keep the baby here.'"" 
Mirza Ali, 35, Suraya, 32, and their other children, 17, 9, 6 and 3 years old, were put on an evacuation flight to Qatar and then to Germany and eventually landed in the United States. The family is now at Fort Bliss in Texas with other Afghan refugees waiting to be resettled somewhere in the United States. They have no relatives here.
Mirza Ali said he saw other families handing their babies over the Kabul airport fence to soldiers at the same time. One video clip https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/the-only-way-out-scenes-from-the-kabul-a-idUSRTXFVLJR of a small baby in a diaper being hoisted by her arm over razor wire went viral on social media. She was later reunited with her parents.
Ever since his baby went missing dates are a blur, Mirza Ali said. Every person he comes across - aid workers, U.S. officials - he tells them about Sohail. ""Everyone promises they will do their best, but they are just promises,"" he said. 
An Afghan refugee support group created a ""Missing Baby"" sign with Sohail's picture on it and are circulating it among their networks in the hopes that someone will recognize him.
A U.S. government official familiar with the situation said the case had been flagged for all the agencies involved, including the U.S. bases and overseas locations. The child was last seen being handed to a U.S. soldier during the chaos at the Kabul airport but ""unfortunately no one can find the child,"" the official said.
A Department of Defense spokesperson and a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which is overseeing resettlement efforts, referred queries on the matter to the State Department, since the separation took place overseas. 
A State Department spokesperson said the government is working with international partners and the international community ""to explore every avenue to locate the child, which includes an international amber alert that was issued through the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children.""

Suraya, who also spoke through a translator, said she cries most of the time and that her other children are distraught.
""All I am doing is thinking about my child,"" Suraya said. ""Everyone that is calling me, my mother, my father, my sister, they all comfort me and say 'don't worry, God is kind, your son will be found.'""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - For some, retirement is a time for relaxation. For 2017 New York City Marathon champion Shalane Flanagan, running six marathons in six weeks has proven a more appealing post-career project. 
The four-time Olympian, 40, started her mission with the Berlin Marathon in September and is ending the journey at the New York City Marathon on Sunday, a project she told Reuters rekindled her joy for running two years since she quit professional competition.
""I needed a goal again after a year of not running and reconstructive knee surgery - and post-pandemic and retirement, I just felt like I wanted to reclaim my mental health and physical health and celebrate running,"" said Flanagan, who picked up Olympic silver in the 10,000-metre race in 2008.
With the COVID-19 pandemic pushing the London Marathon and Boston Marathon from their usual April dates to October, she decided to seize on the rare opportunity to run the prestigious World Marathon Majors within a month-and-a-half stretch.
She substituted the postponed Tokyo Marathon with a 26.2-mile run in Portland, Oregon, last month, and endured a grueling ""double-header,"" with Chicago and Boston on back-to-back days.
""This is just my idea of fun - I need something to be a little bit challenging to be fun to me,"" said Flanagan. ""It's not everyone’s cup of tea but it is mine.""
The  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) athlete has posted times that would make any non-pro swoon, completing the London Marathon in 2:35:04, with her slowest time so far - 2:46:39 - in Chicago. 

""It feels like weirdly a little emotional... the completion of this project, and then being back in a place that I had some of my best career highlights here,"" said Flanagan, who also finished second and third in New York in 2010 and 2018, respectively. 
""Obviously a different experience on Sunday but I'm very excited to be here.""

Xi is ""a man of determination and action, a man of profound thoughts and feelings, a man who inherited a legacy and dares to innovate, and a man who has forward-looking vision and is committed to working tirelessly,"" Xinhua said.
The party's 300-plus member Central Committee, meeting Monday through Thursday, is expected to pave the way for Xi to secure an unprecedented third five-year term as president at the 20th Party Congress next year.
It is also expected to discuss and ratify a ""historical resolution https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-xi-cement-authority-legacy-communist-party-resolution-2021-11-02"" focusing on ""the important achievements and historical experiences of the Party's 100 years of struggle"".
Xinhua's profile, headlined ""Xi Jinping, the man who leads CPC (Communist Party of China) on new journey"", portrayed the president as a man with ""little time for himself"", for whom ""happiness is achieved through hard work."" 
The article, more than 5,000 words long in English translation, features praise from foreign media as well as domestic academics and experts. 
It covers Xi's early career as a village official in the provinces of Shaanxi and Hebei, irrigating farms by day and devouring Karl Marx's Das Kapital in his spare time. It extols Xi's ""signature anti-corruption campaign"", his commitment to ""intra-party democracy"" and his role in the nation's ""rejuvenation"".
Ignoring China's early missteps in dealing with COVID-19, the profile praises Xi's ""people-centred philosophy"" and its role in the country's ""unwavering efforts to save people's lives at all costs.""

Xi, regarded as China's most powerful leader since Chairman Mao Zedong, has been consolidating his authority and legacy further this year, with ""Xi Jinping Thought"" now officially incorporated into the national school curriculum. 
He also vowed to uphold his own ""core"" leadership https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-add-xi-jinping-thought-national-curriculum-2021-08-25 at a speech to mark the centenary of the Communist Party in July.

Belize financed the purchase and the redemption of its bonds - an amount equal to about 12% of its gross domestic product - with funding from a subsidiary of The Nature Conservancy (TNC) as part of organization's ""blue"" bonds program https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/belize-offers-ocean-blue-print-with-debt-for-reef-swap-2021-11-05 to conserve some of the world's most vulnerable marine ecosystems.
The settlement of the offer means Belize reduced the principal amount of its external debt by approximately $250 million, the government said in a statement.
As part of the transaction, Belize's government prefunded nearly $23.5 million to a marine conservation endowment account dedicated to supporting future marine conservation projects in the country.

""Our expectation is that this transaction will pave the way for strong and long-lasting economic growth and allow Belize to achieve its marine conservation objectives,"" Belize's Prime Minister John Briceno said in the statement.
The TNC program uses private capital to refinance public debt of participating countries in order to support marine conservation efforts.

KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) -A witness in the murder trial of U.S. teenager Kyle Rittenhouse said on Friday that one of the two protesters killed that night was acting aggressively and repeatedly challenged a group of armed men to shoot him, but that he did not consider the man a threat.
Rittenhouse, 18, has been charged in the deaths of Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and in the wounding of Gaige Grosskreutz, now 27, during a chaotic night on Aug. 25, 2020, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, during protests following the police shooting and wounding of a Black man.
He has pleaded not guilty and says he acted in self-defense.
Jason Lackowski, a former Marine, was with Rittenhouse on the night of the shootings. Prosecutors sought to use Lackowski's testimony to show that he, while being similarly armed to Rittenhouse, did not see Rosenbaum as a threat. 
Prior to the shootings, Lackowski said Rosenbaum had taunted him and other armed men close by to shoot him and also ""false-stepped"" in their direction - a motion of stepping toward someone and then quickly stepping back.
""After he did that a few times I turned my back and ignored him,"" Lackowski said, answering ""no"" to a question from Kenosha County Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger about whether he considered the unarmed Rosenbaum a threat.
Lackowski said he was armed with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, similar to the weapon held by Rittenhouse. He said he, along with others, had come to Kenosha to protect a used car lot after rioting and arson in the city in previous nights.
Lackowski's testimony came one day after two witnesses provided testimony that appeared to be supportive of Rittenhouse's self-defense claims. On Thursday, one witness said Rosenbaum cursed and lunged for the defendant's rifle before he fired and another witness said Rosenbaum had threatened to kill both Rittenhouse and him earlier in the night. 
Under cross-examination, Lackowski acknowledged that, unlike Rittenhouse, he was not alone when he came into contact with Rosenbaum and that his calculation of the potential threat could have changed if Rosenbaum had threatened his life.
Lackowski also said Rosenbaum was using ""the N-word"" while asking people to shoot him, utterances that prompted other protesters to react negatively toward him. The protests had been sparked by the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, on Aug. 23, 2020. Blake was left paralyzed from the waist down.
Corey Chirafisi, an attorney for Rittenhouse, pointed out the context in which Rosenbaum allegedly used the racial slur.
""He's saying this at a protest for an African-American man who was shot by police.""
BIPOLAR DISORDER
Rosenbaum's fiancee testified that he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which prosecutors could use to argue that he was the aggressor in the encounter and to question his mental stability.
Kariann Swart, Rosenbaum's fiancee, testified that Rosenbaum was not armed when he went out the night of the shootings. She became emotional, dabbing her eyes with a tissue, when she was shown a picture of them together and she talked about her visit to the crime scene the following day where she touched the ground where he fell, wetting her hand with his blood.

Swart, who had been with Rosenbaum for about one year prior to his death, said she believed he had taken his medications, which included gabapentin for bipolar disorder, on the day of the shootings. She also testified that he could not fill his prescriptions because the pharmacy close to where they were staying was boarded up due to the chaos in Kenosha.
A series of police officers were called to testify. One who processed Rittenhouse's rifle said he was never asked to swab the barrel of the gun for DNA and did not do so. The barrel is a focal point in the trial because Rittenhouse's lawyers want to establish that Rosenbaum lunged for it before he was shot.

BRUNSWICK, Ga. (Reuters) -When three white men saw a Black man running through their mostly white neighborhood in southern Georgia one afternoon last year, they ""assumed the worst,"" a prosecutor told the jury on Friday at the men's trial for the murder of Ahmaud Arbery. 
When they began chasing Arbery in their pickup trucks, they did so with violent intent, according to the prosecution's opening statement: One man tried to swipe Arbery off the road with his truck, another shouted out a death threat.
Minutes later, Arbery would be shot dead by Travis McMichael, the youngest of his pursuers through the streets of Satilla Shores, a quiet, green cluster of houses outside the small coastal city of Brunswick (NYSE:BC).
Jurors looked on as a graphic video froze on a frame of Arbery's body in the street, a gaping shotgun wound in his chest, an image left onscreen as technicians tried to fix technical glitches that hindered the first day of testimony. 
Gregory McMichael, 65; his son Travis McMichael, 35; and neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52, have pleaded not guilty to charges of murder, aggravated assault and false imprisonment for their deadly pursuit of Arbery on Feb. 23, 2020. 
Bryan's cellphone video of Travis McMichael shooting Arbery spurred outrage when it emerged more than two months after the encounter. It was seen by many as another example of a Black person falling under dangerous suspicion while engaged in some humdrum activity.
The men later said they thought Arbery might have been fleeing a crime and were trying to detain him under the state's now-repealed citizen's arrest statute in a neighborhood their lawyers say was ""on edge"" over reports of thefts.
""It is a citizen's job to help the police, and the law authorizes that,"" Robert Rubin, Travis McMichael's lawyer, said in his opening statement in the Glynn County Superior Court. ""When seconds count, the police are often minutes away. The police are not going to catch this guy at the speed he's running."" 
Gregory McMichael was out in his driveway repairing seat cushions for his boat when Arbery ran by. He and his son grabbed a handgun and a 12-gauge shotgun and jumped in the son's pickup truck in pursuit.
The defendants' own words undermine their defense, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said in her opening statement to the mostly white jury, which has only one Black member.
""I assumed something was up,"" Travis McMichael later told police when explaining why they chased Arbery, Dunikoski said.
Bryan saw the pursuit as it neared his home and jumped in his own truck. Dunikoski called the truck a ""5,000-pound lethal weapon"" that Bryan swerved toward Arbery four times to angle him off the road into a ditch.
""At this point in time, Mr. Arbery is under attack by all three of these men,"" she told the jury. Bryan got so close that they found Arbery's handprint and fibers from his white T-shirt on the truck. 
""All three of these defendants did everything they did based on assumptions,"" Dunikoski said. ""They made decisions in their driveways based on those assumptions that took a young man's life, and that is why we are here.""
Dunikoski said the defendants had deadly intent, pointing to something the elder McMichael told police he shouted at Arbery: ""Stop or I'll blow your fucking head off!"" She said he also told police they had trapped Arbery ""like a rat.""
She said Arbery was simply a fitness buff and told the jury they would soon be shown his sneakers, their tread worn smooth by his avid jogging.
COVERED IN BLOOD
Rubin said in his opening statement that Travis McMichael had been frightened that Arbery might have been armed. It would turn out the jogger did not even have his cellphone on him.
McMichael opened fire in self-defense as Arbery tried to grab his shotgun, Rubin said.
In the months before the shooting, reports of several property crimes unnerved residents of Satilla Shores, Rubin said.
Arbery had been seen in security-camera video roaming around an unoccupied half-built house near the McMichaels' on several occasions in the months before shooting.
The property owner, Larry English, shared the videos with the neighbors, and Travis McMichael was among those who saw them, Rubin said.
The prosecution told the jury they would see a deposition by English, who has said nothing was taken from his property on the days Arbery was there, and that he believes Arbery was using a water source on the site to quench his thirst.

Police officer William Duggan, who was the second officer on the scene, recalled seeing Travis McMichael covered in blood and asking him if he was okay.
""It was a quick reply of basically, 'No, I'm not okay, I just effing killed somebody,'"" Duggan said.

(Reuters) - A New York county prosecutor on Friday asked a judge to delay for two months the arraignment of former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on a misdemeanor sex offense charge, saying a local sheriff may have botched the case by rushing to file the complaint.
Cuomo resigned in August in the middle of his third term as governor after a five-month official inquiry found that he had sexually harassed 11 women. 
Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) filed a ""forcible touching"" charge against Cuomo last month based on one woman's accusation that Cuomo groped her under her blouse at the Executive Mansion in the New York state capital of Albany.
But the charge against Cuomo was ""potentially defective,"" Albany County District Attorney David Soares wrote in a letter to the judge dated Thursday because it failed to include a sworn statement from the accuser.
Soares asked Albany City Court Judge Holly Trexler to delay Cuomo's arraignment, which had been scheduled for Nov. 17, for 60 days to give his office more time to review the case and possibly avoid a procedural dismissal. Cuomo's attorney supported the request, and the judge granted the delay, scheduling Cuomo's arraignment for Jan. 7, a spokesperson for Soares said. 
Soares said in his letter that his office had been investigating Cuomo for months when the sheriff surprised him with a criminal filing.
""We were in the middle of that investigation when the Sheriff unilaterally and inexplicably filed a complaint in this Court. Unfortunately the filings is this matter are potentially defective in that the police-officer-complainant failed to include a sworn statement by the victim such that the (state) could proceed with a prosecution,"" the Soares letter said.
Soares also said his office was still reviewing hundreds of hours of videotaped testimony and volumes of documents produced by the five-month probe that was conducted by independent lawyers under the direction of state Attorney General Tish James.
Sheriff Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. In comments to the Albany Times Union, he said his office followed proper procedures.
""There was sworn testimony included, and we followed the policies and protocols set to interview victims of sex crimes,"" Apple said.
Apple previously regretted that Soares and others were surprised by his charge, saying his office filed the paperwork for review and intended to meet with prosecutors to determine whether a criminal arrest warrant or a criminal summons would be issued. 
The process, however, moved much more quickly than planned, and the information was leaked to the news media, he said.
Apple also rejected Cuomo's accusations of political motivations, saying his office had conducted a ""comprehensive and methodical"" investigation.

Cuomo, who has maintained his innocence, said he only resigned in order to avoid putting the state through the turmoil that would follow his efforts to fight the charges.
If convicted on the misdemeanor charge, he would face a possible sentence of up to a year in jail.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Former Boston-area millowner Aaron Feuerstein, who gained fame for paying workers idled after a fire in December 1995, has died at the age of 95, his son Daniel Feuerstein said on Thursday.
Feuerstein drew national attention after he continued paying 1,400 workers displaced from the Malden Mills factory in Lawrence, Massachusetts, known for its Polartec fleece fabric. 
Although Feuerstein later lost control of his company, he came to symbolize a business approach now known as ""stakeholder capitalism,"" in which executives consider the needs of workers and communities as well as shareholders.
""For my father, the most important stakeholders were his factory workers,"" said Daniel Feuerstein. He and his brother Ray said their father died of complications from pneumonia after a fall at home in the Boston suburb of Brookline, Massachusetts last week. ""His workers were his people, his community,"" Daniel Feuerstein said.
After the fire, Feuerstein rebuilt the textile factory north of Boston with insurance money but reinvested too much in unprofitable areas like furniture fabric, leading to bankruptcies and the sale of the business founded by his grandfather, which once employed about 3,000 people. Polartec is now a brand of Milliken & Co.
Yet the blunt-spoken Feuerstein became an icon at a time when many business leaders were celebrated for laying off workers and cutting costs to maximize profits.
Just after the fire, Feuerstein said, ""I'm not throwing 3,000 people out of work two weeks before Christmas,"" a Malden Mills executive once told the Boston Globe newspaper. 
Ultimately Feuerstein paid wages to all 1,400 workers displaced by the fire for 90 days and extended their health benefits. Many were immigrants from Lawrence and the nearby city of Lowell, Massachusetts.
Feuerstein won wide acclaim for his actions. He was invited as a guest for President Bill Clinton's 1996 State of the Union address and appeared on the CBS News program ""60 Minutes.""
Former Malden Mills manager David Costello said Feuerstein at first resisted the attention but later ""appreciated the fact that he was the bearer of a good message.""
""He made you feel like the company had a mission, and a commitment to its employees, its products and its customers,"" Costello said.

WASHINGTON/NAIROBI (Reuters) -A newly-formed alliance of Ethiopian opposition factions set a goal on Friday of bringing down Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed by force or negotiation to then form a transitional government.
The government, already embroiled in a year-long war against northern forces, dismissed the creation of the alliance as a stunt and accused some members of past ethnic violence. 
The alliance was announced by faction leaders in Washington despite calls from African and Western leaders for a national ceasefire, as federal troops battle the northern-based Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and its allies. 
With the rebels threatening to move on the capital Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian army on Friday called on former personnel to rejoin the military to fight them, state media said.
The U.N. Security Council on Friday called for an end to the fighting in Ethiopia and for talks on a lasting ceasefire as the 15-member body expressed deep concern in a rare statement about the expansion and intensification of military clashes.
The council also ""called for refraining from inflammatory hate speech and incitement to violence and divisiveness."" 
The United States advised its citizens to leave Ethiopia as soon as possible. ""The security environment in Ethiopia is very fluid,"" the U.S. Embassy said in a statement.
The war, which has killed thousands of people and forced more than two million from their homes, has intensified in recent weeks.
Announcing the formation of the United Front of Ethiopian Federalist and Confederalist Forces at an event in Washington, the alliance said it was setting up a command to coordinate military and political efforts.
""The next step will be to organise ourselves and totally dismantle the existing government, either by force or by negotiation ... then insert a transitional government,"" said Mahamud Ugas Muhumed, of the Somali State Resistance, one of nine member groups, all of whom have armed units.
The pact expands an existing agreement between the TPLF and the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), organisers said.
""We're trying to bring an end to this terrible situation in Ethiopia, which is created single-handedly by the Abiy government,"" said Berhane Gebrekristos, a TPLF leader and former Ethiopian ambassador to the United States. 
""Time is running out for him.""
In a rejoinder, the government said it had a responsibility to secure the country, and urged its international partners to stand with Ethiopia's democracy.
""There is no equivalence between a democratically elected government and a group of terrorists and non-state actors that continue to cause violence and destruction,"" its communication service said in a statement.
Abiy's party won a landslide victory in June.
Attorney General Gedion Temothewos called the alliance ""a publicity stunt"" and said some of the groups had a track record of ""ethnic cleansing"". He referred to only one of the groups, the OLA, accusing them of trying to commit ""pogroms"" in the western part of the Oromiya region.
The OLA was not immediately reachable for comment on that.
'STOP THE WAR'
The conflict started in November 2020 when forces loyal to the TPLF, including some soldiers, seized military bases in Tigray. In response, Abiy sent more troops to the northern region.
The TPLF had dominated national politics for nearly three decades but lost influence when Abiy took office in 2018.
The TPLF accused him of centralising power at the expense of regional states. Abiy denies this.
The TPLF and the OLA told Reuters they were now in the town of Kemise in Amhara state, 325 km (200 miles) from the capital. The TPLF had said on Tuesday its forces were also closing in on the town of Mille, which would enable them to cut off the highway linking neighbouring Djibouti to Addis Ababa.
The government accuses the TPLF of exaggerating gains.
On Friday, government spokesperson Legesse Tulu said fighting was still 80 km (50 miles) from Mille. 
He also said there was fighting at least 100 km (60 miles) north of Shewa Robit, a town in the Amhara region that is on the A2 highway, which links the capital to Ethiopia's north. That would put fighting about 57 km (36 miles) south of Kombulcha, one of two towns the TPLF said it captured last weekend. 
The government said on Friday that a TPLF commander, Colonel Guesh Gebrehiwot, was captured on Thursday during fighting near Dessie in Amhara. The TPLF was unreachable for comment on that.
It was not possible to independently confirm claims made by either side as communications in the area remained down. 
At a market on Addis Ababa's outskirts, traders went about their business as usual but fewer shoppers were coming.
Vegetable seller Abdisa Wili, 32, said prices were rising.
""Both sides should stop the war, no one will profit from war except death and economic downfall,"" he said. ""They should solve the problem through discussion.""
State-affiliated Fana TV reported that thousands of people took to the streets on Friday for pro-government rallies in at least seven towns and cities in Oromiya region, which surrounds Addis Ababa. Abiy is part Oromo and support from Ethiopia's largest ethnic group helped propel him to power but he lost some backing when security forces detained thousands of Oromos

Amnesty International said there has been an alarming rise in social media posts advocating violence. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) said it had removed an unspecified number of pro-government accounts for violating policies against deceptive content aimed at misleading or disrupting other users.
There was no immediate comment on that from authorities in Addis Ababa.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A former senior associate athletic director at the University of Southern California pleaded guilty on Friday to participating in a vast fraud and bribery scheme that allowed wealthy parents' children to gain admission to colleges as fake sports recruits.
Donna Heinel, 60, had been set to go before a federal jury in Boston later this month in the second trial to arise from the U.S. college admissions scandal. She instead pleaded guilty to committing honest services wire fraud.
Heinel admitted she submitted information to a USC admissions committee from the scheme's mastermind, college admissions consultant William ""Rick"" Singer, about students that misled it into believing their applications came from coaches.
She did so from 2015 to 2019 in exchange for payments from Singer's clients to USC accounts she professionally benefited from.
Heinel agreed not to appeal any prison sentence of 46 months or less. She is slated to be sentenced March 11.
Heinel is among 57 people charged in the ""Operation Varsity Blues"" investigation, which ensnared business executives and celebrities and exposed inequalities in U.S. higher education.
Singer pleaded guilty in 2019 to facilitating cheating on college entrance exams and helping bribe coaches and university athletic officials to secure the admission of children as phony athletes.
Forty-eight people have agreed to plead guilty, including actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman.
Heinel's plea came after two fathers, former casino executive Gamal Aziz and private equity firm founder John Wilson, were convicted in October in the first trial in the scandal of buying their children's way into USC. 
Prosecutors alleged Singer's clients made more than $1.3 million in payments to USC accounts that Heinel designated. 

Prosecutors called the payments bribes, a characterization U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani on Friday questioned since Heinel did not personally pocket the funds.
But she ultimately accepted the plea after defense lawyer Nina Marino said the money helped Heinel improperly fulfill her duties to raise money for USC.

(Reuters) -Republican governors began filing lawsuits on Friday to stop the Biden administration's requirement that nearly 2 million U.S. employers get workers tested or vaccinated for COVID-19, saying it trampled civil liberties. 
After President Joe Biden, a Democrat, said on Thursday he will enforce the mandate https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/bidens-vaccine-mandate-be-enforced-after-new-year-offering-us-companies-relief-2021-11-04 starting Jan. 4, the states of Florida, Georgia and Alabama jointly sued in the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
""The federal government can't just unilaterally impose medical policy under the guise of workplace regulation,"" Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said at a press conference on Thursday. 
The lawsuit by the three states, as well as two trade groups, two private companies and two schools, said the mandate exceeded the administration's legal authority and conflicted with the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
The Republican governors of more than a dozen other states also vowed to challenge the mandate in court and several cases were filed by private employers.
The regulation was implemented as a rarely used emergency rule from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the federal workplace regulator.
""Biden just announced his plan to wield OSHA to mandate vaccines on private businesses,"" Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Thursday. ""I'm announcing my plan to sue him once this illegal, unconstitutional regulation hits the Federal Register."" 
Texas is among the Republican-led states that have issued executive orders or enacted laws that ban COVID-19 vaccine mandates or prevent employers from seeking an employee's vaccination status.
OSHA said the rule takes precedence over conflicting state laws. It will take effect on Friday when it is due to be published in the federal register. 
Responding to opponents of the rule, a senior administration official said OSHA clearly has the authority to act to protect workers from health and safety hazards. COVID-19 has killed more than 745,000 people in the United States. 
Biden said in September that patience was wearing thin with the 30% of Americans who remain unvaccinated and who made up the vast majority of those hospitalized during the most recent wave of COVID-19 infections.
Mandates have been used by private businesses and local governments to drive up COVID-19 vaccination rates and courts have generally upheld them because states typically have the power to regulate healthcare within their borders.
Previous uses of OSHA's emergency rule have a history of being blocked in court.
Even if the mandate is upheld by the courts, some states still might not implement the rule.
OSHA applies to private workplaces in 29 states. The remaining states, including at least five with Republican leaders who have vowed to oppose the rule, have their own state-run OSHA that is required to adopt the federal rule.

OSHA issued a similar COVID-19 rule for healthcare settings in June, and in October the federal agency threatened to take over the state-run OSHA agencies in Arizona, South Carolina and Utah for failing to adopt it. Arizona and South Carolina have since said they have started the process to adopt the rule.

Barclays received a subpoena in the United States from the U.S. Virgin Islands in February, the bank confirmed.
""Barclays has already provided its response to this subpoena and complied with its obligations. The USVI is now in the process of serving a similar subpoena on Barclays in the U.K. and Barclays will respond to that subpoena once it is served,"" a spokesman for the lender said.

Barclays said Monday that Chief Executive Jes Staley was leaving the bank after a dispute with British financial regulators over how he described his ties with Epstein.
Epstein's estate was sued last year by the U.S. Virgin Islands, which claimed that he raped and trafficked in dozens of young women and girls on a private island in U.S. Virgin Island territory.

LONDON (Reuters) - For over a year Bhavna Patel has watched her first grandchild grow via FaceTime, talking to him in New York every day while the U.S. travel restrictions prevented her from making the trip from London.
On Monday she is threatening to dance down the aisle of the British Airways plane that will take her to finally meet him, as the United States lifts COVID-19 restrictions that have barred much of the world from entering for over 20 months.
Already she is too excited to sleep, counting down the days, hours and minutes, and wants the world to know of her news. She would also like to wear a large hat announcing that she is about to meet her grandson, Kai.
""I wake up in the night and think: are we really going?"" she told Reuters in her home in south London, throwing her hands in the air with excitement. ""It'll just be amazing to hold him.""
The unprecedented restrictions have prevented loved ones and foreign workers from reuniting with families, attending weddings, saying goodbye at funerals, and greeting new babies.
Patel's son Kushal moved to New York more than six years ago and his most recent visit back, in 2019, is a distant memory. He FaceTimed his family from the hospital in New York to introduce his son and had been urging them to book tickets the second the borders reopened.
For his mother, the hardest part about the separation was not knowing when it would end, and questions from well-meaning friends asking when she would meet her grandson.
""It's that question, it really takes something out of you,"" she said, blinking back tears and looking at photos of her family in New York. ""It's like putting a nail in the heart and knocking. And now I can say: Look, I'm going!""
NEW YORK-BOUND 
Patel and her daughter Bindiya will be on BA001, the first New York-bound BA flight leaving Heathrow on Monday, when the U.S. reopens to fully vaccinated international visitors.
The British flag carrier is marking the reopening of the Europe-to-U.S. route with a first flight reserved for friends and families separated during the pandemic, taking royal family photographer Chris Floyd along to capture the moment.
Such is the importance to European airlines of the transatlantic route, BA and Virgin Atlantic are hoping to send two jets down Heathrow's twin runways for a synchronised takeoff, weather permitting.
On BA001, Bindiya will be carrying the British Cadbury's chocolate her brother has missed. She wonders how Kai will react when he sees his family ""in 3D"" for the first time. 
""It's a real pinch-me moment,"" she said at their home, where balloons still celebrate Kai's birthday in October.
Restrictions on non-U.S. citizens were first imposed on air travellers from China in January 2020 by then-President Donald Trump and extended to dozens of other countries afterwards.

Bhavna Patel said she would be thinking of all the other families around the world who have not yet had the chance to reunite. She is also worried that an 8-hour flight will feel far too long.
""I don't think counting days is enough, not days, it's hours, minutes,"" she said. ""I want to meet him. Monday is too late, that's how I feel.""

France, Sudan's second-largest creditor, has been a main actor in backing the interim authorities after former President Omar al-Bashir was ousted in 2019, but the civilian transition was derailed in October when the military took control.
Speaking to reporters in a daily briefing on Friday, Foreign ministry spokeswoman Anne-Claire Legendre said Paris had been an ""unwavering"" partner for Sudan and that the general debt cancellation programme as part of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative was agreed at a conference in Paris in May. 
""A Paris Club agreement was reached on July 15, each creditor now having to sign a bilateral agreement with Sudan,"" Legendre told reporters, responding to a question on whether Paris was reviewing its debt cancellation promise.
""It is clear that the military coup of October 25 calls into question this process.""
At that conference President Emmanuel Macron had vowed to cancel about $5 billion France is owed by Khartoum, provided a loan to clear Sudan's arrears to the International Monetary Fund and organised a side event promoting investment into the country. 
In a sign the junta is tightening its control, the military dissolved the boards of all state companies and national agricultural projects, state TV said on Friday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday named two new officials to coordinate Washington's response to so-called Havana Syndrome health incidents that have affected U.S. diplomats and officials overseas.
Blinken said Ambassador Jonathan Moore will serve as coordinator of the State Department's Health Incident Response Task Force and Ambassador Margaret Uyehara will lead a team supporting affected employees.
""This is an urgent priority for President Biden, for me, for our entire government,"" Blinken said in an address at the department, pledging to ""get to the bottom of this"" and take care of those affected in the meantime.
""These incidents have left our colleagues with profound harm. They've experienced serious physical consequences, including persistent headaches and hearing loss. They've also experienced psychological harm, including trauma, anxiety, depression,"" he said.
President Joe Biden's administration has faced criticism https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-state-department-defends-handling-havana-syndrome-2021-10-14 from sufferers and lawmakers for not taking seriously enough what officials call anomalous health incidents. A bipartisan group of U.S. senators wrote to Blinken on Oct. 14 urging him to quickly appoint a new coordinator for the response after the previous official resigned. 
Around 200 U.S. diplomats, officials and family members overseas are believed to have been struck by the mysterious ailment - with symptoms including migraines, nausea, memory lapses and dizziness - which was first reported among U.S. officials in the Cuban capital in 2016.
In Colombia last month, Blinken met https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/blinken-spoke-bogota-embassy-staff-affected-by-havana-syndrome-2021-10-21 with members of the embassy community in Bogota who have been affected by the incidents.

""The task force and I believe and respect those who come forward in reporting incidents and will be relentless in our efforts to provide them the care that they need,"" he said.

WARSAW (Reuters) - The death of a pregnant Polish woman has reignited debate over abortion in one of Europe's most devoutly Catholic countries, with activists saying she could still be alive if it were not for a near total ban on terminating pregnancies.
Tens of thousands of Poles took to the streets to protest in January this year when a Constitutional Tribunal ruling from October 2020 that terminating pregnancies with foetal defects was unconstitutional came into effect, eliminating the most frequently used case for legal abortion.
Activists say Izabela, a 30-year-old woman in the 22nd week of pregnancy who her family said died of septic shock after doctors waited for her unborn baby's heart to stop beating, is the first woman to die as a result of the ruling.
The government says the ruling was not to blame for her death, rather an error by doctors.
Izabela went to hospital in September after her waters broke, her family said. Scans had previously shown numerous defects in the foetus.
""The baby weighs 485 grams. For now, thanks to the abortion law, I have to lie down. And there is nothing they can do. They'll wait until it dies or something begins, and if not, I can expect sepsis,"" Izabela said in a text message to her mother, private broadcaster TVN24 reported.
When a scan showed the foetus was dead, doctors at the hospital in Pszczyna, southern Poland, decided to perform a Caesarean. The family's lawyer, Jolanta Budzowska, said Izabela's heart stopped on the way to the operating theatre and she died despite efforts to resuscitate her.
""I couldn't believe it, I thought it wasn't true,"" Izabela's mother Barbara told TVN24. ""How could such a thing happen to her in the hospital? After all, she went there for help.""
Budzowska has started legal action over the treatment Izabela received, accusing doctors of malpractice, but she also called the death ""a consequence of the verdict"". 
In a statement on its website, the Pszczyna County Hospital said it shared the pain of all those affected by Izabela's death, especially her family.
""It should ... be emphasised that all medical decisions were made taking into account the legal provisions and standards of conduct in force in Poland,"" the hospital said.
On Friday, the hospital said it had suspended two doctors who were on duty at the time of the death.
The Supreme Medical Chamber, which represents Polish doctors, said it was not immediately able to comment.
NOT ONE MORE
When the case came to public attention as a result of a tweet from Budzowska, the hashtag #anijednejwiecej or 'not one more' spread across social media and was taken up by protesters demanding a change to the law.
However, Poland's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party rejects claims that the Constitutional Tribunal ruling was to blame for Izabela's death, attributing it to a mistake by doctors.
""When it comes to the life and health of the mother ... if it is in danger, then terminating the pregnancy is possible and the ruling does not change anything,"" Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Friday.
PiS lawmaker Bartlomiej Wroblewski told Reuters that the case should not be ""instrumentalised and used to limit the right to life, to kill all sick or disabled children"". 
But activists say the ruling has made doctors scared to terminate pregnancies even when the mother's life is at risk.
""Izabela's case clearly shows that the ruling of the Constitutional Tribunal has had a chilling effect on doctors,"" Urszula Grycuk of the Federation for Women and Family Planning told Reuters.
""Even a condition that should not be questioned - the life and health of the mother - is not always recognised by doctors because they are afraid.""
In Ireland, the death of 31-year-old Savita Halappanavar in 2012 after she was refused a termination provoked a national outpouring of grief credited by many as a catalyst for the liberalisation of abortion laws.
Budzowska told Reuters that a debate similar to the one that took place in Ireland was underway in Poland.

""Both Izabela's family and I personally hope that this case ... will lead to a change in the law in Poland,"" she said. 
Poland's president proposed changing the law last year to make abortions possible in cases where the foetus was not viable. The Law and Justice dominated parliament has yet to debate the bill.

The body of the 35-year-old man was found early on Oct. 19 by Berlin police officers guarding the building, the magazine said. Quoting security sources, it said the man had fallen from an upper floor at the embassy.
The officers called an ambulance, but medics were unable to resuscitate him, it added.
The embassy confirmed in a statement to Interfax news agency that a Russian diplomat had died but said it was ""not commenting on this tragic event for ethical reasons"".
Berlin police declined to comment and directed all questions to public prosecutors, who said they could neither confirm nor deny the Der Spiegel report. The discovery of a body outside the Russian diplomatic mission had not previously been reported.
Security sources told the magazine it was unclear how the diplomat had fallen and what had caused his death. The Russian Embassy had not agreed to an autopsy, Der Spiegel said.
""All formalities linked to repatriating the body of the diplomat were promptly settled with the responsible law enforcement and medical authorities of Germany in accordance with the practices in place,"" the embassy said in its statement to Interfax. 
The man, who has not been named, was officially listed as a second secretary at the embassy, the magazine said. He was also a relative of a Russia-based senior officer of the FSB's second directorate, which deals with anti-terrorism.

The embassy did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the Spiegel report.
A German Foreign Ministry spokesman told a regular news briefing on Friday that the German government was aware of the death of a Russian diplomat in Berlin but could not give any details.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Last month, several thousand Hong Kong university students, some of them under the watch of a CCTV camera, were the first to take compulsory courses on the territory’s national security law.
The content of the courses, some of which Reuters has seenexclusively, sets out the dangers of breaking the law, in onecase demonstrating how a message in a chat group could beinterpreted as a serious breach, punishable by up to life inprison. 
At Hong Kong Baptist University, at least one CCTV camerawas present in the lecture hall, while an unidentifiedphotographer took pictures, according to two students whoattended.
Critics said the courses represent an attack on academic freedom in Hong Kong's Western-style university education system. 
""In principle, making requirements on particular classes isa very serious infringement of academic freedom,"" said KatrinKinzelbach, a political scientist at the University ofErlangen-Nuremberg in Germany, who has conducted extensiveresearch into academic freedom at universities around the world.
""Academic freedom means you may study and teach what you areinterested in. It also means the freedom to not engage inparticular classes.""
Hong Kong's national security law, imposed by Beijing lastyear, itself stipulates that national security must be taught inschools and universities. Hong Kong’s Education Secretary KevinYeung said earlier this year that it was a ""requirement"" forhigher education institutions to incorporate national securityeducation into their curriculum, according to a governmentstatement. 
The law punishes anything Beijing regards as secession,subversion, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces with upto life in prison.
A spokeswoman for Hong Kong's Education Bureau said in an emailed response to Reuters that it is a ""statutory obligation"" to promote national security education in universities. 
""The community would expect the universities to uphold good governance and accountability to the public, and their operations have to comply with the law and meet the interests of students and the community at large,"" the spokeswoman said.
The bureau, added, however, that academic freedom and institutional autonomy ""are important social values treasured"" by the Hong Kong government and enshrined in local laws. 
Baptist University, a publicly funded liberal arts collegewith a Christian heritage, did not immediately reply to arequest for comment on its course or why a CCTV camera waspresent in the lecture hall. 
The introduction of the courses is the latest move by thepro-Beijing government to clamp down on universities and theirstudents, which Hong Kong and Chinese authorities blamed forstoking and leading some of the occasionally violentpro-democracy protests that took place in 2019. 
Almost 4,000 of the 10,000-or-so people arrested in connection with the protests were students, according to police.
Since the introduction of the national security law, at least six liberal academics have been forced from theiruniversity jobs, according to a Reuters tally, while studentunions have been disbanded or ousted from campuses and studentleaders arrested. Starting next year, universities will berequired to raise China's national flag daily, according toeducation secretary Yeung. 
Critics say the clampdown is part of a broader move toneutralise the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. More than150 people, including many opposition politicians, have beenarrested for endangering national security over the past 16months, while schools, churches, libraries, booksellers andfilm-makers have all been subject to tighter scrutiny. 
‘MS NAUGHTY’ AND ‘MR BREACH’ 
Hong Kong, a global financial hub with a population of 7.5 million, has four universities in the top 100 of the Times Higher Education World University Rankings. Until recently it was regarded as one of Asia's freest academic arenas, largely alegacy of British colonial rule that ended in 1997 when thecity was handed back to China. 
Hong Kong's schools and universities are now being forced tointegrate national security and patriotic themes into theirteaching, bringing them closer into line with education inmainland China.
Four of the city's eight publicly funded universities -Baptist University, Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU),Lingnan University and Education University of Hong Kong - havelaunched national security lectures, seminars or talks as agraduation requirement. Hong Kong Metropolitan University, whichis self-funded, told Reuters it would soon launch such a coursebut declined to specify when it would start. 
The courses outline the national security law’s 66 articles,detailing how they might be breached, while stressing the needfor greater patriotism and national Chinese identity, accordingto course materials from two Hong Kong universities seen byReuters, and interviews with five students. 
The courses include the history of Hong Kong and China,highlighting the subjugation of China by foreign powers in thepast, and reference the existence of national security laws inlarge democratic countries such as the United States andBritain. 
At Baptist University, the course took the form of atwo-hour seminar by pro-Beijing lawyer Alex Fan, who previouslyworked at Hong Kong's Department of Justice. In the seminar, hewarned students of the sweeping powers of the security law andthe severity of punishments for breaking it, according to a200-page PowerPoint presentation seen by Reuters.
The presentation was followed by a compulsory 20-questionmultiple-choice test, seen by Reuters, in which students had toidentify security law violations by characters with names suchas ""Ms Naughty"" and ""Mr Breach"". Several students told Reutersthey failed the test. 
One question in the test described a situation where ""MsNaughty"" asks members of a group on messaging app Telegram toblock commuter trains to stop people getting to work, with theaim of ""compelling"" the government to implement universalsuffrage for the city's legislature. 
That was a tactic adopted by pro-democracy protesters in 2019 to achieve one of their five key demands, fiercely opposed by Beijing. Four choices were offered: incitement to secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces. Each of those are punishable by up to life in prison under the national security law. 
At PolyU, the site of violent clashes between students andpolice in 2019, a 109-page PowerPoint presentation for itsnational security course seen by Reuters paraphrases the Englishliberal philosopher John Locke: ""The right to punish isessential to the (social) contract and to morality"". 
In one section the presentation asks: ""Is criticizing thegovernment a crime under the national security law?"" 
The answer given is: ""It depends. If the criticism involves any of the four major crimes under the national security law (secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with external forces), it may be counted as a crime"".
In response to Reuters’ questions about the course, arepresentative for PolyU said the university ""places a strongemphasis on whole-person development and value education"" andthat the course was necessary to help students ""develop a clearunderstanding of issues relating to national security in thecity"".
STUDENT REACTION
Students' reaction to the new course at Baptist Universityranged from fear to approval. 
""I'm scared that my university assignments might get me intotrouble,"" said one 19-year-old Hong Kong student who identifiedherself only as Mandy. ""I'm scared that the government willcharge me with crimes I didn't commit because of my coursework.""
The course was an attempt at ""mind restructuring,"" saidanother Hong Kong student, who identified himself as Michael.
""If you are going to do something, you'll do it,"" said athird student, who identified herself as Lulu. ""It's useless. Iwon't become patriotic after a two-hour talk."" 

Leo, an 18-year-old from mainland China, welcomed thecourse, saying that Western countries had influenced thethoughts of students in Hong Kong and they lacked awareness ofnational security. 
""Mainland students have been immersed in that educationsince we were small,"" he told Reuters. ""Deep in our hearts, wehave a strong sense of identity towards our country, unlikethose in Hong Kong.""

(Reuters) - When Daniel Ortega lost Nicaragua's presidential election to Violeta Chamorro in 1990, the defeat left a deep mark on the leftist leader. Battling 16 years to regain the presidency, his opponents say he is now determined to retain power at any cost.
Recent years have borne that out. In April 2018, after mass street protests against Ortega's rule put his presidency in jeopardy, the former Marxist guerrilla sent in the police and paramilitary forces to crush the protesters.
More than 300 people were killed and thousands injured in the crackdown.
Three years later, Ortega and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo, again employed authoritarian tactics to keep a grip on power: imprisoning dozens of opponents, including seven candidates for the presidency.
The United States and European Union have said they do not expect Sunday's election to be free and fair. 
""Daniel Ortega and Rosario Murillo's goal is to remove any possible doubts about their survival in power,"" said Tiziano Breda, an analyst at the International Crisis Group think tank.
Murillo, who is also the government spokeswoman, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
Ortega, whose second stint in power began in 2007, is now poised to stay as Nicaragua's leader until 2027.
A constant companion has been Murillo, who he married in 2005 and made vice president in 2017. The 70-year-old poet has become one of the most controversial and ubiquitous figures in Nicaragua, the second poorest country in the Americas.
With Ortega rarely making public appearances, Murillo has become the face of the government. She appears daily on radio and television channels controlled by her family to tout the government's work and rail against political foes. Neither speaks about why they are seeking re-election.
CROSSED PATHS
Ortega, born on Nov. 11, 1945, was raised in a middle-class family that opposed the regime of dictator Anastasio Somoza.
In 1963 he dropped out of university and joined the leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN). In 1967, aged 22, Ortega was jailed for a bank robbery, spending seven years in prison until he was released in a prisoner exchange with high-ranking officials of the Somoza government.
Murillo is from Nicaragua's elite. Born in 1951 to a family of cotton farmers, she is related to General Augusto Sandino, a Nicaraguan revolutionary who gave his name to the FSLN.
After studying in Britain and Switzerland, Murillo aged 18 joined the FSLN guerrillas fighting Somoza.
As well as reading and writing poems, she hid guerrilla fighters in her house in Managua. Murillo was briefly imprisoned by the Somoza regime and went into exile in Costa Rica in 1977, where she became romantically involved with Ortega.
In 1979, Ortega and Murillo returned to Managua to help the Sandinistas overthrow Somoza, the last dictator of a U.S.-backed family dynasty established in the 1930s. The couple have since had seven children.
""The two of them are different but complementary, and when they get together, they're the harmful and unscrupulous force that governs Nicaragua,"" said Fabian Medina, author of a biography of Ortega, ""Prisoner 198.""
""Ortega is passive, introverted, backed by his years of imprisonment and guerrilla warfare in the Sandinista Front and with zero empathy for the suffering of others. Murillo is impetuous, vindictive, outgoing and with inexhaustible energy.""
Murillo, known for her gaudy hippie-style outfits and using flowery religious language in speeches, is due to succeed Ortega if he cannot finish his term. For years rumors have circulated that Ortega is in poor health, diplomats and analysts say.
LEFTIST HERO
Ortega first tasted real power in 1981 as head of the junta which governed Nicaragua after the Sandinistas successfully overthrew Somoza. In 1984 the country held its first democratic elections in almost half a century and Ortega won by a landslide. International observers declared the elections credible and fair.
Washington did not want a Marxist government in its 'backyard' and supported and funded the right-wing 'Contras,' armed insurgents that attempted to overthrow the FSLN. Ortega and the Sandinistas became international heroes for the left, seen by many as the plucky David standing up to the U.S. Goliath.
But the Contra war, along with Washington's economic embargo against Nicaragua and the Sandinistas' mismanagement, laid waste to the economy, which eroded Ortega's popularity and led to his defeat in the 1990 presidential elections. Further runs at the presidency failed.
Ortega's reputation was dealt a major blow in 1998 when Zoilamerica Ortega Murillo, Murillo's daughter from a previous marriage, accused Ortega of sexually abusing her since she was 11. Murillo called her daughter a ""madwoman"", a ""liar"" and a ""traitor."" Ortega has never spoken publicly on the subject.

Ortega rode out the scandal and in 2006 was elected president again. Those who knew the couple say something changed from that point.
""Without political power, they cannot survive,"" Zoilamerica, speaking from exile in Costa Rica, told Reuters earlier this year.

NAIROBI(Reuters) - Rebellious forces from Ethiopia's Tigray region have pushed to within a day's drive of the capital Addis Ababa and are threatening to march on the city of 5 million people.
But any denouement to the year-long war could take far longer to play out.
Forces loyal to the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF)would have to fight through hostile territory in the neighbouring region of Amhara to reach Addis.
They could also face resistance from other Ethiopians who fear the return to power of a party that ruled with an iron fist for the nearly three decades it dominated central government before Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office in 2018.
Oromiya, the region that surrounds Addis Ababa, is divided. Abiy is part Oromo and support from Ethiopia's largest ethnic group helped propel him to power after years of anti-government protests.
He lost some of that support when security forces detained thousands of Oromos, some of whom accused him of not doing enough for the community. Several Oromo leaders were also detained in the wake of deadly riots that killed hundreds. 
The TPLF has since forged an alliance with the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), which is also fighting the central government. This week, both groups said they had seized strategic towns in Amhara and were considering advancing on Addis Ababa. 
On Friday, the TPLF and OLA were due to sign an alliance in Washington with seven other rebel groups. 
Billene Seyoum, the prime minister's spokeswoman, said the alliance could not be relied on to deliver democracy.
""The opening up of the political space three years ago provided ample opportunity for contenders to settle their differences at the ballot box in June 2021,"" she said in a tweet.
Regional diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the threats to march on Addis could be a tactic to try to force Abiy into negotiations or to step down. TPLF spokesman Getachew Reda, who did not respond to requests for comment, has said there should be an interim government and Abiy should be put on trial. 
Ethiopian officials have accused Tigrayan forces of exaggerating territorial gains. Spokespeople for the government and military did not return calls seeking comment on the threats by both groups. 
Tigrayan forces could instead try to increase pressure on Abiy's government by cutting off the landlocked country from the region's main seaport. They could also enter the capital with or behind their Oromo allies.
""The operation will be spearheaded by the OLA,"" said Oda Tarbii, an OLA spokesman. ""This is simply our land and therefore within our jurisdiction.""
HOSTILITY IN CAPITAL
The conflict in what was once considered a stable Western ally in a volatile region has killed thousands of people, plunged around 400,000 in Tigray into famine, and sent more than 2.5 million fleeing their homes.
Abiy sent troops into Tigray last November, accusing its governing party, the TPLF, of mounting surprise attacks on military bases in the region. The TPLF said it acted because the military was preparing to strike after the region held an election in September 2020 in defiance of federal orders.
Forces from Amhara, Ethiopia's second most-populous region, mobilized in support of Abiy's government. Tigray and Amhara have a long-running border dispute, and Amhara took control of territory in the west of Tigray. Violence has also flared along the Oromo-Amhara border.
William Davison, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group think tank, said there could be a severe backlash if Tigrayan and Oromo forces took the capital. 
""Amhara region might go into outright rebellion if the Tigray forces with OLA control Addis Ababa. Amharas are not only angry at the TPLF and OLA but also at federal leaders for leaving Amhara exposed,"" he said. 
Fighting their way into the capital - home to the African Union headquarters and many international delegations - could be bloody. 
Addis Ababa has been a hotbed of opposition to TPLF rule since the party oversaw a crackdown https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL26284307 that netted 30,000 people following elections in 2005. 
""I don't think TPLF will make it to Addis Ababa. I am not scared at all,"" said Teferi Mekonnen, a 30-year-old employee at a petrol station, on Thursday. ""If the government gives me a weapon and asks me to fight, I will. No one is willing to see them back.""
Abiy might also call on Eritrea for help again. Eritrean troops entered Tigray in November to support Ethiopian soldiers; they mostly pulled out in June after a a flood of reports of mass killings of civilians and gang rapes. Eritrea has denied committing abuses. 
Calls are growing from international partners for a ceasefire and talks, including from regional heavyweights Uganda and Kenya and donors like the European Union and United States, which suspended Ethiopia's valued duty-free trade access this week. 

So far there is little sign either side wants talks. But a few Ethiopian voices are starting to publicly call for peace. 
""Abiy's authority has remained intact so far,"" said Davison. ""But given all the pressure, it is possible that the floodgates (of discontent) could open.""

Beijing issued its first heavy pollution alert for the fall and winter on Thursday, requiring the suspension of some outdoor construction, factory operations and outdoor school activities.
Visibility has been severely limited with the top of the city's tallest buildings vanishing in the haze.
The heavily industrialised Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region often suffers from heavy smog in the fall and winter, especially on days without wind.
A cold wave arriving from Siberia over the weekend is expected to disperse the pollution.
China aims to cut concentrations of hazardous, small airborne particles known as PM2.5 by an average of 4% year on year in main cities this winter, the environment ministry said last month. 
The PM2.5 level in urban areas reached as high as 234 micrograms per cubic metre on Friday, according to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, indicating very unhealthy air. 

China's overall 2021-22 winter campaign against pollution will be waged in as many as 64 cities throughout the industrialised, smog-prone north, the ministry said in September.
China is due to host the Winter Olympics in Beijing and the nearby city of Zhangjiakou on Feb. 4-20.

Donna Heinel had been slated to face a federal jury in Boston later this month in the second trial to arise from the U.S. college admissions scandal. She instead will plead guilty to honest services wire fraud, prosecutors said on Thursday.
Prosecutors alleged she accepted bribes from the California college admissions consultant who masterminded the scheme, William ""Rick"" Singer, in exchange for designating his clients' children as athletic recruits.
Her plea deal came after two fathers, former casino executive Gamal Aziz and private equity firm founder John Wilson, were convicted in the first trial in the scandal of trying to buy their children's way into USC.
Under her plea deal, Heinel agreed not to appeal any prison sentence of 46 months of less and forfeit $160,000. A federal judge scheduled a plea hearing for Friday.
Her lawyer, Nina Marino, said she ""did the honorable thing.""
Heinel is among 57 people who were charged in the ""Operation Varsity Blues"" investigation, which ensnared business executives and celebrities and exposed inequalities in U.S. higher education.
Singer pleaded guilty in 2019 to facilitating cheating on college entrance exams and funneling money from the parents to corrupt coaches and university athletic officials to secure the admission of their children as phony athletes.
Forty-eight people have agreed to plead guilty, including ""Full House"" actress Lori Loughlin and ""Desperate Housewives"" star Felicity Huffman.

Prosecutors said Singer's clients from 2014 to 2018 made more than $1.3 million in payments to USC accounts that Heinel designated and professionally benefited from.
Prosecutors said that beginning in 2017, she was also paid $20,000 per month through a sham consulting agreement with Singer. In exchange, Heinel facilitated the admission of more than two dozen students.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A study released on Friday by an Australian university looking at multiple catastrophes hitting the Great Barrier Reef has found for the first time that only 2% of its area has escaped bleaching since 1998, then the world's hottest year on record.
If global warming is kept to 1.5 degrees, the maximum rise in average global temperature that was the focus of the COP26 United Nations climate conference, the mix of corals on the Barrier Reef will change but it could still thrive, said the study's lead author Professor Terry Hughes, of the Australian Research Council's Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies. 
""If we can hold global warming to 1.5 degrees global average warming then I think we'll still have a vibrant Great Barrier Reef,"" he said. 
Bleaching is a stress response by overheated corals during heat waves, where they lose their colour and many struggle to survive. Eighty percent of the World Heritage-listed wonder has been bleached severely at least once since 2016, the study by James Cook University in Australia's Queensland state found. 
""Even the most remote, most pristine parts of the Great Barrier Reef have now bleached severely at least once,"" Hughes said. 
The study found the corals adapted to have a higher heat threshold if they had survived a previous bleaching event, but the gap between bleaching events has shrunk, giving the reefs less time to recover between each episode. 
Australia, which last week said it would not back a pledge led by the United States and the European Union to cut methane emissions, needs to do more to cut greenhouse gas emissions, Hughes said.
""The government is still issuing permits for new coal mines and for new methane gas deals and it's simply irresponsible in terms of Australia's responsibilities to the Great Barrier Reef,"" he said.

The Great Barrier Reef is comprised of more than 3,000 individual reefs stretching for 2,300km (1,429 miles). The ecosystem supports 65,000 jobs in reef tourism. Globally, hundreds of millions of people depend on the survival of coral reefs for their livelihoods and food security. 
""If we go to 3, 4 degrees of global average warming which is tragically the trajectory we are currently on, then there won't be much left of the Great Barrier Reef or any other coral reefs throughout the tropics,"" Hughes told Reuters.

PORTLAND, Ore. (Reuters) - Union leaders for 3,400 nurses and other medical staff at Kaiser Permanente in Oregon set a Nov. 15 strike deadline on Thursday, threatening a walkout they said would idle some 30,000 workers overall unless contract talks make suitable progress.
The Oregon Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals is at odds with Kaiser over the medical network's plan for a two-tiered wage system featuring a lower pay scale for newly hired employees than their more senior colleagues.
The union says such a system would deepen what the nurses describe as a staffing crisis in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic.
Labor leaders cite a survey of Kaiser nurses and other healthcare workers that found 42% were considering leaving the field over perceptions of mistreatment.
Kaiser ranks as one of the nation's largest not-for-profit healthcare networks and managed-care organizations, with nearly 12.5 million plan members and operating revenues of nearly $24 billion last quarter.
The health network issued a statement saying it was ""still hopeful that a labor disruption will be averted through our continued negotiations.""
Kaiser added that its union workforce in ""many areas"" of the country earn wages 26% to 38% above average market rates, which the union called inaccurate.
The union's rank-and-file voted overwhelmingly on Oct. 11 to authorize a strike.
""Striking is out last resort, but it is what we must do so that we can protect our patients, our workers, and our entire public healthcare system,"" union president Jodi Barschow, president of the Oregon Federation of Nurses, said in a statement announcing the strike deadline.
The union's nearly 3,400 members in Oregon and southwestern Washington state - registered nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and lab technicians - will walk off the job starting 6 a.m. on Nov. 15 ""unless negotiations improve"" beforehand, the statement said.
The union said another 32,000 Kaiser workers from affiliated unions would effectively join the strike by refusing to cross picket lines, and that 8,000 more may follow shortly afterward in California, Washington, Hawaii and Colorado. 
Kaiser operates 64 facilities in Oregon and southwestern Washington, including two hospitals and six urgent-care clinics.
Kaiser and unions representing more than 80,000 healthcare workers in California and six other states reached a labor contract in September 2019 that averted a strike. 
The latest standoff comes amid a year of labor unrest across the United States on a variety of fronts, including a United Auto Workers union strike against tractor manufacturer John Deere (NYSE:DE).

KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) - (Note language in 4th paragraph.)
A critical witness in the murder trial of U.S. teenager Kyle Rittenhouse said on Thursday that one of the three men shot during protests in Wisconsin last year cursed and lunged for the defendant's military-style rifle before he fired.
The testimony from Richie McGinniss, a journalist who was recording video in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Aug. 25, 2020, when the shootings took place, could bolster the defense's argument that Rittenhouse, then 17, feared for his life.
Rittenhouse, 18, a resident of Antioch, Illinois, is charged with reckless and intentional homicides in the killing of Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and attempted homicide for wounding Gaige Grosskreutz, now 27, with a bullet to the arm.
McGinniss - chief video director of the Daily Caller, a conservative website - said Rosenbaum yelled: ""Fuck you!"" as he advanced toward Rittenhouse in the parking lot of a used car dealership and then lunged for the youth's semi-automatic rifle.
McGinniss, who re-enacted the scene, crouching and lunging forward with both arms from the stand, said it appeared that Rosenbaum ""was grabbing for the front portion"" of Rittenhouse's weapon before the teen shot him four times.
McGinniss has been seen as a crucial witness because he was close by when Rittenhouse turned and shot Rosenbaum. That violent encounter stirred up the crowd, setting the stage for the shootings of Huber and Grosskreutz minutes later.
As Kenosha County Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger played a video of Rosenbaum lying wounded on the ground, motionless and groaning loudly, McGinniss appeared to struggle to maintain his composure, breathing rapidly and averting his eyes from the monitor. McGinnis escorted Rosenbaum to the hospital where he was confirmed dead. 
When McGinnis testified that Rittenhouse was able to initially dodge Rosenbaum's advance, moving his weapon out of his reach, Binger asked if that meant Rosenbaum was no longer a threat to the teenager.
McGinnis said Rosenbaum and Rittenhouse were still ""extremely close"" to each other and it was not clear to him ""what would have happened if those shots hadn’t been fired."" 
Ryan Balch, a military veteran who was among the armed men with Rittenhouse at the used car dealership they said they were protecting, testified that Rosenbaum was acting in a ""violent"" manner that night, throwing rocks and trying to set fires.
Balch said that in one earlier encounter, Rosenbaum threatened to kill him and Rittenhouse ""if he caught them alone.""
""Every encounter I saw him have with someone was extremely aggressive,"" Balch said.
JUROR DISMISSED OVER JOKE 
Earlier on Thursday, the trial judge dismissed a juror because he told a joke about the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man whose wounding by a policeman on Aug. 23, 2020, sparked the protests in Kenosha.
""The public needs to be confident that this is a fair trial,"" Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder told the juror, an older white man who declined to repeat the joke he told to a sheriff's deputy outside the courtroom this week.
""It had nothing to do with the case,"" the man told the judge. 
It was ""bad judgment to tell a joke of that nature,"" Schroeder said, adding he had no choice but to remove the man from the jury.

Blake was shot several times in the back, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. Prosecutors cleared the policeman of any wrongdoing, saying he acted in self-defense. Blake has sued him.

BRUNSWICK, Ga. (Reuters) -A Georgia judge ruled on Thursday that the jury in the trial of three white men charged with murdering Ahmaud Arbery, a Black jogger, will not see a toxicology report showing that a small amount of THC, a psychoactive compound in marijuana, was found in Arbery's blood.
The jury is due to be sworn in and hear opening statements on Friday morning in Glynn County Superior Court about the deadly shooting that took place on Feb. 23, 2020, when Arbery went on an afternoon run through the mostly white residential neighborhood of Satilla Shores.
On Thursday, Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley heard arguments about what evidence can be presented to jurors.
Lawyers for Travis McMichael, his father Gregory McMichael and their neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan say the three men acted in self-defense after they chased down and cornered the 25-year-old Arbery.
Police say Travis McMichael, 35, fired a shotgun three times after Arbery initially grappled with the weapon and then turned to run. Defense lawyers say the men were trying to make a citizen's arrest of someone they thought resembled a burglar.
Arbery went into a construction site during his run, but the owner of the property said he believed Arbery stopped only for a drink of water and nothing was taken.
The defendants' lawyers asked to exclude graphic video taken from a responding police officer's body-worn camera that shows the wounds on Arbery's body. Walmsley sided with prosecutors that the jury were entitled to see how the body was found.
The defense has also sought to tell the jury that Arbery had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, and that smoking marijuana can cause aggression in someone with this condition. The judge previously ruled that Arbery's mental health records are not admissible as evidence, and warned defense lawyers against using the THC toxicology report as a way to bring up Arbery's mental health before the jury.
Prosecutors from the Cobb County district attorney's office said initial tests on Arbery's body found no trace of drugs. A second test found 3.2 nanograms per milliliter of THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, in his blood, which they called a tiny amount.
Linda Dunikoski, the lead prosecutor, said the toxicology reports were irrelevant to the case: ""Why Mr. Arbery did anything he did is completely irrelevant. The question is about what the defendants did, and they knew nothing about what was in his system.""
VANITY PLATE
The judge said he was still considering a defense request that the jury not see any images of Travis McMichael's pickup truck where the vanity plate he affixed to it last year is visible. The plate features a large image of the old Georgia flag, which incorporates the Confederate battle flag.
Jason Sheffield, a lawyer for the younger McMichael, said while his client may say it was a symbol of Southern pride, the prosecution was planning to argue that the plate ""is a racist statement by the defendant.""
Prosecutors said they had a right to raise it.

""If Travis McMichael takes the stand,"" Dunikoski said, ""we're going to ask him why do you have that on the front of the truck?""
It took more than two weeks to questions potential jurors from Glynn County, which is 70% white, before a jury of 11 white people and one Black person was selected on Wednesday.

The U.S. special envoy for the Horn of Africa, Jeffrey Feltman, arrived in Addis Ababa to press for a halt to military operations and a start to ceasefire talks.
African Union Commission Chair Moussa Faki Mahamat said he met Feltman to discuss efforts towards dialogue and political solutions to the conflict, which pits the central government against the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and its allies.
The United Nations Security Council will meet publicly on Ethiopia on Friday at the request of Ireland, Kenya, Niger, Tunisia and St Vincent and the Grenadines, diplomats said.
The European Union and the East African bloc the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) joined the chorus of bodies calling for a ceasefire. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni announced an IGAD meeting on Nov. 16 to discuss the war.
Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta urged the rival parties to lay down their arms and find a path to peace. 
""The fighting must stop!"" he said in a statement.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he had spoken to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on Wednesday and offered to help create the conditions for a dialogue.
The government brushed off the calls for talks, said new recruits were heeding the call to fight on the government side and accused the Tigrayan forces of exaggerating their territorial gains.
""We are fighting an existential war,"" it said in a statement issued by its communication service. 
Abiy's government declared a state of emergency https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/addis-ababa-government-urges-residents-register-arms-media-2021-11-02 on Tuesday as the Tigrayan forces threatened to push forward to Addis Ababa.
ADDIS ARRESTS
TPLF spokesman Getachew Reda said on Wednesday TPLF troops were in the town of Kemise in Amhara state, 325 km (200 miles) from the capital. Government and military spokespeople did not return calls seeking comment on his account. 
The U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa authorised the voluntary departure of some staff and family members because of the intensifying hostilities. Washington said on Wednesday https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/us-gravely-concerned-by-escalating-violence-ethiopia-ahead-envoys-visit-2021-11-03 it was ""gravely concerned"" about the situation and called for ceasefire talks and a halt to military operations.
The year-long conflict has killed thousands of people, forced more than 2 million more from their homes and left 400,000 people in Tigray facing famine.
The United States, the European Union and the United Nations said a de facto government blockade in Tigray must end to avert a large-scale famine. The government had denied blocking aid. 
No humanitarian convoys have entered Tigray since Oct. 18 and no fuel to aid the humanitarian response has entered since early August, according to the United Nations.
Streets and shops in Addis Ababa, a city of around 5 million people, were busy as usual on Thursday morning, though some residents said there was a feeling of uneasy calm.
""There are rumours about the approach of the rebels. People debate about the conflict; most of the people accuse the government for what happened,"" said one man, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Police had arrested ""many people"" in Addis Ababa since the government declared the state of emergency, police spokesperson Fasika Fanta said on Thursday.
Residents told Reuters on Wednesday many Tigrayans had been arrested. Fasika said arrests were not based on ethnicity.
YEAR-OLD CONFLICT 
""We are only arresting those who are directly or indirectly supporting the illegal terrorist group,"" Fasika said. ""This includes moral, financial and propaganda support."" 
He also said many people were registering weapons at police stations around the city in line with a government directive issued on Tuesday for people to prepare to defend their neighbourhoods.
""Some are even coming with bombs and heavy weapons. We are registering those too,"" he said.
Government spokesperson Legesse Tulu did not respond to requests for comment.
The conflict started a year ago when forces loyal to the TPLF, including some soldiers, seized military bases in Tigray. In response, Abiy sent more troops to the northern region.
The TPLF had dominated national politics for nearly three decades but lost much influence when Abiy took office in 2018.
The TPLF accused him of centralising power at the expense of regional states - which Abiy denies. 
TPLF spokesman Getachew on Wednesday pledged to minimise casualties in any drive to take Addis Ababa.
""We don't intend to shoot at civilians and we don't want bloodshed. If possible we would like the process to be peaceful,"" he said. 
A regional analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the TPLF was likely to hold off on any advance on Addis Ababa until they secured the highway running from neighbouring Djibouti to the capital.

Abiy's spokesperson, Billene Seyoum, accused the international media of being ""overly alarmist"" in its coverage of Ethiopia.
""Perpetuating terrorist propaganda as truth from offices far off and detached from the ground is highly unethical,"" she said in a tweet.

738,"<span>Nov 04, 2021 04:46PM ET</span>","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday scheduled a Jan. 4, 2022 hearing where lawyers for Britain's Prince Andrew are expected to argue for a dismissal of Virginia Giuffre's lawsuit accusing the Duke of York of sexually abusing her when she was under 18.
U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan issued the scheduling order one day after saying he expected https://www.reuters.com/world/us-judge-targets-late-2022-civil-trial-prince-andrew-sex-abuse-case-2021-11-03 Giuffre's civil case to go to trial between September and December 2022, provided it is not settled or dismissed.
Giuffre, 38, sued Andrew for unspecified damages in August.
She accused Queen Elizabeth's second son of forcing her to have sex more than two decades ago at the London home of British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, and abusing her at two homes belonging to financier Jeffrey Epstein.
Andrew, 61, has denied Giuffre's claims, and accused her of trying to profit from accusations against Epstein, who Giuffre says also abused her, and people who knew him. The prince has not been charged with crimes.

Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. A medical examiner called his death a suicide.
Maxwell has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges she helped recruit and groom underage girls for Epstein to abuse. Her trial begins on Nov. 29.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. federal grand jury has indicted the Russian analyst who contributed to the ""Steele dossier"" alleging potential ties between Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign and Russia, a special prosecutor investigating the matter said on Thursday.
Analyst Igor Danchenko is accused of five counts of making false statements to the FBI relating to sources for the material he gave a British firm that prepared the dossier, said John Durham, the special prosecutor appointed by the U.S. Justice Department during Trump's administration.
At a brief hearing on Thursday in Alexandria, Virginia, U.S. Magistrate Judge Theresa Buchanan ordered Danchenko's pretrial release on $100,000 unsecured bail after his lawyer told the court he lived with his family in Virginia. 
Danchenko's lawyer indicated his client would plead not guilty to the charges although his plea was not formally entered. A prosecutor said that, if convicted, Danchenko could face up to five years in prison on each count of his indictment.
The indictment alleges that between June and November 2017, Danchenko made false statements regarding the sources of certain information he provided to a British investigative firm which Durham did not identify.
Sources identified the firm to Reuters as having been linked to former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele.
The dossier, which was circulated to the FBI and media outlets before the November 2016 election, set out still-unproven assertions that Russia had embarrassing information about and some of his Republican campaign's advisers and that Moscow was working behind the scenes to defeat his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. 
The indictment alleges Danchenko made false statements about information he said he had received from an anonymous caller who claimed the Kremlin might have been helping to get Trump elected. It says Danchenko knew the information to be untrue.
A lawyer for Danchenko did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Two sources familiar with Durham's activities said he had issued subpoenas seeking evidence from multiple sources, including people linked to Fusion GPS, the Washington investigations firm that commissioned the dossier.
Steele is a former British intelligence officer who prepared the dossier for Fusion GPS, which was working for a law firm that represented the Democratic Party and Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign.

Steele declined to comment in an emailed message.
One of the sources familiar with Durham's activities said Fusion GPS was not a target of Durham's investigation. Steele had previously declined https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-steele/british-ex-spy-will-not-talk-to-u-s-prosecutor-examining-trump-probe-origins-source-idUSKCN1SY20K to cooperate with investigators working for Durham.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -It has been two years since Jeffrey Epstein hanged himself in a Manhattan jail cell, but the publicity surrounding the deceased financier will make it hard to find an unbiased jury for former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell's upcoming sex abuse trial, according to her defense lawyers and legal experts
Prospective jurors began filling out 24-page questionnaires in federal court in Manhattan on Thursday to assess whether they can fairly judge https://www.reuters.com/world/us/maxwell-accusers-can-be-called-victims-sex-crimes-trial-judge-rules-2021-11-01 Maxwell, a British socialite who U.S. prosecutors say recruited and groomed underage girls https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ghislaine-maxwell-loses-bid-dismiss-sex-trafficking-indictment-despite-cosby-2021-08-13 for Epstein to abuse. 
Epstein, a well-connected money manager who once counted Britain's Prince Andrew and billionaire Leon Black among his associates, died by suicide in a Manhattan jail in 2019 following his arrest on sex trafficking charges. 
Maxwell's lawyers have said ""intense negative media coverage"" of Maxwell and Epstein, including podcasts and documentaries on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and other platforms, have tainted the jury pool for her trial, which is expected to start on Nov. 29. 
Prosecutors say that Maxwell, 59, recruited and groomed four underage girls for Epstein to abuse from 1994 to 2004. 
Maxwell, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges, is the highest-profile woman to be tried on sexual abuse charges since the start of the #MeToo movement. 
Her lawyers have said this has fueled the ""vitriolic"" coverage about Maxwell since her July 2020 arrest. 
""The fact that a woman now stands trial for charges almost exclusively alleged against men heightens the interest and intrigue of this case,"" they wrote in a court filing.
Roy Futterman, a director at trial consulting firm DOAR in New York, said that ""Epstein is going to be such a huge figure in this trial, and there are so many preconceived notions about Epstein, that it's going to be difficult for the defense to get people who can come in as a blank slate."" 
The questionnaire that around 600 prospective jurors will complete asks what they have read or heard about Epstein and Maxwell, and about their own experiences with sexual abuse or assault.
In a video address played to jury candidates before they filled out the questionnaire, U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan said there would be significant press coverage of the trial. 
""Some of you may have already heard about this case in the media, and that is okay,"" Nathan said, before instructing them not to read about the case from this point on. Nathan is presiding over the trial.
Jurors in U.S. criminal trials are prohibited from doing independent research about cases, in order to ensure they reach a verdict solely on the evidence presented in court. 
Attorneys for the Mexican drug lord known as ""El Chapo"" last month urged an appeals court to overturn his 2019 conviction, arguing several jurors improperly followed https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/conviction-mexican-drug-lord-el-chapo-should-be-thrown-out-lawyer-argues-2021-10-25 media coverage of the trial.
In the Maxwell case, more prospective jurors were expected to fill out the questionnaire on Nov. 5 and Nov. 12. Some people will be called back beginning Nov. 16 for individual follow-up questioning by Nathan.
Jury consultants said that the lengthy questionnaire and follow-up questioning should make prospective jurors more comfortable discussing sensitive personal topics, and help lawyers weed out people who have preconceived notions about Maxwell's guilt. 
After the questionnaires are filled out, lawyers for both sides will send Nathan joint lists of jurors they agree should return for questioning, those they agree should not return, and candidates about which they have disputes. Those disputes will be resolved at a hearing before follow-up questioning.
When the process is complete, there will be a jury of 12 plus six alternates.
SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS 
While many potential jurors will be familiar with the case, those who learned about it from news sources rather than entertainment offerings might be seen as less biased, said Christina Marinakis, director for jury research at Litigation Insights in Baltimore.
The questionnaire asks whether potential jurors have discussed the case on social media. Marinakis said both the prosecution and the defense will likely review their online posts to be sure.
For the defense, one challenge is that jurors familiar with Epstein may hold Maxwell to a higher standard because she is a woman, and because many of Epstein's alleged victims were underage, said Melissa Gomez, president of MMG Jury Consulting in Philadelphia. Jurors with a negative view of Epstein may believe Maxwell had a special obligation to protect girls from him. 
""It's not solely going to be whether she actively participated, but, as a woman, did she fail to protect these other women?"" Gomez said. 

The defense might seek to seat men who view Maxwell's accusers as willing participants in sexual activity with Epstein, rather than as victims, said Paul Applebaum, a criminal defense attorney in St. Paul, Minnesota. 
""You want men on the jury who are still cavemen,"" he said.

UNAIZAH, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Stepping out of a shared taxi in central Riyadh, Reham Al-Ahmed walked into the shopping mall where she works four days a week selling cosmetics.
Al-Ahmed, a high school graduate, is the first woman in her family to have a job. Her parents had never wanted her to work but they eventually relented as life in the capital became too expensive.
With steep new taxes and cuts to government subsidies, many families are increasingly relying on women to work. In so doing, women are negotiating a new place for themselves in their country's delicate social fabric – a trend celebrated by some and watched suspiciously by others in a country still tethered to its conservative traditions.
Al-Ahmed, who lives at home with her parents and five younger siblings, chose a shop with mostly female clients to allay her parents' concerns about mixing with men. 
""I used to feel guilty asking my father for anything,"" the 24-year-old said. ""But since I started working, I'm proud I can help out my family.""
Showing up to work across the country every day are thousands of women like Al-Ahmed – unimaginable just a few years ago but now increasingly the norm under reforms led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to modernise the kingdom.
Saudi Arabia is highlighting its progress on women at a time of scrutiny in the West over its human rights record, including a crackdown on dissent that ensnared dozens of women's rights activists and the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. An absolute monarchy, it permits no political parties or elections. 
Men still have a tight grip on power. There are currently no women in King Salman's cabinet or in senior advisory roles, and the advisory Shura Council has only 30 women members out of 150.
But women now make up 33% of Saudi's labour force – nearly double what it was five years ago. Across age brackets and education levels, they are taking up jobs previously restricted to Saudi men and migrant workers in restaurants, supermarkets, accounting and graphic design firms.
As part of the reforms, women have been allowed to drive since 2018. But Al-Ahmed, who earns 4,500 riyals ($1,200) a month, cannot afford driving lessons, let alone a car.
""I spend nearly a third of my salary on taxis,"" she said, and is saving up for a car. ""But I'm really happy to have a job, to earn my own money finally. I never thought this would be possible for me.""
A small number of women had long worked in Saudi Arabia but typically held public sector jobs as teachers or medical workers, in keeping with once-strict gender segregation rules. 
But with looser restrictions on mixing, driving and some aspects of the male guardianship system, firms are hiring more women than ever.
This is particularly true in retail and hospitality, sectors in which the government launched a scheme in 2011 to replace cheaper foreign workers with citizens to tackle Saudi unemployment, currently at 11%.
""A lot of jobs that are going to women were traditionally occupied by non-Saudis,"" said economist Jennifer Peck. New laws have made it easier for women to work in client-facing jobs.
According to her research, the number of Saudi women in the private sector jumped to 935,508 in 2021 from 56,000 in 2010, and continues to climb. 
SOCIAL MORES
The changes are not just happening in Riyadh.
In Unaizah, a city in the conservative heartland of Qassim, attitudes are shifting and more women are working despite wariness among some about upending decades of tradition.
After graduating from university, Ghada al-Salman, 33, struggled to find a job in Qassim, where women's unemployment still hovers at 18%, more than three times the rate for men. 
She turned to baking, eventually opening three stores that employ 45 people. At a recent date festival, she promoted her Rose Ribbon Bakery, one of few women-owned businesses in Qassim.
""Without my parents, I wouldn't have been able to do any of this,"" she said, serving customers slices of date cake.
""Most fathers here would still not be okay with their daughters working all day alongside men; even if they're the boss, even if they're wearing the niqab.""
Salman, like most women in public spaces in Unaizah, wears a full-face covering and long black abaya. But she still faces admonishment from older conservatives. 
Happily eating one of her cupcakes, a man in his 60s complained about the fast pace of social change.
""(The government) is telling us women must work – but that goes against our traditions. In Islam, men take care of women,"" he said, requesting anonymity.
GENDER PAY GAP
For others, the changes are overdue. Rana Alturki, 45, who joined her father's oil and gas firm in 2000 as one of its first female hires, worked for years in a gender-segregated office.
""Back then, the men were not even polite: no one would say good morning or get in the elevator with me, they wouldn't even stand in the same room as me,"" said Alturki, now an owner and manager at Rawabi Holding Co.
""Thankfully, things have changed,"" said Alturki. ""In my day, we were too scared to even ask for a salary. But girls these days – they come in and negotiate hard. They know their worth.""
Despite this, the gender pay gap in Saudi Arabia stands at 49%, according to research by NGO Al Nahda.
""Social attitudes still govern women's access to the labour market,"" said Hala al-Dosari, a U.S.-based Saudi women's rights expert, who notes the bulk of new jobs for women are low-paying.
Although laws were introduced against harassment and discrimination, they are not systematic and women are still being harassed and denied their rights, Dosari said.
Some employers still ask women for their male guardian's approval during hiring, the economist Peck said, despite recent reforms giving women greater control over their lives.
One employer at a large company told Reuters he prefers to hire women because ""they work twice as hard, for half the pay"". Nearly all 400 firms interviewed by Peck's research group said Saudi women's wages were lower, while a third said women were more productive.
But for many Saudi women, these are just growing pains. 

""Young women ask me all the time how they can do what I do,"" said bakery owner Salman. ""I tell them: 10 years ago, it would have been impossible. But now, the future is yours.""

The man was twice taken to hospital for self-inflicted injuries before being interviewed and charged with various offences related to the abduction, police in Western Australia state said in a statement.
The girl, Cleo Smith, had last been seen in her family's tent in the early hours of Oct. 16 at the remote Blowholes Shacks campsite in Macleod. In the morning she was gone.
Her disappearance triggered an extensive search by land and air, along with roadblocks and scouring of CCTV footage.
She was found safe on Wednesday when police broke into a house in Carnarvon, a town about 100 km (60 miles) south of the campsite on the far northwest coast of the state. The house is 3 km (2 miles) from her family home, media said.
Police said the charges the suspect faces include one count of forcibly taking a child under 16. The suspect appeared in court and was due to appear again on Dec. 6, police said.
During his court appearance the man threatened journalists in the public gallery and asked them what they were staring at, the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported.
Police released an audio recording of their entry into the house and the discovery of the girl in a room. ""We've got her. We've got her,"" an officer could be heard saying.
After being asked her name a few times, the toddler answered: ""My name is Cleo"". She had been found playing with toys with the light on, police said.
After meeting her family, state Premier Mark McGowan said Cleo was a ""very bright, upbeat, sweet little girl"" and looked ""very well adjusted"", considering her ordeal. 
Specialist child interviewers would speak with her, and authorities had instructed her parents on how to talk to her to preserve her memory, authorities said.

The hashtag #CleoSmith has been trending on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) since Wednesday, with a picture posted by police that showed a smiling Cleo waving from her hospital bed drawing nearly 54,000 ""likes"". 
Purple and pink balloons adorned the streets and many landmarks in Perth, the capital of Western Australia, were lit up in blue on Wednesday night to thank police for their efforts.

TAIPEI (Reuters) -The European Parliament's first official delegation to Taiwan said on Thursday the diplomatically isolated island is not alone and called for bolder actions to strengthen EU-Taiwan ties as Taipei faces rising pressure from Beijing.
Taiwan, which does not have formal diplomatic ties with any European nations except tiny Vatican City, is keen to deepen relations with members of the European Union. 
The visit comes at a time when China has ramped up military pressure, including repeated missions by Chinese warplanes https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/taiwan-says-eight-chinese-air-force-planes-entered-its-air-defence-zone-2021-10-31 near democratic Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own and has not ruled out taking by force. 
""We came here with a very simple, very clear message: You are not alone. Europe is standing with you,"" Raphael Glucksmann, a French member of the European Parliament, told Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen in a meeting broadcast live on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
""Our visit should be considered as an important first step,"" said Glucksmann, who is leading the delegation. ""But next we need a very concrete agenda of high-level meetings and high-level concrete steps together to build a much stronger EU-Taiwan partnership."" 
The three-day visit, organised by a committee of the European Parliament on foreign interference in democratic processes, will include exchanges with Taiwanese officials on threats such as disinformation and cyber attacks.
Tsai has warned https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-taiwan-idUSKCN1SG08F of increasing Chinese efforts to gain influence in Taiwan, asking security agencies to counter infiltration efforts. 
""We hope to establish a democratic alliance against disinformation,"" Tsai told the delegation in the Presidential Office. 
""We believe Taiwan and the EU can certainly continue strengthening our partnership in all domains."" 
Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu made a rare trip https://www.reuters.com/world/china/europe-trip-taiwan-foreign-minister-calls-collaboration-facing-china-2021-10-29 to Europe last month that angered Beijing, which warned the host countries against undermining relations with China.
Fearing retaliation from Beijing, most countries are unwilling to host senior Taiwanese ministers or send high-level officials to the island. 
Last month, the European Parliament adopted a non-binding resolution to deepen ties with Taiwan, with steps such as looking into an investment agreement.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin condemned the meeting during a daily press briefing in Beijing on Wednesday.
""We urge the European side to correct its mistakes and not send any wrong signals to Taiwan separatist forces, otherwise it will harm China-EU relations,"" he told reporters.

""We want to show our support for the Libyan people as they move toward national elections and as they focus on the importance of the withdrawal of foreign forces and mercenaries,"" one of the officials said.
The Libya-focused summit, organized with the United Nations, Germany and Italy in Paris for Nov. 12, is expected to gather some 20 regional and international heads of state.

Wrangling over elections planned for Dec. 24 has threatened to derail Libya's efforts to end a decade of chaos and violence. A wider peace push has put a transitional unity government into office until that vote.

Police broke into a house in Carnarvon, a town about 100 km (62 miles) south of the campsite, early on Wednesday and found Cleo Smith in one of the rooms.
""One of the officers picked her up into his arms and asked her 'what's your name?'. She said 'My name is Cleo',"" Western Australia Police Deputy Commissioner Col Blanch told media. 
A man has been taken into custody in relation to the disappearance, he said.
Cleo was last seen in her family's tent in the early hours of Oct. 16 at the remote Blowholes Shacks campsite in Macleod, about 900 km (560 miles) north of Perth, the capital of Western Australia state. 
When her parents woke in the morning, she was gone.
Police had feared the girl had been abducted and offered a A$1 million ($743,000) reward for any information leading to her whereabouts.
""What a great day. We now have returned Cleo to her loving parents. It's a wonderful day for this little girl and her loving family,"" the state police commissioner, Chris Dawson, told media.
A team of 140 people had been working on the case with police fielding more than 1,000 tips from the public.
Police said the abduction appeared to have been opportunistic and they expected to file charges later in the day.
""She is physically OK. That was evident from the start,"" said state police homicide squad Senior Sergeant Cameron Blaine, who was one of four people to rescue the child.
""Taking her to the hospital we got assurance of that from people that know what they are doing.""
He said finding her was ""without a doubt"" the best moment of his career.
""She is a very sweet, energetic girl, very trusting and very open with us,"" he said.
Footage released by police showed the moment the girl was carried out of the house, her arms around a policeman. 
After introducing himself, Blaine asked her: ""Are you OK? We are going to take you to see your Mummy and Daddy, OK? Is that good?"" to which she smiled and nodded.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison also welcomed the ""wonderful, relieving news"". 
""Cleo Smith has been found and is home safe and sound. Our prayers answered,"" Morrison said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -A lawyer for the armorer who oversaw weapons used on the ""Rust"" movie set suggested on Wednesday that someone deliberately put a live round into the gun used by Alec Baldwin when he accidentally shot dead a cinematographer.
Jason Bowles said his client, Hannah Gutierrez, had pulled ammunition from a box that she believed contained only dummy rounds that were incapable of firing. He said he thought it was possible that someone purposely placed real bullets, which look similar to dummies, in the box.
""We're afraid that could have been what happened here, that somebody intended to sabotage this set with a live round intentionally placed in a box of dummies,"" Bowles said on ABC television's ""Good Morning America."" 
""We're not saying anybody had any intent there was going to be a tragedy of homicide,"" he added, ""but they wanted to do something to cause a safety incident on set. That's what we believe happened.""
A spokeswoman for producers Rust Movie Productions had no comment on Bowles' remarks. The company has said it is investigating the incident and had received no official complaints about safety on the set in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
Authorities are investigating the matter and no charges have been filed against anyone involved.
""Never in a million years did Hannah think that live rounds could have been in the 'dummy' round box,"" Bowles said in a statement later on Wednesday. 
Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed on Oct. 21 when a gun Baldwin was holding released a live bullet, police said. Baldwin had been told by assistant director Dave Halls that the gun was ""cold"", an industry term meaning it is safe to use.
Bowles said Gutierrez had checked the gun before giving it to Halls. She spun the cylinder and showed Halls each of the rounds, which she believed were six dummy rounds, he said. Halls then took the gun into the church where Baldwin was rehearsing a scene.
He said that Gutierrez took her job seriously, had given Baldwin and other actors on the film firearms training, and ""did everything in her power to ensure a safe set.""
Before the shooting, camera operators had quit the film to protest against what they said were long hours and other objectionable working conditions, authorities in Santa Fe have said.
Asked who would intentionally place live ammunition with dummy rounds, Bowles said on NBC's ""Today"" show that he believed it could be a person who wanted ""to prove a point, to say that they're disgruntled, they're unhappy"".
""And we know that people had already walked off the set the day before,"" he said.

Baldwin, who was also a producer on the film, has said he is heartbroken and is cooperating with authorities https://www.reuters.com/world/us/alec-baldwin-calls-movie-shooting-death-one-trillion-episode-2021-10-30.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea can get all the uranium it needs for nuclear weapons through its existing Pyongsan mill, and satellite imagery of tailings piles suggests the country can produce far more nuclear fuel than it is, a new academic study concludes. 
Despite a self-imposed moratorium on nuclear weapons tests since 2017, North Korea has said it is continuing to build its arsenal, and this year it appeared to have restarted https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-appears-have-restarted-nuclear-reactor-iaea-says-2021-08-29 a reactor that is widely believed to have produced weapons-grade plutonium.
According to research published last month in the journal Science & Global Security by researchers at Stanford University and an Arizona-based mining consulting company, North Korea may be able to increase production, and has no need for other uranium mills.
""It is clear that the DPRK appears to have substantially more milling capacity than it has been using to date,"" said the report, using the initials of North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. ""This means that the DPRK could produce much greater quantities of milled natural uranium if desired.""
The Pyongsan Uranium Concentration Plant and its associated mine are North Korea's only publicly acknowledged source of yellowcake, or uranium ore, according to analysts.
The report comes as other satellite imagery shows North Korea is building a large expansion at its Yongbyon nuclear reactor, which analysts say may be used to produce weapons-grade uranium.
""Given the DPRK’s active nuclear program, it is of utmost importance to assess and understand its nuclear materials production capabilities,"" wrote the report's authors, who submitted their findings in April.
These capabilities govern the rate at which North Korea might expand its nuclear arsenal, determine the magnitude of the threat to international security and the challenge of potential nuclear disarmament, and measure North Korea's ability to fuel its future nuclear energy program, the report said.
GROWING NUCLEAR ARSENAL
The question over how many nuclear weapons North Korea possesses is a key issue for intelligence agencies in South Korea and the United States, as well as for any talks aimed at limiting or reducing North Korea’s arsenal.
The United States, which wants Pyongyang to surrender its nuclear arsenal, has said it is open to meeting with North Korea without preconditions. North Korea says talks are only possible after the United States and its allies drop hostile policies.
Intelligence on North Korean nuclear weapons is limited, but David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, has told Reuters he estimates the country has the capacity to produce material for four to six warheads a year.
The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in September https://www.reuters.com/article/northkorea-nuclear-iaea-idINV9N2IE02B that North Korea’s ""nuclear programme goes full steam ahead with work on plutonium separation, uranium enrichment and other activities.""
There have been no reported accounts of outside inspector access to the Pyongsan uranium mine after the IAEA visited in 1992, leaving details of the mill uncertain, the academic report said.
The authors used artificial intelligence algorithms developed by Orbital Insight, a California-based geospatial analytics company, to analyse satellite imagery for land use patterns around the Pyongsan facility.

Yellowcake from the mine and mill is a key component of North Korea's nuclear fuel production, including its 5-megawatt (MW) reactor, which is seen as capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium.
The IAEA and other analysts reported over the summer that the reactor appeared to be operating for the first time since 2018.

KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) -Jurors saw a series of graphic videos on Wednesday showing the chaotic moments after teenager Kyle Rittenhouse shot three protesters in Wisconsin, including one man who lay motionless and bleeding and another screaming as blood gushed from his arm.
Some of the jurors were visibly uncomfortable as they were bombarded with violent images from Aug. 25, 2020, the night Rittenhouse, then 17, fatally shot two men and wounded a third with a semi-automatic rifle during unrest in the city of Kenosha.
Wearing a dark blue suit and tie, Rittenhouse watched the videos calmly, intermittently turning his eyes away from the screen. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of homicide and attempted homicide and says he acted in self-defense.
A Kenosha police detective agreed under cross-examination by 
Rittenhouse's lawyers that the first person shot that night, Joseph Rosenbaum, had pursued the teen even after he yelled: ""Friendly, friendly, friendly"" in an apparent attempt to relay to the crowd that he meant no harm.
But the videos shown by Kenosha County Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger drove home the violence of that night.
One juror nudged his reading glasses and rubbed his chin anxiously as he viewed the scenes, while others shifted uncomfortably in their chairs as video of Rosenbaum lying motionless surrounded by glass and blood was shown to them, according to a pool report from the courtroom, where media access has been limited for the high-profile trial.
""Put pressure on it!"" one person can be heard yelling as a crowd gathered and attempted to provide aid to Rosenbaum, who had thrown a plastic bag with toiletries at Rittenhouse and chased him. ""Where's the hole?"" another person screams, as the group searches for the bullet wounds.
The jury was also shown video of Rittenhouse fleeing the scene of the Rosenbaum shooting and being chased by a growing crowd of protesters, some of them yelling things like ""Get him"" before he has a series of violent encounters.
After stumbling to the ground, Rittenhouse fatally shoots Anthony Huber, a 26-year-old who swung a skateboard at him, and hits Gaige Grosskreutz, now 27, with a bullet that ruptured his bicep. Grosskreutz was holding a handgun when he was shot. 
""I need a fucking medic!” Grosskreutz screams in one video, with blood spewing from his arm.
DEFENSE ARGUES RITTENHOUSE FEARED FOR HIS LIFE
Rittenhouse's attorneys are trying to establish Rosenbaum, 36, as the aggressor and to show their client was justified in shooting Huber and Grosskreutz because he feared for his life.
Some legal experts https://www.reuters.com/world/us/prosecutors-face-tough-test-trial-us-teenage-protest-shooter-rittenhouse-2021-10-28 have said the prosecution faces a tough task securing a conviction. Under Wisconsin law, people can use deadly force if they ""reasonably"" believe it necessary to prevent someone from killing or causing bodily harm to them. 
Martin Howard, a Kenosha detective who was called by Binger to explain the video evidence, agreed under cross-examination that FBI surveillance video showed Rosenbaum was chasing Rittenhouse when he was shot.
Howard also agreed to a point the defense is expected to stress in the trial - that Rittenhouse was afraid in part because the people he shot were reaching for his gun.
""Sir, if a weapon is taken from somebody, it can be used against them as a deadly and dangerous weapon, correct?"" defense attorney Mark Richards asked Howard. 
""Correct,"" Howard responded.

Rittenhouse has emerged as a hero to some conservatives who believe in unfettered gun rights and see the shootings as justified during the chaos in Kenosha, while many on the left see him as an example of a gun culture run amok.
The unrest in Kenosha erupted after a white policeman shot and seriously wounded Jacob Blake, a Black man, two nights before the shootings. That incident took place against the backdrop of nationwide protests over racism and police brutality following the May 2020 murder of George Floyd, another Black man, by a policeman in Minneapolis.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Conservative U.S. Supreme Court justices on Wednesday appeared ready to shoot down New York state's limits on carrying concealed handguns in public in a major gun rights case that could imperil various firearms restrictions nationally.
While appearing united in their skepticism about the constitutionality of the state's law, some of the conservative justices expressed concern about how a ruling invalidating it might affect prohibitions on guns in sensitive places such as schools, sports stadiums and crowded public gatherings. 
The court heard about two hours of arguments in an appeal https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-hear-major-case-carrying-handguns-public-2021-04-26 by two gun owners and the New York affiliate of the National Rifle Association, an influential gun rights group closely aligned with Republicans, of a lower court ruling throwing out their challenge to the state's law, enacted in 1913. 
New York requires people to show a ""proper cause"" for carrying concealed handguns - including an actual, rather than speculative, self-defense need - to receive permission from a state firearms licensing officer. 
""Why isn't it good enough to say 'I live in a violent area and I want to defend myself?'"" Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked.
Lower courts rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the law violates the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. The challengers seek an unrestricted right to carry concealed handguns in public. The state currently approves the majority of applications for unrestricted licenses.
The Supreme Court's 6-3 conservative majority is considered sympathetic to an expansive view of Second Amendment rights in a country with high levels of gun violence that President Joe Biden has called a ""national embarrassment https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-house-faces-increased-pressure-act-guns-after-indianapolis-shooting-2021-04-16.""
Unrestricted concealed-carry licenses are granted more freely in the state's rural areas than densely populated New York City. Conservative justices viewed that as impermissible. 
""How many muggings take place in the forest?"" Chief Justice John Roberts asked New York Solicitor General Barbara Underwood, who was defending the law.
Justice Samuel Alito wondered why only ""celebrities, state judges and retired police officers"" should be able to carry concealed guns, and not ordinary citizens. 
Underwood emphasized the need to regulate concealed guns to promote public safety, saying allowing a proliferation of firearms in New York City's subway system ""terrifies a great many people."" 
Alito said there already are people illegally carrying guns on subways and streets. ""But the ordinary hard-working, law-abiding people ... they can't be armed?"" Alito asked.
A ruling invalidating New York's law would prompt legal questions surrounding how and when local governments can regulate firearms in sensitive places. 
Liberal and conservative justices challenged Paul Clement, representing the challengers, on where guns might be off limits in that scenario, including government buildings, public transit, sports stadiums, schools, university campuses, sites of protests and drinking establishments. 
Clement said prohibitions at government buildings and schools probably would pass muster but others would need a case-by-case examination.
Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett said states throughout history have outlawed guns in sensitive places.
""Can't we just say Times Square on New Year's Eve is a sensitive place because ... people are on top of each other - we've had experience with violence, so we're making a judgment, it's a sensitive place?"" Barrett asked Clement, referring to the packed annual celebration.
'GUN-RELATED CHAOS'
The case could yield the most important gun rights ruling in more than a decade. The court in 2008 recognized for the first time an individual's right to keep guns at home for self-defense, and in 2010 applied that right to the states. 
The court's three liberals signaled concern about expanding gun rights. 
Noting that guns are dangerous, liberal Justice Stephen Breyer envisioned situations in which even people of ""good moral character,"" including inebriated fans at sports stadium, could ""end up dead."" Breyer challenged Clement on what the court should to avoid ""a kind of gun-related chaos.""
After being denied unrestricted licenses, gun owners https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/new-york-judges-gun-permit-denials-trigger-big-us-supreme-court-case-2021-10-28 Robert Nash and Brandon Koch, along with the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association, sued in federal court.
New York has cited analogous weapons restrictions running from medieval England through the 18th century founding of the United States and ever since. The challengers said the history and tradition of gun rights should make it easier for them to carry handguns.
Advocates for gun restrictions fear that the case could threaten measures around the country such as ""red flag"" laws targeting the firearms of people deemed dangerous by the courts, expanded criminal background checks for gun buyers or restrictions on selling untraceable ""ghost"" guns. 
Seven other states have requirements similar to New York's.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said after the arguments she hopes the justices will uphold her state's ""commonsense"" law, adding: ""Having more armed people in public places doesn't make us any safer.""
The Supreme Court's ruling is due by the end of June.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Commerce Department added Israel's NSO Group and Candiru to its trade blacklist on Wednesday, saying they sold spyware to foreign governments that used the equipment to target government officials, journalists and others.
Positive Technologies of Russia, and Computer Security Initiative Consultancy PTE LTD, from Singapore, were also listed. The Department said they trafficked in cyber tools used to gain unauthorized access to computer networks.
The companies' addition to the list, for engaging in activities contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests, means that exports to them from U.S counterparts are restricted. It for instance makes it far harder for U.S. security researchers to sell them information about computer vulnerabilities.
""We are not taking action against countries or governments where these entities are located,"" said a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department. 
Suppliers will need to apply for a license before selling to them, which is likely to be denied. 
In the past, the NSO Group and Candiru have been accused of selling hacking tools to authoritarian regimes. NSO says it only sells its products to law enforcement and intelligence agencies and takes steps to curb abuse. 
'DISMAYED'
An NSO spokesperson said the company was ""dismayed"" by the decision since its technologies ""support U.S. national security interests and policies by preventing terrorism and crime, and thus we will advocate for this decision to be reversed.""
NSO will present information regarding its ""rigorous"" compliance and human rights programs, ""which already resulted in multiple terminations of contacts with government agencies that misused our products,"" the spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement to Reuters.
The Israeli defence ministry, which grants export licenses to NSO, declined to comment on the matter.
Contact information for Candiru was not available. 
The Biden administration imposed sanctions on Positive Technologies, a Russian cybersecurity firm, this year for providing support to Russian security services. The company denies any wrongdoing.
Positive Technologies said the new sanctions will not affect their business and will not prevent the company from a planned public listing.
""We do not know on what grounds the U.S. Commerce Department added us to the list,"" General Director Denis Baranov said in an emailed comment.
""Anyway we repelled sanction risks earlier and they do not pose additional threats for us now,"" he wrote.
Computer Security Initiative Consultancy PTE LTD, also known as COSEINC, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
A former U.S. official familiar with Positive Technologies, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the firm had helped establish computer infrastructure used in Russian cyberattacks on U.S. organizations.
COSEINC founder Thomas Lim is known for organizing a security conference, named SyScan, which was sold https://tsyrklevich.net/2015/07/22/hacking-team-0day-market to Chinese technology firm Qihoo 360, a sanctioned entity. An email published https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/695766 by WikiLeaks in 2015 suggested Lim had also previously offered to sell hacking tools to infamous Italian spyware vendor HackingTeam. 
Lim did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent to a social media account he owns. 
Export control experts say the designation could have a far broader impact on the listed companies than simply limiting their access to U.S. technology. 

""Many companies choose to avoid doing business with listed entities completely in order to eliminate the risk of an inadvertent violation and the costs of conducting complex legal analyses,"" said Kevin Wolf, former assistant secretary of Commerce for Export Administration during the Obama administration. 
The entity list was increasingly used for national security and foreign policy aims during the Trump administration. Chinese telecom company Huawei was added in 2019, cutting it off from some key U.S. suppliers and making it difficult for them to produce mobile handsets.

BRUNSWICK, Ga. (Reuters) -A jury of 11 white people and one Black person was chosen on Wednesday in the murder trial of three white men who chased and fatally shot Ahmaud Arbery, a young Black man who went for a run in a mostly white neighborhood in coastal South Georgia last year.
Jury selection in Glynn County Superior Court took three weeks in the case, which intensified nationwide protests over racism and policing last year after cellphone video of the shooting spread online. 
Prosecutors from the Cobb County district attorney's office tried unsuccessfully on Wednesday to argue that defense lawyers were rejecting many potential jurors because they were Black, which the U.S. Supreme Court has long deemed unconstitutional.
Arbery's father, Marcus Arbery, 58, said he was disheartened by the jury's racial make-up but believes justice will prevail. ""They can pick any jury they want, but the evidence will show they killed my son in cold blood,"" he said. 
Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley said he was accepting the ""race-neutral"" reasons offered by the defense lawyers for Gregory McMichael, his son Travis McMichael and their neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan.
The three men have pleaded not guilty to criminal charges including murder and assault. In February 2020, they chased the unarmed Arbery in Satilla Shores, a quiet residential neighborhood outside Brunswick (NYSE:BC). The younger McMichael killed Arbery, 25, with a shotgun in what the men have argued was self-defense. 
""In this particular case, there are these significant overtones of race to begin with,"" the judge said. ""The court is not going to place upon the defendants a finding that they are ... not being truthful with the court when it comes to their reason for striking the jurors.""
He said he would hear final arguments over what evidence can be shown to the jury on Thursday, impanel the jury on Friday morning then commence with opening statements. Four alternate jurors were selected, but their races were not immediately disclosed; the judge has promised jurors anonymity, referring to them in court only by a number.
Slowing the process of jury selection, many potential jurors, drawn from the county, told the court that they had seen the viral video of Arbery's death and made their minds up as to the guilt of the defendants.
The three men have said they were trying to detain Arbery under the state's citizen's arrest law, since repealed after Bryan's cellphone video of the killing sparked widespread outrage. 
They said they chased the unarmed 25-year-old because they thought he was a ""suspect"" in a burglary. Arbery went into a construction site during his run, but the owner of the property said he believed Arbery stopped only for a drink of water and nothing was taken.

Only about 85,000 people live in Glynn County, and many potential jurors told the court they personally knew Arbery or know some or all of the defendants.
""This is the most complicated jury selection I've ever been a part of including federal death penalty cases,"" Kevin Gough, a lawyer for Bryan, said earlier on Wednesday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ghislaine Maxwell, accused of enabling financier Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuses, has endured jail conditions comparable to Hannibal Lecter's in the 1991 film ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" her lawyer said in a court filing on Wednesday.
The lawyer, Bobbi Sternheim, offered the assessment as she renewed Maxwell's request for bail ahead of her Nov. 29 trial.
She called the British socialite's 16 months at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn ""reprehensible and utterly inappropriate for (a) woman on the cusp of turning 60 with no criminal record or history of violence.
""The surveillance rivals scenes of Dr. Hannibal Lecter's incarceration,"" Sternheim wrote, ""despite the absence of the cage and plastic face guard.""
Lecter is a fictional serial killer who eats his victims. Anthony Hopkins won an Oscar for best actor by portraying him in ""The Silence of the Lambs.""
The office of U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in Manhattan, which is prosecuting Maxwell, declined to comment.
Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and other charges for helping recruit and groom underage girls for Epstein to abuse between 1994 and 2004.
She likely faces an uphill battle for bail given that U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan, who oversees her case, has rejected https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/ghislaine-maxwell-loses-latest-bail-request-2021-06-02 it three times, calling her a ""significant risk of flight https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-ghislaine-maxwell/ghislaine-maxwell-loses-third-bid-for-bail-idUSKBN2BE31C."" A federal appeals court has also rejected https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/ghislaine-maxwell-loses-latest-bail-request-2021-06-02 bail.
Epstein killed himself at age 66 in a Manhattan jail in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, in what a medical examiner called a suicide.
Sternheim cited several factors behind Maxwell's renewing her proposed $28.5 million bail package, which also included offers to renounce her non-U.S. citizenships and move most of her and her husband's assets into a separate account.
These factors, which Maxwell's lawyers have previously complained about, include alleged abuse by jail guards, unsanitary living conditions, a bad diet, sleep deprivation, and an inability to review documents for trial.

A representative for the federal Bureau of Prisons did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Prospective jurors will on Thursday begin filling out questionnaires to assess whether they can fairly judge Maxwell, who faces up to 80 years in prison if convicted. Her trial may last about six weeks.

ROUEN, France (Reuters) -A British scallop dredger impounded by French authorities sailed out of the French port of Le Havre on Wednesday evening and was heading home, ending a stand-off that aggravated tensions between Paris and London over post-Brexit fishing rights.
Earlier on Wednesday, a court in the French city of Rouen had ruled the vessel, the Cornelis Gert Jan, was free to leave, overturning a demand that its captain pay a 150,000 euro ($174,000) bond, a lawyer for the captain told Reuters.
The vessel was seized last week, with French authorities saying it had been caught fishing for scallops in French territorial waters without a proper license.
The lawyer for the Irish captain Jondy Ward said the vessel was a pawn in a wider political row between Paris and London over fishing rights after Britain's departure from the European Union.
Ship tracking website marinetraffic.com showed the vessel left Le Havre at around 1800 (1700 GMT) and was heading away from the French coast at a speed of 7.4 knots.
It gave its course as the port of Shoreham, on the south coast of England, according to the website.
""We are obviously delighted and relieved that the vessel can leave and our crew can get home,"" Andrew Brown, a director of the trawler, told Reuters after the court ruling.
""We are also very pleased the courts have not set any bond for the release of the vessel. We are just relieved that the crew, who remain in good spirits, are able to head home,"" he said.
The French authorities had initially demanded the 150,000 euro bond in exchange for allowing the captain and the vessel to leave French jurisdiction pending a trial which has been scheduled for next year.
France and Britain this week came to the brink of a cross-Channel trade war, with Paris alleging that London was denying fishing licenses to French trawlers they were entitled to under a post-Brexit deal.
Britain said it was honouring the deal, and accused France of blowing the affair out of all proportion. Paris had threatened to step up checks on trucks and produce arriving from Britain and to bar British trawlers docking in French ports.

But France pulled back at the last minute and now says it will make a fresh attempt to negotiate a solution with Britain. Senior British and French officials are to meet for talks on the issue on Thursday.

Frey, a Democrat who fought off a crowded field of challengers, had opposed a ballot measure backed by his more liberal rivals that would have replaced the police department with a new public safety agency. Minneapolis voters rejected the measure.
Instead, Frey, 40, charted a middle course, calling for police reforms while also vowing to hire more officers for a department that has been hit hard by departures and has struggled to curb a spike in violent crime.
After election returns showed that he had won, he urged city officials to come together ""to begin restoring a fractured faith, not just in our institutions but in one another."" 
""This is our Minneapolis moment to heal and move forward together with renewed purpose toward shared goals and overdue change,"" he said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Wednesday.
Speaking to reporters, he added, ""I'm calling on everyone to come together to unite around common principles and values and to work with us in good faith towards the progress that we all collectively need to see in our city."" 
In Buffalo, India Walton, who captured the Democratic mayoral nomination in June in a surprise upset against long-time Mayor Byron Brown, conceded on Wednesday that she had lost the general election after the incumbent mounted a rare write-in campaign.
""While we anticipate that the margins will narrow, it seems unlikely that we will end up with enough votes to inaugurate a Walton administration in January,"" she said in a statement on Wednesday after initially refusing to concede.
Brown's victory gives him a fifth four-year term. 

Minneapolis employs a ranked-choice system for its mayoral election, in which voters can rank up to three candidates in order of preference.
Frey led after the first round of votes were counted on Tuesday, but he fell short of the mark needed for an outright victory. He cemented his win in a subsequent round of counting on Wednesday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday rejected an accusation he was deliberately trying to avoid being questioned under oath in a defamation lawsuit by a former contestant on TV's ""The Apprentice"" who claimed he sexually assaulted her.
In a filing with a New York state court in Manhattan, Trump said a claim he used ""delay tactics"" to keep his accuser Summer Zervos from deposing him by a court-ordered Dec. 23 deadline ""patently absurd, disingenuous, and entirely unfounded.""
Lawyers for Zervos did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Zervos has accused Trump of harming her reputation by claiming she lied by accusing him during his 2016 presidential campaign of subjecting her to unwanted kissing and groping in 2007, two years after she was on his reality television show.
The lawsuit seeks a retraction or apology, plus compensatory and punitive damages. Trump has denied Zervos' claims and called her case politically motivated.
On Oct. 18, Trump asked for court permission to countersue Zervos for wrongly interfering with his right to speak freely.
The former president cited a 2020 New York state law, known as an ""anti-SLAPP"" law, meant to deter lawsuits designed to harass defendants for speaking out on public issues.
Zervos, who sued Trump in January 2017, had said allowing the countersuit would delay Trump's deposition, adding to delays that have already caused her ""significant prejudice.""
But Trump said Zervos knew on Sept. 30 of his planned countersuit, ""which she has no legitimate basis to oppose,"" and is herself ""unnecessarily delaying"" the case by objecting.

The case is unresolved in part because Trump argued while in the White House that a sitting president could not be sued.
That became moot after Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election and Trump became a private citizen. New York's highest court dismissed Trump's latest appeal in March.

(Reuters) - Minneapolis voters decided on Tuesday not to replace their police force with a new department that would have taken a holistic approach to crime, 18 months after the murder of George Floyd in the city sparked global protests for racial justice.
With all precincts reporting tallies, more than 56% of voters rejected a ballot asking residents if they wanted to create a new Department of Public Safety to take the place of the police department. 
Leili Fatehi, campaign manager for All of Mpls, which campaigned against dissolving the police department, said voters gave a clear mandate for continuing to work on reforms within the structure of the agency. 
She said neither side of the ballot measure is happy with the status quo of policing in the city, but they disagree on how best to make changes.
""What we want to see happen next is for the residents of Minneapolis to unite behind holding the next mayor and city council accountable for rolling up their sleeves and doing that hard work without delay,"" Fatehi said. 
Minneapolis was thrust to the center of the U.S. racial justice debate in May 2020 when officer Derek Chauvin pinned his knee against the neck of Floyd, a Black man, for more than nine minutes. Chauvin was sentenced in June to 22 1/2 years in prison. Three other officers charged in Floyd's death face trial in March. 
Floyd's death ignited calls from activists to ""defund the police"" - which even most of those who supported scrapping the Minneapolis police department rejected. Instead, they called for rethinking how and when police are used, not the disbanding all armed officers. 
JaNaé Bates, a leader of the Yes4Minneapolis campaign that supported creating the new safety department, told supporters at an election watch party that despite the loss, the conversation around policing had forever changed. 
""The people of Minneapolis are deserving to have a law enforcement agency that is accountable and transparent, and that is not what we have today,"" she said. ""We'll continue to push for our people."" 
Democrats, normally allies in the largely progressive Midwestern city, split over the ballot question. Many feared dissolving the department would provide easy election fodder for Republicans nationwide ahead of November 2022 congressional elections. 
Opposed to the measure were Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo; Mayor Jacob Frey, who is up for reelection on Tuesday; U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Governor Tim Walz. 
Some of the state's best-known progressives - such as U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who oversaw Chauvin's prosecution - supported the change. 

At the watch party for Yes4Minneapolis, supporter Sandra Williams said those seeking reforms would press on. 
""The fight continues,"" Williams said.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - As the devastating Delta variant surge eases in many regions of the world, scientists are charting when, and where, COVID-19 will transition to an endemic disease in 2022 and beyond, according to Reuters interviews with over a dozen leading disease experts.
They expect that the first countries to emerge from the pandemic will have had some combination of high rates of vaccination and natural immunity among people who were infected with the coronavirus, such as the United States, the UK, Portugal and India. But they warn that SARS-CoV-2 remains an unpredictable virus that is mutating as it spreads through unvaccinated populations. 
    None would completely rule out what some called a ""doomsday scenario,"" in which the virus mutates to the point that it evades hard-won immunity. Yet they expressed increasing confidence that many countries will have put the worst of the pandemic behind them in the coming year.
    ""We think between now and the end of 2022, this is the point where we get control over this virus ... where we can significantly reduce severe disease and death,"" Maria Van Kerkhove, an epidemiologist leading the World Health Organization's (WHO) COVID-19 response, told Reuters. 
    The agency's view is based on work with disease experts who are mapping out the probable course of the pandemic over the next 18 months. By the end of 2022, the WHO aims for 70% of the world's population to be vaccinated. 
    ""If we reach that target, we will be in a very, very different situation epidemiologically,"" Van Kerkhove said.
In the meantime, she worries about countries lifting COVID precautions prematurely. ""It's amazing to me to be seeing, you know, people out on the streets, as if everything is over.""
COVID-19 cases and deaths have been declining since August in nearly all regions of the world, according to the WHO's report on Oct. 26. 
Europe has been an exception, with Delta wreaking new havoc in countries with low vaccination coverage such as Russia and Romania, as well as places that have lifted mask-wearing requirements. The variant has also contributed to rising infections in countries such as Singapore and China, which have high rates of vaccination but little natural immunity due to much stricter lockdown measures.
“The transition is going to be different in each place because it's going to be driven by the amount of immunity in the population from natural infection and of course, vaccine distribution, which is variable ... from county by county to country by country,” said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
    Several experts said they expect the U.S. Delta wave will wrap up this month, and represent the last major COVID-19 surge.
""We're transitioning from the pandemic phase to the more endemic phase of this virus, where this virus just becomes a persistent menace here in the United States,"" former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said.
Chris Murray, a leading disease forecaster at the University of Washington, likewise sees the U.S. Delta surge ending in November.    
""We'll go into a very modest winter increase"" in COVID-19 cases, he said. ""If there's no major new variants, then COVID starts to really wind down in April.""
Even where cases are spiking as countries drop pandemic restrictions, as in the UK, vaccines appear to be keeping people out of the hospital. 
Epidemiologist Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London said that for the UK, the ""bulk of the pandemic as an emergency is behind us."" 
'A GRADUAL EVOLUTION'
    COVID-19 is still expected to remain a major contributor to illness and death for years to come, much like other endemic illnesses such as malaria.
""Endemic does not mean benign,"" Van Kerkhove said.
Some experts say the virus will eventually behave more like measles, which still causes outbreaks in populations where vaccination coverage is low. 
Others see COVID-19 becoming more a seasonal respiratory disease such as influenza. Or, the virus could become less of a killer, affecting mostly children, but that could take decades, some said. 
   Imperial College's Ferguson expects above-average deaths in the UK from respiratory disease due to COVID-19 for the next two-to-five years, but said it is unlikely to overwhelm health systems or require social distancing be reimposed.
    ""It's going to be a gradual evolution,"" Ferguson said. ""We're going to be dealing with this as a more persistent virus.""
Trevor Bedford, a computational virologist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center who has been tracking the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, sees a milder winter wave in the United States followed by a transition to endemic disease in 2022-2023. He is projecting 50,000 to 100,000 U.S. COVID-19 deaths a year, on top of an estimated 30,000 annual deaths from flu.
The virus will likely continue to mutate, requiring annual booster shots tailored to the latest circulating variants, Bedford said.
If a seasonal COVID scenario plays out, in which the virus circulates in tandem with the flu, both Gottlieb and Murray expect it to have a significant impact on healthcare systems.
""It'll be an issue for hospital planners, like how do you deal with the COVID and flu surges in winter,"" Murray said. ""But the era of ... massive public intervention in people's lives through mandates, that part I believe will be done after this winter surge.""

    Richard Hatchett, chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, said with some countries well protected by vaccines while others have virtually none, the world remains vulnerable. 
    ""What keeps me up at night about COVID is the concern that we could have a variant emerge that evades our vaccines and evades immunity from prior infection,” Hatchett said. “That would be like a new COVID pandemic emerging even while we're still in the old one.""

The nominees must still win the support of a majority of the full Senate, but all received bipartisan support at the committee level, a good indicator that they eventually will be confirmed.
There has been no word yet on when the full Senate would vote on the nominees.
Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley announced before the committee business meeting that he would not back Emanuel. Merkley questioned Emanuel during his confirmation hearing about accusations of a coverup when he was Chicago mayor about the murder of a Black teenager, Laquan McDonald, by a white police officer.

Emanuel expressed regret about events surrounding McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) death and said he thought about it every day. His nomination was supported by a strong majority of the committee.
Burns, who took a tough line on dealings with China at his Oct. 20 confirmation hearing, is also expected to easily win confirmation.

CALAIS, France (Reuters) - French fisherman Loic Fontaine is finalising a deal to sell his boat because, cut off after Brexit from access to British waters where French fleets traditionally fished, he says the vessel can no longer earn its keep.
Fontaine though has decided to hold off signing away his boat for a few days longer, while Britain and France try to resolve their row over fishing licences that this week took them to the brink of trade sanctions, before France stepped back.
“The English are stubborn, they won’t let go ... it is better to stay friendly and to find a compromise,” the 45-year-old told Reuters from the port of Calais on Tuesday afternoon after a day fishing just 30 minutes from the coast to make sure he did not stray into British waters.
“If we start a naval war, it won’t end.”
Tensions escalated last week after a British boat was held in the port of Le Havre and France said it would put in place increased checks on trucks and produce coming from Britain and that British trawlers would be barred from docking in French ports from midnight on Monday. 
Britain, accused by France of not honouring a post-Brexit deal on access to British fishing grounds, has now been given until Thursday to come up with a solution.
Thirty five licences have been granted to fishing boats in the Hauts-de-France region of northern France and Fontaine’s boat, the Sainte Catherine Labouré, is one of 45 boats that is still waiting, according to a French tally. 
These talks represent a last chance for Fontaine, who says that it is not worth continuing in the profession without a licence to work in British waters. This year, he saw his profits drop by 60% compared to previous years. 
""(Now) we are all fishing in the same zone and it is getting less because we are going for the same resource – at some point we won’t get anything,"" he said.
In the port of Boulogne-sur-Mer, fisherman Gaetan Delsart is also getting ready to watch his catch swim beyond his reach over the next months.
Like Fontaine, he is counting on the two countries to come to a solution soon in order to continue to working. 

“I will hang up the keys in less than a year I think,” says the 35-year-old, who missed out on a licence as he did not have the approved tracking equipment installed on his boat to show he fished in British waters before 2016.
If he does have to sell, he is pessimistic he would get a decent price because, he said, ""who would buy a boat without a licence?""

ROUEN, France (Reuters) - A British fishing trawler impounded by French authorities is the unjustified casualty of a wider political battle between Paris and London over post-Brexit fishing rules, a lawyer for the vessel's captain said on Wednesday.
A court in the north-western French city of Rouen is deciding whether the Irish captain, Jondy Ward, should pay a 150,000 euro ($174,000) deposit to have the boat released after French authorities said he was fishing in French waters without a proper licence.
""He is clearly in the middle of a political game,"" the lawyer, Mathieu Croix, said outside the courtroom.
He said the deposit being sought by France was out of proportion to the value of the cargo of scallops on board the Cornelis Gert Jan when it was seized last week, which he estimated at around 5,000 euros.
'COMPLETELY DISPROPORTIONATE'
He said the amount had been inflated in order to ""make an impression"" given the dispute over fishing licences since Britain pulled out of the European Union.
""It has taken on another dimension in the current context that has taken on a completely disproportionate meaning,"" said the lawyer.
The deposit would allow the vessel to go free pending a court case next year. The Rouen court will decide later on Wednesday whether the deposit should stand. Scottish company Macduff Shellfish, which used the boat, has said it did have the appropriate licences.
France and Britain this week came to the brink of a cross-Channel trade war, with Paris alleging Britain was denying fishing licenses to French trawlers they were entitled to under a post-Brexit deal.
Britain said it was honouring the deal, and accused France of blowing the affair out of proportion. Paris had threatened to step up checks on trucks and produce arriving from Britain, and to bar British trawlers docking in French ports.

KABUL (Reuters) - The United Nations children's agency said it was planning to set up a system to directly fund Afghan teachers, after the international community placed a freeze on funding to the Taliban-led administration.
""UNICEF is setting up a system that will allow direct payments to teachers without the funds being channelled through the de facto authorities,"" Jeannette Vogelaar, UNICEF Afghanistan's Chief of Education, told Reuters in an email.
In preparation, she said, UNICEF would begin registering all public school teachers.
""The best way to support the education of girls in Afghanistan is to continue supporting their schools and teachers. UNICEF is calling upon donors not to let Afghanistan's children down,"" Vogelaar added.
Afghanistan's public services, in particular health and education, have been plunged into crisis since the Islamist Taliban movement took over the country on Aug. 15.
Many foreign governments have placed a ban on funding outside of humanitarian aid that is channelled through multilateral agencies.
That has generally been limited to urgent supplies such as wheat and blankets, leaving public service workers including teachers without pay for months. Billions of dollars in Afghan central bank funds held overseas have also been frozen.
The international community has raised alarm that the Taliban might restrict female education, and high schools for girls in many parts of the country have remained closed even while those for boys have been allowed to open.
A Taliban official told Reuters this week there would be ""good news"" soon on older girls being allowed to go back to school, and that they were working with UNICEF and other international organisations on the issue.

""We are working especially with UNICEF and some other international organisations ... to come up with a good solution ... we have meetings on a daily basis,"" said Waheedullah Hashimi, Director of External Programmes and Aid at Afghanistan's Ministry of Education.
""We have a problem that economically we are not good ... that is why we are requesting the international community, international organisations, especially those who have funds for emergency situations, to help us in this regard,"" he added.

GENEVA/ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - All sides fighting in the war in Ethiopia's northern region of Tigray committed violations that may amount to war crimes, according to a joint investigation by the United Nations and Ethiopia published on Wednesday. 
The report accuses all sides of torturing and killing civilians, carrying out gang-rapes and making arrests on the basis of ethnicity.
It was released the day after Ethiopia declared a state of emergency. Tigrayan forces said on Monday they might march on the capital to topple Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government.
The investigation was carried out by the U.N.'s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the state-appointed Ethiopian Human Rights Commission.
It covers from November to June during the year-long conflict fought by Tigrayan forces against the Ethiopian military and its allies - forces from the Amhara region and soldiers from the neighbouring country of Eritrea. 
""All parties to the Tigray conflict have committed violations of international human rights, humanitarian and refugee law. Some of these may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity,"" said Michelle Bachelet, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
Bachelet said most violations in the period covered by the report were committed by Ethiopian and Eritrean forces, but since then, they had seen an increase in reports by Tigrayan forces as well as continuing abuses by the Ethiopians and Eritreans. 
Eritrean forces - either individually or collectively - had ""huge responsibility"" for many violations, she said. 
The report draws on 269 interviews, many containing graphic details of rapes and mutilations by Eritrean soldiers on military bases. 
Prime Minister Abiy said he accepted the report despite some ""serious reservations"" and said it did not accuse the government of genocide or using food as a weapon. He said a civil-military taskforce would be established to investigate all the allegations in the report. Ethiopia has said individual soldiers are on trial for rape and killing. 
Eritrean Information Minister Yemane Meskel, who spent months denying Eritrean troops were in Tigray, called the report ""fallacious ... utterly false"" in a tweet. 
The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) spokesperson Getachew Reda said the report ""did not cover all the heinous crime spots"" and accused Ethiopian investigators of bias. 
Amhara regional spokesperson Gizachew Muluneh was unreachable but has previously denied abuses. 
The report said Eritrean soldiers had killed around 100 civilians in the city of Axum, that Ethiopian soldiers had dragged about 70 men from their homes and killed them in three villages in southern Tigray, and that Tigrayan forces had killed around 200 Amhara civilians in the town of Mai Kadra, a crime followed by revenge killings of Tigrayans by Amhara. 
Investigators said they did not travel to Sudan, where most Tigrayan victims of Mai Kadra fled, due to time constraints. The report noted around 600,000 Tigrayans fled Western Tigray after it fell under Amhara control. 
Reuters and other news organisations, rights groups, and civil society groups have documented many more mass killings of civilians that were not mentioned in the report. 
It was not clear whether the report's findings could form the basis for legal action. Ethiopia and Eritrea are not members of the International Criminal Court, so it has no jurisdiction. 
YEAR OF CONFLICT
The report also accused Eritrean soldiers of forcing Eritrean refugees living in Tigray to return, in violation of international law.
The report accused all sides of blocking aid at different times and said it could not verify whether starvation was used as a weapon of war, as had been previously alleged by the United Nations aid chief. The United Nations has previously said the government operated a ""de facto blockade"" of food aid. The government denies this. 
The report mentioned investigators were often hindered in their work, particularly areas controlled by Amhara forces, or unable to visit certain areas due to insecurity. It did not mention that Ethiopia deported a U.N. investigator working on the report in September.
The report said the Tigrayan leadership was reluctant to engage due to the presence of investigators from the state-appointed Ethiopian Human Rights Commission. 

The war began a year ago after regional forces and Tigrayan soldiers in the national army seized control of military bases across Tigray. They said the central government was about to move against Tigray after the region held its own elections despite a government directive delaying them.
The conflict has left about 400,000 people in Tigray facing famine, killed thousands of civilians and forced more than 2.5 million people in northern Ethiopia to flee their homes.

KABUL (Reuters) -At least 25 people were killed and more than 50 wounded when gunmen attacked Afghanistan's biggest military hospital after two heavy explosions at the site in central Kabul, officials said.
The explosions hit the entrance of the 400-bed Sardar Mohammad Daud Khan hospital and were followed with an assault by a group of Islamic State gunmen, all of whom were killed within 15 minutes, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said.
He said Taliban special forces dropped by helicopter had prevented the attackers from entering the hospital itself, with all killed at the entrance or in the courtyard. Earlier another spokesman said one of the attackers was captured.
The blasts add to a growing list of attacks and killings since the Taliban completed their victory over the Western-backed government in August, undermining their claim to have restored security to Afghanistan after decades of war.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the operation was typical of the complex attacks mounted by Islamic State. It follows a string of bombings by the group which has emerged as the biggest threat to Taliban control of Afghanistan.
A Taliban security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said at least 25 people had been killed and more than 50 wounded in the assault but there was no officially confirmed casualty toll.
Among the dead was Mawlawi Hamdullah Mukhlis, head of the Kabul military corps and one of the first senior Taliban commanders to enter the abandoned presidential palace when the city fell, Taliban officials said.
Photographs shared by residents showed a plume of smoke over the area of the blasts near the former diplomatic zone in the Wazir Akbar Khan area of the city.
Witnesses said at least two helicopters flew over the area as the assault went on, one of the first times Taliban forces have used aircraft captured from the Western-backed government in a military operation.
A health worker at the hospital, who managed to escape, said he heard a large explosion followed by gunfire and a second, larger explosion about 10 minutes later.
Islamic State, which has carried out a series of attacks on mosques and other targets since the Taliban's seizure of Kabul in August, mounted a complex attack on the hospital in 2017, killing more than 30 people.
CONDEMNATION
The group's attacks have caused mounting worries outside Afghanistan about the potential for the country to become a haven for militant groups as it was when an al Qaeda group attacked the United States in 2001.
""It's just about the biggest concern at the moment for everyone, in the region and in the West,"" a senior Western diplomat said.
The United Nations' mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), along with countries including Pakistan, condemned the attack.
""Attacks targeting medical personnel and civilians seeking treatment are violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. Those responsible need to be held to account,"" UNAMA said in a tweet. 

The concern has been worsened by a spiralling economic crisis that has threatened millions with poverty as winter approaches and left thousands of former fighters with no employment.
The abrupt withdrawal of international support following the Taliban victory has brought Afghanistan's fragile economy to the brink of collapse just as a severe drought has threatened millions with hunger.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan is ""very high on the agenda"" in the European Union, the grouping's first official parliamentary delegation to the democratic island said on Wednesday, amid heightened tension between Taipei and Beijing.
Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory and has not ruled out taking by force, does not have formal diplomatic ties with any European nations except tiny Vatican City. But it is keen to deepen relations with members of the European Union.
""Our visit shows how Taiwan now is very high in the agenda in Brussels and in every member state,"" Raphael Glucksmann, a French member of the European Parliament, told Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang at a meeting.
""We in Europe are also confronted with interference from authoritarian regimes and we came here to learn from you,"" added Glucksmann, who is leading the delegation.
He described Taiwan as ""a laboratory and a hub for the fight against foreign interference and the preservation of democracy"". 
In a statement, Taiwan's foreign ministry pointed to the ""great significance"" of the first official delegation from the European Parliament. Prior visits by foreign lawmakers have provoked https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-czech-china-idUSKBN25R059 China's anger.
During the three-day visit, organised by a committee of the European Parliament on foreign interference in democratic processes, the ministry said the delegation would discuss threats such as disinformation and cyber attacks.
In a statement, the office of Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen said the government would share its experiences in tackling challenges such as ""foreign infiltration"". 
Tsai, set to meet the delegates on Thursday, has warned of increasing Chinese efforts https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-taiwan-idUSKCN1SG08F to gain influence in Taiwan, asking security agencies to counter infiltration efforts. 

The EU lawmakers' visit comes after Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu made a rare trip to Europe last month that angered Beijing, which warned the host countries against undermining relations with China.
Last month, the European Parliament adopted a non-binding resolution to deepen ties with Taiwan, with steps such as looking into an investment agreement.

The vaccination campaign in the global financial hub has lagged many other developed economies, with about 65% of the eligible population fully vaccinated with shots from either China's Sinovac, or Germany's BioNTech. 
About 85% of those older than 80 in the Chinese-ruled city of 7.5 million have not been vaccinated.
The elderly will get priority for the booster shots, along with health workers, cross-border truck drivers and others in categories deemed to be at higher risk of getting the disease.
About 1.86 million people are eligible for the booster, which they can start booking from Nov. 5, to receive it as soon as Nov. 11.
""The elderly are the most fragile group and we have a responsibility to protect their health,"" Chan said.
Hong Kong is following Beijing's lead in retaining strict travel curbs, in contrast to a global trend of opening up and living with the coronavirus.
International business lobby groups have warned Hong Kong could lose talent and investment, as well as competitive ground to rival finance hubs such as Singapore, unless it relaxes its restrictions on travel.

Despite barely any recent local cases and an environment virtually free of COVID-19, Hong Kong has imposed mandatory hotel quarantine of up to 21 days for arrivals from most countries at the travellers' cost. 
Those who test positive are immediately admitted to hospital regardless of their condition. Since last month they have been required to spend a further 14 days in a designated facility after leaving the hospital.

KABUL (Reuters) - To fill her days and keep her mind occupied, university student Hawa sits by the window in her Kabul home and pores over a book.
Like hundreds of thousands of other Afghan girls and young women, the 20-year-old Russian literature undergraduate has not been allowed to return to her studies since the Taliban seized power in mid-August.
And like many of her peers, she is feeling a mixture of frustration and anger that her aspirations to study and work are being thwarted.
""We are not born to sit at home,"" Hawa told Reuters in her family's house in the Afghan capital, where she has been cooped up spending her days drawing, reading and doing chores.
""If we can nurture babies we can provide for our families too. In this situation, I do not see my dreams coming true.""
(Open https://reut.rs/3nPWv0a in an external browser to see a picture package on Afghan women and girls unable to study)
The hardline Islamist Taliban movement, which stormed to power earlier this year after ousting the Western-backed government, has allowed all boys and younger girls back to class, but has not let girls attend secondary school.
Most public universities are not functioning at all, or only partially.
Officials have tried to assure Afghans and foreign donors that people's rights will be honoured, including allowing girls to go to school and women to study and work once details on how to do so in accordance with Islamic law are thrashed out.
They have also blamed https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/we-are-not-deleting-them-afghanistans-taliban-promise-progress-girls-schooling-2021-11-02 the international community for cutting off aid, making it harder to fund the reopening of schools and universities for all.
More than three months into their rule, that has not happened, and some are skeptical of a group that, when it was last in power from 1996-2001, banned all girls from school and women from paid employment.
DREAMS ON HOLD
Fewer than 40% of Afghan girls attended secondary school in 2018 even though it was allowed then, according to the most recent figures from UNESCO.
Much of the country remains deeply conservative, despite 20 years of Western-backed rule and billions of dollars in foreign aid aimed partly at promoting equality and civil rights.
But in urban centres in particular, girls and women have enjoyed greater freedoms since 2001, and they are reluctant to let them go.
""Those of us who went to university and also had jobs, were helping our families, of course nothing will come of us, because they (the Taliban) say that whatever we studied in the last 20 years is useless,"" Hawa said.
Across town, 17-year-old Sahar is also stuck at home. She wants to become an engineer, but, for now at least, has to learn at home as best she can.
""I am trying to continue my lessons at home but nevertheless the environment at school, the classroom, our friends and teachers is something different compared to being at home.""
She proudly showed Reuters around her old classroom - a school manager on the premises that day allowed Sahar in.
""I would love to come back to my class, resume my studies, to be with my classmates and teachers,"" she said, looking wistfully around the room where desks and benches gathered dust.
When her younger brother and sister return from school each day, Sahar helps with their homework.
""They ... come home and do their homework, talk about their classmates and their studies. But I feel sad inside that I can't go to school myself.""
Her sister Hadia, who is 10, has noticed that some of her former teachers and classmates are no longer around - she assumes they were among thousands of Afghans who fled Kabul in the chaotic weeks that followed the Taliban's conquest.

Even at her age, she recognises the difficulties ahead.
""I'm in the 4th grade. I want to be a doctor, but if in two years' time I am not allowed to continue my studies like my sister, I won't be able to fulfil my dream,"" said Hadia. ""That already scares me.""

GENEVA/ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - All sides fighting in the war in Ethiopia's northern region of Tigray committed violations that may amount to war crimes, according to a long-awaited joint investigation by the United Nations and Ethiopia published on Wednesday. 
The report by the U.N.'s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the state-appointed Ethiopian Human Rights Commission was released the day after Ethiopia declared a state of emergency. Tigrayan forces said on Monday they might march on the capital to topple the government of Africa's second most populous nation. 
The report covers most of the year-long conflict, fought by Tigrayan forces against the Ethiopian military and its key allies: forces from Ethiopia's Amhara region and soldiers from the neighbouring nation of Eritrea. 
All sides are accused of torturing and killing civilians, carrying out gang-rapes and making arrests on the basis of ethnicity. 

It was not immediately clear whether findings from the report could form the basis for legal action. Ethiopia and Eritrea are not members of the International Criminal Court, so the court has no jurisdiction. 
The report recommended a possible international justice mechanism, saying Ethiopian investigations were insufficiently broad, did not always comply with international standards, and were not always transparent.

771,"<span>Nov 03, 2021 04:15AM ET</span>",,,,,,"CANBERRA/SYDNEY (Reuters) - France's ambassador to Australia, Jean-Pierre Thebault, said on Wednesday that Australia acted with deceit when it abruptly cancelled a multi-billion dollar deal with Paris to build a fleet of submarines.
""The deceit was intentional,"" Thebault told media in Canberra on Wednesday.
""And because there was far more at stake than providing submarines, because it was a common agreement on sovereignty, sealed with the transmission of highly classified data, the way it was handled was a stab in the back.""
Australia in September cancelled a deal with France's Naval Group, opting instead to build at least 12 nuclear-powered submarines in a deal with the United States and Britain.
The new alliance, dubbed AUKUS, is designed to give Australia access to nuclear-powered submarines for the first time.
The decision has caused a major bilateral rift, with France recalling its ambassadors from Australia and the United States in protest. Thebault returned to Canberra last month and the speech on Wednesday is the first time he has spoken publicly on the bilateral relationship.
""These are not things which are done between partners - even less between friends,"" said Thebault, who added that the French government had no gripe with the people of Australia.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison declined to refute Thebault's comments when speaking on Wednesday in the United Arab Emirates en route from the U.N COP26 climate summit.
""Claims were made and claims were refuted, what is needed now is for us to move on,"" Morrison told reporters.
French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday said Morrison had lied to him about Canberra's intentions.
Morrison has denied the claim. He said he had previously explained to Macron that conventional submarines would no longer meet Australia's needs.
Morrison and Macron spoke last week before the Australian leader publicly sought a handshake with his French counterpart at the G20 meeting. 
The destabilisation of the usually close diplomatic relations between the two nations now threatens to spill over into trade consequences. 
The European Union has twice postponed a planned round of free trade talks with Australia. In solidarity with France, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen questioned whether the bloc could strike a trade deal with Australia.
The relationship was tested further this week after Australian media published leaked messages between Morrison and Macron that attempted to counter France's claim that Australia did not give it sufficient warning that the contract would be cancelled.
Thebault said the leaking of the messages represented an ""unprecedented new low"" and he said that it sent a worrying signal to heads of state that confidential correspondence could one day be ""weaponised against you"". 
Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce said Macron was wrong to accuse Morrison of lying.
""We had a major political leader call the prime minister of Australia a liar, and you can't do that diplomatically,"" Joyce told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

""This isn't some tin-pot nation in the middle of nowhere... if a person calls you a liar, what are you going to do? You have to defend it and say you are not.""
U.S. President Joe Biden said last week that the handling of the new pact had been clumsy, adding that he had thought France had been informed of the contract cancellation before the new pact was announced.

LAGOS (Reuters) -Rescuers combed through the rubble of a high-rise building in Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos in search of survivors on Tuesday, a day after it collapsed while under construction, as the death toll rose to 16 with scores reported missing.
The Lagos state government said it had put its chief architect on indefinite suspension and launched an independent investigation of the causes of the collapse of what was to have become a high-end apartment block.
Emergency services braced for a second night of work as earth-moving equipment lifted chunks of masonry at the site in the affluent neighborhood of Ikoyi. Large trailers were brought in to help move debris, blocking one of Ikoyi's main roads.
Building collapses are frequent in Africa's most populous country, where regulations are poorly enforced and construction materials often substandard.
Lagos state government had sealed off the building site in June for failing to meet structural requirements and demanded the anomaly be corrected before construction could proceed, state deputy governor Obafemi Hamzat said in a statement. He did not say whether that problem had been rectified.
Sixteen bodies, including the assistant of the building's owner, have been recovered so far while nine people have been pulled out alive, emergency services said, as excavators sifted rubble from the heaps of shattered concrete and twisted metal where the building once stood. 
Hamzat said the number of people trapped was unknown but that interviews with workers indicated up to 40 were on site when the building collapsed, much lower than an initial figure of 100 given by witnesses on Monday..
Agitated families whose loved ones were missing gathered nearby. Some wailed and others prayed in small groups for the safe return of their relatives.
As tempers flared, a few got into a scuffle with government officials, demanding to be allowed to help with the search effort.
High-end apartments have been springing up in Ikoyi, and the collapsed building was part of three towers being built by private developer Fourscore Homes, where the cheapest unit was selling for $1.2 million.

The project developer and owner of Fourscore Homes, Olufemi Osibona, told a local news channel in August that he had developed buildings in the London districts of Peckham and Hackney and that the Ikoyi apartments were the start of bigger projects he planned in Nigeria.
Osibona could not be reached for comment on Tuesday. Local media reports said he may have been among those trapped.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The last of several Afghan refugee families who had resettled near San Diego only to end up trapped in their homeland during summer visits amid the Taliban takeover in August have made it safely out of the country, school officials said on Tuesday.
The final stranded family group consisting of four students from the Cajon Valley Union School District and their mother made their way to Kabul, the Afghan capital, and took a flight to Doha, Qatar, according to district spokesman Howard Shen.
He said the group, stuck in Afghanistan since August after the Taliban swiftly seized power, got out of the country ""with lots of assistance,"" but he declined to elaborate on the precise means of their departure.
A statement from the school district, located in the San Diego suburb of El Cajon, said the stranded family were helped by various aid organizations and government officials who asked not to be named.
School district community liaison representatives, working with staff from their local member of Congress, Darrell Issa, a Republican, had previously arranged exits for 19 other immigrant students and their parents likewise trapped during vacation visits to Afghanistan, according to the statement.
Afghan refugees account for a few hundred of the 17,000 students enrolled in Cajon Valley schools. 
District officials said such families likely saw the summer of 2021 as their last, best chance to safely pay a return visit to Afghanistan to see loved ones before the U.S. military pulled out but ended up caught in the ensuing chaos when the Afghan government abruptly fell.
The superintendent of the San Juan School District in Sacramento County has said nine local Afghan refugee families, comprising a total of 24 students, were still stranded in Afghanistan under similar circumstances and in need of rescue.
More than 114,000 people were evacuated by a U.S. airlift from the Kabul airport in the weeks immediately following the Taliban takeover before the U.S. withdrawal was completed.
Late last month, a group of 13 U.S. senators, all Democrats, sent a letter to President Joe Biden urging him to appoint a White House official and a special State Department envoy to focus efforts to gain safe passage for ""tens of thousands of individuals trying to leave Afghanistan as refugees or asylum seekers.""

GLASGOW/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden on Monday sought to assure world leaders the United States would fulfill its promise to slash greenhouse gas emissions in half by the end of the decade, but a setback at home heightened uncertainty about his ability to follow through. 
Biden joined leaders from over 100 countries in Glasgow for the start of the COP26 climate conference https://www.reuters.com/business/cop, which kicked off on the heels of the G20 summit in Rome that concluded with a statement that urged ""meaningful and effective"" action on climate change but left huge work for negotiators to ensure an ambitious outcome.
Biden, who succeeded former president Donald Trump in January, pledged earlier this year that the United States would cut its greenhouse gas emissions 50-52% by 2030 compared with 2005 levels. The White House has expressed confidence it can achieve that, even as a bill that would help further those goals languishes in Congress, with a key senator on Monday withholding his support, for now.
Biden wanted to show to the world that Washington could be trusted to fight global warming despite changes in policies between Republican and Democratic administrations that have undermined its pledges in the past.
""We'll demonstrate to the world the United States is not only back at the table but hopefully leading by the power of our example,"" he said. ""I know it hasn’t been the case, and that's why my administration is working overtime to show that our climate commitment is action, not words.""
Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accord, dealing a blow to international efforts on the subject while he was in office. Biden rejoined when he became president.
""I guess I shouldn't apologize, but I do apologize for the fact the United States, in the last administration, pulled out of the Paris accords,"" Biden said at a separate COP26 event.
As Biden was meeting with world leaders in Scotland, moderate Democratic Senator Joe Manchin announced he would not yet support a $1.75 trillion legislative framework that is central to achieving the president's emissions reduction goals.
National Climate Adviser Gina McCarthy said ahead of Biden's arrival in Glasgow that the bill would unleash $555 billion in climate spending, the largest investment to combat global warming in U.S. history, and allow the country to reduce emissions well over a gigaton or a billion metric tons by 2030.
Biden announced a long-term strategy laying out how the United States would achieve a longer-term goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. 
In his COP26 speech, Biden said the world needed to help developing nations in the climate fight. 
""Right now we're still falling short,"" he said.
Biden plans to work with the U.S. Congress to launch a $3 billion program in 2024 aimed at helping developing countries adapt to and manage the impacts of climate change through locally led measures. 

In a conference call with reporters, McCarthy also addressed concerns around a Supreme Court announcement late on Friday that it would review the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, potentially undermining U.S. climate goals.
""We're confident that the Supreme Court will confirm what those have before them, which is EPA has not just the right but the authority and responsibility to keep our families and communities safe from pollution,"" McCarthy said.

KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) -Jurors heard two very different portrayals of U.S. teenager Kyle Rittenhouse on Tuesday as prosecutors described him as a vigilante who killed two protesters and defense attorneys depicted him as a scared kid who protected himself from a mob.
Rittenhouse, 18, has been charged with killing two protesters and wounding a third with a semi-automatic rifle during unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, over the police shooting of a Black man on Aug. 25, 2020. Rittenhouse has pleaded not guilty to homicide and attempted homicide charges.
The dueling narratives came on the first day of testimony in what is poised to be the biggest U.S. court test of a civilian's right to self-defense since George Zimmerman was acquitted in 2013 in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Black teenager, in Florida.
In his opening statement, defense attorney Mark Richards stressed that two of the men whom Rittenhouse shot had reached for his rifle, causing the teen to fear it would be used on him. A third man was armed with a handgun, Richards said, and was part of a mob that ""attacked him in the street like an animal."" 
In contrast, Kenosha County Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger painted Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time, as the aggressor. He repeated seven times in his opening statement that the teenager was the only person to have shot anyone on a night when hundreds of protesters had taken to the streets, some peacefully and others engaged in arson, looting and rioting.
""Yet out of these hundreds of people, only one person killed anyone that night. Only one person shot anyone that night,"" Binger said.
The unrest in Kenosha erupted after a white policeman shot and seriously wounded Jacob Blake, a Black man. That shooting took place against the backdrop of nationwide protests over racism and police brutality following the May 2020 murder of George Floyd, another Black man, by a policeman in Minneapolis. 
Rittenhouse has emerged as a hero to some conservatives who believe in unfettered gun rights and see the shootings as justified during the chaos in Kenosha, while many on the left see him as an example of a gun culture run amok.
Richards suggested that Rittenhouse would take the stand to testify in his own defense.
'HE WAS FREAKING OUT' 
Rittenhouse, a resident of Antioch, Illinois, is charged with reckless and intentional homicides in the killing of Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and attempted homicide for wounding Gaige Grosskreutz, now 27, with a bullet to the arm. 
The prosecutor said the evidence would show that of the four bullets fired at Rosenbaum, the one that killed him was to his back. Rosenbaum, who was chasing the teenager, threw a plastic bag containing toiletries at him but was unarmed. Binger said Rittenhouse fled the scene without providing first aid.
Richards, the defense attorney, contended that Rosenbaum was ""ultimately the individual who lit the fuse that night.""
Some legal experts https://www.reuters.com/world/us/prosecutors-face-tough-test-trial-us-teenage-protest-shooter-rittenhouse-2021-10-28 have said the prosecution faces a tough task in convincing a jury that Rittenhouse did not fear for his life. Under Wisconsin law, people can use deadly force if they ""reasonably"" believe it necessary to prevent someone from killing or causing great bodily harm to them.
Dominick Black, the trial's first witness, testified that he and Rittenhouse had spent part of Aug. 25 helping clean graffiti off a local school before returning at night armed to protect a used-car dealership.
Black, who has been charged criminally with purchasing the rifle for Rittenhouse in 2020 because the defendant was too young to buy it legally, said he spoke with Rittenhouse minutes after the shootings and described him as distraught.

""He was freaking out. He was really scared, pale, sweating a lot,"" said Black, who was dating Rittenhouse's sister at the time. ""He said he had to do it, it was self-defense, people were trying to hurt him.""
The second witness was FBI agent Brandon Cramin, who was asked about aerial surveillance the night of the shooting. Kenosha County Circuit Court Judge Bruce Schroeder shut off public access to the audio and video feed of Cramin's testimony.

KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) -The jury was chosen on Monday in the trial of a U.S. teenager accused of fatally shooting protesters in Wisconsin last year, with potential jurors found to be too biased about guns excused in what the judge called a ""very political"" case.
Kyle Rittenhouse https://www.reuters.com/world/us/case-us-teenage-gunman-kyle-rittenhouse-2021-11-01, 18, is charged with killing two men and wounding a third with a military-style rifle during unrest in the city of Kenosha on Aug. 25, 2020. The protests were sparked by a police officer's shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, and came amid the sometimes violent demonstrations over racism and police brutality that rattled cities nationwide.
Rittenhouse has emerged as a hero to some conservatives who believe in unfettered gun rights and see the shootings as justified during the chaos that had engulfed Kenosha, while many on the political left have labeled him a vigilante killer.
Rittenhouse faces seven charges, including homicide in the fatal shootings of Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and attempted homicide for wounding Gaige Grosskreutz, 27. He has pleaded not guilty. Opening arguments in the trial begin on Tuesday.
The 20-member jury will be composed of 11 women and nine men. The group will be cut to 12 for final deliberations.
Several potential jurors told the judge they had seen video clips or other evidence that hardened their views on the case, a reflection of the widespread media coverage of the shootings on Aug. 25, 2020. Others said it would not change their belief in Rittenhouse's guilt or innocence even when presented with contrary evidence.
One man was excused after telling the judge his mind was made up already, citing his strong beliefs about the American right to bear arms.
Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder criticized the 2020 presidential campaigns of both major parties for their comments on the case. Days after the shootings, then-President Donald Trump suggested Rittenhouse had acted in self-defense, while Joe Biden, Trump's Democratic challenger and now president, accused Trump of stoking violence with his rhetoric.
""This case has become very political,"" Schroeder said, urging the jurors to be ""fair and impartial"" for a trial he has projected will last about two weeks.
Kenosha County Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger asked potential jurors whether they had experience with firearms, if they had taken efforts to protect their property on the night of the protests and whether they could make their own decision and not be swayed by family or friends.
Corey Chirafisi, an attorney for Rittenhouse, asked to strike one potential juror who said she would equate bringing an AR-15-style rifle to a protest with guilt.
""I don’t think a weapon like that should belong to the general public,"" the excused juror said.
With ample video evidence available, there is little dispute over the facts and the two sides will likely focus mainly on how to interpret Wisconsin law, which says people can use deadly force if they ""reasonably believe"" it necessary to prevent their own death or great bodily harm.
YES TO LOOTERS, NO TO VICTIMS
Prosecutors are expected to argue that Rittenhouse, who says he was in Kenosha to help protect a business, was looking for violent conflict and reacted with disproportionate force. They have indicated in past court filings they plan to argue that the men who were shot had been trying to disarm Rittenhouse because he was a threat to others.
The defense will stress that Rittenhouse feared for his life in each encounter. Video evidence shows Rosenbaum charging at Rittenhouse, Huber swinging a skateboard at him and Grosskreutz armed with a pistol when he was shot. 

Several potential jurors expressed worries about their safety. One woman, who said she had driven someone else's car to the court to avoid being identified, was selected for the jury.
""I really do not want to serve on this jury,"" said the woman, pointing to the partisan split in how people view the case. ""I figure either way this goes, you are going to have half the country upset with you.""

Writing ""Read this,"" Baldwin reposted lengthy remarks from Terese Magpale Davis, who worked in the wardrobe department on ""Rust.""
""I'm so sick of this narrative,"" Davis wrote. ""The story of us being overworked and surrounded by unsafe, chaotic conditions is bullshit.""

The ""30 Rock"" actor had been told the weapon was ""cold,"" or safe to use, according to court filings by the Santa Fe Sheriff's Department, which is investigating the incident.
Camera operators had walked off the ""Rust"" set before the incident to protest working conditions, authorities have said. Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza last week said he believed there was complacency on the production regarding safety.

782,"<span>Nov 02, 2021 05:23PM ET</span>",,,,,,"ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia declared a six-month state of emergency on Tuesday after forces from the northern region of Tigray said they were gaining territory and considering marching on the capital Addis Ababa.
The announcement came two days after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed urged citizens to take up arms to defend themselves against the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).
Earlier on Tuesday, authorities in Addis Ababa told residents to register their arms and prepare to defend their neighbourhoods.
The state of emergency was imposed with immediate effect after the TPLF claimed to have captured several towns in recent days and said it might march on Addis Ababa, about 380 km (235 miles) to the south of their forward positions.
""Our country is facing a grave danger to its existence, sovereignty and unity. And we can’t dispel this danger through the usual law enforcement systems and procedures,"" Justice Minister Gedion Timothewos told a state media briefing. 
He said anyone violating the emergency would face three to 10 years in prison, for offences such as providing financial, material or moral support to ""terrorist groups"". 
Ethiopia last imposed such a measure in February 2018 for six months ahead of the transition of power to Abiy. Curfews were enforced and people's movements restricted, while thousands of people were detained.
The Addis Ababa city administration said people should register their weapons and gather in their neighbourhoods. House-to-house searches were being conducted and troublemakers arrested, a statement said.
""Residents can gather in their locality and safeguard their surroundings. Those who have weapons but can't take part in safeguarding their surroundings are advised to hand over their weapons to the government or their close relatives or friends.""
Before the announcement, people moved around the capital as normal.
""I will try to buy food commodities in advance. But so far I haven't yet purchased anything,"" said one woman who asked not to be named.
The governments of four of Ethiopia's 10 regions also called upon Ethiopians to mobilize to fight against the Tigrayan forces, state-affiliated Fana TV said. 
The conflict in what was once considered a stable Western ally in a volatile region has plunged around 400,000 people in Tigray into famine, killed thousands of civilians and forced more than 2.5 million people in the north to flee their homes.
It erupted in the night of Nov. 3, 2020 when forces loyal to the TPLF - including some soldiers - seized military bases in Tigray, a northern region. In response, Abiy sent more troops there.
The TPLF had dominated Ethiopian politics for nearly three decades but lost much influence when Abiy took office in 2018 following years of anti-government protests.
Relations with the TPLF soured after they accused him of centralising power at the expense of Ethiopia's regional states - an accusation Abiy denies. 
TOWNS CAPTURED
TPLF spokesperson Getachew Reda said that if Tigrayan forces and their allies succeeded in removing the government, they would establish an interim government. ""If the government falls, we will definitely have an interim arrangement.""
There would also need to be a national dialogue, he said, but Abiy and his ministers would not be asked to take part. 
""They will have their day in court,"" he said.
The TPLF has claimed the capture of Dessie, Kombolcha and Burka, all in the Amhara region, in recent days.
A government spokesperson disputed the capture of Dessie and Kombolcha but later released a statement saying TPLF ""infiltrators"" had killed 100 youths in Kombolcha. 
Spokespeople for the government, military and the Amhara region did not return calls seeking further comment on Tuesday. 
On Monday night, Tigrayan forces said they had linked up https://www.reuters.com/article/ethiopia-conflict-link-idAFL8N2RS5NL with fighters from an Oromo force also fighting the central government. The Oromo are Ethiopia's biggest ethnic group. Many of their political leaders are currently in prison.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is ""extremely concerned"" by the latest developments in Ethiopia, said U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. ""The stability of Ethiopia and the wider region is at stake,"" Dujarric said.
U.S. ALARM
The U.S. Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa said on Tuesday Washington was alarmed by the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the north, including signs of famine, and urged all sides to find ways to de-escalate and let aid in.
Also on Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration accused Ethiopia of ""gross violations of internationally recognised human rights"" and said it planned to remove https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-conflict-trade/biden-says-ethiopia-mali-and-guinea-to-lose-duty-free-trade-access-idINKBN2HN1QQ the country from the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) trade agreement which gives it duty-free access to the United States. 

Ethiopia's trade ministry said it was ""extremely disappointed"" by the U.S. move and called for a reversal by January.
""The Ethiopian government takes all human rights allegations seriously: we are looking at them and conducting investigations and we are committed to ensuring accountability,"" it said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden acted on Tuesday to cut Ethiopia off from duty-free trade access to the United States over human rights violations, the strongest response yet to the conflict in the region of Tigray that has caused mass displacement and famine.
Biden said in a letter to Congress that he intends to remove Ethiopia - as well as two other African nations, Mali and Guinea, where military leaders have seized power in recent coups - from the U.S. African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA).
The move, set to take effect on Jan. 1, came as Ethiopia declared https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/addis-ababa-government-urges-residents-register-arms-media-2021-11-02 a state of emergency after Tigrayan forces said they were gaining territory and considering marching on the capital Addis Ababa.
The suspension of benefits threatens https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/ethiopian-textile-industry-risk-if-us-suspends-trade-deal-over-tigray-war-2021-10-28 Ethiopia's textile industry, which supplies global fashion brands, and the country's nascent hopes of becoming a light manufacturing hub. It will also pile more pressure on an economy reeling from the conflict, the coronavirus pandemic, and nearly 35% inflation. 
The war broke out in November 2020, dashing hopes for stability and development in Ethiopia under Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for his role in a peace deal with Eritrea.
Allegations of widespread sexual violence and mass killings of civilians have been leveled against forces in the conflict, including government troops. The Ethiopian government says it is investigating the claims.
Washington had warned Ethiopia for months that it risked losing its trade access, U.S. Horn of Africa envoy Jeffrey Feltman said. He added that Ethiopia must take urgent action like entering negotiations for de-escalation and a ceasefire in order to avoid the cut-off of trade access.
""Ethiopia does not have to lose the AGOA eligibility if it takes certain steps in the days ahead, and that's what we hope will happen,"" Feltman told the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington. 
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said she would provide Ethiopia, Mali and Guinea with clear benchmarks on how they can return to compliance with AGOA’s requirements and would work with them to achieve that goal.
Ethiopia is ""extremely disappointed"" by Washington's announcement, its trade ministry said on Tuesday, calling for a reversal by January. 
""These actions will reverse significant economic gains in our country and unfairly impact and harm women and children,"" the ministry said. ""Ethiopia will continue to make every effort to correct any unintended or perceived wrongs.""
'1 MILLION JOBS'
In his letter to Congress, Biden said Guinea and Mali had not made progress toward establishing rule of law and political pluralism, and Mali had failed to establish workers' rights and human rights.
Government spokespeople in the two West African countries
could not immediately be reached for comment. Both were suspended from the African Union after their militaries seized power and have been sanctioned by the Economic Community of West African States regional bloc. 
The AGOA trade legislation provides sub-Saharan African nations with duty-free access to the United States if they meet certain eligibility requirements, such as eliminating barriers to U.S. trade and investment and making progress toward political pluralism. 
Ethiopia is not a major exporting nation, but officials have said losing that trade access would take away 1 million jobs from the country of 109 million people. 
Textile and apparel made up more than 90% of Ethiopian goods exported duty-free to the United States last year, which totaled about $237 million, according to U.S. Commerce Department data.
Sweden's H&M AB, which sources apparel from Ethiopia, said it was closely monitoring developments in the country but had no further comment.
U.S.-based The Children's Place (NASDAQ:PLCE) Inc and PVH (NYSE:PVH), which also work in Ethiopia, did not respond immediately to requests for comment.

William Davison, the International Crisis Group's senior analyst on Ethiopia, said the limited economic hit from cutting off duty-free trade access was ""very unlikely to change (the government's) position on negotiating with Tigray's leaders.
""Instead, the far bigger threat to the federal government is the advance of the Tigray forces,"" Davison said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday ordered continued pretrial detention for a former U.S. Marine facing multiple felony charges related to his allegedly violent conduct, including throwing a pole at police, during the Jan. 6. U.S. Capitol riot.
Beryl Howell, chief U.S. District judge in Washington, told Arizona resident James McGrew, 39, that the ""weight of evidence is strong and merits pretrial detention.""
Howell said McGrew had violated probation he was serving for an earlier offense by travelling to Washington on Jan. 6 and had an extensive criminal record.
The judge said McGrew, whose abdomen features a large gothic-lettered tattoo labelling him ""King James,"" participated ""enthusiastically ... in a violent assault on the Capitol,"" assuming a leadership position among rioters.
""I do find the defendant poses a danger to the community"" beyond Jan. 6, Howell said. 
According to a case summary filed by prosecutors, evidence showed that early in the riot, McGrew cheered as a mob of demonstrators first drove back police defending the Capitol's West Plaza, where he apparently was pepper-sprayed. 
Prosecutors said he subsequently entered the U.S. Capitol, encouraging other rioters to enter with him, and then became aggressive when police asked him to leave the Rotunda, where he was pepper-sprayed again. Prosecutors said that some time after exiting the Capitol building, McGrew threw a pole at police.

Defense lawyer William Shipley acknowledged that riot video did show that McGrew ""took a hold of"" a pole and threw it ""like a javelin."" Shipley complained that his client had already spent six months in pretrial detention. 
More than 660 people have been charged with taking part in the attack, an unsuccessful attempt to stop Congress from certifying Democratic President Joe Biden's election victory, which former president Donald Trump falsely claimed was the result of widespread fraud.

A U.S. Embassy spokesperson said Burns was leading a delegation of senior U.S. officials to Moscow on Tuesday and Wednesday at President Joe Biden's request.
""They are meeting with members of the Russian government to discuss a range of issues in the bilateral relationship,"" the spokesperson said.
Russia's Security Council said Burns, a Russian-speaker and former ambassador to Moscow, held talks with Nikolai Patrushev, the council's secretary and a former head of Russia's FSB intelligence service.
Neither side gave details of the conversation, but security issues loom large in their troubled relationship.
Ties have hit a series of post-Cold War lows over issues including Russian-based cyberattacks against U.S. targets, Moscow's support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, the jailing of opposition politician Alexei Navalny and Russia's behaviour towards Ukraine, from which it seized the Crimea peninsula in 2014.
Biden sent a top Russia expert, Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, to Moscow for talks last month that failed to yield any progress in a dispute between the two countries over the sizes of their respective embassies.

Biden met Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit in Geneva in June, and said at the time it would take six months to a year to find out whether the two countries could establish a meaningful strategic dialogue.
Putin frequently criticises the United States but said last month he had established a constructive relationship with Biden. The Kremlin has said a further meeting between the two this year is a realistic possibility.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices on Tuesday appeared skeptical that a Texas community college violated the free speech rights of a former member of its board of trustees by censuring him for ""reprehensible"" behavior during his stormy tenure. 
The justices heard nearly 90 minutes of oral arguments in Houston Community College's appeal of a lower court decision to revive a lawsuit by David Wilson that claimed that the school's censure - a formal act of discipline - violated the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protection from government abridgement of free speech.
Questions posed by the justices indicated that they may be reluctant to limit the ability of publicly elected bodies to respond to a member's speech or conduct with censure. Wilson was publicly elected to the school's board of trustees.
Censure has been employed by democratic institutions throughout U.S. history. Members of the U.S. Congress have faced censure on occasion dating back two centuries, including in recent decades. 
Wilson's lawyer, Michael Kimberly, told the justices that censures like the one meted out by the college have a chilling effect on the speech of elected members, prompting skepticism from some of the justices. 
Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts said siding with Wilson would cause ""a chilling effect the other way.""
""A majority of a board wants to say something about what they regard as whatever reprehensible or offensive conduct - and yet their speech is going to be chilled if you prevail today,"" Roberts told Kimberly.
Liberal Justice Stephen Breyer expressed concern about the Supreme Court attempting to ""oversee"" other branches of government. 
Wilson served from 2013 to 2019 on the board at the college, a public institution in the largest city in Texas, with an enrollment of more than 50,000 students. 
Some justices expressed discomfort with certain other punishments doled out to Wilson beyond the actual censure, including denying reimbursement for travel expenses. 
Wilson is described in local media accounts as a longtime anti-LGBT activist. He previously mounted a petition to amend Houston's city charter to bar men ""who perceive or express themselves as women"" from entering women's restrooms, according to the Houston Chronicle. 
Wilson said he ran for a board seat to expose college mismanagement. He criticized board decisions in the news media and through robocalls, hired a private investigator to uncover alleged corruption, claimed on his website that other board members had engaged in unethical or illegal conduct and sued the board twice for actions he opposed.
The board voted to censure him in 2018, finding that his conduct was ""not only inappropriate, but reprehensible."" The discipline also revoked his privileges as a trustee to access certain funds for college-related travel and other activities. 

Wilson sued to stop the censure's enforcement, seeking monetary damages including for mental anguish.
The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2020 overturned a federal judge's decision to throw out the case, allowing it to proceed. The 5th Circuit ruled that a ""reprimand against an elected official for speech addressing a matter of public concern is an actionable First Amendment claim.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate panel will consider legislation this week to boost the independence of government watchdogs after President Donald Trump while in office fired several who were conducting high-profile investigations into him or his allies.
Several bills in the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee would make it harder for presidents to install political insiders as inspectors general, amid concerns that political insiders might not be fair and impartial. 
The bills would also allow inspectors general to compel testimony from ex-government officials, contractors or non-government officials, and empower the Justice Department inspector general to more easily conduct probes into misconduct by department attorneys.
Similar legislation passed in the U.S. House of Representatives with some bipartisan support. The Senate version has strong bipartisan support, boding well for its chances of eventually being signed into law by President Joe Biden, a Democrat who defeated the Republican Trump a year ago.
Inspectors general serve inside executive branch agencies and have a unique duty to report their findings to both Congress and agency heads. Their job is meant to be nonpartisan, but a president has a right to remove them for any reason. 
Under the proposed legislation, a president would be required to tap a senior official already employed within an inspector general office to serve as an acting inspector general.
A lack of testimonial subpoena power was a problem for the Justice Department inspector general's probe into the FBI's botched investigation of former doctor Larry Nassar's sexual abuse of female professional gymnasts.
In that case, the office was unable to compel former USA Gymnastics president Steve Penny to sit for a follow-up interview after investigators discovered the former FBI special agent in charge who was overseeing the Nassar probe had been in talks with Penny about a possible job.
""We should be able to get all the evidence in those cases,"" Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz told Reuters on Tuesday. ""The victims deserve that.""

If enacted, the legislation would give Horowitz's office authority for the first time to expressly investigate department attorneys for misconduct.
Currently that power rests with the Office of Professional Responsibility. Although Horowitz can ask for authority from the deputy attorney general to conduct an investigation into attorney misconduct, he said his office had been turned down ""every single time we have asked for it.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. law enforcement officials seized more than one ton of cocaine allegedly shipped to the New York area from Puerto Rico, the largest bust of the drug in the region in over a decade, authorities said on Tuesday.
The bust comes as authorities grapple with a 150% increase in cocaine seizures over the past year in the area, said Ray Donovan, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's special agent in charge for the New York division. 
Cocaine availability nationwide in 2019 dropped 14% from the prior year and hit its lowest level in six years, and supply remained largely steady throughout 2020, according to a March 2021 DEA report.
""This seizure signifies a shift in the illegal drug landscape in New York,"" Donovan said in a statement. 
The 920 kilograms (2,028 pounds) of cocaine seized could have a street value of between $37 million and $370 million, depending on the retail level, according to a person familiar with the case.
In an indictment filed on Monday, federal prosecutors accused three men - Jorge Aponte-Guzman, Nelson Agramonte-Minaya and Carlos Maisonet-Lopez - of drug trafficking conspiracy in relation to the seized drugs. 
Officials found the cocaine packaged inside large metal lawn rollers in a rental van that Aponte-Guzman drove from a New Jersey loading dock to a residence, prosecutors said. Shipping records showed the rollers were sent from Puerto Rico to an address in the Bronx, they added.
Defense attorneys for Aponte-Guzman and Maisonet-Lopez did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An attorney for Agramonte-Minaya declined to comment.
Damian Williams, the new U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York sworn in last month, referred to the amount of cocaine seized as a ""massive quantity of dangerous drugs.""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Palestinians facing eviction from the flashpoint East Jerusalem neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah rejected a deal on Tuesday that would have seen them accept the temporary ownership of their homes by an Israeli settler organisation. 
The long-running legal battle over the evictions helped trigger an 11-day war between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza, and the case has been a regular source of tension across East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank. 
Seeking a compromise, Israel's Supreme Court in October proposed a deal that would have seen four Palestinian families remain in their homes for 15 years as ""protected tenants"" while paying rent to settlers who claim the land. 
The court gave the families until Nov. 2 to decide whether to accept. 
""We unanimously rejected the settlement offered by the occupation (Israeli) court,"" Muna El-Kurd, one of the Palestinians facing eviction, said at a press conference.
""This refusal comes from our faith in the justice of our case and our rights to our homes and homeland,"" said El-Kurd, wearing a jacket embellished with the words ""No Fear"". She was flanked by other residents.
The deal would have required the Palestinians to recognise the settlers' ownership claims on land their families have lived on for generations - a condition they have long rejected. It also would have granted them the right to prove ownership in the future.
A ruling on the families' fate has been repeatedly delayed since May, after the case garnered international attention and the “#SaveSheikhJarrah” hashtag gained momentum overseas.
The families have lived in their homes since the 1950s. But the settlers claim the land is theirs and presented 19th-century documents as evidence in Israeli courts.
Some Israeli settlers have already moved in to homes in the neighbourhood. After the news conference, Reuters knocked on the door of one of the settlers' houses, but there was no answer.
Israel has framed the issue of Sheikh Jarrah as a real estate dispute, while Palestinians say the court-ordered evictions aim to erase their presence in the holy city.

Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war, occupying and later annexing it. It regards the entire city as its undivided capital - a status not recognised internationally.
Palestinians seek East Jerusalem as capital of a state they hope to establish in the West Bank and Gaza.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear a bid by a Catholic hospital in California to avoid a lawsuit over its refusal to let its facilities be used to perform a hysterectomy on a transgender patient who sought the procedure as a part of gender transition from female to male. 
The justices turned away an appeal by Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a Sacramento-area hospital owned by Dignity Health, and let stand a lower court ruling that revived Evan Minton's lawsuit accusing it of intentionally discriminating against him in violation of California law because he is transgender.
The justices on Monday also bolstered a Roman Catholic-led challenge to a New York state requirement that health insurance policies provided by employers cover abortion services. The justices told a lower court to reconsider its decision to throw out a bid by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany and other plaintiffs to widen an existing religious exemption to a 2017 state regulation that requires health insurance policies to cover ""medically necessary"" abortions. 
Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch said they would have taken up both cases for argument.
In the California case, the hospital said it does not discriminate against transgender patients, but does not allow its facilities to be used for a certain procedures including abortion, sterilization and euthanasia, which it contends are contrary to Catholic teachings.
The hospital in 2016 had initially scheduled Minton's hysterectomy - surgical removal of the uterus - but canceled it after learning the reason Minton wanted it, according to the lawsuit. The hospital let Minton's physician perform the procedure at a different facility in its system a few days later.
Minton sued in state court, accusing the hospital of violating a California civil rights law that prohibits discrimination by business establishments, including hospitals, based on race, religion, sexual orientation or gender identity. 
After a trial judge ruled against Minton, a California appeals court in 2019 revived the case, rejecting the hospital's argument that forcing it to perform procedures contrary to its religious beliefs would violate its right under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment to the free exercise of religion.

""This case poses a profound threat to faith-based health care institutions' ability to advance their healing ministries consistent with the teachings of their faith,"" the hospital told the justices in a court filing. 
Minton said the hysterectomy was medically necessary to treat gender dysphoria, which the American Psychiatric Association defines as ""clinically significant distress"" due to a conflict between a person's gender identity and sex assigned at birth. The hospital routinely performs hysterectomies on non-transgender patients to treat other issues, such as chronic pelvic pain or uterine fibroids, Minton told the justices in a legal filing.

The National Transportation Safety board previously criticized the FAA in its investigation of the July 2016 Texas balloon crash that killed 16 people. A balloon hit a power line and plummeted in flames into a pasture near Lockhart, about 30 miles (50 km) south of the state capital Austin.
Investigators said the balloon pilot and owner of the balloon, who was killed in the crash, flew in weather conditions below required visual flight rule minimums and did not disclose a series of drug and alcohol related arrests dating back to 1987. He did not have a valid driver’s license at the time of the crash and had been incarcerated twice.

Balloon pilots are currently not required to obtain a pilot medical certificate, but cannot operate if they have certain medical conditions.
In 2018, Congress directed the FAA to revise the medical certification standards for commercial balloon pilots. The FAA's proposed rule would mandate a second-class medical certificate, the same standard required for commercial pilots.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - As Myanmar's military seeks to put down protest on the streets, a parallel battle is playing out on social media, with the junta using fake accounts to denounce opponents and press its message that it seized power to save the nation from election fraud, eight people with knowledge of the tactics said. 
The army, which was banned by the country's dominant online platform Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) after the Feb. 1 coup, has tasked thousands of soldiers with conducting what is widely referred to in the military as ""information combat"", according to the people, who include four military sources.
The mission of the social media drive, part of the military's broader propaganda operations, is to spread the junta's view among the population, as well as to monitor dissenters and attack them online as traitors, the people told Reuters.
""Soldiers are asked to create several fake accounts and are given content segments and talking points that they have to post,"" said Captain Nyi Thuta, who defected from the army to join rebel forces at the end of February. ""They also monitor activity online and join (anti-coup) online groups to track them."" 
The 31-year-old said he was part of the army's propaganda operations until his defection, writing speeches for military chief Min Aung Hlaing.
A spokesperson for the military government did not respond to repeated requests for comment on its social media tactics. In September, a junta spokesperson on army-owned Myawaddy TV accused media groups and opposition activists of spreading ""fake news"" about the situation in Myanmar.
The eight people with knowledge of the social media drive all asked to remain anonymous, citing fears of retaliation, with the exception of Nyi Thuta and Captain Lin Htet Aung, who defected from the army in April.
The military, known as the Tatmadaw, is pushing its campaign online even as it puts down protests on the streets, nine months after it ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, saying her National League for Democracy had fraudulently won the November 2020 vote. International election watchdogs said in a May report that the vote was fair. 
A Reuters review of thousands of social media posts in 2021 found that about 200 military personnel, using their personal accounts on platforms including Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Telegram, regularly posted messages or videos alleging fraud at the election and denouncing anti-coup protesters as traitors. 
In over 100 cases, the messages or videos were duplicated across dozens of copycat accounts within minutes, as well as on online groups, purported fan channels for Myanmar celebrities and sports teams and purported news outlets, data from Facebook-owned online tracking tool Crowdtangle showed. 
Posts often referred to people who opposed the junta as ""enemies of the state"" and ""terrorists"", and variously said they wanted to destroy the army, the country and the Buddhist religion.
Many opposition activists are using some similar methods, creating duplicate accounts to fill ""Twitter teams"" with hundreds of thousands of members and making anti-junta hashtags trend, according to the review and four activist sources.
While such tactics are common worldwide, they can be particularly influential in Myanmar, according to four researchers interviewed by Reuters who said the population receives most of its information via social media rather than directly from established news outlets, and Facebook is regularly used by over half the population.
'AGGRESSIVELY REMOVED'
The Tatmadaw has killed more than 1,000 civilians and jailed thousands since the coup, according to the United Nations, though the army says these estimates are exaggerated and that soldiers have also been killed by rebel forces.
Rafael Frankel, Facebook's director of public policy emerging countries, Asia Pacific, told Reuters the company ""proactively"" detected almost 98 percent of the hate speech removed from its platform in Myanmar.
""Our ban of the Tatmadaw and repeated disruption of coordinated inauthentic behavior has made it harder for people to misuse our services to cause harm,"" he added, responding to questions on the army's continued use of fake accounts. 
""This is a highly adversarial issue and we are working hard to calibrate our systems to properly enforce the ban at scale.""
Facebook says it has taken down hundreds of accounts and pages linked to Myanmar army personnel since 2018, after the New York Times reported that military officials were behind fake pages inciting violence against the Muslim Rohingya minority, 700,000 fled an army crackdown in 2017, and a Reuters investigation found Facebook was failing to police anti-Rohingya hate speech. 
YouTube said it had ""terminated"" two pro-military channels posing as news outlets flagged by Reuters and that it was monitoring for ""violative"" content, while TikTok said it had ""aggressively removed"" thousands of Myanmar accounts that breached its guidelines.
Twitter said it remained vigilant against attempted manipulation. Telegram did not respond to a request for comment.
'INFORMATION WARFARE'
The information combat drive is being coordinated from the capital Naypyidaw by the army's Public Relations and Information Production Unit, known under the acronym Ka Ka Com, which has hundreds of solders there, said Nyi Thuta and Lin Htet Aung.
""Ka Ka Com gives a person's information to military intelligence if they believe they should be arrested or subject to on the ground surveillance,"" said Lin Htet Aung.
The central unit coordinates the work of dozens of smaller social media teams deployed across the country at regional military commands and battalions, according to the defectors.
The military has imposed some temporary restrictions on the internet since the coup and banned the use of Facebook in February yet 20 million people in the country continued to use the platform in July, according to Facebook data. That figure compares with 28 million in January, with many users getting around the ban by using virtual private networks (VPNs), according to researchers.
Nyi Thuta and Lin Htet Aung said those monitoring for signs of trouble were particularly vigilant for any dissent among other soldiers to prevent defections. They said ""monitoring teams"" were often staffed in part by female soldiers, who are not allowed combat roles. 
Both ahead of the election and after the coup, soldiers and their families were told to report their social media accounts to the army and warned not to post content critical of the junta or supportive of Aung San Suu Kyi, according to the two defectors plus another military source.
Nyi Thuta said he and other soldiers who did leave the army had been the targets of online attacks. 
Reuters reviewed two Telegram groups with thousands of soldiers in them, who shared the identities, photos and social media details of people they said they suspected of being ""watermelons"", pro-military on the outside but secretly supportive of Aung San Suu Kyi, whose party's colors are red.
Both Lin Htet Aung and Nyi Thuta said they left the army of their own accord in protest at the coup. Lin Htet Aung now helps to train rebel forces in Myanmar. 

Nyi Thuta, who declined to specify his location, said he had launched an online support organization for military personnel who wanted to defect, called People's Soldiers. The group, which has over a quarter of a million followers on Facebook, estimates that 2,000 soldiers have defected since the coup, a figure that Reuters was unable to confirm. 
    ""I'm using the information warfare tactics I learned in the army against them,"" he said.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - China and Russia are pushing the U.N. Security Council to ease sanctions on North Korea by reviving a 2019 attempt to remove a ban on Pyongyang's exports of statues, seafood and textiles and expanding it to include lifting a refined petroleum imports cap.
In a reworked draft resolution, seen by Reuters on Monday, China and Russia want the 15-member council to remove those sanctions ""with the intent of enhancing the livelihood of the civilian population"" in the isolated Asian state. 
North Korea has been subject to U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. 
The draft resolution also includes other measures first proposed by Russia and China nearly two years ago, including lifting a ban on North Koreans working abroad and exempting inter-Korean rail and road cooperation projects from sanctions.
Several U.N. diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the refreshed draft resolution would find little support. In 2019 Russia and China held two informal rounds of talks on the draft resolution, but never formally tabled it for a vote.
Diplomats said on Monday that China and Russia have not yet scheduled any talks on their new draft resolution. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, France, Britain, Russia or China to pass.
The U.N. missions of Russia and China did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new text, which diplomats said was circulated to council members on Friday.
""It has been always China's will that we should also address the humanitarian dimension caused by the sanctions imposed by the Security Council,"" China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun told reporters last month, adding again that the 2019 draft resolution ""remains on the table.""
'DIFFICULT SITUATION'
A spokesperson for the U.S. mission to the United Nations declined to comment on private council discussions, but added that all U.N. members should be focused on addressing those who are violating the sanctions already in place.
""The Security Council has repeatedly affirmed that it is prepared to modify, suspend, or lift the measures as may be needed in light of the DPRK's compliance,"" the spokesperson said. ""Yet the DPRK has taken no steps to comply with the Security Council's demands regarding its prohibited nuclear and ballistic missile programs.""
North Korea is formally known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
The U.N. Security Council does already allow for humanitarian exemptions. A U.N. rights investigator last month called for sanctions to be eased as North Korea's most vulnerable risk starvation after it slipped deeper into isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The sanctions on industries that Russia and China have proposed lifting previously earned North Korea hundreds of millions of dollars. They were put in place in 2016 and 2017 to try to cut off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
North Korea continued developing its nuclear and ballistic missile programs during the first half of 2021 in violation of U.N. sanctions and despite the country's worsening economic situation, U.N. sanctions monitors reported in August.

The country has long suffered from food insecurity, with observers saying that mismanagement of the economy is exacerbated by sanctions and now the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted unprecedented border lockdowns there.
The new draft resolution would have the council acknowledge ""the difficult situation of economy and livelihood of the DPRK in recent years, underscoring the necessity to respect the legitimate security concerns of the DPRK, and ensure the welfare, inherent dignity, and rights of people in the DPRK.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Two months after letting a near-total ban on abortion in Texas take effect, conservative U.S. Supreme Court justices on Monday signaled they are reconsidering their positions and could let abortion providers pursue a bid to invalidate the law.
The court on Sept. 1 declined to halt the law https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/texas-six-week-abortion-ban-takes-effect-2021-09-01 in a 5-4 decision with all but one of its six conservative justices in the majority. During three hours of oral arguments on Monday, at least two of the justices who had allowed the law to be enforced - Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett - appeared to lean toward permitting abortion providers to proceed with their legal challenge. 
The court's conservatives seemed more skeptical about whether to let Democratic President Joe Biden's administration pursue its own challenge. The Justice Department sued Texas in September seeking to block the Republican-backed law. 
The administration and abortion providers have said the law violates a woman's constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy recognized in the court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling and is impermissibly designed to evade federal judicial review.
The law imposes the nation's toughest abortion restrictions, banning it after about six weeks of pregnancy - a time when many women do not realize they are pregnant - with no exceptions for pregnancies resulting from incest or rape. It is one of a wave of Republican-backed state abortion laws in recent years. Abortion opponents hope the court's 6-3 conservative majority will pare back abortion rights or even overturn Roe v. Wade.
Some justices signaled that existing Supreme Court precedent could accommodate the lawsuit by the abortion providers despite the law's novel design that makes it difficult for federal courts to block it. The law lets private citizens rather than state officials enforce it through lawsuits against providers and others who assist a woman in obtaining an abortion.
Depending on what approach the justices take, they could block the law entirely or pave the way for a lower court judge to do so. If the justices keep federal courts out of the process by virtue of the law's design, it could be replicated in various other states seeking to curtail abortion access.
U.S. abortion rights are hanging in the balance as the justices review the Texas law before hearing arguments on Dec. 1 https://www.reuters.com/article/legal-us-usa-court-abortion-instant/u-s-supreme-court-takes-up-case-that-could-limit-abortion-rights-idUSKCN2CY1P9 over the legality of a Mississippi measure, blocked by lower courts, prohibiting the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy.
'FULLY AIRED'
Barrett asked clinic lawyer Marc Hearron about whether under the law's structure the constitutional claims on the right to abortion could ever be ""fully aired."" Under the law, abortion providers can bring up that constitutional issue as a defense only after they have been sued.
Kavanaugh expressed interest in an outcome raised by liberal Justice Elena Kagan in which state court clerks would be barred from allowing lawsuits brought by private individuals seeking to enforce the law to proceed while litigation over the legality of the measure unfolds. 
Kavanaugh wondered if states could pass similar laws https://www.reuters.com/world/us/texas-abortion-law-critics-warn-conservatives-unintended-consequences-2021-10-31 infringing on other constitutional rights including gun rights. A state, for example, could allow for $1 million in damages against anyone who sells an AR-15 rifle, he said. Kavanaugh also wondered about closing a loophole ""exploited"" by the Texas measure in the court's precedents concerning when state officials can be barred from enforcing unconstitutional laws. 
His tone was more skeptical toward the Biden administration lawsuit, telling U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar that challenge was ""different and irregular and unusual.""
Kagan said the law was written by ""some geniuses"" to evade the broad legal principle that ""states are not to nullify federal constitutional rights."" Kagan warned of the consequences of states passing laws that infringe upon rights, including same-sex marriage and religious liberty.
The Texas measure enables private citizens to sue anyone who performs or assists a woman in getting an abortion after cardiac activity is detected in the embryo. That feature made it more difficult to directly sue the state. Individual citizens can be awarded a minimum of $10,000 for bringing successful lawsuits under the law. Biden's administration has called it a ""bounty.""
Conservative justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito asked whether anyone would have standing to sue under the law without having a direct injury. Texas Solicitor General Judd Stone, defending the law, said personal ""outrage"" toward abortion would be enough to justify a lawsuit. 

The law has deterred abortion providers facing innumerable potentially costly lawsuits in Texas - the second most-populous U.S. state behind only California, with about 29 million people.
The court agreed to take up https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-hear-challenge-texas-abortion-ban-2021-10-22 the matter on Oct. 22, bypassing lower courts considering the challenges.

MAPASTEPEC, Mexico (Reuters) - A caravan of thousands of migrants and asylum seekers from Central America and the Caribbean resumed its trek through southern Mexico on Monday, despite concerns that half of them could be injured or sick, including some from dengue fever.
Over the past week, the approximately 3,000 migrants, mostly women and children, have trekked over 100 km (60 miles) from the city of Tapachula on the Guatemalan border, struggling through sweltering heat and evening rains.
Kabir Sanchez, a volunteer doctor helping to look after injured caravan members, said he and his colleagues treated dozens of people on Saturday with foot injuries, respiratory problems, infections and pregnant women at risk of miscarrying.
""More than 50% of the people in the caravan are sick,"" he told Reuters by telephone.
He said other caravan members had possible cases of coronavirus, but that the government had not provided COVID-19 tests.
The government's National Migration Institute (INM) did not immediately reply to a request for comment on COVID-19 testing.
The INM did say in a statement that six people in the caravan, including five children, had contracted dengue.
On Sunday night, the caravan members slept outside in the rain having paused their trek during the day due to the health concerns.

Most of the migrants are fleeing poverty, violence and the impact of adverse environmental conditions linked to climate change in their homelands. Many hope to make it to the U.S. border.
Leaders of the caravan last week rejected the Mexican government's offer of visas that are meant to grant migrants access to healthcare and regular work, arguing it had failed to keep promises to help them in the past.

797,"<span>Nov 01, 2021 07:54PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- One hundred countries, representing 85% of the world’s forests, have given themselves nine years to halt and reverse deforestation, in a major new commitment at global climate change talks on Tuesday.
Brazil, Russia, Canada, Colombia and Indonesia will be among the nations committing to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030 at the third day of COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, in an initiative spearheaded by the conference host, the U.K.
The inclusion of Brazil, home to the world’s largest tropical rainforest, is crucial to the initiative and comes amid a turnaround in the country’s ambitions to reduce emissions and tackle deforestation. Across the world as a whole, an area of forest the size of 27 soccer pitches is lost every minute, according to the U.K.
The international pledge will be backed by $19.2 billion (about 14 billion pounds) in funding, the U.K. said. However, only $7.2 billion of that will be new money, coming from companies and philanthropies and will go to encouraging deforestation-free soy and cattle production in South America, and to scale investments in tree planting and other nature-based solutions.
In addition to the private funding, 12 countries including the U.K. will allocate $12 billion (8.75 billion pounds) of public funds from 2021 through 2025 to tackle wildfires, restore land and help indigenous communities. These contributions will mostly come from existing financial commitments, according to a spokeswoman from the U.K. government.  
Meanwhile, 30 financial institutions including  Aviva  (LON:AV) Plc,  Schroders  (LON:SDR) and Axa, will also commit to eliminate investment in activities linked to deforestation.  
“With today’s unprecedented pledges, we will have a chance to end humanity’s long history as nature’s conqueror, and instead become its custodian,” said U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

(Reuters) -A U.S. judge in Florida on Monday dismissed money laundering counts against Alex Saab, an ally of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, but he remains accused of one count of conspiracy to launder money, a court filing showed.
The order was issued by U.S. District Judge Robert Scola. The conspiracy charge that remains carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.
Prosecutors say Saab, a Colombia-born businessman and top dealmaker for Maduro's socialist government, siphoned around $350 million out of Venezuela via the United States as part of a bribery scheme linked to Venezuela's state-controlled exchange rate.
One of Saab's lawyers, Henry Bell, told Reuters last week that his client would plead not guilty at an arraignment that had been originally scheduled for Monday but was postponed to Nov. 15. Bell declined to comment on Monday's decision.
Maduro's allies have characterized Washington's pursuit of Saab as part of an ""economic war"" on Venezuela being waged by the U.S. government. The case has strained already frayed relations between Washington and Caracas.
Saab was extradited https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-venezuela-politics-saab/cape-verde-supreme-court-rules-on-extradition-of-maduro-envoy-idUSKBN2BA0HQ last month to the United States from Cape Verde, where he was detained in the summer of 2020 on a U.S. warrant. 
In a Monday filing, U.S. prosecutors requested that seven of the initial eight charges contained in a July 2019 indictment be dropped to comply with assurances that officials made to the government of Cape Verde in seeking Saab's extradition. 
Prosecutors said officials promised Cape Verde that Saab would only be charged on a single count to comply with the archipelago nation's laws regarding the maximum term of imprisonment. 
Prosecutors did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.
Three former federal prosecutors told Reuters they did not think the dismissals were major complications to the U.S. case, although one said it was a setback. 
""This filing shows that the U.S. has now lost some sentencing leverage,"" said Mark Bini, partner with Reed Smith.
But Benton Curtis, a partner at McDermott Will & Emery, said that a lower maximum sentence was unlikely to affect Saab's likelihood of collaborating. 
""Twenty years is still twenty years – that's a potentially significant period of incarceration. Once you reach certain (high) levels of potential incarceration, cooperation becomes less and less attractive to defendants,"" Curtis said. 
Venezuela's opposition has said it hopes Saab will tell U.S. law enforcement agencies what he knows https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/high-profile-case-against-maduro-ally-saab-miami-2021-11-01 about any criminal activity by top Venezuelan officials, as well as the government's schemes for evading U.S. sanctions, which are aimed at ousting Maduro.
Washington has called Maduro a corrupt dictator and blamed him for the once-wealthy OPEC nation's economic collapse.
Following Saab's arrest, Venezuela's government said Saab had been granted Venezuelan citizenship and had been named a diplomat to negotiate shipments of fuel and humanitarian aid from Iran. 

In response to the extradition, Maduro's government last month suspended nascent negotiations with the opposition.
The U.S.-backed opposition, which has called on Maduro to resume the talks, has said Saab became wealthy as a result of the deals he made with the government and did nothing to relieve the suffering of Venezuela's citizens.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - National and international mediation efforts working to solve Sudan's political crisis are expected to bear fruit in coming days, the U.N. special envoy said on Monday.
General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan toppled Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok's cabinet a week ago and arrested key politicians. Hamdok remains under house arrest in his residence, Volker Perthes told reporters in New York via video from Sudan. 
""There are multiple mediation efforts under way in Khartoum by a host of actors,"" Perthes said. ""We are supporting a couple of these efforts, proposing initiatives and ideas and coordinating with some of these mediators."" 
""It is bigger packages that are being put up for negotiation and they hope that within the next couple of days ... the contours of a package would become visible,"" he said. ""There's a general sense that a way out should be found.""
Perthes said he could not speak about the demands, conditions or positions of Hamdok and Burhan, with the mediators shuttling between the pair. However, he said negotiations could only be held between ""people who are at liberty,"" in reference to the detained officials.
A statement posted by the Ministry of Information representing civilian authorities, said that Hamdok maintained that the solution to the crisis was the release of all detainees and the return of his cabinet to work, and that he would not recognize the decisions of the coup leaders.
Politicians involved in mediation efforts say the main compromise under discussion is a proposal for Hamdok to be given full executive powers and appoint a cabinet of technocrats.
The proposal, which the sources say has been presented to all sides, would do away with the 14-member power-sharing Sovereign Council in favour of a three-person honorary council.
Political parties, rebel groups, and the military - partners in the pre-coup government - would be represented in parliament, and the military would continue to lead a Security and Defense Council, they said.
The coup took place 2-1/2 years after a popular uprising ousted the authoritarian Omar al-Bashir, who had ruled Sudan, Africa's third largest country, for three decades. 
Hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets on Saturday to demand an end to military rule and the restoration of a civilian-led government. Security forces shot dead three people, a doctors union said, bringing the death toll since the coup to 15.
The doctors union and an eyewitness said that security forces fired tear gas and live bullets at citizens in a neighborhood of Omdurman on Monday. One person was shot in the shoulder and three others were injured, the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors in a statement.

Burhan has said he removed the cabinet to avert civil war after civilian politicians allegedly stoked hostility to the armed forces. He says he is still committed to a democratic transition, including elections in July 2023.
Several professionals groups reaffirmed their commitment to general strikes on Monday in protest of the coup, and resistance committees began laying out schedules for new protests and civil disobedience.

Reuters could not independently verify the statement as phone connections in the area were down. Government spokesperson Legesse Tulu, a military spokesperson, and an Amhara regional spokesperson did not respond immediately to requests for comment. 
The forces from the northern region of Tigray say they have pushed further south into the neighbouring Amhara region this week in a bid to pressurise the central government to meet their demands, although the government disputes how far they have advanced. 
If Tigrayan fighters join up with rebellious forces from Oromiya, Ethiopia's most populous region, it could strengthen their ability to threaten the capital, a move that would deepen the conflict in Africa's second most populous nation and increase turmoil in a volatile region. 
""We have linked up with the OLF/OLA and if achieving our objectives in Tigray will require that we march to Addis Ababa, we will. But we are not saying we are marching to Addis Ababa,"" Getachew Reda, a spokesperson for the forces led by the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), told Reuters. 
The Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) is a banned armed group that splintered from the opposition party the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF). The Oromo are Ethiopia's largest ethnic group; many of their political leaders are currently in jail. 
U.S. CONCERNS
The U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken United States expressed concern about Tigrayan advances on Monday, tweeting ""Continued fighting prolongs the dire humanitarian crisis in northern Ethiopia. All parties must stop military operations and begin ceasefire negotiations without preconditions.""
This weekend Tigrayan forces said they had pushed further south and taken Kombolcha and Dessie, two towns on the A2 highway leading into Addis Ababa. Tens of thousands of ethnic Amharas had sought refuge from an escalation in fighting in Dessie. 
The Ethiopian government denied Tigrayan forces had taken Dessie on Saturday, but on Monday they issued a statement accusing Tigrayan forces of killing 100 youths in Kombolcha, about 380 km (235 miles) north of Addis Ababa. 
TPLF spokesman Getachew told Reuters by satellite phone from an undisclosed location: ""We don't have to kill the youth. There was no resistance in Kombolcha.""
Government spokesperson Legesse Tulu did not respond when asked by phone and message for a comment on Getachew's statement. 
The government did not provide any additional details for their claim, and phone lines to the area are down so Reuters was unable to reach residents in either town. 
A Reuters witness counted at least three checkpoints within 50 kilometers on the A2 road on Monday, each manned by 50 federal police officers and assisted by militia forces.
One militia officer told Reuters the dragnet is to stop illegal migration into the capital, adding that they were only allowing those with valid resident permits for the capital to pass.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed called on all citizens to mobilise. The Amhara regional government has issued a similar call, urging all citizens to join the fight. 

The Tigrayan forces have been fighting the government for the past year in a widening war that first pitted federal troops against the TPLF, which dominated Ethiopian politics for nearly 30 years before Abiy was appointed in 2018.
The conflict has plunged around 400,000 people in Tigray into famine, killed thousands of civilians and forced more than 2.5 million people in northern Ethiopia to flee their homes.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Prosecutors can refer to individuals accusing Ghislaine Maxwell of sex crimes as ""victims"" in the upcoming trial of Jeffrey Epstein's longtime associate, a judge ruled on Monday.
Attorneys for Maxwell, whom prosecutors have charged with procuring and grooming underage girls for Epstein to abuse, had argued that using the term victims could bias the jury that will decide the fate of the British socialite.
But U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan said in a hearing on Monday that it would be ""unecessary and impractical"" to exclude use of the term, adding that she could revisit the decision if the prosecution were using it in a ""prejudicial"" way.
""I will of course instruct the jury repeatedly that the defendant is presumed innocent,"" Nathan said.
Maxwell, 59, appeared in court on Monday in a white face mask.
She was arrested in July 2020 and has pleaded not guilty to six counts of sex trafficking and other crimes regarding her alleged recruitment of girls to give Epstein what prosecutors described as ""sexualized massages."" 
Jury selection in the case is slated to begin on Thursday, and opening arguments are expected on Nov. 29.
Nathan's ruling, coupled with another decision allowing witnesses to testify under pseudonyms, could complicate the defense's efforts to dispute accusers' credibility.

Nathan said withholding the identities of victims who plan on testifying could protect them from harassment in what she called a ""highly publicized case involving highly sensitive issues."" 
Maxwell's attorneys have argued that she was unaware of any illegal activity by her ex-boyfriend Epstein, a teacher-turned-globetrotting financier. Epstein in 2019 died by suicide in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial for alleged sex crimes.

In Rome for the G20 summit, the two leaders were meeting for first time since Australia scrapped the multi-billion dollar deal with France as part of a new security alliance with Britain and the United States unveiled in September.
The alliance, dubbed AUKUS, which could give Australia access to nuclear-powered submarines, caught Paris off guard, prompting it to recall ambassadors from Washington and Canberra amid accusations that France had been betrayed.
""I don't think, I know,"" Macron said in response to a question whether he thought that Morrison had lied to him
""I have a lot of respect for your country,"" he said in comments on Sunday to a group of Australian reporters who had travelled to Italy for the summit of leaders of the top 20 economies.
""I have a lot of respect and a lot of friendship for your people. I just say when we have respect, you have to be true and you have to behave in line, and consistently, with this value."" 
Morrison told a media conference later the same day that he had not lied, and had previously explained to Macron that conventional submarines would no longer meet Australia's needs. The process of repairing ties had begun, he added.
Morrison and Macron spoke last week before the Australian prime minister publicly sought a handsake with his French counterpart at the G20 meeting.
On Monday, Australian Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce urged France to view the matter in perspective.
""We didn’t steal an island, we didn’t deface the Eiffel Tower. It was a contract,"" Joyce told reporters in Moree, 644 km(400 miles) northwest of Sydney.
""Contracts have terms and conditions, and one of those terms and conditions and propositions is that you might get out of the contract.""

Joyce spoke just hours before Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne met France's ambassador to Canberra. Payne said their hour-long meeting focused on efforts to repair the relationship.
On Friday, U.S. President Joe Biden said the handling of the new pact had been clumsy, adding that he had thought France had been informed of the contract cancellation before the pact was announced.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Already mired in economic collapse, Lebanon is facing a blast of Gulf Arab anger after a prominent broadcaster-turned-minister levelled blunt criticism at Saudi Arabia, in a row that has further strained Beirut's ties with once generous benefactors. 
Many ordinary Lebanese fear it is they who will pay the price for the diplomatic deep freeze provoked by the latest spat, which has roots in a long-running rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran that underpins conflicts across the Middle East.
Saudi Arabia and its fellow Gulf Arab monarchies once spent billions of dollars in aid in Lebanon, and still provide jobs and a haven for much of Lebanon's huge diaspora. But the friendship has been strained for years by the growing influence of Lebanon's powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah movement.
Gulf Arab ties with Lebanon hit a new nadir last week when George Kordahi, a former gameshow host recently appointed information minister, appeared in an interview speaking in support of Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis and criticising the Saudi-led forces they are fighting.
For Riyadh, whose sway in Lebanon has waned as Tehran's has grown, Kordahi's comments were just a symptom of Hezbollah's continued dominance of the political scene, though they were recorded before he took office.
Coming as the Houthis advance in Yemen, the fallout of his comments underlines the depth of Iranian-Saudi rivalries. Gulf concerns about Tehran have been stoked by a lack of progress in U.S.-led efforts to revive a deal curbing Iran's nuclear work.
Saudi Arabia and other U.S.-allied Gulf states have long struggled to counter the influence Tehran has carved out across the region by arming, training and financing Shi'ite Muslim groups modelled after Hezbollah, which it founded in 1982.
Saudi Arabia's foreign minister told Reuters at the weekend the issue went beyond the comments by Kordahi, who was named to Prime Minister Najib Mikati's government by Suleiman Frangieh, a Maronite Christian and a close ally of Shi'ite Muslim Hezbollah.
""It's important that the government in Lebanon ... forges a path forward that frees Lebanon from the current political construct, which reinforces the dominance of Hezbollah,"" Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said. 
Saudi Arabia and Gulf allies have expelled Lebanese ambassadors and recalled their envoys from Beirut. Riyadh has also halted imports from Lebanon, which were already suffering because of an earlier Saudi ban on Lebanese fruits and vegetables by Riyadh due to drugs being smuggled in shipments.
""From Riyadh’s vantage point, this recent crisis is seen as an opportunity to pressure the Lebanese system to take a stand against Iran and Hezbollah,"" said Sanam Vakil, deputy director of Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa Program.
""GULF DISCONTENT""
Viewed from Tehran, Riyadh's move shows the Saudis are losing to Iran on the diplomatic front and in need of some leverage, a senior Iranian hardline official close to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's office said. 
But while Riyadh may be able to isolate Lebanon, it would not be able to isolate Hezbollah, the official said. 
For Lebanon's decimated economy, the big concern would be any measures affecting the hundreds of thousands of Lebanese who work in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and the dollars they send home to a nation drowning in poverty.
The fear is gripping Lebanese expats in the Gulf, despite official assurances they will not be sent home.
UAE political analyst Abdulkhaleq Abdulla said Saudi Arabia was being careful not to punish the Lebanese, as were other Gulf states. But other steps ""to convey the deep Gulf discontent with Hezbollah"" might happen, including ending flights, he said.
It isn't the first time in recent years that hostility to Hezbollah has led Riyadh to act against Lebanon. 
In 2017, then Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri unexpectedly resigned while on a visit to Riyadh, plunging Lebanon into crisis. Sources including the French president have said Saudi Arabia held him captive at the time. Riyadh denies this.
ELECTIONS
Another crisis was the last thing Mikati needed as he struggles to address the financial meltdown which has plunged more than three quarters of Lebanese into poverty.
Mikati, a billionaire tycoon, has said Kordahi's remarks were made before he became a minister and had nothing to do with the government. Kordahi has said he will not quit. 
Mikati's cabinet was already in trouble because of a standoff over a probe into last year's Beirut port explosion. The cabinet has not convened since Oct. 12.
Western states want to see progress towards an IMF deal and elections held on time on March 27. Hezbollah's opponents see the election as a chance to overturn the majority won in 2018 by the group and by parties that support its possession of arms.

Christian seats are seen as an area where Hezbollah allies could lose. One party looking to gain is the anti-Hezbollah, Christian Lebanese Forces, widely seen as Riyadh's last major Lebanese ally. 
Lebanon is ""being cut off from the Arab world by the behaviour of Hezbollah and its allies in government"", said the LF's Ghassan Hasbani, a former deputy prime minister.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Sudan's military leadership could face isolation at home and abroad if it tries to tighten its grip after seizing power in the face of opposition from a sophisticated protest movement and from Western states that had invested in a democratic transition, analysts and diplomats say. 
Lacking a political base inside Sudan and with uncertain prospects of support from Gulf states and Egypt, the military has begun to draw on loyalists from the regime of former leader Omar al-Bashir, toppled in 2019 after a popular uprising. 
The coup on Oct. 25 drew swift condemnation from Western countries including the United States, which had been working closely with the dissolved transitional government to stabilise Sudan after decades of isolation under Bashir. 
The general who led the takeover, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, promised to name a government but has yet to do so as mediation efforts involving Sudanese political figures and the United Nations continue against a backdrop of strikes and protests.
Mediation has focused on finding a way for ousted Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok to form a new cabinet of technocrats. Hamdok, an economist, is respected by pro-democracy protesters and was permitted to return home under guard a day after the coup.
But Hamdok resisted pressure to dissolve his government before the coup, and since the takeover has indicated he will not negotiate on a future government unless the army commits to fully restoring the military-civilian power sharing system put in place after Bashir fell. 
""Burhan doesn't have a clean path to form a government in the way that he wanted,"" said one diplomatic source.
Meanwhile, the military has been appointing figures associated with the Bashir era to positions in the state media and foreign ministry, and moving to take control of key institutions including the judiciary, said activists, analysts and diplomats.
'ALTERNATIVE FACTS' 
If the military rejects compromise, it could run the country on cash flows from gold sales and try create ""alternative facts"" through its control of state media and through social media campaigns, said Suliman Baldo of The Sentry, an investigative and policy group based in Washington DC. 
But it will have to contend with a savvy and resilient pro-democracy street movement that has mobilized repeatedly since start of the uprising against Bashir nearly three years ago. 
The protest movement has the stamina to wear down the military through scheduled rounds of disobedience and more mass marches, said Mohamed Alasbat, a spokesman for the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), the main activist coalition.
Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets on Oct. 21, four days before the coup, to protest against the prospect of a military takeover, and similar numbers returned on Saturday.
A campaign of civil disobedience by a wide range of civilian groups as well as protests and security measures to counter them have brought Khartoum to a near standstill over the past week.
Neighbourhood committees organised Saturday's demonstrations in greater Khartoum despite an almost total blackout on mobile phone and internet coverage and the closure of strategic sites, bridges and roads by security forces. Activists handed out printed fliers and went door to door to drum up support. 
The protest movement ""will end up by eroding whatever system he (Burhan) is trying to put in place. This is the real risk for him and that's why I think he will try to target it very aggressively,"" said Baldo.
Foreign states may balk at the unrest this could trigger, and Washington will want to prevent any cross-border spillover, including to conflict-torn Ethiopia, he added. The military takeover has created uncertainty around a partial peace deal that transitional authorities had signed with Sudanese rebel groups last year, with two major armed groups in Darfur and the south rejecting the coup.
AID WITHHELD
The United States has tried to exert pressure by saying it will withhold $700 million in economic assistance and that Sudan will be unable to secure tens of billions of dollars in debt relief as long as the military pursues unilateral control. The World Bank, a key source of development financing whose president visited Khartoum one month ago, has also suspended disbursements.
Internal splits within Sudan's sprawling military apparatus, which developed its commercial interests under Bashir and includes the powerful, paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, are another risk for the army leadership. 
In an indication of possible confusion over its strategy, the former head of Bashir's ruling party was freed from jail on Sunday only to be rearrested on Monday.
Burhan and his backers ""don't have the capacity or the cohesion among themselves to be able to mount the sort of intensive crackdown that could make it work,"" said Alex de Waal, a Sudan expert and head of the World Peace Foundation at Tufts University.

Regional powers such as the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt were no friends of Bashir's Islamist government. They would appear to have little to gain by backing military rule in Sudan, de Waal said. 
Saudi Arabia and the UAE ""don't have deep enough pockets to bail Sudan out of the hole that it's in, so the real leverage lies with the U.S. and the World bank and others. And the U.S. and Western governments having taken a strong stand, Burhan doesn't have much to play with.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Shortly before the U.S. Supreme Court began heard arguments in a major abortion dispute out of Texas, a group of demonstrators who oppose abortion joined together outside the stately white marble neoclassical building to pray for the nine justices, listing each one by name.
Hundreds of people in support and opposition to a restrictive Texas abortion law gathered on Monday outside the courthouse on a mild autumn day in the U.S. capital. The justices heard arguments in challenges by President Joe Biden's administration and abortion providers to the measure, which imposes a near-total abortion ban - prohibiting it after six weeks of pregnancy - and empowers private citizens enforce it. 
Abortion opponents held signs saying, ""Let their hearts beat,"" and played Christian music. Abortion rights supporters held signs saying ""Bans off our bodies"" and ""Abortion is essential.""
Some of the law's supporters cast the debate in religious terms.
The Reverend Patrick Mahoney, chief strategy officer for the anti-abortion group Stanton Public Policy Center, said, ""Our strength is local. You can go to every community in the country right now and find grandmas in church basements knitting baby booties or doing bake sales. There's this collective energy bubbling in our movement right now.""
Regarding the law's private-enforcement mechanism, Mahoney said, ""Is that the way I would have gone? Probably not. But it's saving innocent lives. Overall I think it's innovative and creative.""
The law puts enforcement in the hands of private citizens, empowering them to sue anyone who performs or assists a woman in getting an abortion after cardiac activity is detected in the embryo. Individual citizens can be awarded a minimum of $10,000 in successful lawsuits.
Julia Deluce, a coordinator with the group Students for Life, said she was advocating for the rights of ""pre-born children,"" adding, ""They are human. They are part of our species. And they deserve our protection.""
Abortion rights demonstrators voiced alarm over the Texas law, which bans abortion at a point in time when many women do not yet realize they are pregnant. Abortion was legalized nationwide in the Supreme Court's Roe. v. Wade decision. A series of restrictive Republican-backed abortion laws have been passed by states in recent years.
Washington resident Martha Dickey said she has been advocating for abortion rights since the 1970s.

""I found out what happened in Texas and I was really upset,"" Dickey said. ""... It stops the chance for a woman to be free to decide what happens to her own body.""
Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder of the Whole Women's Health Clinic abortion provider that challenged the Texas law, said, ""A ban like this doesn't change the fact that people need abortions. It just changes the kind of abortions they can have."" She said she hopes the justices understand the impact of their decisions ""on real people's lives.""

BANGKOK/SYDNEY (Reuters) -Thailand, Australia and Israel eased international border restrictions significantly on Monday for the first time in 18 months, offering a broad test of demand for travel worldwide amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The relaxation contrasts with tightening lockdowns elsewhere, notably in eastern Europe where infections have hit record numbers, and in parts of China, which has taken a zero-tolerance approach to COVID-19 despite relatively few cases.
Hundreds of vaccinated foreign tourists arrived in the Thai capital https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/bangkok-welcomes-first-tourists-quarantine-free-holiday-2021-11-01 for quarantine-free travel after the Southeast Asian nation approved visitors from more than 60 countries, including China and the United States. 
Several European nations are also on the list as Thailand, one of Asia's most popular holiday destinations, looks to capitalise on the approach of winter in the northern hemisphere. 
""We just picked this flight and it is quite surprising that we are the first flight to arrive,"" said German tourist Simon Raithel, 41, who planned to head to the Thai south.
In Sydney https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-eases-international-border-ban-first-time-since-march-2020-2021-10-31, hundreds of citizens were greeted by family and friends as they became the first since April 2020 to arrive from abroad without a permit or the need to quarantine. 
""(It's a) little bit scary and exciting,"" said Ethan Carter, who flew in from Los Angeles. ""I've come home to see my mum 'cause she's not well.""
While travel is initially limited to just a few states and to Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate families and New Zealand nationals, it heralds a plan to re-open to international tourists and workers.
'WE MISSED YOU GUYS'
Israel also relaxed travel rules on Monday but tourists should read the fine print before booking.
""Welcome to Israel,"" the government said in a tweet next to a big blue heart. ""We missed you guys.""
Individual tourists are allowed in if they have received vaccine boosters - but not if more than six months have lapsed since their last dose, with some exceptions.
That has tempered excitement among hoteliers.
""How many tourists out in the world have actually gotten boosters or are sitting in that six-month period following their second dose?"" Israel Hotel Association CEO Yael Danieli said in the days leading up to the relaxation.
""Even if both parents in a family are vaccinated, their children under 12 are not, so they mostly can't come to Israel.""
Members of tour groups are exempted from the six-month rule but will have to take PCR or antigen tests every 72 hours for the first two weeks of their stay.
Despite the eased curbs, world travel in full swing is a long way off.
China's tourism sector is suffering from the country's zero tolerance for COVID-19 as cities with infections, or even with concerns about infections, close entertainment venues, restrict travel or delay cultural events. Shanghai Disneyland stopped admitting visitors on Monday.
Eastern Europe is grappling with its worst outbreak since the pandemic started. The Russian capital introduced its strictest lockdown measures in more than a year last Thursday as the daily tally of cases and deaths nationwide hit new highs.
But many Russians have decided that now is an ideal time to fly off for a foreign holiday, with a sharp increase in bookings to destinations where Russia's Sputnik V vaccine is recognised or where COVID entry requirements are cheap and easy.
""Don't quarantine, but holiday on the beach!"" travel company Orange Sun Tour proclaims on its website osttour.ru, which offers breaks in Cyprus, Egypt, Cuba and elsewhere.
Rules aimed at moving South Korea towards ""living with COVID-19"" came into effect on Monday, with the easing of a range of curbs and the introduction of vaccine passports at gyms, saunas and bars.
""The return path to everyday life, to which we're taking the first step today, is a path we've never been on,"" Health Minister Kwon Deok-cheol told an intra-agency COVID-19 meeting.
The Netherlands will impose new coronavirus restrictions this week in a bid to curb a recent surge in infections, Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said, without giving details.

Britain on Monday removed the last seven countries on its coronavirus ""red list"", which required newly arrived travellers to spend 10 days in hotel quarantine.
The United States will lift international travel restrictions for vaccinated travellers on Nov. 8.

(Reuters) - Here is a timeline tracing the case of Kyle Rittenhouse, a U.S. teenager who went on trial on Monday charged with killing two men and wounding a third with a military-style rifle during protests last year in Kenosha, Wisconsin. 
Aug. 23, 2020 - A white police officer responding to a domestic dispute in Kenosha shoots Jacob Blake seven times at close range, paralyzing the Black man and setting off protests.
Aug. 25, 2020 - As Kenosha braces for a third night of protests, Rittenhouse, then 17, takes his rifle and joins other armed men on the streets. Rittenhouse says he was asked to help guard a used-car dealership. Shortly before midnight, Rittenhouse fatally shoots Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, after Rosenbaum appears to have chased him and tried to grab his rifle, according to video evidence. As he runs down the street, Rittenhouse shoots and kills Anthony Huber, 26, who was swinging a skateboard at him, and shoots Gaige Grosskreutz, now 27, in the arm. Grosskreutz, who was holding a pistol at the time of the shooting, survives. 
Aug. 27-28, 2020 - Kenosha County District Attorney charges Rittenhouse with six criminal counts, including reckless and intentional homicides. Rittenhouse, who turned himself in on Aug. 26, is held in custody in his home state Illinois. Atlanta-based attorney Lin Wood says video evidence would vindicate Rittenhouse, showing he acted in self-defense. Wood begins soliciting donations through a non-profit and within a month collects nearly $2 million. Wood and another lawyer portray Rittenhouse as a patriot and tie him to the issue of gun rights. 
Oct. 30, 2020 - Rittenhouse is extradited to Wisconsin.
Nov. 20, 2020 - John Pierce, then an attorney for Rittenhouse, posts $2 million cash bail. Rittenhouse is released.

Jan. 5, 2021 - Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley finds officer Rusten Sheskey acted in self-defense in shooting Blake, saying Blake was armed with a knife and had resisted arrest. That same day Rittenhouse pleads not guilty to all counts in a video appearance at Kenosha County Circuit Court.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to consider whether the public has a right to see significant decisions issued by a secretive court that approves government surveillance requests including some that are highly contentious.
The justices turned away an American Civil Liberties Union bid to gain access to U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court decisions made before 2015 involving what former President George W. Bush's administration called the ""global war on terrorism"" after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. The ACLU had appealed a decision by a specialized appellate court on surveillance matters denying it such access.
Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch and liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor said they would have taken up the case. Gorsuch wrote that the case raises questions about public access to proceedings of ""grave national importance"" and the Supreme Court's own power to supervise lower courts.
""If these matters are not worthy of our time, what is?"" Gorsuch asked.
The ACLU has said the public has a right to know notable decisions made by the court, sometimes called the FISA court after the law under which it was created, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. The ACLU said the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment, which guarantees free speech and freedom of the press, provides a limited right of public access to the FISA court's most significant decisions. 
Tech giant  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and 34 media organizations have supported the ACLU's effort. The FISA court in the past has approved government requests for information held by Microsoft.
Technological advances mean that the FISA court ""evaluates broad programs of surveillance that can have profound implications for Americans' privacy, expressive and associational rights,"" the ACLU's lawyers said in court papers.
President Joe Biden's administration urged the Supreme Court not to hear the appeal, arguing among other things that there are other ways the ACLU could try to make the information public.
The FISA court, founded at a time of heightened concern among lawmakers about the need for greater oversight of U.S. intelligence agencies, makes its decisions on government requests generally without hearing from anyone but U.S. Justice Department lawyers in private proceedings. Its rulings are kept confidential for national security reasons.
Its 11 judges are appointed by U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts. They are full-time federal district court judges who take on the task as an additional responsibility.
The actions of the FISA court came into public view in 2013 when its role in approving the government's secret collection of millions of raw daily phone records of Americans was revealed in a leak of classified information by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who faces U.S. espionage charges. He fled the United States and was given asylum in Russia.
The FISA court was also embroiled in former President Donald Trump's claims that the FBI unlawfully investigated his campaign in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. The Justice Department's internal watchdog in 2019 concluded that the FBI made errors in its warrant applications seeking FISA court approval to conduct surveillance involving contacts between members of Trump's campaign and Russians.
Congress in 2015 passed the USA Freedom Act that ordered the government to declassify certain decisions issued by the FISA court. 
The ACLU in 2016 filed a motion with the FISA court to try to gain access to rulings before then relating to the U.S. ""global war on terror."" 

Between 1978 and the 2013 Snowden leak, only two of the court's multitude of rulings were made public, the ACLU said.
The FISA court in 2020 decided that it did not have the authority to consider the ACLU's request. It did not rule on the underlying First Amendment issue. That decision was upheld by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review later that year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear a bid by a Catholic hospital in California to avoid a lawsuit over its refusal to let its facilities be used to perform a hysterectomy on a transgender patient who sought the procedure as a part of gender transition from female to male. 
The justices turned away an appeal by Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a Sacramento-area hospital owned by Dignity Health, and let stand a lower court ruling that revived Evan Minton's lawsuit accusing it of intentionally discriminating against him in violation of California law because he is transgender.
The justices on Monday also bolstered a Roman Catholic-led challenge to a New York state requirement that health insurance policies provided by employers cover abortion services. The justices told a lower court to reconsider its decision to throw out a bid by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany and other plaintiffs to widen an existing religious exemption to a 2017 state regulation that requires health insurance policies to cover ""medically necessary"" abortions. 
Conservative Justices Thomas Alito, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch said they would have taken up both cases for argument.
In the California case, the hospital said it does not discriminate against transgender patients, but does not allow its facilities to be used for a certain procedures including abortion, sterilization and euthanasia, which it contends are contrary to Catholic teachings.
The hospital in 2016 had initially scheduled Minton's hysterectomy - surgical removal of the uterus - but canceled it after learning the reason Minton wanted it, according to the lawsuit. The hospital let Minton's physician perform the procedure at a different facility in its system a few days later.
Minton sued in state court, accusing the hospital of violating a California civil rights law that prohibits discrimination by business establishments, including hospitals, based on race, religion, sexual orientation or gender identity. 
After a trial judge ruled against Minton, a California appeals court in 2019 revived the case, rejecting the hospital's argument that forcing it to perform procedures contrary to its religious beliefs would violate its right under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment to the free exercise of religion.

""This case poses a profound threat to faith-based health care institutions' ability to advance their healing ministries consistent with the teachings of their faith,"" the hospital told the justices in a court filing. 
Minton said the hysterectomy was medically necessary to treat gender dysphoria, which the American Psychiatric Association defines as ""clinically significant distress"" due to a conflict between a person's gender identity and sex assigned at birth. The hospital routinely performs hysterectomies on non-transgender patients to treat other issues, such as chronic pelvic pain or uterine fibroids, Minton told the justices in a legal filing.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - In a crowded Addis Ababa factory, Finoteselam Nigussie's needle plunges in-and-out of the gauzy white cloth she deftly guides through a sewing machine. 
Like thousands of other Ethiopian women, stitching shawls for export to the United States pays the 40-year-old textile worker's rent and her daughter's school fees. 
Now though, Finoteselam's job is in danger as the United States ponders suspending Ethiopia's duty-free market status, citing abuses and a growing famine in the war-ravaged northern Tigray region. 
Suspension of benefits under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) would threaten Ethiopia's aspirations to become a light manufacturing hub and dent hard-won economic gains in a nation once a byword for hunger and poverty. 
""We have used AGOA since we started business,"" said Finoteselam's boss Sammy Abdella, who set up the company nearly two decades ago and employs 250 people.
""People ... have worked with us since we have started. We have created a family,"" he added, his voice cracking.
Although Ethiopia is not a large global supplier, suspension of its U.S. trade status would be yet another problem on the list for global fashion brands such as The Children's Place (NASDAQ:PLCE), Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein as COVID-19 disrupts manufacturing capacity, ports and supply chains. 
WAR HORRORS
Washington has repeatedly expressed concern over widespread reports of sexual violence by Ethiopian and allied Eritrean soldiers in Tigray, where local forces have battled the military and its allies for a year. 
The United Nations says a de facto blockade of aid has forced 400,000 people into famine. On Thursday, it said no food convoys had entered Tigray for the past 10 days. There have been many reports of mass killings of civilians. 
The government has denied blocking aid and said individual soldiers have been tried for any abuses, without giving details. Eritrea has denied committing abuses. 
Washington has already laid the ground for sanctions, with its chief trade representative promising a decision soon on its AGOA status. 
The act gives sub-Saharan African nations duty-free access to the United States if they meet criteria including removing barriers to U.S. trade and progress towards political pluralism. 
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's chief trade negotiator Mamo Mihretu told Reuters that AGOA had directly created 200,000 jobs and indirectly created millions. 
""We should not politicize trade issues,"" he told Reuters.
Over the past decade, Ethiopia has spent billions constructing a dozen industrial parks and related infrastructure. Some factories produce goods for fashion giant PVH (NYSE:PVH), owner of the Calvin Klein, Speedo and Tommy Hilfiger labels. 
At Finoteselam's company, Sammy Ethiopia, around 90% of products are exported to the United States, via retailers such as Eileen Fisher and Anthropologie.
Exports to the United States account for three quarters of the firm's annual turnover of over $200,000. If Ethiopia is suspended, Sammy said his company will close. 
Ethiopia exported about $237 million worth of goods duty-free to the United States under AGOA in 2020, U.S. commerce department data shows, more than 90% of it textiles and apparel.
Duty-free access is a major draw for companies including Sweden's H&M. The full impact a suspension on foreign investors and Ethiopian companies exporting to the United States is not yet clear, with layoffs and order cancellations possible.
'ADDED HEADACHE'
Mamo warned an AGOA suspension would hurt U.S. companies trying to diversify production from Asia by relocating or expanding to Ethiopia. 
Conlumino, a retail research agency and consulting firm, noted, however, that Ethiopia's textile exports to the United States were still minuscule compared to the likes of China, Bangladesh and India. 
Though Ethiopia would suffer from a AGOA suspension; retailers will find alternatives despite the havoc from COVID-19, said Neil Saunders, a Conlumino analyst.
""The suspension of AGOA will not have a huge impact on clothing retail,"" he said. ""However - as this will come at a time when global manufacturing capacity is already reduced and retailers are struggling to keep up with demand - it is an added headache.""
An H&M spokesperson said the company was following developments regarding AGOA carefully, but it was too early to comment. In December, H&M said its long-term manufacturing and sourcing strategy involves Ethiopia and it did not plan to change. But its Ethiopia production is comparatively small. 
U.S.-based apparel companies The Children's Place, Gap and PVH did not respond to requests for comment.
A senior PVH official previously said the 10-year renewal of AGOA in 2015 ""was a critical factor in PVH's decision to invest"", according to a 2017 case study of PVH in Ethiopia published by the World Bank and co-authored by Mamo.
In 2018, PVH said Ethiopia could become a top supplier because it grows cotton, dyes fabrics and sews garments. It established a joint venture to operate a factory in Hawassa city, the company's first such venture in 30 years. 
Raghavendra Pattar is CEO of Nasa Garment, a manufacturer in Hawassa Industrial Park. Nasa exports about 95% of its garments to U.S. companies. It employs 1,200 workers, mostly women, and spent $7 million to set up the factory two years ago.

But an AGOA suspension would halt expansion.
""AGOA … is the reason buyers are coming to Ethiopia and sourcing manufacturing here,"" he said. ""If the duty benefit is taken away, the buyers will go to another country.""

ROME (Reuters) - An emotional U.S. President Joe Biden, who has come away from his visit with papal backing in his conflict with conservative U.S. bishops, on Sunday praised Pope Francis for being ""everything I learned about Catholicism.""
Biden, the second Catholic president in U.S. history, choked up as he spoke about his late son Beau and his own feelings about the pope and Catholicism at a final news conference in Rome at the end of the G20 summit of leaders of the world's richest nations.
""This is a man who has great empathy. A man who understands that part of his Christianity is to reach out,"" Biden said. ""He is a really, truly genuine decent man.""
Conservative U.S. bishops want to deny Biden the right to receive communion, the central sacrament of the faith, because of Biden's support for abortion rights.
The same bishops, some of whom supported Biden's predecessor Donald Trump, have clashed with the pope on issues including climate change, the death penalty and nuclear weapons. 
Biden has said he personally opposes abortion but, as an elected official, cannot impose his views on others.
""He is everything I learned about Catholicism from the time I was a kid going from grade school through high school,"" Biden said.
In an apparent reference to the pope's critics, Biden said ""I have great respect for people who have other religious views but he's just a fine, decent, honourable man, and we keep in touch.""
After he met the pope on Friday, Biden said the pontiff had told him he is a ""good Catholic"" who can receive the sacrament.
Biden did just that when he went to Mass the next evening at St. Patrick's, the English-language church of the American Catholic community in Rome.
Biden spoke in response to a reporter who asked how he felt about the pope's backing and whether it meant the communion debate should be put to rest.
He answered by heaping praise on the pope as someone ""looking to establish peace and decency and honour, not just in the Catholic church but just generically.""
Biden choked up as he recalled how when Francis visited the United States in 2015, while Biden was vice president, the pontiff took time to console the extended Biden family over the death of Biden's son Beau earlier that year at the age of 46.
""He didn't just generically talk about it (Beau's death from brain cancer), he knew about it. He knew what he did, he knew who he was, he knew where he went to school, he knew what a man he was,"" Biden said.

""It had such a cathartic impact on his (Beau's) children, and my wife, our family, it meant a great deal,"" Biden said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A right-wing Japanese party with a stronghold in the western city of Osaka surprisingly emerged as the third-largest in Sunday's election, capitalising on some discontent with the central government and the left-wing opposition.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) defied expectations and held its strong majority in the lower house poll, solidifying his position in a fractious party and allowing him to ramp up economic stimulus.
But the left-leaning opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ) lost some seats although it remained the second-biggest party in the house. 
The conservative Japan Innovation Party (JIP), which almost quadrupled its haul to 41 seats in the 465-seat legislature, ended up the election's biggest winner, overtaking even the Komeito party, the LDP's coalition partner.
The right-wing JIP has been seen as a possible ally for the LDP's push to revise the constitution. But it has also called for deregulation, tax cuts and decentralisation of authority to help trigger growth
""They took a more critical stance towards the central government, and managed to extract votes from those hesitant about it, but not pleased with the main opposition,"" said Corey Wallace, a Japanese politics expert at Kanagawa University.
One reason for the JIP's success was the party's young No. 2, Osaka governor Hirofumi Yoshimura, and his social media reach combined with frequent appearances during the COVID-19 pandemic, when traditional campaigns had been limited, said Hosei University professor Hiroshi Shiratori.
Unlike many other Japanese mainstream politicians, the 46-year-old who has 1.2 million followers on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), speaks off the cuff, and often makes impassioned television pleas to the public to comply with pandemic-related restrictions.

Yoichiro Sato, a professor of international relations at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University, said the JIP favoured small government and could ""block Kishida's new capitalism idea of narrowing the rich-poor income gap"" even further.
However, like the LDP, the JIP favours the revision of the post-war constitution and allowing for the defence budget to go above the informal ceiling of 1% of the GDP. The LDP for the first time called for raising defence spending to 2% in its manifesto.
""If they join hands in promoting policy to bolster defence, there will be little CDPJ or the Japanese Communist Party can do,"" said Mikitaka Masuyama, professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies.
A stronger JIP could also put more focus on Japan's drive to build casinos. The party supports the effort and Osaka in September picked MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) International and partner  Orix  (NYSE:IX) Corp to build what could be Japan's first casino.

Wallace said that Osaka residents are ""not as strongly opposed to casinos,"" as in other potential sites like Yokohama, adding that JIP's win ""despite support for a casino being one of their clearer and more committed positions suggests there is a decent chance of casino supporters eventually prevailing.""
Ichiro Matsui, the mayor of Osaka who leads the party, said after the election that the group will stay in opposition and keep the Kishida administration in check by ""saying what's right is right and what's wrong is wrong.""

814,"<span>Nov 01, 2021 03:55AM ET</span>","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's leisure and tourism businesses are feeling the bite of the country's zero tolerance for COVID-19 as cities with infections, or have concerns about the virus, close entertainment venues, restrict tourism or delay cultural events. 
Shanghai Disneyland stopped admitting visitors on Monday and Tuesday, and required patrons and staffers in the theme park on Oct. 30-31 to undergo COVID tests immediately, according to state media. 
The measures are part of the city's cooperation with a COVID-19 investigation requested by authorities from outside Shanghai, state television reported, without providing further details. 
A total of 484 domestically transmitted cases with confirmed symptoms were reported on Oct. 17-31, mostly in the north of China, Reuters calculations based on official data showed on Monday. 
Many of the infections have been tourists who travelled across multiple regions, complicating and prolonging contact-tracing efforts.
While the caseload remains miniscule compared with clusters outside China, and the rise in local infections in some regions have started to slow or even stopped in recent days, China is sparing no effort in minimising transmission risks, even at the cost of disrupting businesses and local economies.
As China steps up vaccinations for children and rolls out booster shots, the impact from the current outbreak on economic growth in the fourth quarter will be smaller than in the third, said Nie Wen, a Shanghai-based economist at Hwabao Trust.
Gross domestic product in July-September grew at the slowest in a year, partly due to an outbreak over summer that affected over 40 cities including Nanjing and Yangzhou in Jiangsu province, which bore the brunt of the infections.
China's three biggest airlines on Friday posted deeper losses for July-September due to a domestic travel slump.
TOURISM HIT
Last month, the national tourism authority announced the suspension of travel agencies from organising inter-province trips that involve provincial regions with areas deemed to be at higher risk of the virus, and halted dedicated train services linking tourist attractions.
Many cities with local infections, including the capital Beijing, have halted some indoor leisure venues such as internet cafes, chess and card parlours, as well as cinemas, while a number of marathon races, concerts and theatrical performances have been delayed or cancelled. 
Cultural and leisure businesses in some cities that have not detected local cases for a few months are also affected. 
In northern Heilongjiang province, where the daily tally of new local infections topped Chinese regions since Oct. 29, Jiamusi city and Mudanjiang city on Oct. 30 announced temporary closure of various indoor entertainment venues.
Yichun, also in Heilongjiang, said tourists arriving from outside for leisure would be barred from entering tourist sites until Nov. 6. The three cities have reported no infections so far from the current outbreak. 

In southern Dongguan city, also infection-free for now, an international exhibition centre suspended the hosting of various events. 
Shares of China's consumption- and tourism-related companies were down in early trade on Monday. The consumer staples sub-index slipped 1.5%, while the tourism sub-index retreated by more than 4%.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea and the United States kicked off joint aerial drills on Monday, a military official in Seoul said, amid tensions over North Korea's recent missile tests and calls for a restart of denuclearisation talks. 
The exercises, previously called Vigilant Ace, once mobilised tens of thousands of troops and hundreds of cutting-edge fighter jets, bombers and other warplanes. 
But the programme has been scaled back since 2017 to facilitate talks aimed at ending Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programmes in return for U.S. sanctions relief. 
The allies began the drills, which will last five days, without announcing or naming them. Yonhap said that some 100 aircraft were dispatched from each side, including South Korea's F-15Ks and KF-16s and U.S. F-16s, but that no equipment or soldiers from the U.S. mainland would join the exercises. 
A South Korean air force spokesman declined to confirm the report. 
The drills came after North Korea fired a submarine launched ballistic missile, the latest in its recent series of weapons tests. 
The reclusive country sees exercises in the South as a rehearsal for war, and severed inter-Korean hotlines when the allies held regular summer training in August, accusing Seoul of ""perfidious behaviour"".

The U.S. envoy for North Korea, Sung Kim, slammed the test as ""concerning and counterproductive"" during his visit to Seoul last week and urged Pyongyang to accept offers to talks.
The North has so far rebuffed U.S. overtures, accusing Washington and Seoul of applying ""double standards"" by criticising its weapons programmes while talking diplomacy and stoking tension with their own military activities.

""Continued fighting prolongs the dire humanitarian crisis in northern Ethiopia. All parties must stop military operations and begin ceasefire negotiations without preconditions,"" he said. 
The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) said on Sunday its fighters were in control of Kombolcha and its airport. 
The capture of Kombolcha would be a strategic gain for the fighters against Ethiopia's military and their allies, who are trying to dislodge the Tigrayans from the Amhara region.
The large town on a major highway approximately 380 km (235 miles)from the capital of Addis Ababa and is the furthest south in Amhara that the TPLF has reached since pushing into the region in July. 
A day earlier, it said it had also seized Dessie in Ethiopia's Amhara region where tens of thousands of ethnic Amharas have sought refuge from an escalation in fighting. The government denied this.

War broke out nearly a year ago between federal troops and the TPLF, which dominated Ethiopian politics for nearly 30 years before Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was appointed in 2018. 
The conflict has killed thousands of civilians and forced more than two million people to flee their homes.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's ruling LDP defied expectations and held its strong majority in Sunday's parliamentary election, solidifying his position in a fractious party and allowing him to ramp up stimulus.
Kishida's conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) emerged with fewer seats in the powerful lower house than it won in the last election in 2017. But the LDP maintained its single-party majority in a big victory for Kishida, who took power only a month ago.
The result was at odds with expectations and initial exit polls that suggested the LDP, hurt by perceptions it mishandled the coronavirus pandemic, would need to rely on its junior coalition party for a majority. 
Kishida, a soft-spoken former banker who has struggled to shake off an image that he lacks charisma, is also likely to be emboldened by the win https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/tightrope-election-may-spell-uncertain-future-japans-new-prime-minister-2021-10-28. 
Kishida, who called the election soon after taking the top post, has hewed to traditional policies of the party's right wing, pushing to increase military https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/with-an-eye-china-japans-ruling-party-makes-unprecedented-defence-spending-2021-10-13 spending, but has also promised to address wealth inequality, touting a ""new capitalism"" that has stoked concern among investors. 
In the end, the LDP claimed 261 seats against the 276 it held before the election - an absolute stable majority that will give it control of parliamentary committees and ease passage of legislation, including key budget proposals. 
Kishida's publicly stated goal had been for the coalition to keep a majority, at least 233 seats https://www.reuters.com/article/japan-election/factbox-key-numbers-to-watch-in-japan-lower-house-election-idUSL4N2RI1CL, of the 465 in the lower house - although that was widely seen as a lowball target, given the junior coalition partner Komeito had 29 seats before the election. Together the LDP and Komeito secured 293 seats.
""The overall trend is in favour of stability. The LDP cleared the hurdles it absolutely had to,"" said Tobias Harris, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress.
""We'll see a lot of stimulus,"" he said.
Japanese stocks cheered the victory, with the Nikkei up 2.38% soon after trade began. 
A poorer showing would have heightened expectations that Kishida could follow predecessor Yoshihide Suga in becoming another short-term premier.
The party did take some notable hits, including the loss by its secretary general, Akira Amari, in his single-seat district, and a former economy minister and the leader of one the party's factions, Nobuteru Ishihara, who lost to an opposition candidate in a western Tokyo district. 
EXTRA BUDGET TARGETED
Kishida said the administration would attempt to compile an extra budget this year, in what would be a tight schedule.
""I hope to pass through parliament an extra budget this year,"" he told reporters.
This would involve funding steps to support people hit by the pandemic such as those who lost jobs and students struggling to pay tuitions.
A big winner was the conservative Osaka-based Japan Innovation Party, projected to more than treble its seats and surpass Komeito as the third force in the lower house, after the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan.
The emergence of the Osaka party as a national force may complicate Kishida's pledge to roll back neoliberal economic policies.
The Innovation Party is ""really sweeping the Osaka region. They've emerged as an important conservative bloc,"" said Yoichiro Sato, a professor of international relations at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University. ""They are going to block Kishida's new capitalism idea of narrowing the rich-poor income gap.""
The usually splintered opposition was united, with only one party - including the widely shunned Japanese Communist Party - facing off against the coalition in most districts.
Some voters - including Yoshihiko Suzuki, who voted for the main opposition candidate in his district and the Communists in proportional representation - hoped the poll might teach the LDP a lesson.

Suzuki, 68 and retired, said the LDP's years in power made it complacent and arrogant, underscored by a series of money and cronyism scandals. 
""I hope this election comes as a wakeup call for them,"" he said. ""If it does, the LDP will become a better party, considering the number of talented lawmakers they've got.""

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's security detail allegedly used violence against Brazilian reporters covering his trip to Rome for the Group of 20 major economies meeting, local media reported on Sunday.
The alleged attacks against Brazilian reporters, who Bolsonaro has long accused of treating him unfairly and publishing fake news, capped a grim weekend for the far-right president. Videos from G20 events showed him as an isolated figure, who was not part of the photo taken at the Trevi fountain with world leaders. Out on the streets of Rome, he was loudly criticized for his handling of the country's brutal pandemic, with critics calling him ""genocidal.""
More than 600,000 people have died from COVID-19 in Brazil, the second highest tally in the world after the United States. Bolsonaro has questioned the severity of the virus, shunned lockdowns, sowed vaccine doubts and pushed unproven cures. A Senate panel has recommended he be indicted for nine crimes related to his handling of the pandemic, including crimes against humanity. 
Newspaper O Globo reported that broadcast journalist Leonardo Monteiro of TV Globo was punched in the stomach and pushed by Bolsonaro's security after asking the president why he didn't attend any G20 events on Sunday. A video taken by UOL journalist Jamil Chade shows chaotic scenes with security staff jostling the press and Bolsonaro supporters chanting abuse at reporters. 
It was not clear if the security officers were Brazilian or Italian. O Globo reported that Italians had been given the job of providing security to Bolsonaro. 
The president's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the attacks or why he was missing from the leaders' photo. The G20 press team also did not immediately respond to requests. 
""Globo vehemently condemns the aggression against its correspondent Leonardo Monteiro and other colleagues in Rome and demands a complete assessment of responsibilities,"" TV Globo said in a statement.
Videos from the G20 events show Bolsonaro looking isolated.
The former army captain has seen his international support diminish since former U.S. President Donald Trump lost his re-election bid, while Bolsonaro's skepticism toward COVID-19, vaccines and environmental concerns has won him few friends on the global stage. 

In one video taken by Jamil Chade, Bolsonaro is seen striking up a conversation with Italian waiters as global leaders chat among themselves in the other part of the room.
""This video of Bolsonaro walking around alone in the G20 conference hall, while other world leaders are chatting, is painful to watch, but it adequately reflects the collapse of Brazil's standing in the world,"" Oliver Stuenkel, an international relations professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a Brazilian university, tweeted.

ROME (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden told Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan his request for F-16 fighter jets had to go through a process in the United States, while Erdogan said his counterpart was ""positive"" toward the jet sale.
Ties between Ankara and Washington have been strained over a host of issues in recent years, from policy differences in Syria to Turkey's purchase of Russian S-400 missile systems, human rights and legal matters. The United States has also sanctioned Turkey over the S-400s.
Days after the allies narrowly averted a diplomatic crisis over jailed philanthropist Osman Kavala, Biden and Erdogan met on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Rome. Biden also raised the issue of human rights, a U.S. senior administration official told reporters.
""President Biden reaffirmed our defense partnership and Turkey's importance as a NATO Ally, but noted U.S. concerns over Turkey's possession of the Russian S-400 missile system,"" the White House said in a statement after the meeting. 
The Turkish presidency said the two leaders had agreed to form a joint mechanism to strengthen ties, while a senior Turkish official said the talks were held in ""a very positive atmosphere"".
Speaking to reporters in Rome, Erdogan said he reiterated to Biden Turkey's opposition to U.S. support for the Syrian Kurdish YPG - a U.S. ally in the fight against Islamic State in northeast Syria but deemed a terrorist group by Ankara.
""Undoubtedly, I conveyed to him (Biden) our sadness with the support these terrorist organisations in Syria... are receiving from the United States,"" Erdogan said. ""I also told him these issues were steps that could damage our solidarity.""
Ankara had previously ordered more than 100 F-35 jets, but Washington removed Turkey from the programme after it bought the S-400s. Turkey has called the move unjust and demanded reimbursement for its $1.4 billion payment.
Erdogan has said that payment should be used to finance some of Turkey's request to buy 40 F-16s and nearly 80 modernisation kits, but Washington has said it had made no financing offers to Ankara.
Erdogan said he asked Biden for support in getting U.S. lawmakers to back the sale.

""While I saw Mr Biden's positive approach on this matter, another aspect of the issue is the House of Representatives and Senate,"" he said.
On Saturday, a different U.S. administration official said that Biden would warn Erdogan against ""precipitous"" actions and that crises should be avoided after the Turkish leader last week threatened to expel 10 foreign envoys, including the U.S. envoy, for seeking Kavala's release. Erdogan withdrew his threat on Monday.

(Reuters) - Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) on Sunday said it is investigating an incident in which a pilot allegedly said ""Let's Go Brandon"" - a phrase meant to insult U.S. President Joe Biden - over the intercom during a flight. 
In a statement posted to the company's official Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account, Southwest said it is ""conducting an internal investigation"" into the event, and ""will address the situation directly with any employee involved."" 
The incident, initially reported by the Associated Press, took place Friday on a Southwest flight from Houston to Albuquerque. The pilot allegedly said ""Let's Go Brandon"" during his remarks to passengers, drawing audible gasps, the AP reported.
The phrase has become an anti-Biden meme in the wake of a NASCAR race earlier this month, won by NASCAR driver Brandon Brown. As Brown was interviewed on camera after the race, the largely conservative crowd chanted ""F--k Joe Biden!"" The interviewer mistook the chant for ""Let's Go Brandon,"" and the phrase has been a euphemism ever since. 
""Southwest does not condone employees sharing their personal political opinions while on the job,"" the company said in Sunday's statement, adding that the pilot's views should not be interpreted as representative of the company's. 

Some Republican congressmen have unapologetically embraced the phrase as a rallying cry. U.S. Senator Ted Cruz tweeted a photo of himself at baseball's World Series, posing with a fan holding a ""Let's Go Brandon"" sign. U.S. Representative Jeff Duncan from South Carolina wore a facemask sporting the phrase at the U.S. Capitol.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) -A U.N. official discussed mediation options and possible ""way forward"" for Sudan with its ousted prime minister on Sunday, a day after hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets to demand an end to military rule.
The outpouring of dissent posed the biggest challenge to General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan since he toppled Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok's cabinet last Monday and arrested key politicians. The streets were largely calm on Sunday.
Late on Sunday, judicial sources confirmed the release of Ibrahim Ghandour, head of the disbanded former ruling party, and other former Islamist officials.
""I will continue these efforts with other Sudanese stakeholders,"" Volker Perthes, the U.N. Special Representative for Sudan, said in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post.
Perthes said Hamdok was ""at his residence where he remains well but under house arrest"".
Mediation efforts by the international community and within Sudan had been announced before Saturday's protests, with no outcome reported.
The main compromise under discussion, say politicians who have presented it, is a proposal for Hamdok to be given full executive powers and appoint a cabinet of technocrats. 
The proposal, which the sources say has been presented to all sides, would do away with the 14-member power-sharing Sovereign Council in favour of a three-person honorary council.
Political parties, rebel groups, and the military, partners in the pre-coup government, would be represented in parliament, and the military would continue to lead a Security and Defense Council, they said.
Hamdok has demanded the release of detainees and a return to the pre-coup power-sharing arrangement before negotiating further, sources close to him said last week. 
The coup took place 2-1/2 years after a popular uprising ousted the authoritarian Omar al-Bashir, who had ruled Sudan, Africa's third largest country, for three decades.
The Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors said three protesters were shot dead by security forces in Khartoum's twin city of Omdurman on Saturday. Sudanese police denied shooting protesters during the demonstrations, saying on state TV that one policeman sustained a gunshot wound.
With Saturday's deaths, at least 15 protesters have been killed in clashes with security forces this week, a health ministry official said. Some 245 people were injured on Saturday, the official said.
Life returned to a near standstill in the capital Khartoum on Sunday. Residents said strikes and security measures were causing paralysis. 
Banks and most markets were closed, with only a few small stores and stalls open.
""You can't do anything - everything is shut down. We need to work every day to make money,"" said a fruit and vegetable seller in the city centre.
People were unable to cross into Khartoum from Omdurman and the capital's other twin city, Khartoum North, because security forces had closed the Nile river bridges.
Unions of doctors, bankers, teachers and other groups have been on strike since last week and have said they will continue until demands are met, while resistance committees have barricaded neighbourhoods and created schedules of protests and civil disobedience.
Demands range from a handover of power to civilians in full to criminal charges against coup leaders.
The Sudanese Lawyers Union condemned the arrests of activists and political leaders. The union ""warns that the Sudanese people are in front of an oppressive military movement paving the way for dark totalitarianism"". 
Lawyers told Reuters they have petitioned to get access to detained officials and politicians.
Judiciary sources confirmed the release of Bashir's former foreign minister Ghandour, as well as former security officials Mohamed Hamed Tabidi and Alshazali Almadih.

All three men had been detained under orders of a taskforce aiming to dismantle and prevent the return of the Bashir government, which the military has been critical of.
Other Bashir allies, former health minister Mamoun Humeida and businessman Abdalbasit Hamza, have also been released recently, judiciary sources said.

GLASGOW ( Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Foundation) - With the UK hosts warning that ""lights are flashing red on the climate change dashboard"", the COP26 U.N. climate summit kicked off on Sunday in Glasgow, marked by pointed warnings of growing threats as emissions-cutting pledges still fail to add up.
""I do not underestimate the challenge"" of reaching an effective deal to adequately slash emissions, Alok Sharma, Britain's COP26 president, told delegates at the talks' opening.
But, he added, ""I believe that we can resolve the outstanding issues.""
Heavy rain poured down in Glasgow on the first day of COP26, and a fallen tree blocked train lines from London, forcing some red-faced delegates into last-minute flights or rental cars.
Others struggled to master the phone apps governing a daily coronavirus testing regime for attendees, some of whom showed up to the venue of one of the first major international gatherings since the start of the pandemic with negative tests in hand.
""This is not a normal COP,"" Sharma admitted.
But the biggest hurdle facing COP26 may be the outcome of the G20 meeting of major economies in Rome this weekend, where leaders backed a 1.5-degree Celsius limit on global temperature rise but offered few new concrete commitments to achieve it.
As world leaders arrive at the talks in Glasgow on Monday, more ambitious emissions-cutting pledges will be crucial for the COP26 hosts to meet their overarching goal to ""keep 1.5 alive"".
""If the G20 was a dress rehearsal for COP26, then world leaders fluffed their lines,"" Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said in a statement, describing the G20 outcome as ""weak"".
Alden Meyer, a senior associate at climate think-tank E3G, noted that ""much hard work – especially on issues of climate finance – remains ahead, if COP26 is to reach agreement"" on keeping the 1.5C goal in sight.
'OUT OF EXCUSES'
At the Glasgow conference's opening session, U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa admitted that the task of swiftly shifting the world's economy onto a greener trajectory, to avoid increasingly deadly climate impacts, was enormously difficult.
""The transition we need is beyond the scope, scale and speed of anything humanity has accomplished in the past. It is a daunting task. But humanity is a species defined by its ingenuity,"" she said.
She encouraged negotiators to ""keep the big picture in mind"" as they haggled over details on things like finance and carbon markets, reminding them to think of ""what we are trying to achieve together... and the trust invested in you by billions"".
Abdulla Shahid, president of the U.N. General Assembly, urged negotiators to ""be honest with each other and with the rest of the world"" about past failures to act fast enough on climate threats and to ""choose the hard but necessary actions"".
""We have run out of excuses. It is time to do the right thing,"" said Shahid, also foreign minister of the Maldives, a nation of low-lying Indian Ocean islands.
As the talks got underway, the World Meteorological Organization said that the last seven years had been the hottest on record and sea level rise reached a new high in 2021.
In a report released on Sunday, it called the changes ""uncharted territory, with far-reaching repercussions for current and future generations"".
Mayor Frank Cownie of the U.S. city of Des Moines said changes were not just being seen in the poorer countries considered most vulnerable to climate change threats.
His Midwestern city, in the U.S. state of Iowa, has seen much more extreme weather in recent years, including 10 inches (250 mm) of rain falling in just three hours and hurricane-like 130 mph winds.
""This is a global catastrophe that we all need to jump on, (with) all hands on deck,"" said Cownie, president of ICLEI, an association of sustainable local governments. ""We have to prepare for the worst. That’s sort of the new normal.""
CITIES SET THE PACE
But cities and other local governments are often leading the way on low-carbon changes, and offer examples national governments can scale up, Ryuzo Sugimoto of Japan's Ministry of Environment, told a press conference with city officials.
He noted that 160 local government bodies in Japan, governing 17 million people, had made carbon-neutral commitments before Japan's national government followed suit last year.
Now, with the need to speed up large-scale emissions cuts by 2030 - on the way to net-zero by 2050 - the world requires a ""decarbonisation domino effect"", with local governments often good testing grounds for what is possible, Sugimoto said.
Susan Aitken, the leader of Glasgow's city council, said such changes also had to happen in a fair way, focused on ""taking our citizens with us"".
The decline of Glasgow's industrial might, starting 30 or 40 years ago, left the city with enduring mental and physical scars, she said, including a legacy of unemployment.

Now a rapid switch to a greener economy, based on clean power, needs to be far more just and inclusive, as governments invest ""unprecedented sums"" to tackle climate change, she said.
""Climate justice and social justice are indivisible,"" she added.

Most of the leaders taking part in the photo opportunity on the sidelines of a summit of the Group of 20 world's largest economies just tossed the coin over their right shoulder.
Prime Minister Mario Draghi, who lives in Rome, stayed motionless, while U.S. President Joe Biden skipped the event.

The Trevi Fountain, completed in 1762, covers the entire facade of Palazzo Poli in central Rome with its statues of Tritons guiding the shell chariot of the god Oceanus illustrating the theme of the taming of the waters.
The fountain is where the late director Federico Fellini set one of the most famous scenes in cinema in ""La Dolce Vita"", with Anita Ekberg wading into the fountain after midnight and beckoning Marcello Mastroianni to join her.
In the song ""Three Coins in the Fountain"", crooner Frank Sinatra sang of ""each one seeking happiness"" and asks ""which one will the fountain bless?"".

Coins worth about one million euro ($1.16 million) are thrown into the basin by tourists each year. All the money goes to a charity that helps the city's needy.

ROME (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi locked horns over Taiwan on the sidelines of a Group of 20 summit on Sunday, trading warnings against moves that could further escalate tensions across the Taiwan Strait.
In an hour-long meeting in Rome, Blinken made ""crystal clear"" that Washington opposes any unilateral changes by Beijing to the status quo around Taiwan, a senior State Department official said.
A recent increase in Chinese military exercises in Taiwan's air defence identification zone, including what Taipei said were eight such flights on Sunday, is part of what it views as stepped-up military harassment by Beijing. 
The United States wants to manage the intense competition between the world's two largest economies responsibly, the State Department official said, adding that both sides acknowledged that open lines of communication are paramount.
Wang expressed China's ""solemn concern over various issues on which the U.S. side has damaged China's legitimate rights and interests, and asked the U.S. side to change its course and promote China-U.S. relations back to the track of healthy development"", China's foreign ministry said in a statement.
Wang said it was misleading of the United States to blame China for a change in the status quo on Taiwan, saying it is U.S. “connivance” and “support” for pro-independence forces in Taiwan that are at fault, China's statement said.
China claims the island as part of its own territory and views any foreign intervention over Taiwan as interference in its domestic affairs.
Blinken's meeting with Wang was their first in person since a fiery exchange in Alaska in March.
Sunday's meeting in Rome was ""exceptionally candid"" but productive, and will help lay the groundwork for a virtual summit between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping later this year, the U.S. official said. 
NO CHANGE IN POLICY
While the United States, like most countries, has no formal relations with Taiwan, Washington is the island's most important international supporter and main arms supplier, and is required by law to provide it with the means to defend itself.
Washington has long followed a policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" on whether it would intervene militarily to protect Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack, though Biden said last week that it would come to Taiwan's defence if necessary.
Blinken made clear that Washington had not changed its ""one China"" policy regarding Taiwan, the official said, and Blinken said there was ""no change in our policy"" when pressed on CNN on Biden's comment.
“We’ve had a long-standing commitment,” he said, under the Taiwan Relations Act that Biden supported when he was a senator “to make sure that Taiwan has the means to defend itself. And we stand by that. The president does sit by that strongly"".
“We want to make sure that no one takes any unilateral action that would disrupt the status quo with regard to Taiwan. That hasn’t changed,” Blinken said.

Wang told Blinken that Taiwan is the most sensitive issue between China and the United States. “We require the United States to pursue a real one China policy, not a fake one China policy,” Wang was quoted by the ministry as saying.
Blinken and Wang did not discuss a recent Chinese hypersonic weapons test that military experts say appears to show Beijing's pursuit of an Earth-orbiting system designed to evade American missile defences, the State Department official said.

826,"<span>Oct 31, 2021 10:05AM ET</span>",,,,,,"TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan's air force scrambled on Sunday to warn off eight Chinese aircraft including fighter jets that entered its air defence zone, its defence ministry said, at a time of heightened tensions across the sensitive Taiwan Strait.
Taiwan has complained for a year or more of repeated missions by China's air force near the self-ruled island, often in the southwestern part of its air defence zone near the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands.
The Chinese aircraft included six J-16 fighters, one anti-submarine aircraft and one surveillance aircraft, the defence ministry said in a statement late on Sunday. 
Taiwan, which China claims as its own and has not ruled out taking by force, says Chinese military activities near the island jeopardize regional stability and repeatedly vows to defend its freedom and democracy. 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told his Chinese counterpart on Sunday that the United States opposed actions https://www.reuters.com/world/blinken-warns-china-against-unilateral-action-regarding-taiwan-2021-10-31 by China that have increased tensions across the Taiwan Strait, a senior State Department official said.
The official said that during an hour-long meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of a Group of 20 summit in Rome, Blinken made ""crystal clear"" that Washington opposes any unilateral changes by Beijing to the status quo there.
Wang told Blinken that tensions over Taiwan were caused by U.S. support for pro-independence forces on the island, China's foreign ministry said in a statement.
A recent increase in Chinese military exercises in Taiwan's air defence identification zone is part of what Taipei views as stepped-up military harassment by Beijing. 
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen says the island is an independent country and has made modernizing the armed forces, which is well-armed but dwarfed by China's, a top priority.
Earlier this month, Taiwan reported 148 Chinese air force planes in the southern and southwestern theatre of the zone over a four-day period, marking a dramatic escalation of tension between Taipei and Beijing.
Chinese aircraft have not been flying in Taiwan's air space, but rather its air defence identification zone or ADIZ, a broader area Taiwan monitors and patrols that acts to give it more time to respond to any threats.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's foreign minister said on Sunday that if the United States was serious about rejoining Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, President Joe Biden could just issue an ""executive order"", the state-owned Iran newspaper reported. 
The accord, under which Iran curtailed nuclear work seen as a risk of developing nuclear weapons in exchange for a lifting of global sanctions, unravelled in 2018 after then-President Donald Trump withdrew the United States, prompting Tehran to breach limits on uranium enrichment set by the pact.
At the G20 summit in Rome on Saturday, leaders of the United States, Germany, France and Britain urged Iran to resume compliance with the deal in order to ""avoid a dangerous escalation https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-g20-summit-iran/western-leaders-urge-iran-to-act-in-good-faith-on-nuclear-deal-idUKKBN2HK0B6?edition-redirect=uk"", saying they wanted a negotiated solution.
""It is enough for Biden to issue an executive order tomorrow and they (U.S.) announce they are rejoining the pact from the point where his predecessor left the deal,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian told the Iran daily.
""If there is a serious will in Washington to return to the deal, there is no need for all these negotiations at all.""
Tehran has said its nuclear steps since Trump abandoned the accord, saying it was flawed to Iran's advantage, are reversible ""if Washington lifts sanctions in a verifiable process"".
Talks between Iran and world powers meant to salvage the deal, which started in April, are slated to resume at the end of November, the Islamic Republic's top nuclear negotiator said on Wednesday. The talks have been on hold since the election of hardline cleric Ebrahim Raisi as Iran's president in June.
Concerned about Iran now enriching uranium close to bomb-grade level of fissile purity, Western powers have repeatedly urged Tehran to resume talks, saying the diplomatic window would not stay open forever. 
""Washington wants to continue a large part of the sanctions imposed by Trump on Iran. This is unacceptable for Iran,"" Amirabdollahian said. 
Iran denies any intention to develop nuclear bombs.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday Washington was ""absolutely in lockstep"" with Britain, Germany and France on getting Iran back into the deal, but it not clear if Tehran was willing to rejoin the talks in a ""meaningful way"".

Holding up progress towards restoring the deal are sharp U.S.-Iranian disagreements over which steps need to be taken and when. Key issues include what nuclear limits Tehran will accept and what sanctions Washington will remove.
In addition to seeking the lifting of Trump-era sanctions, including those related to Iran's record on human rights and alleged support for terrorism, Tehran has other demands such as assurances that Washington will not renege on the deal again.

TOKYO (Reuters) -An unprecedented election pledge by Japan's ruling party to double defence spending underscores the nation's haste to acquire missiles, stealth fighters, drones and other weapons to deter China's military in the disputed East China Sea.
The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) included a goal of spending 2% of GDP - about $100 billion - or more on the military for the first time in its policy platform ahead of a national election this month.
Experts don't expect new Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to double spending anytime soon, given Japan's debt-saddled public finances and a pandemic-stricken economy. But it is a sign that the pacifist nation could over time abandon a commitment to keep military budgets within 1% of GDP - a number that for decades has eased concern at home and abroad about any revival of the militarism that led Japan into World War Two.
""LDP conservative leaders want the party to give it up,"" said Yoichiro Sato, an international relations professor at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University, referring to the de facto spending cap, which he called ""sacrosanct for Japanese liberals.""
""They are setting the direction, that is what conservatives want to do,"" he added.
The United States has been pushing key allies to spend more on defence; an increase to 2% of GDP would put Japan in line with pledges by North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members.
The hawkish notes from the LDP come as Japanese public sentiment shifts away from concerns about rearming to growing alarm over China's military assertiveness in Asia, particularly toward Taiwan.
In a survey of 1,696 people conducted by the Nikkei business daily at the end of last year, 86% of respondents said China posed a threat to Japan, more than the 82% who expressed concern about nuclear-armed North Korea.
""Putting this in the manifesto is a recognition of the need to garner public support for required defence policy changes,"" said Robert Ward, a London-based researcher at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. ""The direction of travel is now set.""
SOUTHWEST THEATRE
Japan's military strategy is focused on defending territory along the edge of the East China Sea, where Tokyo is locked in a dispute with Beijing over a group of uninhabited islands.
The Okinawan chain, Taiwan, and islands stretching down through the Philippines form what military planners dub the First Island Chain, a natural barrier to Chinese operations in the Western Pacific.
With an additional $50 billion a year, Japan could buy more American equipment, including F-35 stealth fighters, Osprey tilt-rotor utility aircraft and surveillance drones, as well as domestically made equipment such as amphibious landing craft, compact warships, aircraft carriers, submarines, satellites and communications gear to fight a protracted war.
""The Self Defence Force is well trained and well equipped, but its sustainability and resilience is one of the most serious problems,"" former Maritime Self Defense Force admiral and fleet commander Yoji Koda told Reuters.
Japan's defence ministry also wants money for an indigenous stealth fighter, and missiles that can strike enemy ships and land bases more than 1,000 kilometres (621 miles) away. The country is also building up cyber, space and electromagnetic warfare capabilities.
""Japan wants to acquire very sophisticated capabilities in a variety of areas,"" Thomas Reich, the country manager for BAE Systems (OTC:BAESF) PLC, said during a briefing on Tuesday. ""What's in the budget and where it's going are the things that really attract us.""
Britain's biggest defence company is part of the consortium led by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) that builds the F-35 fighter.
CARRYING ABE'S TORCH
The speed at which once-dovish Kishida has fallen in line with the national security agenda of conservatives has surprised some observers. But he is carrying on policies pursued by former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and supported by conservative lawmakers who helped him https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-shadow-shogun-abe-assured-clout-over-next-pm-kishida-2021-09-30 win the party leadership election last month.
By pursuing a policy of similar small steps, Abe enacted security laws to allow Japanese troops to fight on foreign soil, ended a ban on military exports and reinterpreted the country's war-renouncing constitution to allow missile strikes on enemy territory.
For now, however, the LDP defence spending pledge does not say how any extra money would be spent or indicate when the 2% goal would be reached.
""The real question is whether Japan can absorb another $50 billion in a way that measurably improves Japan's defence,"" said Chuck Jones, a former defence industry executive familiar with Japan's military policy. ""The concern is that large sums will be wasted on programs and projects doomed to failure or irrelevance.""

The lack of detail gives the ruling group room to alter course, analysts say.
""There is opposition even inside the LDP,"" said Tetsuo Kotani, a senior research fellow at the Japan Institute of International Affairs. ""We are going to have an election and we will see if the general public supports the LDP's proposal.""

MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - Angela Harrelson points toward a blue angel painted on the pavement, marking the spot where a Minneapolis police officer murdered her nephew George Floyd and ignited a national police reform movement. 
""If a mental health worker or a social worker had been with the police the day my nephew died right here, he might very well still be alive today,"" Harrelson said. ""I don't want to abolish the police, but we need to do something different.""
On Tuesday, Minneapolis voters get to decide just how different their city's approach to policing should be. A ballot question asks residents whether they want to replace the police department with a new department of public safety, in the first big electoral test of reform efforts sparked by Floyd's May 2020 killing.
But even after the outrage over his death and the tense protests that followed, the progressive city is deeply divided over the future of its law enforcement. The split illustrates the tricky calculus around overhauling policing in major U.S. cities, as residents fear for their safety amid crime spikes and Democratic politicians worry https://www.reuters.com/world/us/democratic-cries-defund-police-fade-us-mayoral-races-crime-surges-2021-10-29 about Republicans weaponizing the issue in next year's congressional elections.
Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo opposes the measure. Mayor Jacob Frey, who is seeking reelection on Tuesday, is also against it. Neither responded to requests for comment from Reuters. 
Conversations with dozens of voters cutting across racial and socio-economic lines in Minneapolis in recent days revealed a range of views. Nearly all expressed confusion over what exactly would happen if the proposal is approved.
That is in large part because the particulars of the new public safety department would only be hashed out by the mayor and city council in the months after the vote.
Opponents say the measure would make good on the city council's threat in the days after Floyd's death to ""defund the police."" They say Minneapolis, with a population of about 430,000 people, needs more officers, not fewer, as it grapples with a crime wave.
Supporters insist police would remain on their jobs, though perhaps in smaller numbers. They say the change would mean approaching safety in a holistic manner, including addressing the root causes of crime before it takes place. 
If approved, the department of public safety would create a larger agency that would include police officers as well as mental health professionals, housing and addiction experts, and people trained in de-escalating conflict to respond to 911 calls where an armed officer may not always be needed.
The new department would answer not just to the mayor but also the city's 13 council members, which supporters say would give residents more influence in how policing is carried out.
""What police have been doing for decades does not work,"" said the Reverend JaNaé Bates, with the Yes4Minneapolis campaign that supports creating the new safety department. ""We want the city to have the nimbleness to match its safety needs with the resources available."" 
'BIG EXPERIMENT'
Homicides in Minneapolis were up more than 17% through the end of September, compared to the same period in 2020. Robberies and aggravated assaults also have increased.
More than 200 police officers have left the force since Floyd's murder. Police who remain have in many ways stopped engaging with the community, for fear of being involved in another flashpoint case, a recent Reuters investigation found https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-policing-minneapolis.
North Minneapolis, a poorer area where more Black residents live, has seen the brunt of the violence. Nearly half of all murders in the city have taken place in Precinct 4, where residents complain of nights filled with shootings, carjackings and out-of-control petty crime.
""This entire thing is a white, progressive movement, man,"" said Teto Wilson, a Black barber shop owner in north Minneapolis, referring to efforts to replace the police department. ""They're trying to turn us into some damn big experiment.""
Like other residents on the north side who spoke with Reuters, Wilson said police reform is needed desperately - but within the current structure. He said those living with daily violence don't have the luxury to try drastic new approaches. 
In the Folwell neighborhood north of Wilson's barber shop, Anna Gerdeen, who is white and described herself as a progressive director of a community not-for-profit, said she might normally support more radical policing reforms. But not now, while she and her 11-year-old son feel under siege inside their own home. She will vote against the creation of a new department.
""My neighbor's house got hit with bullets a couple months ago. I can't let my son play outside in the yard anymore,"" Gerdeen said. ""As a mother, I just can't risk any more chaos."" 
'LIVING HELL'
Supporters of creating a new public safety department say such violence makes clear the need for a new strategy. They say advocates have tried for decades to get reforms passed to make policing more equitable and to bring more safety to poorer neighborhoods but have repeatedly failed.
Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a progressive Democrat, oversaw the prosecution of former police officer Derek Chauvin, who pinned Floyd's neck to the ground for more than nine minutes with his knee. Ellison said now is the time for true change.
""If we're saying that George Floyd could be murdered on the streets of this town ... and we're not willing to take any institutional change to address that, to me that's sad, and it's a little scary,"" said Ellison, who lives in Minneapolis. ""My hope is that we actually respond to what's happening here, in a way designed to prevent it from happening again.""
Back on the street where Floyd was killed in south Minneapolis, Bridgette Stewart and other members of a community watch group had just returned from the scene of a drive-by shooting where three people were injured last Tuesday. The group, Agape Movement, was there to act as a bridge between family of the victims, community members and law enforcement, to ensure nothing escalated into more violence. 

That is the type of work Stewart said needs to happen on a citywide scale, and that she said could only happen if the new public safety department is approved.
""This is our vision, that we can all work together for public safety,"" she said. ""Because if we all can't get along and get this work done, we're going to be stuck right where we're at - in a living hell.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former President Donald Trump is seeking to block Jan. 6 investigators from seeing hundreds of pages of White House documents that include his handwritten notes as well as phone call logs, the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration told a court late on Friday.
A congressional panel has asked the National Archives - the U.S. government's official body for preserving government records and making them publicly available - to release nearly 1,600 pages of documents as part of their investigation into the deadly Jan. 6 assault by Trump supporters on the U.S. Capitol. 
Trump, however, has demanded that about 760 pages be withheld, the National Archives said in a filing with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
The former president is arguing that normal rules for the secrecy of White House documents should apply and that the congressional panel, which includes Trump critics from the Democratic and Republican parties, is a ""witch hunt."" 
But President Joe Biden has waived the secrecy rules, arguing it is in the nation's interest to understand Trump's role in the attempt by his supporters to overturn Biden's victory over Trump in the November 2020 presidential election. 
Trump urged supporters to attend a Jan. 6 rally, telling them it ""will be wild."" Then at the rally he urged them to march on the Capitol and ""show strength,"" making false claims that he lost the election because of fraud. Shortly afterward, supporters violently broke into the U.S. Capitol and tried to stop lawmakers from certifying Biden's victory. Four people died on the day of the violence, one shot dead by police and the other three of natural causes.
The Democrat-controlled House impeached Trump for inciting insurrection. He was later acquitted in the U.S. Senate.
The records Trump wants kept from investigators include ""daily presidential diaries, schedules, appointments showing White House visitors, activity logs (and) call logs,"" according to the court filing by the National Archives.
The records could shed light on ""what was occurring at the White House immediately before, during and after the January 6 attack,"" according to the filing.

Trump is also seeking to block access to documents from binders kept by former Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany.
A Nov. 4 hearing has been scheduled to consider Trump's claim of executive privilege.

Akhundzada https://www.reuters.com/world/haibatullah-akhundzada-shadowy-taliban-supreme-leader-whose-son-was-suicide-2021-09-07, known as the leader of the faithful or Amir ul Momineen, had not been seen in public even after the Taliban's August takeover of the country, giving rise to the speculation.
A senior Taliban leader who was present with Akhundzada during the appearance told Reuters the supreme leader had visited Jamia Darul Aloom Hakimia, a religious school in Kandahar on Saturday.
As the Islamist movement unveiled its interim government in September after U.S.-led forces withdrew, the mysterious Akhundzada retained the role he has held since 2016 of supreme leader, the ultimate authority over the group's political, religious and military affairs.
Though some officials say that Akhundzada has made unpublicised public appearances before, this was the first confirmed appearance of a man who has long kept a low public profile. 
The only photo Reuters has been able to verify of him was an undated image posted on a Taliban Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) feed in May 2016.

This shadowy existence has led to constant speculation about his whereabouts and health. 
Previously, the Taliban had not confirmed the death of their founder, and original supreme leader, Mullah Omar, for years.

MAPASTEPEC, Mexico (Reuters) - A migrant caravan trekking slowly through southern Mexico will rest a day due to concern over the health of dozens of women and children, one of its organizers said on Saturday, as the government urged the people to accept humanitarian visas.
In often sweltering heat, the group of a few thousand people has during the past week advanced only about 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the city of Tapachula on the Guatemalan border, leaving it still over 1,000 km away from Mexico City.
Luis Villagran, a leader of the caravan largely made up of migrants from Central America and the Caribbean, told Reuters the group would stop for a day in the town of Mapastepec to recover from fatigue and some injuries, then restart on Monday.
""There are more than 150 boys and girls who can't walk any more,"" Villagran said. ""There are pregnant women with sores on their feet who can't continue walking. We estimate there are 90 women in a critical state.""
The government's National Migration Institute (INM), which has sought to disperse caravans, said it wanted to make sure the women and children were looked after, and offered the migrants food and buses to where they could be issued humanitarian visas.
""People's health and their lives should not be put at risk, irrespective of their migration status,"" the INM said in a statement.

Leaders of the caravan this week rejected the offer of visas that are meant to grant migrants access to healthcare and regular work, arguing the government had failed to keep promises to help them in the past.
Separately, official data published this week showed that Mexico's detentions of foreign migrants during September leapt to more than 41,000 from around 32,000 a month earlier. That compared with just over 82,000 in all of 2020.

ROME (Reuters) - Joe Biden received communion while attending Mass on Saturday evening in the American church of Rome, a day after the U.S. president met Pope Francis and said later that the pontiff had told him he is a ""good Catholic"" who can receive the sacrament.
The Mass and Biden's statement beforehand widened a gulf between Francis and conservative U.S. bishops who want to deny him the right to receive communion because of Biden's support for abortion rights.
A person inside the church on Saturday told Reuters the president, who attended the Mass sitting in the back of the church with his wife Jill, received communion.
Biden regularly attends Mass and receives communion in Washington, where the local archbishop, Cardinal Wilton Gregory, has not made any moves to stop him.
Biden, the second Catholic U.S. president, has said he personally opposes to abortion but, as an elected official, cannot impose his views on others.
In Rome, where he was taking part in a summit of the G20 world's richest nations, he attended the Mass at St. Patrick's Church, near the U.S. Embassy.
Pope Francis is also the bishop of Rome, so Biden went to Mass and received communion in his archdiocese.
Catholics can attend Mass on Saturday night to fulfil their Sunday obligation.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who is also Catholic, attended Mass in the same church earlier this month but had to leave early because of a security threat connected with people protesting in a nearby square against coronavirus vaccinations.
Pelosi goes to Mass in Washington but the archbishop in her home city of San Francisco, Salvatore Cordileone, has said public figures who support abortion should be denied communion in his archdiocese and has urged Catholics to pray for Pelosi's ""conversion of heart"".
Last month the pope, asked about the U.S. communion debate, told reporters abortion is ""murder"", even soon after conception, but appeared to criticise U.S. bishops for dealing with the issue in a political rather than pastoral way.

""Communion is not a prize for the perfect,” the pope said. ""Communion is a gift, the presence of Jesus and his Church.""
In June, a divided conference of U.S. Roman Catholic bishops voted to draft a statement on communion that some bishops say should specifically admonish Catholic politicians, including Biden. They take up the issue again next month.

Baldwin, speaking with reporters for the first time since he accidentally killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins with a gun he was told was not loaded, said he had been told not to comment on the investigation by authorities in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
""I'm not allowed to make any comments because it's an ongoing investigation,"" the actor told reporters in an impromptu roadside conversation with photographers and camera crews who had located him in a small town in Vermont.
""We are eagerly awaiting the sheriff's department telling us what their investigation has yielded,"" Baldwin said.
Hutchins, 42, was killed and Joel Souza, the director of the indie Western movie ""Rust"", was wounded when Baldwin fired a gun loaded with a real bullet during a rehearsal on the set on Oct. 21. Baldwin had been told the gun was safe.
No charges have been filed against anyone and the Santa Fe Sheriff's Department has said its investigation will take time to complete. It remains unclear how live ammunition found its way on to the set.
Baldwin called Hutchins his friend and said her family was ""overwhelmed with grief"".
""There are incidental accidents on film sets from time to time, but nothing like this. This is a one in a trillion episode,"" he said.
The incident has led to calls by some https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pressure-mounts-ban-real-guns-hollywood-after-baldwin-set-tragedy-2021-10-25 in the industry for real guns, which usually carry blanks or dummy bullets, to be banned on movie and television sets. Baldwin said he supported the efforts. 
""I do know that an ongoing effort to limit the use of firearms on film sets is something I'm extremely interested in,"" Baldwin said. ""Some new measures have to be taken."" 

""I'm not an expert in this field. So whatever other people decide is the best way to go, in terms of protecting people's safety on film sets, I'm all in favor of and I will cooperate with that in any way that I can.""

ROME (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden will warn Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan during a meeting on Sunday that any precipitous actions would not benefit U.S.-Turkish relations and that crises should be avoided, a U.S. official said on Saturday.
Erdogan earlier this month ordered 10 envoys, including the U.S. ambassador, to be declared ""persona non grata"" for seeking the release of jailed philanthropist Osman Kavala, though he later withdrew the threat to expel them.
""Certainly the president will indicate that we need to find a way to avoid crises like that one going forward and precipitous action is not going to benefit the U.S.-Turkey partnership and alliance,"" the U.S. official told reporters.
The official said a meeting between the two leaders may not have happened if Erdogan had expelled the U.S. ambassador. But the issue had been resolved, for the moment at least, he said.
Biden, who is in Rome for the G20 summit, will also discuss Turkey's request to purchase F-16 fighter jets, its defence relationship with the United States and a range of regional issues such as Syria and Libya. 
U.S. lawmakers have urged the Biden administration not to sell F-16s to Turkey and threatened to block any such exports on the grounds that Turkey had purchased Russian missile defence systems and ""behaved like an adversary"".

Reuters reported earlier this month that Turkey had made a request to the United States to buy 40 Lockheed Martin-made F-16s and nearly 80 modernization kits for its existing warplanes.
The alliance between the United States and Turkey, both members of NATO, has come under strain in recent years over policy differences on Syria, Turkey's Russian S-400 missile defence purchase, and human rights.

No country has formally recognised the Taliban government since the insurgents took over the country in August, while billions of dollars in Afghan assets and funds abroad have also been frozen, even as the country faces severe economic and humanitarian crises. 
""Our message to America is, if unrecognition continues, Afghan problems continue, it is the problem of the region and could turn into a problem for the world,"" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told journalists at a news conference on Saturday.
He said the reason the Taliban and the United States went to war last time was also because the two did not have formal diplomatic ties.
The United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001 following the Sept. 11, 2001, attack after the then-Taliban government refused to hand over al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden. 
""Those issues which caused the war, they could have been solved through negotiation, they could have been solved through political compromise too,"" Mujahid said.
He added that recognition was the right of the Afghan people.
While no country has recognised the Taliban government, senior officials from a number of countries have met with the movement's leadership both in Kabul and abroad.
The latest visit was by Turkmen Foreign Minister Rasit Meredow, who was in Kabul on Saturday. The two sides discussed the speedy implementation of the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline, Mujahid said earlier on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, met Taliban officials in Qatar earlier this week. Mujahid said on Saturday that China had promised to finance transport infrastructure, and to give Kabul's exports access to Chinese markets via neighbouring Pakistan.

Mujahid also spoke at length about the issues facing border crossings, particularly with Pakistan, which have seen frequent closures and protests in recent days. The crossings are crucial for landlocked Afghanistan.
He said serious talks on the matter were held when Pakistan's foreign minister had travelled to Kabul last week.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - An attorney for Andrew Cuomo on Saturday suggested the county sheriff's office that has filed a misdemeanor sex complaint against the former New York governor leaked secret grand jury testimony to the press.
In a letter to Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), attorney Rita Glavin served formal notice demanding that all records related to the sheriff's office investigation of Cuomo be preserved, in a probe Cuomo described on Saturday as ""rogue"".
On Friday Apple rejected accusations from Cuomo's camp that his investigation was politically motivated. Cuomo's attorney called the timing of Thursday's criminal complaint ""suspect"", as it was made on the eve of New York Attorney General Letitia James's announcement that she was running for New York governor.
Cuomo resigned in August amid multiple sexual harassment allegations. He and James are both Democrats but are political rivals. James's office is conducting a separate investigation of Cuomo.
The criminal complaint filed on Thursday charges Cuomo with forcible touching by groping a female aide under her blouse inside the Executive Mansion. The complaint did not name the woman but she has identified herself as Brittany Commisso, who worked as one of Cuomo's executive assistants.

In Saturday's letter, Glavin demanded that Apple preserve all communications between his office and that of James, state lawmakers, journalists and Commisso.
""We will be asking for an investigation of unlawful grand jury leaks, and we are also exploring legal remedies for such leaks,"" Glavin wrote to Apple.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) -Security forces shot dead three people during nationwide protests in Sudan on Saturday, a doctors committee said, as hundreds of thousands of people demanded the restoration of a civilian-led government after a military coup.
In Khartoum, security forces used tear gas and gunfire to try to disperse a huge crowd after protesters had been setting up a stage and discussing the possibility of a sit-in, said a Reuters witness.
The Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors said three protesters were shot dead by security forces in the capital Khartoum's twin city of Omdurman. It said 38 people were injured, including some by gunfire.
An eyewitness in Omdurman said they heard gunshots and saw people being carried away bleeding from the direction of the parliament building.
Sudanese police denied shooting protesters during the demonstrations, saying on state TV that one policeman sustained gunshot wounds. A representative of the military was not immediately available to comment.
The demonstrations marked the biggest challenge to General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan since he ousted Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok's cabinet on Monday. 
""This has been a miscalculation from the start and misunderstanding of the level of commitment, bravery, and concern the street has about the future of Sudan,"" said Jonas Horner of the International Crisis Group.
Protesters carried Sudanese flags and chanted ""Military rule can't be praised"" and ""This country is ours, and our government is civilian"" as they marched in neighbourhoods across Khartoum.
People also took to the streets in cities in central, eastern, northern and western Sudan. Crowds swelled to the hundreds of thousands in Khartoum, said a Reuters witness.
""The people have delivered their message, that retreat is impossible and power belongs to the people,"" said protester Haitham Mohamed.
AID FROZEN
The United States and the World Bank have frozen assistance to Sudan, where an economic crisis has seen shortages of food and medicine and where nearly a third of the population are in need of urgent humanitarian support.
While Western states have denounced the coup, Sudan's regional allies Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt have emphasized the need for stability and security.
Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud told Reuters that the kingdom hopes all sides in Sudan can engage in a dialogue and chart a path forward. 
Civilian-appointed cabinet ministers supported the protests in a statement, and said the military ""will not find free Sudanese or true democratic revolutionary forces to be their partners in power.""
In central Khartoum there was a heavy military deployment of armed troops that included the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. 
Security forces had blocked roads leading to the defence ministry complex and the airport.
With Saturday's daths, at least 14 protesters have been killed in clashes with security forces this week, raising fears of a full-blown crackdown.
    In local neighbourhoods, protest groups blocked roads overnight with stones, bricks, tree branches and plastic pipes to try to keep the security forces out. 
NEIGHBOURHOOD RESISTANCE COMMITTEES
Unlike in previous protests, many people carried pictures of Hamdok, who remains popular despite an economic crisis that had worsened under his rule. 
""Hamdok is supported by the people. If Hamdok takes the country that's okay,"" said Mohamed, a member of a neighbourhood resistance committee.
With internet and phone lines restricted by the authorities, opponents of the coup mobilised for the protest using fliers, SMS messages, graffiti, and neighbourhood rallies.
    Neighbourhood-based resistance committees, active since the uprising https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/sudans-political-turmoil-2021-10-29 against deposed President Omar al-Bashir that began in December 2018, have been central to organising despite the arrests of key politicians.
    Protesters carried pictures of Burhan, his deputy General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, and Bashir covered in red.
    Burhan has said he removed the cabinet to avert civil war after civilian politicians stoked hostility to the armed forces.

    He says he is still committed to a democratic transition, including elections in July 2023.
""Rule is based on a combination of consent and coercion,"" said Sudanese analyst Magdi El Gizouli. ""Burhan has no consent and is unable to coerce the multitudes on the street into submission.""

ROME (Reuters) - Thousands of people marched in Rome on Saturday during the summit of the leaders of the Group of 20 major economies, calling on them to act against climate change and ensure fair access to COVID-19 vaccines.
Climate activists led the march, carrying colourful placards, playing drums and dancing as they demanded world leaders save the planet.
""We are holding this protest for environmental and social issues and against the G20, which continues undaunted on a path that has almost led us to social and ecological failure,"" said protester Edoardo Mentrasti.
They marched alongside students and groups of workers in a city on high security alert, with up to 6,000 police and about 500 soldiers deployed to maintain order. Metro stations have been closed and bus routes diverted due to the G20 summit.
Italian police are particularly anxious about unrest after recent protests over the country's mandatory COVID health pass for workers turned violent when neo-fascist activists attacked the headquarters of the CGIL labour union in Rome.
In Saturday's march, a large banner saying ""stop patents, vaccines are a global right"" was held by demonstrators parading along the banks of the Tiber river.
In the morning, the G20 leaders kicked off two days of talks where they were set to acknowledge the existential threat of climate change, but stop short of radical new commitments to tame global warming.
""There is an alternative to a development model based on 20 of the world's most important heads of state meeting in a room and deciding on the fate of the world,"" demonstrator Luca Ianniello said. 

A separate, smaller protest against the Italian government, was in progress a few kilometres away.
Demonstrators have been kept far from the summit centre, located in a suburb built by the 20th Century fascist dictator Benito Mussolini.

Some 377 domestically transmitted cases with confirmed symptoms were reported from Oct. 17-29, National Health Commission (NHC) data showed. China has tackled a series of outbreaks this year since it largely contained a national spread in early 2020.
The numbers remain tiny compared with clusters outside the country. However, while the rest of the world works out how to co-exist with COVID, China has maintained its zero tolerance, urging vigilance around border areas and ports to prevent infected inbound travellers spreading the virus to locals. 
""Within the past 14 days, 14 provincial areas have reported new locally transmitted cases or asymptomatic carriers,"" the NHC spokesperson Mi Feng said on Saturday.
""The outbreak is still developing rapidly, and the virus control situation is severe and complicated.""
Heihe, a small northeastern city of 1.3 million people that lies on China's side of the Amur river on the border with Russia, reported 26 local cases for Oct. 29, a sharp increase from nine on Oct. 28 and just one on Oct. 27.
""The outbreak has exposed the laxity of mind among some local authorities,"" Wu Liangyou, another NHC official, said. 
China, especially ports of entry, should strengthen test screening of people of high infection risk and improve monitoring of potential flare-ups, as the virus is still spreading in surrounding countries, Wu told a news briefing. 
Surveys and virus sequencing results showed the cluster in Heihe was unrelated to an ongoing outbreak hitting mainly the northwestern parts of China, indicating that there was a new source of virus brought from overseas, Wu said. 
Many local infections found in the north and northwest parts of China since Oct. 17 could be traced back to a source of virus brought in from overseas, the NHC said last week.
China's border towns, many with relatively few resources, have tended to suffer more severe disruptions than richer cities amid the outbreaks. 
The small southwestern city of Ruili bordering Myanmar has seen its once robust jewellery trade business, a pillar of its modest economy, dampened by some of the toughest virus measures in China due to repeated outbreaks.
In major cities, officials have vowed strict virus curbs for key international events to minimise the risk of imported virus. 
To safely host the Winter Olympics Games in February, Chinese athletes and staff supporting the event must receive a vaccine booster shot, while boosters are recommended for foreign athletes but not compulsory, according to a state television report.

China is aiming to complete vaccinating children aged three to 11 by the end of December, excluding those with medical conditions that may render a COVID-19 shot harmful, Wu said.
It has already fully vaccinated about 75.8% of its 1.4 billion population, and is giving eligible adults a booster shot.

The fighters pushed Ethiopian government forces from Dessie and were headed towards the town of Kombolcha, Getachew Reda, spokesperson for the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), told Reuters by satellite phone from an undisclosed location.
He said Tigrayan forces had captured numerous Ethiopian soldiers.
Legesse Tulu, the government spokesperson, told Reuters in a text message that the town was still under the control of the Ethiopian government and said claims by the Tigrayan forces were ""fabricated propaganda"".
The Unites States on Saturday afternoon called on Tigrayan forces to halt their advances ""in and around the cities of Dessie and Kombolcha"" and renewed calls for them to withdraw from the Amhara and Afar regions.
Asked about the Tigrayan forces' claims, Ethiopian military spokesman Colonel Getnet Adane referred Reuters to the federal government. Amhara spokesperson Gizachew Muluneh, the mayor of Dessie and a spokesperson for the town did not respond to requests for comment.
Reuters could not independently verify the account of either side as phone lines in Dessie appeared to be down as of Saturday afternoon. 
The capture of Dessie would be a strategic gain for the Tigrayan fighters against the central government forces who are trying to dislodge them from the Amhara region. 
The large town is some 385 km (240 miles) from the capital, Addis Ababa, and is the furthest south in Amhara that the TPLF has reached since pushing into the region in July. 
A school director in Dessie said he saw Ethiopian soldiers retreating from the town on Saturday morning towards Kombolcha and that power across town had been off since Friday.
Another resident of Dessie also said the town had no power and that the federal army had left. Both said they had heard Tigrayan fighters were in town but had not seen them. Both residents spoke on condition of anonymity.
War broke nearly a year ago between federal troops and the TPLF. Thousands of people have been killed and more than 2 million people have been forced to flee.

Tigrayan forces were initially beaten back, but recaptured most of the region in July and pushed into the neighbouring Amhara and Afar regions.
In mid-October, the Tigrayan forces said the military had launched a ground offensive to push them out of Amhara. The military said on Thursday there was heavy fighting there, but accused the Tigrayan forces of starting it.

ROME (Reuters) - Britain stepped up a war of words with France on Saturday, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson refusing to rule out triggering trade dispute action next week in a fishing row and his Brexit minister sharply criticising Paris' actions.
Johnson, who is hosting the U.N. climate summit next week, again said he did not want the spat over fish https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/post-brexit-fishing-rules-heart-new-uk-france-clash-2021-10-28 to derail this weekend's meeting of the world's 20 biggest economies, seen as a stepping stone to secure more commitments for COP26 in Glasgow https://www.reuters.com/business/cop.
But a volley of angry statements from Brexit minister David Frost underlined how seriously London was taking a letter sent by Paris calling on the European Union to demonstrate the damage of leaving the bloc. He described it as ""very troubling"".
After an earlier British-hosted G7 meeting was overshadowed by a disagreement with the EU over post-Brexit problems with the movement of sausages and other goods to Northern Ireland, Johnson also made a move to defuse the row.
""If there is a breach of the treaty or we think there is a breach of the treaty then we will do what is necessary to protect British interests,"" Johnson told Sky News in the Colosseum in Rome, where he is attending a G20 meeting.
Asked if he would rule out triggering dispute resolution measures in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) next week, Johnson said: ""No of course not, I don't rule that out."" 
""But what I think everybody wants to see (is) cooperation between the European allies and Emmanuel Macron and I share a common perspective which is that climate change is a disaster for humanity.""
Relations with France have become increasingly strained since Britain voted to leave the EU in 2016, with London's security pact with the United States and Australia doing little to build trust with Paris. French President Macron has questioned Britain's ""credibility"".
Fishing, which dogged Brexit talks for years, while not economically crucial to either country, holds huge political importance to both, and the row, if not resolved, could trigger the beginning of dispute measures in the Brexit trade deal.
Any such measures would likely involve convening an arbitration panel and could result in a demand for compensation or suspension of obligations.
FIST BUMP
The letter sent by French Prime Minister Jean Castex to the EU calling on the bloc to demonstrate there was ""more damage to leaving the EU than to remaining there"" has also soured ties.
Frost said he hoped ""this opinion is not held more widely across the EU"", calling its expression in a letter ""clearly very troubling and very problematic"".
Johnson also expressed his concerns ""about the rhetoric from the French government"" at a meeting with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. She said Brussels was ""intensively engaging for finding solutions"".
In Rome, Johnson and Macron exchanged a mock-combative fist bump but did not appear to speak to one another as the leaders took a ""family photo"". They are due to see each other for a brief meeting on Sunday.
""We have been seeking to work with the French government to issue more fishing licences, we stand ready to continue that work,"" Johnson's spokesman said.
With an election in April in which Macron is expected to seek a new term, some British officials say he is seeking to look tough to appeal to the electorate. Some European diplomats see Johnson's government as likewise taking a firm stance to please Brexit supporters. 
The issue escalated this week when a British scallop dredger was escorted to a French port after French officials said it did not have the correct documentation. Paris has said it could begin to impose targeted measures from Tuesday, including heightening some checks, if the dispute is not resolved.

But a French diplomatic source told Reuters Macron shared Johnson's aim of easing tensions.
""The president is in favour of calming things down, but at the same time he can't pretend the British are not reneging on the commitments they've made,"" the source said.

BEIRUT (Reuters) -Lebanon's president said on Saturday he wants the best relations with Saudi Arabia, looking to heal a rift with the kingdom after it expelled Beirut's envoy and banned Lebanese imports in a diplomatic spat that risks adding to Lebanon's economic crisis.
In a tweet Michel Aoun said Lebanon is keen on strengthening links via bilateral deals, after mounting tensions following critical comments by a Lebanese minister about the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen.
The row has spurred calls by some top politicians for the resignation of Information Minister George Kordahi, while others opposed such a move, which could undermine the government as a whole.
Following a near three-hour ministerial crisis meeting on Saturday, Education Minister Abbas Halabi said the government could not afford to resign over the diplomatic dispute.
""The country cannot be left without a government,"" due to other pressing matters, and would continue to work to resolve the rift, Halabi said.
Saudi Arabia expelled Lebanon's envoy and banned all Lebanese imports on Friday, and Bahrain and Kuwait followed suit, giving the top Lebanese diplomats 48 hours to exit. The United Arab Emirates later said it would withdraw all its diplomats and banned its citizens from travelling to Lebanon. 
Kordahi's resignation would have knock-on effects that could threaten Prime Minister Najib Mikati's coalition government, tasked with addressing a financial crisis dubbed by the World Bank as one of the worst in modern history. 
Kordahi left without making a statement after a visit to the country's top Christian cleric, Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros Al-Rai on Saturday. 
Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib said Mikati's contacts with officials from a number of states showed opposition to the resignation of the government, formed only last month after a 13-month stalemate. 
""They told Mikati, 'if you are thinking about resignation, take that out of your head,'"" he said. 
Richard Michaels, deputy head of the U.S. mission in Lebanon, had joined the crisis meeting in Beirut, a U.S. Embassy spokesperson said, declining to comment further.
NATIONAL INTERESTS 
Kordahi has been publicly backed by the Iran-backed Hezbollah armed group and has declined to apologise or resign over the comments, which have dealt the worst blow to Saudi-Lebanese relations since Saad al-Hariri's 2017 detention in Riyadh.
The minister's political patron, Suleiman Frangieh of the Hezbollah-allied Marada Movement, told a news conference he had refused an offer by Kordahi to resign and would not name a successor should he do so. 
A group of former Lebanese prime ministers called on Saturday for Kordahi to resign, however, saying his comments had inflicted a strong blow to relations with Gulf Arab nations.
Fouad Seniora, Hariri and Tammam Sallam, some of the country's top pro-Saudi politicians, said in the statement that Kordahi's remarks ""harmed Lebanon's supreme national interest"". 
If Kordahi resigns, ministers backed by Hezbollah and its Amal ally could follow suit at a time when the government is already paralysed by a dispute over an inquiry into the August 2020 explosion that devastated parts of Beirut. 
A senior political source told Reuters that the United States and European nations were in contact with Lebanese officials to prevent the government from falling and there were no immediate indications any ministers would resign. 
Mikati has been hoping to improve ties with Gulf Arab states strained for years because of the influence wielded in Beirut by Hezbollah. 

Ali Shihabi, a Saudi analyst, said the latest row was rooted in Saudi concern over Hezbollah's growing grip on Lebanon despite huge Saudi financial support and hundreds of thousands of Lebanese working in the Gulf. 
""Kordahi's statement stung particularly hard since his career was made with Saudi-owned media ... but this is bigger than just him,"" he said.

ROME (Reuters) -Leaders of the Group of 20 major economies will say they aim to cap global warming at the 1.5 degrees Celsius level scientists say is vital to avoid disaster, but will largely avoid firm commitments, according to a draft statement seen by Reuters. 
The joint statement on the need for climate action reflects tough negotiations among diplomats as the leaders gathered for a two-day summit in Rome, but the draft details few concrete actions to limit carbon emissions.
""We remain committed to the (2015) Paris Agreement goal to hold the global average temperature increase well below 2°C and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels,"" the draft says.
The statement also says the leaders recognised ""the key relevance"" of achieving net zero carbon emissions by the middle of this century.
This is a goal that United Nations experts say is needed to achieve the 1.5 degree cap on warming, but some of the world's biggest polluters have still not committed to it.
China, the largest global emitter of greenhouse gases, has set a 2060 target date.
Overall, the fifth draft produced does not seem to have toughened up the language on climate action compared with previous versions, and in some areas it has slightly softened it.
BIG EMITTERS
The role of the G20 is crucial ahead of a broader U.N. climate summit https://www.reuters.com/business/cop known as ""COP26"" to be held in Glasgow, Scotland next week involving almost 200 countries.
The G20 bloc, which includes Brazil, China, India, Germany and the United States, accounts for more than 80% of the world's gross domestic product (GDP), 60% of its population and an estimated 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
""Keeping 1.5°C within reach will require meaningful and effective actions by all countries,"" the latest draft says. 
That compares with a previous draft which said ""immediate action"" was needed, reflecting the painstaking discussions over wording involved in climate diplomacy.
The reference in the latest draft to the importance of reaching net zero emissions ""by mid-century"", replaces a previous version which referred to the more specific ""by 2050"". This was in brackets, indicating it required negotiation.
The latest draft acknowledges that current national plans on how to curb emissions will have to be strengthened, but offers little detail on how this should be done.
U.N. experts say that even if current national plans are fully implemented, the world is headed for global warming of 2.7 degrees, with a catastrophic acceleration of events such as drought, storms and flooding.
The draft includes a pledge to halt financing of overseas coal-fired power generation by the end of this year, and to ""do our utmost"" to stop building new coal power plants before the end of the 2030s. Both these commitments were in previous drafts, as was another reiterated pledge to phase out fossil fuel subsidies ""over the medium term.""
In the latest draft the G20 leaders also say they will ""strive to reduce our collective methane emissions significantly"". Methane has a much more potent, but less long-lasting, impact on global warming than carbon dioxide.
The willingness of wealthier countries to help finance the ecological transition of poorer ones, known as ""climate financing"", is likely to be crucial to the success of the G20 and the Glasgow summits.
In 2009, rich nations promised to provide $100 billion per year of climate financing but they have failed to meet the pledge, generating mistrust and a reluctance among some developing nations to accelerate their emissions reductions.

""We stress the importance of fulfilling the joint commitment to the goal of developed countries to mobilize USD 100 billion annually from public and private sources through to 2025 to address the needs of developing countries, in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation,"" the latest G20 draft says.
There is no reference to retroactive payment of the money promised by 2020, which some developing countries and activists say is needed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. intelligence agencies said on Friday they may never be able to identify the origins of COVID-19, as they released a new, more detailed version of their review of whether the coronavirus came from animal-to-human transmission or leaked from a lab.
The Office of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said in a declassified report that a natural origin and a lab leak are both plausible hypotheses for how SARS-COV-2 first infected humans. But it said analysts disagree on which is more likely or whether any definitive assessment can be made at all.
The report also dismissed suggestions that the coronavirus originated as a bioweapon, saying proponents of this theory ""do not have direct access to the Wuhan Institute of Virology"" and have been accused of spreading disinformation.
The report issued on Friday is an update of a 90-day review that President Joe Biden's administration released in August, amid intense political infighting over how much to blame China for the effects of the global pandemic rather than governments that may not have moved quickly enough to protect citizens.
China responded on Friday by criticizing the report.
""The US moves of relying on its intelligence apparatus instead of scientists to trace the origins of COVID-19 is a complete political farce,"" Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, said in an emailed statement.
""... It will only undermine science-based origins study and hinder the global effort of finding the source of the virus,"" the statement said.
Former Republican President Donald Trump - who lost his bid for re-election as the deadly pandemic ravaged the U.S. economy - and many of his supporters referred to COVID-19 as the ""China virus.""
Some U.S. spy agencies had strongly favored the explanation that the virus originated in nature. But there has been little corroboration and over recent months the virus has spread widely and naturally among wild animals.
The ODNI report said four U.S. spy agencies and a multi-agency body have ""low confidence"" that COVID-19 originated with an infected animal or a related virus.
But one agency said it had ""moderate confidence"" that the first human COVID-19 infection most likely was the result of a laboratory accident, probably involving experimentation or animal handling by the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
U.S. spy agencies believe they will not be able to produce a more definitive explanation for the origin of COVID-19 without new information demonstrating that the virus took a specific pathway from animals to humans or that a Wuhan laboratory was handling the virus or a related virus before COVID-19 surfaced.
The report said U.S. agencies and the global scientific community lacked ""clinical samples or a complete understanding of epidemiological data from the earliest COVID-19 cases"" and said it could revisit this inconclusive finding if more evidence surfaces. 
China has faced international criticism for failing to cooperate more fully in investigations of COVID's origins.

The embassy statement also dismissed that criticism.
""We have been supporting science-based efforts on origins tracing, and will continue to stay actively engaged. That said, we firmly oppose attempts to politicize this issue,"" it said.

ROME (Reuters) - Britain's Queen Elizabeth, who has been advised by doctors to rest and avoid official visits for at least the next two weeks, is on very good form, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said after speaking to the 95-year-old monarch this week.
There has been concern over the health of Elizabeth, the world's oldest and longest-reigning monarch, after she cancelled a number of planned trips and spent a night in hospital for an unspecified, although not COVID-19 related, ailment, her first such overnight stay for years.
""I spoke to her majesty and she’s on very good form,"" Johnson, who speaks to the queen every Wednesday to give her a weekly update, told Channel 4 news on Saturday. 
""She’s just got to follow the advice of her doctors and get some rest and I think that’s the important thing. I think the whole country wishes her well.""
Elizabeth, who is queen of 15 other realms including Australia, Canada and New Zealand, has been resting at her Windsor Castle home since she stayed overnight in hospital 10 days ago after undergoing ""preliminary investigations"".
The monarch, who is known for her robust health and who regularly carried out official public duties despite her age, had already pulled out of a visit to Northern Ireland and the upcoming COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow next week where she had planned to address world leaders in person.
Buckingham Palace said she would no longer attend a major event on Nov. 13 at the Royal Albert Hall hosted by a British military charity, but had a ""firm intention"" to be present at the main national service of remembrance for veterans on Sunday Nov. 14, an event of great importance to her.

A palace source said the queen remained in good spirits and she had recorded a video address for the COP26 delegates. Further rest was a ""sensible precaution"", the source added.
Since being told the rest, the queen has appeared well and cheerful in footage released by the palace when she took part by videolink in a number of virtual events.

The caravan made up of mostly of women and children arrived earlier in the day in the town of Acacoyagua, advancing 24 miles (38 km) from a previous stop in another southern Mexican hamlet, just beyond the border city of Tapachula, where the migrants began their journey.
Migrants advocate Irineo Mujica, one of the caravan's leaders, said migrants mostly rejected the offer of so-called humanitarian visas from the agents in exchange for ending their journey. The migrants also would have had to report to government shelters and consent to be moved to other states, Mujica said.
He added that many were distrustful of the migration officials due to what he described as broken promises in the past, as well as some arrests and deportations.
The humanitarian visas would have temporarily regularized the migrants' legal status in Mexico while granting them access to public services like healthcare, as well as the ability to work.
A press officer with the national migration institute said he could not provide any information on negotiations over the visas.

It remains unclear if the Mexican authorities will seek to break up the caravan. Previous caravans have faced off with migration agents and soldiers who have increasingly used tough tactics to stem the tide of fleeing migrants, many of whom want to escape violent gangs and grinding joblessness back home. Others are seeking asylum protections.
The Mexican government is under pressure from U.S. authorities to help reduce the flow and has deployed thousands of police and national guard soldiers to do so in recent months.

(Reuters) - A group of mostly Republican critics of former U.S. President Donald Trump claimed responsibility on Friday for a demonstration in the Virginia governor's campaign that recalled an infamous 2017 rally in the state.
The Lincoln Project said it was behind the use of tiki torches outside a Republican candidate's bus that mimicked the rally by white supremacists in Charlottesville. The earlier event turned deadly when a car driven into a crowd by a self-described neo-Nazi killed a counter-protester.
Tuesday's close vote between Republican former private-equity executive Glenn Youngkin and Democrat Terry McAuliffe, a former governor, is widely seen as a foretaste of next year's midterm elections.
""Today's demonstration was our way of reminding Virginians what happened in Charlottesville four years ago, the Republican Party's embrace of those values and Glenn Youngkin's failure to condemn it,"" the Lincoln Project said in a statement.
On Friday morning, five people wearing white shirts, khaki pants, dark sunglasses and baseball caps and carrying tiki torches approached Youngkin's campaign bus. They reportedly said, ""We're all in for Glenn,"" and remained in front of the bus during his campaign event.
Youngkin said the demonstrators were sent by his opponents. The Democratic Party of Virginia denied involvement.
Trump, who was president during the Aug. 11, 2017 ""Unite the Right"" rally, was criticized for initially saying there were ""fine people on both sides"" of the dispute between neo-Nazis and their opponents at the rally.

Recent polls show McAuliffe slightly ahead or in a statistical dead heat https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-democrats-republicans-spend-heavily-virginia-ahead-governor-election-2021-10-21 in a state where President Joe Biden beat Trump by 10 percentage points last year.

ROME (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said his government's handling of a security agreement with Australia and Britain had been ""clumsy"" and sought to turn the page during his first meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron since a diplomatic crisis last month between Washington and its oldest ally.
The two leaders shared warm words, and friendly body language, but Macron said later that France's trust needed to be regained by deeds, not words. 
The relationship came under strain over the U.S.-Australia security alliance, known as AUKUS, which also includes the United Kingdom. It included a submarine sale agreement with Australia that effectively canceled a 2016 Australian-French submarine deal.
The U.S. decision to secretly negotiate https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/aukus-deal-ensure-peace-security-indo-pacific-says-us-admiral-2021-10-14 drew outrage from Paris. France temporarily recalled its ambassador from Washington, canceled a gala in the U.S. capital and officials accused Biden https://www.reuters.com/world/us-move-dislodge-france-australia-submarine-deal-is-incoherent-french-ministers-2021-09-15 of acting like former President Donald Trump.
""I think what happened was, to use an English phrase, what we did was clumsy. It was not done with a lot of grace,"" Biden said. ""I was under the impression certain things had happened that hadn't happened. And - but I want to make it clear: France is an extremely, extremely valued partner - extremely - and a power in and of itself.""
Biden also noted the United States does not have an older and more loyal ally than France and said there is no place where the two nations cannot cooperate.
""I was under the impression that France had been informed long before that the deal was not going through. I, honest to God, did not know you had not been,"" Biden told Macron.
Macron said his meeting with Biden was ""important"" and that it was essential to ""look to the future"" as his country and the United States work to mend fences. 
Biden and Macron showed warm body language, with clasped hands and arms on each others' backs when they greeted one another. They shook hands a few times while journalists watched the beginning of their meeting.
""What really matters now is what we will do together in the coming weeks, the coming months, the coming years,"" Macron said.
'PROOF IS BETTER'
Macron told reporters afterward that the meeting with Biden had been helpful, with a ""strong"" U.S. commitment about European defense, but what happened next was important. 
""Trust is like love: Declarations are good, but proof is better,"" Macron said.
A senior U.S. administration official said after the meeting that the two sides were ""moving forward"" in their relationship and, after difficult conversations in September and October, talks were now more engaging.
Biden and Macron had a discussion about the rise of China and the questions that poses for democracies and market economies, the official said. They also discussed Iran, supply chains, steel and aluminum tariffs and trade.
The two nations issued a lengthy joint statement after the meeting painting themselves as global democratic partners in the fight against a range of challenges, including the coronavirus pandemic, the climate crisis and ensuring the ""indivisible security"" of the NATO alliance.
Washington has taken several steps to fix the relationship with Paris since the rift last month.
Biden and Macron spoke to each other https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/biden-macron-discuss-european-defense-will-meet-rome-white-house-2021-10-22 last week. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also visited Paris, where he acknowledged the United States could have ""communicated better."" Vice President Kamala Harris also announced that she would travel to Paris in November and meet with Macron.
Biden and Macron met at the Villa Bonaparte, the French embassy to the Vatican, which a French diplomat said was a significant mark of goodwill from Biden.
""It's an important gesture,"" the French diplomat said, adding that the United States recognized that it had underestimated the impact of its actions.

France now wants to see if Biden follows his words with actions. ""Trust is being rebuilt. This is one step. Tokens of goodwill were given, we'll see whether they follow through over the long term,"" the diplomat said.
Biden and Macron are in Rome for the Group of 20 summit of world leaders, which opens on Saturday.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said on Friday that Pope Francis told him he was a ""good Catholic"" who can receive communion, widening a gulf between Francis and conservative U.S. bishops who want to deny it because of Biden's support for abortion rights.
Biden and the pope held an unusually long 1 hour and 15 minute meeting at the Vatican as a debate raged back in the United States about the divisive issue.
Asked if the topic of abortion came up, Biden said: ""No it didn't. It came up -- we just talked about the fact he was happy that I was a good Catholic and I should keep receiving communion,"" Biden told reporters.
The president, who goes to weekly Mass regularly and keeps a picture of the pope behind his desk in the Oval Office, has said he is personally opposed to abortion but cannot impose his views as an elected leader.
In June, a divided conference of U.S. Roman Catholic bishops voted to draft https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-bishops-vote-draft-communion-statement-that-may-rebuke-biden-abortion-views-2021-06-18 a statement on communion that some bishops say should specifically admonish Catholic politicians, including Biden. They take up the issue again next month. 
But the pope's comments to Biden, who disclosed them at the start of a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, may make it difficult for the bishops to follow through on their plans.
Asked if he and the pope discussed the U.S. bishops, Biden said ""that's a private conversation.""
Biden's most ardent critics in the U.S. Church hierarchy doubled down ahead of the visit. 
""Dear Pope Francis, you have boldly stated that abortion is 'murder'. Please challenge President Biden on this critical issue. His persistent support of abortion is an embarrassment for the Church and a scandal to the world,"" Bishop Thomas Tobin of Providence, Rhode Island, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) before the meeting.
After the meeting, Tobin tweeted: ""I fear that the Church has lost its prophetic voice. Where are the John the Baptists who will confront the Herods of our day?"", apparently comparing Biden to King Herod, who beheaded the preacher John for calling out the king's sins.
Last month, the pope told reporters that abortion is ""murder"" https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/pope-says-abortion-is-murder-us-bishops-should-not-be-political-2021-09-15 but appeared to criticise U.S. Catholic bishops for dealing with the issue in a political rather than a pastoral way.
""Communion is not a prize for the perfect. ... Communion is a gift, the presence of Jesus and his Church,"" the pope said, adding that bishops should use ""compassion and tenderness"" with Catholic politicians who support abortion rights.
Since his election in 2013 as the first Latin American pope, Francis has said that while the Church should oppose abortion, the issue should not become an all-consuming battle in culture wars that detracts attention from matters such as immigration and poverty.
Biden's meeting with the pope came three days before the U.S. Supreme Court https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-hear-challenge-texas-abortion-ban-2021-10-22 hears the first of two major cases this year challenging a series of state laws backed by Biden's rival Republicans limiting abortion rights. Abortion opponents hope the court will overturn the landmark 1973 Roe vs Wade decision that legalised the procedure nationwide.
Both the White House and Vatican statements made no reference to the abortion issue.
EXCEPTIONALLY LONG MEETING
The White House said Biden thanked the pope for ""his advocacy for the world’s poor and those suffering from hunger, conflict, and persecution"". Biden also praised the pope's ""leadership in fighting the climate crisis, as well as his advocacy to ensure the pandemic ends for everyone through vaccine sharing and an equitable global economic recovery"".
The Vatican said the two discussed ""care of the planet"", health care, the pandemic, refugees, migrants, and ""the protection of human rights, including freedom of religion and conscience"".
The Vatican said the private meeting lasted one hour and 15 minutes and then about another 15 minutes were spent for picture taking and the exchange of gifts in the presence of other members of the delegation, such as Biden's wife, Jill.
A meeting between the pope and former President Donald Trump in 2017 lasted about 30 minutes and one with Barrack Obama in 2014 lasted about 50 minutes.

Biden gave the pope a coin sometimes awarded to soldiers and leaders and told him: ""You are the most significant warrior for peace I've ever met.""
A senior U.S. administration official said the two men discussed climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic at length.

Biden has come under pressure from conservatives at home and his most ardent critics in the U.S. Church hierarchy have said he should be banned from receiving communion, the central sacrament of the faith. 
Asked if the topic of abortion came up during a long meeting with pope in the Vatican earlier on Friday, Biden said no. He said the pope told him he was happy he was a good Catholic and he should ""keep receiving communion"".

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Enrollment in U.S. government-run health insurance program Medicaid during the COVID-19 pandemic grew 16%, with more than 11 million additional Americans signing up, the Department of Health and Human Services said on Friday.
Safety nets like Medicaid and re-opening enrollment through the Affordable Care Act helped stabilize uninsured rates even while millions lost employer-related health insurance coverage as the pandemic rattled the U.S. economy, the department said.
""The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our lives in many ways, yet today's report shows we made significant strides to protect Americans' health,"" said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra.
The pandemic disrupted the federal surveys that the HHS relies on for coverage estimates, the agency said in a report https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/tracking-health-insurance-coverage tracking health insurance coverage. It added lower response rates, especially among lower income and younger respondents, may have affected the accuracy of its estimates.
The data showed a stable uninsured rate in 2020, with estimates ranging from 8.6% to 9.7% of the population, about 28-31.6 million people. Around 30 million U.S. residents were uninsured in 2019, before the pandemic, federal surveys show.
The uninsured rate was significantly higher in Hispanic populations at 18.3%, residents of states that did not expand Medicaid coverage at 17.6%, people below the poverty line at 17.2%, and Black populations at 10.4%, Friday's report showed.
Addressing these disparities is a top priority for the President Joe Biden's administration, the department said.
The data comes ahead of the enrollment period for the online health insurance marketplace created by the ACA, also known as Obamacare, for 2022, set to open on Monday and close on Jan. 15.
Around 2.8 million people signed up for health insurance on government website Healthcare.gov https://www.healthcare.gov after Biden re-opened enrollment for a special period from Feb. 15 to Aug. 15 in part because of the pandemic.
The Democrat ran in 2020 on a promise to curb growing inequality, including expanding access to healthcare and affordable drugs amid a pandemic that has killed over 745,000 people so far.

Biden presented a negotiated social spending plan on Thursday to Congress and voters. 
It expands ACA premium tax credits through 2025 and adds coverage of hearing costs for people 65 and older, but notably lacked significant Medicare and Medicaid coverage expansions as well as drug price reform.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Representative Adam Kinzinger, one of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach then-President Donald Trump on a charge of inciting the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, on Friday said he would not seek re-election in 2022.
The Illinois congressman, who also bucked party leadership by joining a House of Representatives panel investigating the Capitol riot, lamented national divisions in announcing his exit.
""I cannot focus on both a re-election to Congress and a broader fight nationwide,"" Kinzinger, 43, said in a video posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). He is in his sixth two-year term representing a district just outside Chicago.
Kinzinger was the second of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump to choose not to seek re-election in the 2022 contests that will determine control of Congress. Democrats hold slim majorities in both the House and Senate.
Kinzinger also faced a difficult race next year. 
Hours before his announcement, Illinois' Democrat-led state legislature approved a new map for congressional districts that would pit Kinzinger against another Republican incumbent, Representative Darin LaHood, in a single, heavily Republican district. 
Illinois and other state governments are currently redrawing congressional district boundaries following the 2020 census. 
Trump, the first U.S. president in history to be impeached twice, was narrowly acquitted by the Senate. He has lambasted Kinzinger and other Republicans who criticized him for his false claims that he lost the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden due to voter fraud.
""2 down, 8 to go!"" Trump said in a statement on Friday following Kinzinger's announcement. The former president has endorsed https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-revenge-endorsements-drive-republican-congressman-race-2021-09-09 primary challengers to four House Republicans and a Senate Republican, Lisa Murkowski, who supported his second impeachment.
In September, Representative Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, another Republican who voted to impeach Trump, dropped out of his re-election race, citing ""the toxic dynamics inside our own party."" 
Representative Liz Cheney, who also cast a vote for impeachment, was ousted from her House Republican leadership post after repeatedly criticizing Trump's claims. Once considered a rising star in the party, she faces a tough re-election battle in her home state of Wyoming.
Kinzinger, who had also been one of Trump's fiercest critics in the Republican Party, was less pointed in the video announcing his exit from Congress.

He said his political career was not over. While he did not specify his next steps, he urged viewers to support a political action committee, or fund-raising organization, which could support his political allies.
""My disappointment in the leaders that don't lead is huge,"" Kinzinger said. ""We must unplug from the mistruths we've been fed.""

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Afghanistan's Taliban government is pressing for the release of billions of dollars of central bank reserves as the drought-stricken nation faces a cash crunch, mass starvation and a new migration crisis.
Afghanistan parked billions of dollars in assets overseas with the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks in Europe, but that money has been frozen since the Islamist Taliban ousted the Western-backed government in August.
A spokesman for the finance ministry said the government would respect human rights, including the education of women, as he sought fresh funds on top of humanitarian aid that he said offered only ""small relief"".
Under Taliban rule from 1996-2001, women were largely shut out of paid employment and education and normally had to cover their faces and be accompanied by a male relative when they left home.
""The money belongs to the Afghan nation. Just give us our own money,"" ministry spokesman Ahmad Wali Haqmal told Reuters. ""Freezing this money is unethical and is against all international laws and values.""
One top central bank official called on European countries including Germany to release their share of the reserves to avoid an economic collapse that could trigger mass migration towards Europe.
""The situation is desperate and the amount of cash is dwindling,"" Shah Mehrabi, a board member of the Afghan Central Bank, told Reuters. ""There is enough right now ... to keep Afghanistan going until the end of the year.
""Europe is going to be affected most severely, if Afghanistan does not get access to this money,"" said Mehrabi.
""You will have a double whammy of not being able to find bread and not being able to afford it. People will be desperate. They are going to go to Europe,"" he said.
The call for assistance comes as Afghanistan faces a collapse of its fragile economy. The departure of U.S.-led forces and many international donors left the country without grants that financed three quarters of public spending.
The finance ministry said it had a daily tax take of roughly 400 million Afghanis ($4.4 million).
Although Western powers want to avert a humanitarian disaster in Afghanistan, they have refused to officially recognise the Taliban government.
Haqmal said Afghanistan would allow women an education, although not in the same classrooms as men.
Human rights, he said, would be respected but within the framework of Islamic law, which would not include gay rights.
""LGBT... That's against our Sharia law,"" he said.
Mehrabi hopes that while the United States has recently said it will not release its lion's share of roughly $9 billion of funds, European countries might.
He said Germany held half a billion dollars of Afghan money and that it and other European countries should release those funds.
Mehrabi said that Afghanistan needed $150 million each month to ""prevent imminent crisis"", keeping the local currency and prices stable, adding that any transfer could be monitored by an auditor.
""If reserves remain frozen, Afghan importers will not be able to pay for their shipments, banks will start to collapse, food will be become scarce, grocery stores will be empty,"" Mehrabi said.
He said that about $431 million of central bank reserves were held with German lender Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), as well as a further roughly $94 million with Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank.

The Bank for International Settlements, an umbrella group for global central banks in Switzerland, holds a further approximately $660 million. All three declined to comment.
The Taliban took back power in Afghanistan in August after the United States pulled out its troops, almost 20 years after the Islamists were ousted by U.S.-led forces following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.

""Mr. Clark has been granted a brief postponement as a result of his retaining new counsel,"" a committee aide said on Friday.
The U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 assault on the seat of the U.S. government announced on Oct. 13 that it had issued a subpoena to Clark asking him to produce records and testify at a deposition by Oct. 29.
Clark was acting head of the Justice Department's civil division during the presidency of former Republican President Donald Trump. He was a proponent of Trump's unfounded claims that Democrat Joe Biden's victory in the November 2020 election was the result of fraud.

In announcing it subpoenaed Clark, the committee said it needed to understand all the details about efforts inside the previous administration to amplify misinformation about election results.
Trump gave a speech espousing his election fraud theory at a raucous rally on Jan. 6, when Vice President Mike Pence and Congress met to certify Biden's election. Trump urged his supporters to ""fight like hell,"" sending thousands of them to march on the Capitol.

U.S. officials, in a statement, said the IRGC has been providing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones for use by Iran-backed groups, including Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, and in crisis-hit Ethiopia.
""Iran's proliferation of UAVs across the region threatens international peace and stability. Iran and its proxy militants have used UAVs to attack U.S. forces, our partners, and international shipping,"" Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said. ""Treasury will continue to hold Iran accountable for its irresponsible and violent acts.""
The sanctions announced Friday targeting four people, including Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Brigadier General Saeed Aghajani, who the United States says oversees the UAV operations of the Aerospace Force.
The Treasury Department's actions also target two companies -- Kimia Part Sivan Co. and Oje Parvaz Mado Nafar Co. -- that it said procured components for the program and provided other assistance.
The sanctions will block access to property subject to U.S. jurisdiction of the persons designated, while U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with the designated persons or their blocked property, the Treasury said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration is working with international partners to prepare new sanctions that could be levied in response to Nicaragua’s Nov. 7 election, which Washington has denounced as a sham organized by President Daniel Ortega, U.S. officials say.
The U.S. government has also begun a review of Nicaragua’s participation in a Central America free trade agreement and has already halted support for any “trade capacity building” activities seen as benefiting Ortega’s government, a senior State Department official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
President Joe Biden’s administration, building on sanctions imposed by his predecessor Donald Trump, has imposed punitive financial measures and U.S. travel bans on dozens of Nicaraguan officials, including Ortega family members, amid a government crackdown ahead of the election.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement last week that Ortega, who is seeking a fourth term, and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo, were “preparing a sham election devoid of credibility, by silencing and arresting opponents.”
One U.S. government source said further sanctions were in the works for after the election, and the State Department official also signaled such a move was likely.
The Nicaraguan government and its embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Ortega said in June that sanctions would not deter him and his government was following the law in prosecuting people conspiring against him. He accused Washington in July of trying to undermine the elections and seeking to ""again sow terrorism"" in Nicaragua, an apparent reference to U.S. financing of right-wing “Contra” fighters in the 1980s.
""We'll continue to use diplomatic and economic tools at our disposal to promote accountability for those who support the Ortega regime’s human rights abuses and attacks on Nicaraguan democracy,"" the State Department official said.
“We do have sanctions tools. We are working with international partners, as well to work in multilateral fora, in ways that uphold our values, and we'll continue to do so,” the official added.
Both officials declined to identify possible sanctions targets or provide the timing for new measures. The U.S. official said, however, that the next round could include not only people but also security force units or government-controlled companies linked to the crackdown.
The European Union has matched some U.S. sanctions but it is unclear how far the EU and regional governments are prepared to go to pressure Ortega. He has steadily tightened his grip on the Central American nation he has dominated since returning to power 15 years ago.
SANCTIONS AGAINST ORTEGA?
Still uncertain is whether the U.S. administration is considering directly targeting Ortega, a former Marxist guerrilla leader. Murillo, considered by U.S. officials to be a major powerbroker, is already under sanctions.
The Biden administration spearheaded a resolution last week by the Organization of American States that expressed “alarm” over the Nicaraguan government's actions.
Since June alone, Ortega's government has arrested dozens of opposition politicians, including presidential hopefuls, suspended a rival party and also cracked down on media critical of his rule. 
Washington is also looking for ways to squeeze Ortega’s government financially.
U.S. officials have warned that Nicaragua's membership in the CAFTA-DR regional trade agreement, which gives preferential treatment to Central American exports to the United States, could be in jeopardy if Ortega rigs the elections in his favor.
The State Department official confirmed that a review was already under way. “We’re continuing to review their participation in any U.S.-sponsored assistance program,” the official said.
The official acknowledged, however, that the administration was discussing potential legal obstacles to any suspension of Nicaragua from the trade pact, which some experts have suggested could complicate any action.

One person familiar with the matter said there were also concerns within the administration that Nicaragua’s removal could hit its struggling economy hard enough to worsen Nicaraguans' humanitarian plight, spurring further migration toward the U.S.-Mexico border. 
About half of Nicaragua's exports go to the United States, with duties kept low under CAFTA-DR.

BEIRUT (Reuters) -The U.S. Treasury has imposed sanctions on two top Lebanese contractors and a lawmaker close to the Hezbollah movement over alleged large-scale corruption that undermined the rule of law in Lebanon.
Businessmen Jihad al-Arab and Dany Khoury, close to former Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri and Christian politician Gebran Bassil respectively, were sanctioned on Thursday for alleged corruption related to state contracts.
Lawmaker Jamil Sayyed was sanctioned for allegedly seeking to ""skirt domestic banking policies and regulations"" and transfer $120 million abroad, ""presumably to enrich himself and his associates,"" a Treasury statement said.
The allegations come amid an unprecedented economic crisis in Lebanon blamed on years of bad policies and corruption by the ruling elite that the United Nations says has left three-quarters of the population affected by poverty.
Sayyed did not directly deny allegations he had skirted banking regulations with a $120 million transfer during Lebanon's economic crisis aided by a senior government official, but called for evidence to be released.
""I'm not defending myself, you have a responsibility to present to us these details,"" he told a news conference on Friday, adding that the U.S. Treasury had not provided any paper evidence for bank transfers. 
Sayyed, an outspoken MP close to Hezbollah who formerly headed the country's top intelligence agency, is seen as a potential successor to Parliament speaker Nabih Berri, who has held the post for 29 years.
STATE CONTRACTS
The Treasury alleged that Khoury and Arab both received state contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars, including for garbage collection and disposal work, thanks to political connections.
Khoury did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and Arab could not be reached. 
Bassil denied allegations by the Treasury that Khoury had benefited from his personal relationship with him.
""He is not my partner in politics, nor am I a partner in business,"" Bassil said in a tweet.
Khoury had won a contract worth $142 million to operate a coastal landfill and has been ""accused of dumping toxic waste and refuse into the Mediterranean Sea... all while failing to remedy the garbage crisis,"" according to the Treasury statement. 
Al Arab meanwhile ""served as an intermediary as of 2014 to broker a meeting between top Lebanese officials in advance of the Lebanese presidential election, in exchange for two government contracts valued at approximately $200 million.""
Thursday's sanctions marked the first time that the United States has imposed sanction on a close associate of Hariri, a pro-Western figure, having previously focused on Iran-backed Hezbollah and its allies. 
""The Americans are sending a message to the entire political class, not just those backed by Iran, and also to the Lebanese people that they haven’t walked away,"" Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, told Reuters. 
In 2020, Washington imposed sanctions on Bassil along with former finance minister Ali Hasan Khalil and former public works minister Youssef Fenianos, alleging corruption and material support for Hezbollah.

Thursday's sanctions ""also include concrete allegations on Sayyed’s money transfer after the revolution. This is new and has an impact on Hezbollah’s reputation,"" said Mohanad Hage Ali, a research fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center.
In a tweet, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken characterized the new sanctions as ""an important step in promoting accountability in Lebanon.""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Each morning, Adulwitch Tangsupmanee brings a cart of crispy pork belly to a run-down cinema in Bangkok's Chinatown and sets up the same street-food stall his internationally renowned father ran for nearly 50 years before dying of COVID-19 in July.
While aromatic pork broth simmers, Adulwitch carefully places a framed picture of his late father, Chanchai, on top of the stall's window display - adorned with  Michelin  (PA:MICP) guide accolades from 2018 to 2021. 
""I prepared the broth for my father when he was here, and I still do it when he's gone,"" said Adulwitch, 42. ""I feel he's still around."" 
Known to many as ""Elder Brother Ouan"", Chanchai had stood behind that same cart selling ""Guay Jub"" rolled rice noodles soup for decades until he died at age 73. 
He was one of at least seven well-known sidewalk chefs that Bangkok's renowned street-food scene has lost to coronavirus in recent months, according to a Reuters count - the latest blow to the culture of single-dish stalls.
The deaths of Chanchai and his contemporaries left a legacy of rich flavours in the hands of their children, who vow to carry on traditions that over decades propelled Bangkok into a global street-food Mecca. 
As the city is set to reopen to foreign visitors on Monday, Adulwitch hopes customers will again line up for his father's noodle soup, to help him lessen the pangs of loss. 
FUTURE UNCERTAIN
Bangkok's street-food vendors were already under stress before the pandemic, having faced evictions and bans from the city's efforts to ""clean up"" sidewalks in recent years, while more upscale and trendy restaurants sprang up everywhere. 
Serving dishes from ""Yentafo"" pink noodle soup to stewed pork leg on rice, such street cooks - mostly first or second-generation Chinese immigrants - who could support families on the strength of a single dish, were already a dying breed. COVID has only accelerated its demise. 
""The immediate aftermath of this is less choice for the consumer,"" said Chawadee Nualkhair, author of two Thai street food guidebooks. 
""And a further erosion of one of the few truly democratic places left in society, where anyone, regardless of social standing, could be found in line for a bowl of noodles or plate of curry rice."" 
RECIPES AND MEMORIES 
While Chanchai's children did not hesitate taking over his stall, the children of Ladda Saetang initially debated giving up the family's stewed-duck stand after she died in May. 
Ladda, a 66-year-old lady with a kind smile known as ""Grandma Si"", ran a stall just 650 meters (0.4 mile) away from Chanchai's. 
Finally, her daughter Sarisa decided to learn everything about duck stewing to honour her mother's memory.
""I don't want the recipe to disappear,"" said Sarisa, 39. ""This was her whole life."" 
""I'll be overjoyed if customers say our ducks still taste like my mother's,"" said Sarisa. ""Some tell me to not quit, because they can't find food like this anywhere else.""

Adulwitch, also, is determined his father will live on in famed rolled rice noodles. 
""This stall was what my father loved most, and I love him most. I have to keep it going, no matter what,"" he said.

TAIPEI (Reuters) -The top U.S. representative in Taiwan, Sandra Oudkirk, said on Friday that the United States is committed to helping Taiwan defend itself amid heightened tensions between Taipei and Beijing.
Speaking to reporters at her first news conference since assuming her post in July, she described U.S. relations with Taiwan as ""rock-solid"".
""The United States has a commitment to help Taiwan provide for its self-defence,"" said Oudkirk, who heads the American Institute in Taiwan, the de facto U.S. embassy in the absence of formal diplomatic ties.
Her remarks come as tension between Taiwan and China, which has not ruled out taking the democratically ruled island by force, has escalated in recent weeks.
In a statement to Reuters, the Chinese foreign ministry said it is opposed to Oudkirk's comments and urges the United States to be aware of the sensitive nature of the Taiwan issue.
""Don't play with fire, or it will severely impact China-U.S. relations and the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait,"" the statement said.
While the United States, like most countries, has no formal ties with the Chinese-claimed island, it is its most important international backer and main arms supplier. President Joe Biden's administration has moved to restate that support, to the anger of Beijing.
Washington is required by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself but it has long followed a policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" on whether it would intervene militarily to protect Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack.
When asked if the United States would come to Taiwan's defence if China attacked, Oudkirk said the policy towards Taiwan has been clear and remains unchanged, citing several U.S. laws governing its relations with Taiwan.
A recent increase in https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-says-military-drills-near-taiwan-just-move-2021-10-13 Chinese military exercises in Taiwan's air defence identification zone are part of what Taipei views as stepped up military harassment by Beijing.
Taiwan Defence Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng said earlier this month that military tensions with China are at their worst in more than 40 years.
In an interview with CNN that aired Thursday, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen confirmed that a small number of U.S. forces are in Taiwan to train Taiwanese soldiers.
When asked for more details on the presence of U.S. forces on the island, Oudkirk declined to comment on specific operations or training.

""We engage with our partners in Taiwan on a routine basis to assess vulnerabilities, to assess ways we can support Taiwan in mounting its own self-defence,"" she said.
The U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday urged https://www.reuters.com/world/blinken-urges-all-un-member-states-support-taiwan-participation-2021-10-26 all United Nations member states to support Taiwan's ""robust"" participation in the U.N. system.

(Reuters) - Felicia Moore, Atlanta's city council president, vows to hire 250 police officers to help combat her city's rising crime rate if she is elected mayor next week. Her most prominent Democratic rival, former Mayor Kasim Reed, wants to go even further, putting 750 more officers on the streets.
Public safety is at the forefront in dozens of major U.S. cities poised to elect mayors on Tuesday. However, a year after ""defund the police"" became a rallying cry at protests against racism and police brutality, Democratic candidates from Atlanta to Minneapolis are eschewing proposals to reduce police funding even as they emphasize the need for reform. 
With most urban areas deeply Democratic, the campaigns provide a preview of how Democrats may seek to bridge the gaps between liberals who support policing overhauls and moderates who worry Republicans will weaponize the issue in next year's congressional elections.
Republicans effectively labeled some Democrats as police ""defunders"" during the 2020 elections, even though most mainstream candidates - including President Joe Biden - never embraced the movement pushed by party progressives.
Democrats want to avoid similar pitfalls in 2021 as crime continues to surge. Last month, the FBI reported murders rose nearly 30% in 2020, while violent crime overall went up for the first time in four years.
That trend has not abated in cities like Atlanta, where homicides have risen more than 60% since 2019.
A Pew Research Center poll released this week found 47% of Americans want to see police spending increase, up from 31% in June 2020. Only 15% said funding should be reduced, down from 25% last year.
Polls show Black voters - who are more likely to be victims of crime and live in neighborhoods with high crime rates - are particularly opposed to cutting funding.
""Communities that tend to be Black and brown, that tend to be less affluent, actually want police,"" said Tammy Greer, a political science professor at Clark Atlanta University. ""The pendulum was always going to shift back.""
An early signal came in New York, where former police officer Eric Adams won the Democratic mayoral nomination in June over several progressive rivals after positioning himself as a moderate who favored more aggressive policing.
Even candidates who still support redirecting funds from policing to other priorities, such as public housing and social work, have curbed their language to avoid alienating residents fearful for their safety.
In Buffalo, New York, India Walton joined protesters last year as they chanted anti-police slogans after a city officer was videotaped shoving a 75-year-old man to the ground.
But as a mayoral candidate, Walton has eschewed ""defund"" language and vowed not to lay off a single officer, even as she calls for cutting $7.5 million from the police budget as well as reforms such as relying on civilian personnel to handle mental health calls.
""In her capacity as an activist, during the uprisings last summer, she was really speaking from a place of resistance to injustice,"" campaign spokesperson Jesse Myerson said. ""Obviously, that's a very different posture than the sort of cooler-headed, more intellectually studied posture of a candidate for office.""
This summer, Walton, a democratic socialist, pulled off a shocking upset in the Democratic primary, beating four-term incumbent Byron Brown. Brown, who has since mounted a write-in campaign, has in ads accused Walton of wanting to ""defund"" the police.
BACKLASH TO 'DEFUND' MOVEMENT
In Boston, Annissa Essaibi George, a city council member running for mayor, has similarly attacked the race's leading candidate, Michelle Wu, as planning to ""defund"" the police. Wu rejects the charge as false.
Wu was among several council members who called for a 10% cut to the police budget last year. Her mayoral campaign, however, has not promoted a specific figure, instead pushing changes such as using civilians to respond to emergency calls for mentally disturbed or homeless people.
""Michelle has always said that we need to invest more in the intersection of public health and public safety,"" said campaign spokesperson Sarah Anders. ""Michelle thinks that it's less about pinpointing any one number and more about the reforms that we need.""
In Seattle, one of the country's most liberal cities, mayoral candidate and city council President Lorena Gonzalez supported calls last year to halve the police budget and invest the money in social programs.
Polls show her trailing Bruce Harrell, a former council president and fellow Democrat who has advocated hiring more officers alongside a number of police reforms.
""If this is a year ago, in the face of a dramatic few months in mid-2020, I think this would be a very different story,"" said Zachary Wood, a public affairs professor at Seattle University.
In Minneapolis, where George Floyd's murder by a white police officer prompted last year's widespread demonstrations, voters will decide whether to approve a ballot measure replacing the police department with a new public safety agency.
Mayor Jacob Frey, who is seeking reelection, opposes the proposal. He says the city needs to hire more police to replenish an under-staffed department.
""I have never supported defunding or abolishing the police,"" he said at a debate this week.
All of the leading candidates in Atlanta's mayoral race support more officers to combat crime, while also calling for reforms to ensure racial equity.
Moore, who like Reed is a Democrat in the nonpartisan race, backs the creation of civilian first responders to handle non-violent emergency calls, among other reforms. But the city also needs enough officers to keep neighborhoods safe, she said.
""Defunding the police doesn't get us anywhere,"" she said.

The race has disappointed left-wing activists like Kelsea Bond, co-chair of the Atlanta chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America.
""There really was this glimmer of hope last year,"" Bond said. ""The city has only expanded policing and incarceration since last year, and a lot of it has been backlash to the 'defund the police' movement.""

BADUNG, Bali (Reuters) - An American woman jailed in 2015 with her boyfriend for murdering her mother and stuffing the remains in a suitcase on the Indonesian island of Bali was released from prison on Friday after serving a chunk of her 10-year sentence.
Swarmed by reporters, Heather Mack left Bali's Kerobokan prison early on Friday. She did not say anything. Her lawyer, Yulius Benyamin Seran, who was not seen with Mack, declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
Arrested in 2014 in a case that captured global attention due to its grisly nature, Tommy Schaefer was sentenced to 18 years for premeditated murder, while Mack received a 10-year sentence for being an accessory to murder. 
Kerobokan prison chief for women inmates Lili said on Friday that Mack was given a 34-month remission. She said Mack was religious and participated in fashion and dance activities in prison.
Lawyer Yulius told AFP in August that Mack would be deported back to the U.S. upon her release.
Mack and Schaefer's case was investigated by Indonesian authorities for four months, along with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.
In 2015, Schaefer, then 21, said in court he had killed Sheila von Wiese-Mack in self-defence in the St. Regis (NYSE:RGS) Hotel in Bali after she attacked him in anger because she objected to the couple's relationship.
Mack was 19 at the time of sentencing in 2015.

Von Wiese-Mack's body was found at the hotel with bruises on her arms and broken fingers. Evidence submitted to court included CCTV footage showing Schaefer and Heather Mack speaking to a taxi driver after dropping the bloodied suitcase.
Mack and her mother had a troubled relationship and von Wiese-Mack had frequently reported that her daughter punched and bit her, according to police reports cited by Chicago media.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and prime minister Fumio Kishida are likely to take a bruising at the weekend's lower house election, though the coalition government should safely retain power, opinion polls on Friday showed. 
The Sunday election is set to be a test for the LDP, whose image was battered by its perceived mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic, and hanging on to its single-party majority in the powerful lower house could be difficult, the polls suggested. 
Kishida became prime minister earlier this month and governed for a bit over a week before dissolving the chamber, hoping to catch the opposition on the back foot with an earlier-than-expected poll and take advantage of the ""honeymoon"" period usually granted to new governments.
But some analysts believe the move may do nothing for Kishida himself, whose bland image has failed to inspire voters, and say he risks being replaced if there a substantial loss of seats for the LDP with an upper house election looming next year. A loss of 30 seats or more could leave Kishida in trouble. 
""Recently elections have been about personalities, a certain 'face,' but right now neither the coalition nor the opposition really has that,"" said Atsuo Ito, a political commentator.
""Moreover, elections like this are usually a judgement on the government that's been in power, but Kishida's government had really only been in for around 10 days by the time parliament was dissolved, and you can't really vote on that,"" he added.
""I think a lot of voters are puzzled and turnout may fall.""
Turnout is crucial, with high numbers tending to favour the opposition, but polls suggest turnout may be only slightly higher than the postwar record low of 52.66% in 2014.
The second lowest post-war turnout was in the 2017 lower house election, at 54%. Youth turnout was particularly low, with only three out of every 10 people in the 20-24 age bracket casting votes - something activists and others are trying to change. 
SHRINKING MAJORITY
Kishida has set a coalition target for a majority 233 seats in the 465-seat lower chamber, well below the 276 seats held by the LDP alone before the lower house was dissolved.
Both the Nikkei and Yomiuri Shimbun dailies published polls on Friday showing the LDP may be hard pressed to hold 233 seats but its junior coalition partner, Komeito, should help the coalition maintain an overall majority.
The leading opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan is likely to pick up some extra seats, the Nikkei said, estimating that around 40% of races in single seat districts were expected to be closely fought.
An alliance of opposition parties has made things harder for the LDP, and the question is not if they will lose seats, but how many, Ito and others say. 
""In districts where the opposition is cooperating, the LDP is fighting pretty hard,"" said Airo Hino, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University.
""They're neck-and-neck in a number of the single seat districts.""
The shortness of the campaign period also means less time for voters to critically examine, and ask questions, about the coalition's governance over the last few years, said Kensuke Takayasu, at the Seikei University Faculty of Law.

""This general election could have been a chance to review the government's responses not only to the pandemic but to foreign policy, gender policy, its fiscal and monetary policy, social policy, family policy .... for the last eight or nine years,"" he told a news conference. 
""Yet unfortunately it seems we're going to miss this very significant opportunity.""

OKINAWA, Japan (Reuters) - Aiko Shimajiri fist-bumps supporters as she walks into a rally at a bullring in Okinawa's gritty Uruma city, the former minister in Japan's ruling party relishing the prospect of pulling off an upset victory in this weekend's vote.
Nationwide, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is expected to lose seats in Sunday's lower house election due largely to voter dissatisfaction over the handling of the coronavirus pandemic. 
But in the far southern prefecture of Okinawa - long a bastion of the pacifist opposition - the LDP's harder line on China and proactive security policy is helping it win over younger voters.
""If we don't have U.S. forces and our Self-Defense Forces (SDF) here, we can be attacked by China,"" said electrician Takuji Ikemiya, 41, at the rally. ""We think differently from the older generation that has experienced the war and its aftermath.""
Elderly voters are mostly sticking with left-wing parties, mindful of Okinawa's past as one of the bloodiest battlegrounds of World War Two, and opposing the U.S. military bases which house 50,000 people and take up a fifth of the main island.
The LDP has called for an unprecedented doubling in defence spending, largely in response to China's aggressive military posture on Taiwan, only 110km (68 miles) from the westernmost isle in this strategic archipelago fringing the East China Sea.
The LDP will not reverse its projected losses on this issue alone, experts say. But the fact that the party is on the cusp of making gains in Okinawa shows how concerns over China are helping the LDP win a longer game with the electorate.
The LDP's internal polling data show support for one of its Okinawa candidates at around 40% among people in their 30s and 40s. It stands at only 25% among those over 60, with close to half of that cohort backing a communist party opponent.
The opposition's ""All Okinawa"" movement, which has dominated local politics with its anti-base message, has been losing steam: A candidate backed by the ruling bloc won mayoral race in Uruma in April, and a powerful corporate sponsor switched sides to the LDP last month.
""All Okinawa"" holds three out of four Okinawa districts but polls show the LDP, which holds the remaining seat, could snatch one more if Shimajiri converts a tight battle into a win.
""My parents support 'All Okinawa' because of their anti-base position, but I grew up with American bases and I take them for granted,"" said Kazuhisa Higa, 33, a construction company worker who will vote LDP.
NATIONALIST MESSAGE
The Okinawa trend captures a broader shift started about a decade ago by ex-premier Shinzo Abe, who galvanised younger voters with his nationalist message, said Yoichiro Sato, international relations professor at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University.
""Abe lowered the voting age to 18 knowing that the agenda he was promoting would attract younger voters. Conservative agenda, defence was one of those, but also nationalism,"" said Sato, adding that Abe's economic programme was also popular.
Under Abe, Japan introduced laws allowing its troops to fight on foreign soil, ended a ban on military exports and reinterpreted the country's war-renouncing constitution to allow missile strikes on enemy territory.
A poll in the Mainichi daily last week showed the trend holding up across Japan, with 40% of those under 40 backing the LDP, compared to 10% for the largest opposition party.
To be sure, top of mind for voters is economic recovery from the pandemic. The view that the LDP is more capable and can get more done in Okinawa - one of the country's poorest regions - is also a major driver of youth support for the party.
""It is not like young people are forgetting their identity as Okinawans. But if there're no jobs here, then you won't be able to live here anyway, right?"" said Hiroto Higa, 34, who was elected as a local LDP lawmaker in July.
But 500 km (310 miles) southwest of Okinawa island, on the small island of Yonaguni, from where Taiwanese mountains are visible a few times a year, the China threat is more palpable.
During the 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis, Chinese missiles landed close to the island, threatening Japanese and Taiwanese fishing boats, said 64-year-old fisherman Hirotoshi Ogimi.
""At that time, Taiwanese fishing boats entered the fishing grounds near Yonaguni to avoid pressure from China,"" he said.
Two decades later, to Beijing's chagrin, Japan opened a radar station on the island to gather intelligence on China.

The result is a place of surreal contrasts, where wild horses roam and huge military radar towers loom in the background. Some 1,700 villagers live on the island, including 240 SDF members and their families.
Some in the island chain complain that bases make them a potential target. Others, like Mariko Nishiyama, 36, who runs a horse ranch on Yonaguni, said she used to be afraid of China but, ""now that we have the SDF base, I feel safer in case of a crisis.""

866,"<span>Oct 29, 2021 12:18AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Bloomberg) -- The Group of 20 came into its own during the 2008 financial crisis in order to avoid a global depression. It was a turning point that made clear that big decisions could no longer be taken without the fastest growing economies.
Fast forward to now, and the leaders of the nations that account for 75% of global carbon emissions are again being called to arms to avert another catastrophe — a climate one. The G-20 is meeting in Rome this weekend right before COP26 in Glasgow, the United Nations gathering that aims to set specific goals to wean nations off coal and other noxious substances for good.
This time around, the G-20 risks falling short and a draft communique seen by Bloomberg News shows just how much is still up in the air. For starters, some key players aren’t showing up in person. Last year the entire summit was held virtually due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Climate Talks in Times of Crisis: Your Roadmap to COP26
The push to consign coal to history and achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century looks out of reach. There is a sense that the old establishment represented by the Group of Seven nations tried to impose itself on the likes of China, Russia and India rather than actively engage them.
The mood of mutual suspicion is hard to bridge without the kind of face-to-face contact that can clear the air. The meeting comes as countries grapple with spiraling energy costs and supply-chain shortages, challenges that are reigniting geopolitical tensions between producers and users.
The chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and President Joe Biden’s inability to set climate goals at home have also cast a shadow on U.S. leadership when most needed.
Here is your guide to the complicated considerations of leaders as they attend, or dial in, to the two-day summit starting Oct. 30.
Italy | Mario Draghi, The Host
It’s a bit of awkward for the man who saved the euro and likes to get things done. The reality is that, as the unelected technocratic leader of a smaller developed economy, he’s not in a position to dictate climate terms. Italy itself has yet to make a contribution to the $100 billion fund aimed at helping poorer countries. As the former head of the European Central Bank, Draghi commands respect and is carving a larger role for himself within Europe’s circle of influence — but corralling G-20 holdouts into submission might prove beyond even his abilities. At home he’s focused on restoring order to the economy amid speculation his next career move might be to become head of state. 
U.K. | Boris Johnson, The Convert
In a much-cited 2000 column in the Daily Telegraph, the now Conservative prime minister ridiculed “eco doomsters” with such gusto that more than a few skeptics raised an eyebrow when he took to the United Nations General Assembly recently with an impassioned speech about the need for humanity to face its responsibilities to the planet. Johnson is one of the few politicians who can pull off a U-turn and his unflappable optimism has been key to his political success. But his relationship with the European Union after Brexit remains difficult — with France it’s particularly antagonistic. As host of COP26 he’ll need all his powers of persuasion to force a miraculous shift.Johnson ‘Touch and Go’ If COP26 Climate Summit Will Be a Success
U.S. | Joe Biden, The Letdown
Biden will kick off his European tour with two acts of contrition. On Friday, the devoutly Catholic president will have a private audience with Pope Francis amid pressure from U.S. conservative bishops over his stance on abortion rights. He’ll then pull France’s Emmanuel Macron aside for a chat to repair an alliance bruised by his role in convincing Australia to cancel a submarine contract with Paris to instead pursue a purchase of nuclear-powered ships from the U.S. or the U.K. Biden leaves behind a stalled legislative agenda and faces the disillusionment of many allies whom he had promised “America is back.”

Germany | Angela Merkel, The Departing
It’s a passing-of-the-baton moment from the acting chancellor to her successor, finance minister Olaf Scholz, who will also be attending and whom leaders will want to approach. But as the EU’s longest-serving leader, Merkel is no ordinary lame duck. The G-20 will miss someone known as a “compromise machine.” She remained neutral in the growing U.S.-China standoff and saw the value in staying the course as the main interlocutor with Russian President Vladimir Putin in spite of various provocations. Scholz has no such history of engagement with the Kremlin – and his future coalition partner, the Greens, have been openly hostile to the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline linking Russia and Germany.Merkel Signals Smooth Power Transfer With G-20 Invite to Scholz
France | Emmanuel Macron, The Humbled
The 43-year-old brings swagger to summits. At the G-7 he hosted in 2019, Macron gave Brazil a dressing down over deforestation in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). He courted then-U.S. President Donald Trump and swung his arm around Biden at the G-7 this year in the U.K., only to be stung by the submarine switch betrayal. Ties with the U.K. are at a low and some in Europe are uneasy about Macron’s ambitions to occupy the regional vacuum left by Merkel. The next six months will see him sucked into a re-election campaign against the far-right. The Paris climate agreement was struck in 2015, before Macron came to power. It remains the benchmark, one that Macron will argue must be improved on.France and U.K. Are Fighting Again on Eve of Another Major Summit
Canada | Justin Trudeau, The Conflicted
Trudeau recently won a third term but presides over a minority government, one that made many climate pledges yet can’t wean itself off oil. Just this month his administration invoked a 44-year-old treaty to stop the U.S. from shutting a pipeline. Reconciling his environmental goals with the country’s fundamental reliance on fossil fuels was never easy. But this time around critics will be looking for action, or it will be hard to shake off a sense of hypocrisy that dogs rich countries talking a big green game. 
Saudi Arabia | MBS, The Climate-Oil Strategist
The world’s largest oil exporter surprised many ahead of climate talks by pledging a net zero goal, showing that Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman wants to be part of the global conversation on climate change even as he aims to keep the kingdom’s crude in the energy mix long-term. It’s the latest twist from the royal known as MBS, who has eased back into the limelight. The 2018 murder of critic Jamal Khashoggi (which he denied any role in), a crackdown on domestic political opposition and the Yemen war had strained ties with Western allies. Prince Mohammed is defacto ruler but his father, the Saudi king, could opt to lead the delegation remotely. It's unclear still if the crown prince will attend in person. 
The Telling No-Shows | China and Russia 
It’s hard not to interpret the absence of both Putin and Xi Jinping as a snub in the efforts to reach a new climate deal given their combined clout. Along with the U.S. and India, China and Russia are the worst polluters.
Covid-19 has given both a reason to stay home. Russia’s just imposed the toughest restrictions for months while Xi hasn’t left China in nearly two years. In truth, domestic politics make it imperative for Xi to hang back as he seeks to consolidate power ahead of a Communist Party leadership meeting next year.
Xi Jinping Is Too Busy Lobbying China Elite for a Global Summit
Putin will miss the potential for a second in-person meeting with Biden following their summit in Geneva. The energy crunch has given the Russian leader a lever to seek a reprieve on sanctions by offering to boost supplies to gas-starved Europeans. There are of course, strings attached as he seeks swift approval to begin shipments through the controversial NS2 pipeline that bypasses Ukraine.
Who else is not going? 
Mexico’s Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is sending his foreign minister in lieu while South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa is staying put, keeping a close eye on local elections. The coal-dependent nation uses the fossil fuel to generate most of its electricity and while the government is committed to an energy transition it’s looking for bigger financial help to carry it out.
Japan’s Fumio Kishida will take part virtually as the summit comes during an election where his ruling party is expected to lose seats, but hold on to power with the help of its coalition partner. While his predecessor set the bold target of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, the plan looks shaky because it depends on restarting most of the country’s nuclear reactors, something that frightens a public scarred by the Fukushima disaster a decade ago.
Is anyone else coming? 
Turkey | Recep Tayyip Erdogan
Erdogan has one goal in mind: some alone time with Biden to make his case to buy U.S. warplanes.  He'd wanted to have that conversation in Rome, but he will likely have to wait for COP26. His presence at the G-20 comes amid frictions with the West after Turkey threatened, and then dropped, a call for 10 ambassadors to be expelled from Ankara over their demand a government critic be released. Turkey is also prepping for further military action against U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in Syria. All this will make for uncomfortable conversations. 
Brazil | Jair Bolsonaro
The firebrand former army captain is in a tight spot. At home, his popularity has dived amid criticism of his handling of the pandemic and an inflation spike that has eroded income. He faces critics abroad over the Amazon. Latin America’s biggest economy also faces 2022 elections with polls showing leftist former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in the lead. Bolsonaro is a contradictory figure, presenting himself both as a climate mediator but also ready to pick up a fight. However, the fact he is skipping COP26 doesn’t bode well for the talks.
India | Narendra Modi
Will he or won’t he commit India to a net-zero target? India is one of the worst polluters but wants goals that take into account emissions per capita, a metric that plays in its favor given the tremendous size of its population. Modi will also be looking for tangible evidence that more money will come his way if he’s to commit (so far the signs aren’t encouraging). His other mission is to convince the world that India is open for business even as the full scale of its devastating death toll from Covid may never be known. Under him, Hindu nationalism has gained ground with a rise in religious identity politics that has concerned civil liberty activists.
Argentina | Alberto Fernandez
With midterm elections around the corner and with economic problems piling up, Fernandez will use the G-20 to try to get support for the complex renegotiation the country is undergoing with the International Monetary Fund. Specifically, Fernandez has been seeking other country members to back his proposal to reduce commissions paid for large IMF loans, with the nation owing the Washington-based fund more than $40 billion. A meeting with IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva may take place on the sidelines of the summit.
South Korea | Moon Jae-in
A long-time proponent of reconciliation with North Korea, Moon’s final months in office are all about the elusive goal of permanent peace with the regime. In a visit to the Vatican, he’ll ask the pope to visit Pyongyang with a view to reviving talks with its ever-unpredictable leader Kim Jong Un.
Australia | Scott Morrison
The prime minister finally unveiled a plan for zero carbon emissions by 2050, but that target is not even going to be passed into law, prompting critics to call it “glossy and slick advertising with no substance.” That’s probably because Morrison has his sights on elections next year and needs to assuage voters, particularly those in coal-mining communities, that there will be no threat to rural jobs. Morrison, whom Biden referred to as that “fella Down Under” when announcing the submarine deal, might be more interested in working out the mechanics of that agreement with U.S. and U.K. officials — out of Macron’s earshot, naturally.
Indonesia | Joko Widodo
The leader of Southeast Asia’s largest economy is set to take the reins of the G-20 presidency under the cloud of a stunted national agenda back home as Indonesia recovers from the pandemic. With an ambition of building a brand new green capital in Borneo, he’ll arrive in Italy keen to show support for greening the economy. But a lower-than-expected carbon tax is not a good look, especially when, as the world’s top exporter of thermal coal, Indonesia benefits from sky-high prices.

The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a challenge to the near-total ban on abortion in Texas, while Republican Governor Greg Abbott last month signed into law voting restrictions that critics said will make it harder for Black and Hispanic voters to cast ballots.
The NAACP cited those issues among its concerns in a letter sent to players associations in Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Football League, Women's National Basketball Association, National Basketball Association and National Hockey League. 
""As we watch an incomprehensible assault on basic human rights unfold in Texas, we are simultaneously witnessing a threat to constitutional guarantees for women, children and marginalized communities,"" the NAACP said in the letter.
Abbott's press office could not be reached for comment late on Thursday. 
The governor has previously said the voting law was intended to combat voter fraud. The Texas anti-abortion law, which bans the procedure after six weeks of pregnancy, was hailed as a victory for conservatives, who have long sought to eliminate abortion access in the United States.
NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson said he was calling on athletes to protect ""democratic values"".

""Professional athletes serve as some of our country's greatest role models and we need them to join us to fight for democracy,"" he said. 
Earlier this year, MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred moved the All-Star Game and amateur player draft out of Atlanta in protest over Georgia's new voting restrictions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. traffic deaths soared by 18.4% in the first six months of 2021 from the same period a year earlier, for the most deadly first half on American roads since 2006, the Transportation Department said on Thursday.
Traffic deaths surged after coronavirus lockdowns ended in 2020 as more drivers engaged in unsafe behavior like speeding and driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, regulators said. That made for the largest six-month increase ever recorded in the Fatality Analysis Reporting System's history, which has been in use since 1975.
""This is a crisis,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. ""We cannot and should not accept these fatalities as simply a part of everyday life in America.""
Buttigieg said the department will release a National Roadway Safety Strategy in January with a comprehensive set of actions to reduce serious injuries and deaths.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimated 20,160 people died in car crashes in the first six months of 2021 in the United States, up 3,140 over the same period in 2020. Travel on U.S. roads was up 13% in the first half compared to a year earlier.
One factor in the big jump in 2020 was that drivers who remained on the roads engaged in riskier behavior, NHTSA said. As U.S. roads became less crowded, some motorists perceived police were less likely to issue tickets because of COVID-19, some experts said.
NHTSA released behavioral research findings from March 2020 through June this year that indicated incidents of speeding and traveling without a seatbelt were higher than before the pandemic.

NHTSA said in the three months ending June 30 alone, traffic deaths rose by 23.1%, the highest quarterly increase ever. 
""This nightmare on our roads needs to stop,"" said Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) President Alex Otte. ""Traffic safety enforcement has been cut and we are seeing the horrific consequences. A shortage of officers has resulted in the elimination of DUI task forces in some cities.""

(Reuters) -The U.S. Department of Justice on Thursday said it settled civil cases brought by survivors and families of victims of a massacre in 2015, in which nine Black people were killed at a historic South Carolina church.
The agreement settles more than a dozen claims that blamed the FBI for failing to prevent a gun from being sold to Dylann Roof, the white supremacist who said he wanted to start a “race war” when he opened fire inside the Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in June 2015.
Five survivors will receive $5 million, while the families of those killed in the shooting will each receive between $6 million and $7.5 million, according to a news release.
""The mass shooting at Mother Emanuel AME Church was a horrific hate crime that caused immeasurable suffering for the families of the victims and the survivors,"" U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. ""Since the day of the shooting, the Justice Department has sought to bring justice to the community, first by a successful hate crime prosecution and today by settling civil claims.""

Families and survivors argued in lawsuits that the FBI's background check system did not flag that Roof was banned from having a firearm before he purchased a handgun that was used in the mass shooting.
In December 2016, a jury found Roof guilty of 33 federal charges for the mass shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, whose congregation dates back two centuries. The same jury sentenced him to death in January 2017.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed Elizabeth Prelogar to serve as U.S. solicitor general, approving President Joe Biden's pick to be his chief advocate before the U.S. Supreme Court just days before it hears two major abortion and gun rights cases.
The Senate voted 53-36 to approve Prelogar, a former member of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation team who then served as acting solicitor general from the time of Biden's inauguration in January until her nomination in August.
Due to a legal quirk, Prelogar was required to step down from that acting position while her nomination was pending and has been working since then in the U.S. Justice Department's office of legal counsel.
Her confirmation comes ahead of the conservative-dominated Supreme Court on Monday hearing a challenge to a Texas law that imposes a near-total ban on abortions and a closely-watched gun rights case on Wednesday.
During a September hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Republicans pressed Prelogar on how the solicitor general's office under Biden reversed the government's position in several cases from former President Donald Trump's era.
U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the panel's ranking Republican, cited those ""flip flops"" earlier this month in saying he opposed her nomination.
The Harvard Law School graduate clerked for liberal Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died in 2020, and Elena Kagan and later served as an assistant to the solicitor general from 2014 to 2019.

A former student of Russian who held a Fulbright fellowship in St. Petersburg, Prelogar while at the Justice Department also worked as an assistant special counsel to Mueller, who led the probe into Russia's role in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
She briefly returned to private practice and joined the law firm Cooley in January 2020 before returning to the Justice Department following Biden's election.

LE HAVRE, France (Reuters) -Britain denounced France's seizure of a British boat in French waters and warned Paris against further retaliation on Thursday, in a rapidly deteriorating row over post-Brexit fishing rights.
The Cornelis Gert Jan, a scallop dredger, was escorted to the northern port of Le Havre overnight after its crew failed to prove it was allowed to fish in French territorial waters, French Seas Minister Annick Girardin said.
A second British vessel was given a verbal warning.
The action signalled France's determination not to back down in the row, a day after listing potential sanctions https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/brexit-france-readying-sanctions-if-uk-withholds-fishing-licences-2021-10-27 against Britain if there is no progress in talks. 
They include extra customs checks on British goods from Nov. 2 and what was widely seen in London as a threat to cut electricity exports to Britain if talks fail.
""It's not war, but it is a fight,"" Girardin told RTL radio.
Britain's foreign minister, Liz Truss, responded by ordering France's ambassador to London to explain on Friday the ""disappointing and disproportionate threats made against the UK and Channel Islands.""
British fishing grounds are among the richest in the North East Atlantic where most of the European Union's catch is hauled in. France's actions appear to be a warning shot to put pressure on Britain to compromise at talks with the EU.
British environment minister George Eustice challenged France's statement that the boat had no licence. He told parliament France's threatened steps appeared to be incompatible with a post-Brexit free-trade agreement and international law.
""...if carried through, (they) will be met with an appropriate and calibrated response,"" he said.
France says Britain has refused to grant its fishermen the full number of licences to operate in British waters that France says is warranted. Britain says it is issuing licences to vessels that meet its criteria.
""So now we need to speak the language of strength since that seems to be the only thing this British government understands,"" European Affairs Minister Clement Beaune told CNews television channel.
Girardin made clear France could not cut off electricity supplies to Britain as a retaliatory measure but said it could raise tariffs. Britain was importing about 6% of its electricity supply from France on Thursday, data showed.
Jersey, a self-governing British Crown Dependency 14 miles off the French coast, said it was ""extremely disappointed"" at France's announcement as Jersey officials had met officials from France, the UK and the European Commission on Wednesday.
""The outcome of that meeting was that 162 French vessels will be licensed to fish in Jersey's territorial waters from this Friday"", Jersey's government said.
VESSEL IMPOUNDED 
Extra customs checks on goods travelling between Britain and the rest of Europe could disrupt trade flows before Christmas. 
The EU's executive body said it would continue talks with Britain and France in the coming days. 
The Cornelis Gert Jan's skipper is under preliminary investigation for dredging 2,160 kg (4,762 lb) of scallops and could face a 75,000-euro ($87,500 fine). Its owners said the vessel had a fishing licence and had been fishing legally.
""We are a pawn of bigger forces here. This is to do with licences and the beef that the French have with the licences of French vessels,"" Andrew Brown, a director of Macduff Shellfish, told Reuters.
Barrie Deas, head of Britain's National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, said France appeared determined to escalate the licence row before a presidential election, with President Emmanuel Macron expected to seek a new term in April.
In a sign Britain might offer more licences, Bruno Margolle, head of the Boulogne fishermen's collective, said 15 of the 37 licence requests from his region previously shown as rejected had passed to 'under consideration' since the boat was held. 
Senior British, French and EU officials have signalled they do not want the dispute to escalate, but Macron and Johnson are under pressure from vocal fishing lobbies. 
Britain's Brexit minister, David Frost, chaired a ministerial meeting on Thursday to consider a response to France's measures, a British government spokesman said.
The industry makes a small contribution to the French and British economies but is a lifeline for some coastal communities. 
In Le Havre, scallop fishermen said they were fed up with British vessels enjoying what they called unfair access to shellfish in French waters. 

""There has to be an end to this fraud,"" Pascal Coquet, president of the National Scallop Fishermen's Committee, said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -The Russian capital brought in its strictest COVID-19 related lockdown measures in more than a year on Thursday as nationwide one-day pandemic deaths and infections hit new highs amid slow vaccination take-up across the world's biggest country. 
Moscow's partial lockdown, in which only essential shops like pharmacies and supermarkets are allowed to remain open and schools and state kindergartens are shut, comes ahead of a week-long nationwide workplace shutdown from Oct. 30. 
Like Moscow, some regions decided to kick off their partial lockdowns on Thursday or even earlier in an effort to cut infection numbers ahead of the nationwide initiative. 
Moscow's residents are allowed to leave their homes unlike a sweeping lockdown in summer 2020, but the new measures point to rising concern among officials over record numbers of deaths that the Kremlin has blamed on vaccine hesitancy.
Officials on Thursday reported an all-time high of 1,159 COVID-19 nationwide deaths in the past 24 hours, while the number of daily infections broke through the 40,000 barrier for the first time. 
At the State Duma lower house of parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker, proposed requiring all lawmakers to get vaccinated and suggested that stragglers should have to work remotely. 
""Imagine the consequences for the country if parliament stops working,"" Volodin told the lower house. ""Every day we're seeing how our ... colleagues are ending up in hospital beds,"" he said. 
His proposal was met by angry shouts from the parliament's chamber with someone calling out: ""What kind of PR is this?""
Many Russians have said they are reluctant to get vaccinated and have spurned the four vaccines Russia has registered, including the flagship Sputnik V vaccine. 
Some people say they are hesitant due to mistrust of the authorities, while others cite concerns about the safety of vaccines.
As of Oct. 22, official data showed that 49.1 million Russians were fully vaccinated. The total population, excluding annexed Crimea, is officially estimated at around 144 million. 
AD CAMPAIGN RELAUNCH? 
The daily Kommersant newspaper reported on Thursday that the Kremlin planned to revamp the troubled public information campaign about the importance of getting vaccinated. 
The new campaign would pay closer attention to Russia's more than 80 regions and strike a less aggressive and negative tone than previously, the report said. 
The existing campaign has often highlighted the risk of death for Russians who decline to get vaccinated rather than linking vaccination to the freedom to be exempt from lockdown-style restrictions, it said. 
However, the Kremlin denied it planned to relaunch the ad campaign, but said the strategy was constantly being adjusted and that the campaign would be continued. 
Many Russians have decided that now is an ideal time to fly off for a foreign beach holiday instead of hunkering down at home. 
There were mixed feelings about the lockdown on the streets of Moscow on Thursday. Some residents like Lyubov Machekhina said they thought it would obviously help slow infections. 

But others like Mikhail, a Muscovite who did not give his surname, voiced doubts that there would be any real impact without a larger chunk of the population being vaccinated. 
""In my opinion, it will change nothing. Perhaps, it will slow down (the spread of cases) a bit, but in fact, without herd immunity - it's nonsense. I don't believe it will work.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) said Thursday it has recently ramped up proposed fines for travelers failing to wear masks at airports and in other transit modes.
The TSA said it has proposed $85,990 fines for 190 mask violators through Monday after more than 5,000 reported incidents since February 2 and issued warnings to more than 2,200.
On Monday, two U.S. lawmakers in the House of Representatives disclosed had issued just $2,350 in total fines to 10 passengers through mid-September, despite thousands of reports of airport travelers failing to comply.
House Homeland Security Committee chairman Bennie Thompson and Bonnie Watson Coleman, who chairs the House transportation subcommittee, said despite 4,102 reports of mask-related incidents TSA had issued just 10 fines through Sept. 13.
""We urge you to implement these enhanced penalties to curb the rising number of mask-related disruptive passenger incidents,"" the lawmakers wrote.
The TSA said Thursday it has ""taken steps to make enforcement and compliance more meaningful, including by increasing the penalties, reducing the processing time from receipt of incident reports to the issuance of enforcement actions and frequent and routine interaction with air carriers to improve incident reporting.""
The agency also said almost 200 people have faced criminal penalties. TSA Administrator David Pekoske in July said since the start of the pandemic there have been over 85 physical assaults on TSA officers.
In August, the TSA extended mask requirements on airplanes, trains and buses and at airports and train stations through Jan. 18 to address COVID-19 risks.
The requirements, first imposed in early February, have been the source of some friction, especially aboard U.S. airlines, where some travelers have refused to wear masks.

The Federal Aviation Administration, which has instituted a ""zero tolerance"" enforcement effort on unruly passengers, through Monday has received 4,941 unruly passenger reports - including 3,580 mask-related incidents.
Last month, the TSA said it was doubling penalties for violating the transportation mask mandate: $500-$1000 for first offenders and $1000-$3000 for second offenders.

(Reuters) - One potential juror sometimes enjoyed a Southern-style oyster roast and game of cards with the victim's father. Another said her stepfather goes fly-fishing with two of the defendants. Others said they had seen the victim jogging around town or lifting weights in a neighbor's driveway.
As jury selection drags into its second week in the trial of three white men charged with murdering Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man who went for a run in a mostly white neighborhood, one difficulty of prosecuting a major case in a small town is becoming clear: everyone seems to know everybody in Georgia's Glynn County.
Judge Timothy Walmsley, prosecutors and the defense lawyers are trying to seat 12 jurors and four alternates who can weigh evidence without being swayed by bias in the trial at Glynn County Superior Court in Brunswick (NYSE:BC), a coastal city home to just 16,000 people.
Jury summonses went out to 1,000 people across Glynn County, population 85,000, about two-thirds white. Dozens of potential jurors have been questioned since the trial began on Oct. 18, identified only by numbers after the judge promised anonymity. 
None of the 12 potential jurors questioned in court on the first day appeared to be acquainted with any of the parties, but the issue quickly became apparent soon after. 
A woman who works in a hospital told the court her husband and father-in-law know William ""Roddie"" Bryan, one of the three defendants facing charges that include murder, aggravated assault and false imprisonment.
Bryan helped give chase to Arbery down a road in the suburb of Satilla Shores in February 2020 and used his cellphone to film the encounter in which Arbery was cornered and then shot to death.
Another potential juror said he knew Gregory McMichael, Bryan's neighbor, who led the chase in a pick-up truck with his son, Travis McMichael, in what they say was an attempt to make a citizen's arrest.
""He's a friend of my father's and he's been over to our house multiple times,"" the man told the court, one of at least 20 potential jurors by Reuters' count who have said they met or know either Arbery or the defendants.
Some potential jurors with especially close ties to a party have been dismissed. One was a woman who said she was third cousins with Arbery and grew up in the same house as his father, Marcus Arbery.
Another was a young man who recently moved to Brunswick and became close friends with Arbery after they met at a bar on one of the beach-lined islands nearby a few months before the shooting. 
Some of the others with weaker ties have not yet been dismissed as the court tries to build a pool of 64 pre-screened people it intends to whittle down to the seated jury.
'EVERYONE KNOWS EVERYONE' 
A retired mechanic said he had met Travis McMichael, who confronted Arbery with a shotgun before fatally shooting him, because they were both in the same hunting club. The man also said he had known Bryan for about 20 years through Bryan's work repairing small engines.
He said he was not close friends with either but pleaded, unsuccessfully, to be excused, saying it was too difficult for him to be impartial.
The web of relationships that has emerged underscores how tricky jury selection can be in small communities, said Annie C. Deets, a law professor at Emory University in Atlanta, who has previously been involved in picking jurors in small Georgia towns and cities both as a prosecutor and a defense attorney.
""Everyone knows everyone,"" she said in an interview.
Knowing someone does not necessarily disqualify them from a jury, but it can be a big strike against them, she said.
One middle-aged man said he was friendly with Arbery's mother and that Arbery's father, who runs a landscaping business, had mowed his lawn about six months ago. Both parents have often been present for jury selection, the mother sometimes in tears. 

One woman did not indicate that she knew any of the parties in questioning on Wednesday, but told the court about her husband's job servicing equipment in the local 911 call center. A prosecutor asked: Did he ever share conversations he had with 911 operators?
""Don't take this wrong,"" she replied, ""but this is a small town and people talk.""

(Reuters) - One of those fatally shot by Kyle Rittenhouse threw a plastic shopping bag containing socks and a deodorant stick at him before appearing to try and grab his rifle. Another struck the teenager with a skateboard. The third person shot was brandishing a handgun when Rittenhouse fired his final round.
    Rittenhouse, 18, has been charged with killing two men and wounding a third during demonstrations in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Aug. 25, 2020. The protests were sparked by the shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, by a white police officer a few days earlier. Blake was left paralyzed from the waist down.   
    As Rittenhouse prepares for trial next week, the chaotic circumstances surrounding the shootings present a formidable challenge for prosecutors, who will seek to portray the teenager as a vigilante killer, legal experts said. 
Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time of the shootings, has pleaded not guilty and is considering taking the stand to offer a firsthand account of his self-defense claims, two people familiar with the matter said.
    ""If you asked me would I rather be the prosecutor or the defense attorney right now, I would rather be the defense attorney,"" said Tom Grieve, a criminal defense lawyer in Milwaukee and former prosecutor. Absent surprise evidence emerging at trial, he added, ""This is a strong case for the defense.""
The trial, which kicks off on Monday with jury selection, is arguably the highest-profile test of a civilian's right to self-defense since George Zimmerman was acquitted in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Black teenager, in 2013.
The judge overseeing the trial has vowed to prevent it from becoming political, even as debates over race, guns and policing have raged online in connection with the case.
Rittenhouse, who is white, has emerged as a cause celebre for many conservatives in the perennial battle over gun rights in the United States. He was also viewed by some on the right as a timely counterpoint to the sometimes violent protests against police brutality that rocked large U.S. cities last year. Days after the shootings then-President Donald Trump suggested Rittenhouse had acted in self-defense.
Under Wisconsin law, a person can only use deadly force if he or she ""reasonably believes"" it necessary to prevent someone from killing or causing great bodily harm to them. 
    Deciding what is reasonable will be up to a jury of 12 people from Kenosha County, a mix of urban, suburban and rural areas west of Lake Michigan that Trump narrowly won last year. 
How sympathetic the jury is to Rittenhouse may shake out along partisan lines, with a right-leaning juror more likely to believe he had a right to defend himself and a more liberal juror more apt to fault him for going out that night armed, said Marquette University Law School Professor Michael O'Hear. 
DEFENSE 
With ample bystander and surveillance video available as evidence, there is little dispute over what transpired and the two sides are mainly fighting over how to interpret the facts.
Rittenhouse, a resident of nearby Antioch, Illinois, is facing seven charges, including homicide in the fatal shootings of Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and attempted homicide for wounding Gaige Grosskreutz, 27.
Prosecutors are expected to argue that Rittenhouse, who was armed with a military-style semi-automatic rifle and says he was in Kenosha to help protect a business, was looking for violent conflict.
The defense will likely try and portray the men he shot as bad actors involved in lawless behavior that night, giving him reason to fear for his safety.
But prosecutors will likely say Rittenhouse reacted with disproportionate force, regardless of whether the three men were involved in any wrongdoing prior to their encounters with him. 
""Their behavior that night has nothing to do with this case, unless it was witnessed by the defendant,"" Kenosha County Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger said in a hearing this week. ""His state of mind is the most important thing.""
Video shows Rosenbaum charging at Rittenhouse when he was gunned down. A reporter named Richard McGinnis told police that Rosenbaum, who threw a plastic bag at the defendant but was unarmed, tried to grab the barrel of Rittenhouse's rifle, according to a criminal complaint filed last year. McGinnis is expected to testify at trial.
Rosenbaum's actions could have caused Rittenhouse to fear his own weapon would be used against him, said Benjamin Van Severen, a defense attorney in Milwaukee. He said law enforcement officers are regularly exonerated for shootings when someone has tried to seize their firearm. 
Van Severen said proving that Rosenbaum's death was unlawful was central to the prosecution's entire case given that it appears to have prompted a crowd to start pursuing Rittenhouse, setting the stage for the other shootings.
Prosecutors have said they have FBI surveillance video showing that Rittenhouse followed and confronted Rosenbaum, evidence they could use to try to prove he was the aggressor. 
As Rittenhouse flees the scene of the first shooting, protesters can be heard yelling things like ""Get his ass!"", according to the complaint. Rittenhouse then stumbles and falls to the ground and shoots Huber, a protester who was swinging a skateboard at him, according to video evidence and the complaint. 

Grosskreutz, who was holding a pistol, took a step back and put his hands in the air before then moving toward Rittenhouse, who opened fire again, shooting him in the arm. 
""It's not a slam dunk,"" said Keith Findley, a professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School, referring to the prosecution's case. ""I think they are going to have some challenges.""

BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN (Reuters) -The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) said on Thursday it has agreed with China to upgrade their relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership, a day after reaching a similar deal with Australia.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Hours before Sudan's army seized power and dissolved its government, a senior U.S. envoy warned the country's top general not to take any steps against the civilian administration that was overseeing a democratic transition, diplomats said.
Jeffrey Feltman, President Joe Biden's special envoy for the Horn of Africa, flew into Khartoum two days before Monday's coup, as concerns mounted that the transition was running into trouble due to mounting tension between the generals and civilians.
But instead of heeding the warning, the army did just the opposite, acting on a plan to seize power that two diplomats and three Sudanese official sources said had been developed over the preceding weeks.
The coup brought an abrupt halt to a political transition that began after a popular uprising led to the overthrow of former President Omar al-Bashir in 2019, and was meant to end with elections in late 2023.
After Feltman flew out, uniformed soldiers rounded up the civilian cabinet in pre-dawn raids, before Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan announced the dissolution of the government. 
Until the last moment, the military was hoping to persuade Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok to dismiss his cabinet so they could tighten their grip on the transition without using force while keeping him in office, according to the diplomats and two of Hamdok's aides. Hamdok refused to cooperate.
The decision to ignore warnings from the United States -- which had thrown diplomatic and financial weight behind the transition -- and move forward with what one of the diplomats and Sudanese sources with knowledge of the matter described as a ""plan B"" without Hamdok, reflected the stakes for the army, which analysts say saw growing risks from continued civilian rule.
In his last meeting with Burhan, Feltman ""put Burhan under big pressure not to do anything against the cabinet, to de-escalate"", said one diplomat briefed on the meeting, declining to be identified.
But Burhan was also under pressure from factions in the army and his deputy in the Sovereign Council that had been steering the transition, the powerful head of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), to take a hard line with the civilians, the diplomat said.
""During the meeting they decided to go with Plan B. This was the last chance to get Hamdok to take part,"" he said.
Sudan's military did not respond to calls seeking comment.
The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters about Feltman's meetings in Khartoum.
Feltman received no heads-up about the military intervention, State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters on Monday.
""It is not something that we were apprised of beforehand by anyone, and we would have made very clear of the profound implications that any such move would have,"" he said.
Feltman had urged authorities to agree a date for transferring leadership of the Sovereign Council from Burhan to a civilian and to initiate security sector reform, the State Department said before the coup. 
DERAILING DEMOCRACY
The military has been at the heart of power in Sudan since independence in 1956, staging repeated coups that snuffed out occasional experiments with civilian control.
Bashir, a general, seized power in one such coup in 1989, and ruled for three decades during which Sudan became an international pariah. He hosted Osama bin Laden in the 1990s and fought wars against restive regions, for which he was indicted in the Hague on genocide charges he denies.
After decades of conflict, he allowed the country's mainly non-Arab south to gain independence in 2011. But peace did not bring prosperity. Oil revenue dwindled, economic output per capita cratered, and by 2019, hundreds of thousands of mainly young demonstrators had taken to the streets to demand his removal. It was the army that finally deposed him. 
Under the power sharing deal that followed, the military was due to hand over leadership of the transition to civilian groups in the coming months. But the partnership became increasingly strained by demands for the military to be brought under civilian control, for justice over protester deaths during the uprising, and by the government's agreement to hand Bashir and others to the International Criminal Court.
Feltman's visit followed weeks of escalation and signs of deepening splits, both between civilians and the military and within the army. 
Protests by a tribal group blocked essential imports at the country's main port, Port Sudan.
Matters came to a head after Sept. 21, when authorities said they had thwarted a coup plot attributed to mutinous military factions and Bashir loyalists.
On Oct. 16, rebel groups and parties aligned with the military began a sit-in in Khartoum, calling on the military to dissolve the government. In response, opponents of a military takeover held huge rallies on Oct. 21.
The United Nations special envoy to Sudan, Volker Perthes, said he met with a military leader from the Sovereign Council late on Sunday afternoon and that they discussed a possible U.N.-led dialogue.
""He also indicated that the military might move, of course ... I strongly warned against doing this,"" Perthes told reporters.
Hamdok was still meeting with Burhan at army headquarters at 8 p.m. on Sunday, hours before he was placed under house arrest, said Adam Hereika, Hamdok's chief of staff.
Hamdok refused to dissolve the government without a political process, Hereika told Reuters. ""They were insistent on changing the government and having the government follow their orders,"" he said. 
Burhan told reporters on Tuesday that he had discussed with Feltman political divisions that ""threaten the country's security"", and that he had offered Hamdok several options for resolving the crisis.
RUSSIAN ""GREEN LIGHT""
The United States has responded with condemnation and a decision to freeze $700 million of economic assistance for Sudan.
Washington had swung firmly behind the transition, removing Sudan from its list of states that sponsor terrorism and providing diplomatic support that helped secure billions of dollars worth of debt relief.
Though U.S. ties have been shaken, Burhan can likely still depend on the backing of U.S.-allied Arab states with whom he has developed close relations. These include Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, which were all happy to see the downfall of Bashir, whose Islamism they opposed.
The army may also be looking to build closer ties with Russia: diplomats and analysts say RSF commander General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo has cultivated ties to Moscow.
Ahead of the coup, the military sought and obtained a ""green light"" from Moscow in an effort to protect themselves from any sanctions imposed through the United Nations Security Council, two official Sudanese sources said.
The Kremlin responded to the coup by urging all parties to show restraint and calling on Sudanese to resolve the situation on their own as quickly as possible and without any loss of life. But it did not condemn the takeover. 
The Russian Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its Sudan policy.
Russia already appears to be shielding Sudan's military in a possible Security Council statement. Two diplomats with direct knowledge of negotiations on the text said Russia had suggested the 15-member council express concern at developments in Sudan, rather than condemn the takeover. Negotiations on the text, which has to be agreed by consensus, are ongoing.

Western states that backed the transition will need to re-evaluate how to apply pressure on Sudan, said Jonas Horner of the International Crisis Group. 
""I think it's probably been very chastening for Sudan's Western allies. The military brushed aside what was being held over their heads in the end,"" he said.

879,"<span>Oct 28, 2021 08:37AM ET</span>","BEIJING (Reuters) - A former vice mayor of a Chinese town on the border with Myanmar lamented local lockdowns and disruptions caused by repeated COVID-19 outbreaks and wrote a rare plea for a ""strong"" helping hand from Beijing.
Ruili, in the province of Yunnan, has faced some of the toughest curbs in the country under Beijing's zero-tolerance policy, as a key international transit point for southwest China, following multiple outbreaks since last year.
China's border towns, faced with a higher risk of infection from overseas and many equipped with relatively few resources, have tended to suffer more severe disruptions than richer cities.
""Since this small town has assumed the responsibility for the epidemic prevention and control of the whole country, our motherland should extend a strong hand to protect this tortured child,"" wrote Dai Rongli, vice mayor of Ruili in 2018, on his WeChat account in a rare show of angst over China's COVID curbs.
This remote corner of China has been plagued with reports of asymptomatic carriers in recent days. While not in full lockdown, Ruili does not encourage its more than 200,000 residents to leave town. Those who insist, excluding those planning essential travel, would have to be quarantined for at least seven days before departure. 
""The long-term closure of the town has formed a deadlock in the town's development,"" Dai wrote. ""It's necessary to resume production and trade.""
The Ruili government did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

NORTHEAST CHINA 
In the northeast, a few border cities started to tighten COVID-19 measures as China combats an outbreak hitting mainly the north.
China reported 23 locally transmitted symptomatic cases for Wednesday, official data showed on Thursday, bringing the total number to 270 since Oct. 17, when the current outbreak began. 
Although the tally is tiny compared with infections elsewhere in the world, the spread to more than a dozen provincial areas has forced officials to toughen restrictions, squeezing the service sector, including tourism and catering companies. 
In northeastern Heilongjiang province, which shares a border with Russia, Heihe city detected one local confirmed case on Wednesday. 
The city of 1.3 million demanded the suspension of manufacturing activities and business operations in urban areas, except for essential ones, and cut transport services within those areas as well as outbound routes.

'EXTREME CAUTION' 
China's high vaccination rate should in principle allow it to shift to a less disruptive strategy, said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.
As of Oct. 23, 76% of China's 1.41 billion population had received full doses.
""But extreme caution prevails,"" he said. ""Any shift seems unlikely until at least after the Winter Olympics in February."" 

Jiamusi city, also on the Heilongjiang-Russia border, has yet to report cases in the latest outbreak but has banned individuals arriving from outside from entering the city's tourist sites for seven-days. 
Another two cities in Heilongjiang, Jixi and Mudanjiang, pledged to enter into a ""pre-war"" mode of high vigilance and stringent monitoring, though no local infections have been reported in the past week.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United Nations cannot get enough cash into Afghanistan to deliver humanitarian aid to millions of people on the brink of starvation and is struggling to develop options to help stabilize the collapsing economy, U.N. officials said.
Ultimately political solutions are needed, a senior U.N. official told Reuters on condition of anonymity, an apparent reference to sanctions relief and for governments and institutions to free up billions of dollars of Afghan assets held overseas.
In the meantime U.N. agencies are scrambling to find ways to get large amounts of U.S. dollars into Afghanistan to combat a liquidity crisis that has taken hold since the Taliban ousted the Western-backed government in August. The U.N. official shared with Reuters some of the options being suggested.
The delivery of U.S. dollars to Afghanistan has stopped since the Islamist militants seized power and if countries or international financial institutions don't step up then the United Nations might have to fill the gap, said the official.
One suggested option is using Afghanistan International Bank, which could bring in and store money, but there are issues with insurance, the U.N. official said.
The United Nations is also aware that no one option will work and several avenues to get enough cash into Afghanistan are needed, the official said.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for the International Monetary Fund to agree on waivers or mechanisms to get money into Afghanistan. The IMF has blocked the Taliban from accessing some $440 million in new emergency reserves. 
Much of the Afghan central bank's $10 billion in overseas assets have been frozen as well, most of it in the United States. The U.S. Treasury has said there are no plans to release the money.
""We need to work together to make the economy breathe again and to help people survive,"" Guterres said on Wednesday. ""Injecting liquidity into the Afghan economy can be done without violating international laws or compromising principles.""
FLYING IN MONEY NOT ON TABLE YET 
The United Nations has repeatedly warned that Afghanistan's economy is on the brink of collapse and would likely further fuel a refugee crisis. 
When asked about U.N. efforts to get cash into Afghanistan, Mary-Ellen McGroarty, head of the World Food Programme in Afghanistan, told reporters on Tuesday: ""The U.N. collective is looking at what potential solutions we could have, but flying in money to the country is not on the table yet.""
""What we are using at the moment is the limited liquidity that is in the country,"" she said. ""But the longer this goes on ... we're finding it's becoming more and more difficult.""
Some 8.7 million people are ""one step away from starvation,"" said McGroarty, adding: ""There is a tsunami of destitution, incredible suffering and hunger spiraling out of control.""
The Taliban is facing growing international pressure for an inclusive and representative Afghan government and to uphold human rights, particularly those of women and girls in return for international recognition and freeing up aid and reserves.
Donors and institutions are also seeking to avoid running afoul of U.N. and unilateral sanctions on the Taliban.
The United Nations is appealing for countries ""to provide humanitarian financial exemptions to allow funds to reach aid organizations in the country,"" said U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric, without naming names.
U.N. agencies and aid groups are currently using informal money-moving networks - known as hawalas - and small amounts of cash in banks to pay staff salaries and for other smaller scale purchases, Dujarric told Reuters. 

""These modalities are not sufficient for the large scale operations requiring cash payments or cash assistance in-country, however,"" said Dujarric, adding that the United Nations was talking to international financial institutions to find a solution that would expand aid operations. 
A key part of U.N. plans to inject money into Afghanistan is by providing cash directly to poor Afghan families.

TROY, N.Y. (Reuters) - Justice Richard McNally Jr., a New York state trial court judge, knows he has a reputation among gun enthusiasts in the upstate county of Rensselaer where he presides as a tough sell on granting permits for people to carry concealed handguns without restrictions.
McNally insists that in each case he applies the standard as written in a 1913 New York law that limits concealed-carry licenses to people who can show a ""proper cause"" for having one. 
""It's a law that was intended to grant broad discretion to the local licensing officers, and that takes into consideration geography and other factors,"" McNally said in an interview in his chambers at the county courthouse in Troy, a city near the state capital of Albany. ""I think it's worked pretty well for the last 100 years.""
That very discretion, wielded by state judges and police officials, could soon disappear. McNally's decisions to deny two county gun owners unrestricted licenses are at the heart of a major gun rights case set to be argued at the U.S. Supreme Court next Wednesday. A ruling is due by the end of next June.
Plaintiffs backed by the National Rifle Association, an influential lobby group closely aligned with the Republican Party, are challenging the ""proper cause"" requirement as a violation of the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment right to ""keep and bear arms."" 
A ruling striking down New York's law would deliver the biggest expansion of gun rights since the Supreme Court's watershed 2008 ruling that recognized for the first time an individual's right to keep a firearm in the home for self-defense. The justices in 2010 extended that decision, which involved the District of Columbia, to the states.
Gun rights, cherished by many Americans, are a contentious issue in a nation that has experienced high levels of firearms violence and numerous mass shootings. The Supreme Court's 6-3 conservative majority is seen as sympathetic toward gun rights. 
Gun control advocates fear that the New York case could imperil other state and local gun measures such as ""red-flag"" laws targeting the firearms of dangerous people or restrictions on selling untraceable ""ghost"" guns. Proponents of New York's law said striking it down also could jeopardize bans on guns in sensitive places such as airports, courthouses, hospitals and schools.
The challengers in the case seek an unfettered right to carry concealed handguns in public because they said that is where the chance of confrontation is highest. 
New York and seven other U.S. states - including the most populous, California - empower officials to decide whether people can carry a handgun even if they pass other criteria such as criminal background checks. Removing that power could require officials to issue thousands more concealed-carry permits. 
""The stakes are incredibly high. The fact that the court even took up the case should give us all cause for concern,"" said Eric Tirschwell, executive director of the gun safety legal group Everytown Law.
'GOD-GIVEN RIGHT'
The New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, the NRA's affiliate in the state, is a plaintiff in the case. Its president, Tom King, said, ""This is a God-given right that's protected by the (Constitution's) Bill of Rights, and nothing in the Bill of Rights says that your right to self-defense stops at your front door.""
To carry a concealed handgun without restriction, most applicants must convince a firearms-licensing officer that they have an actual, rather than speculative, need for self-defense.
The two gun-owner plaintiffs challenging the law, Robert Nash and Brandon Koch, do not face any special or unique danger, but want to carry handguns in public for self-defense. 
McNally rejected Nash's bid for an unrestricted license in 2016 and Koch's in 2018, letting them instead carry their guns for hunting, target practice and other outdoor activities. The two men teamed up with King's group to sue the judge and state police in 2018. 
Nash and Koch, through an NRA spokesperson, declined to be interviewed. They appealed to the Supreme Court after the Manhattan-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out their lawsuit last year.
The plaintiffs have argued that the law bans most average New Yorkers from obtaining a concealed-carry permit. Data reported to the Supreme Court by the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James, defending the law, showed that around 65% of applicants received unrestricted concealed-carry licenses statewide in 2018 and 2019.
The state has said the law lets officials make public-safety decisions based on local circumstances. New York City, for example, enforces it more strictly in an effort to reduce gun violence in a dense urban environment.
That lack of uniformity irks many gun owners.
""It's just too arbitrary,"" said Phil Minissale, a retired restaurant owner who belongs to a gun club in Rensselaer County. 
For Minissale, judges should not be able to deny law-abiding ""good people"" unrestricted permits. When he hears that McNally is deciding someone's application, ""I know it's not going to be positive for them,"" Minissale said. 
Sitting behind his paper-strewn desk adorned with a tiny model of the scales of justice, McNally, 60, looks very much like a judge, with white hair and reading glasses hanging from his neck. McNally sees himself as a ""regular guy"" and was previously elected as the county district attorney. 

McNally declined to discuss the pending case, but acknowledged his reputation with gun owners. He noted that he grew up outside the city of Syracuse next to a gun club, and has spent time shooting in firing ranges.
The judge said he grants unrestricted licenses when they are warranted, adding, ""I'm not anti-gun and never have been.""

SANTA FE, N.M. (Reuters) -A .45-caliber Colt revolver used on the set of the film ""Rust"" was not thoroughly checked before being given to actor Alec Baldwin, who fired a live lead bullet in an accidental fatal shooting last week in New Mexico, according to officials and a new court filing.
New details about the incident emerged on Wednesday during a news conference by Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza and District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies and in an affidavit filed by the sheriff's department.
Mendoza told reporters there was a complacent attitude toward safety on the set before last Thursday's shooting that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins during a rehearsal.
Hannah Gutierrez, the crew member in charge of weapons on the set, told investigators she had checked guns there but found no ""hot rounds"" - apparently meaning live ammunition - before the shooting, according to the affidavit.
Dave Halls, the film's assistant director, handed the gun to Baldwin, telling the actor it was ""cold"" or safe.
""He advised he should have checked all of them, but didn't,"" Halls told police, according to the affidavit. Halls was referring to the barrels of the revolver.
Halls had been fired from a previous movie set in 2019 over a mishap with a gun, production company Rocket Soul said on Monday. He has made no public comment on the incident.
Mendoza and Carmack-Altwies said while no criminal charges have been filed, they are not ruling out that possibility.
""All options are on the table. ... No one has been ruled out at this point,"" Carmack-Altwies said of potential charges.
Legal experts have said that criminal charges are possible but not likely against Baldwin.
The shooting https://www.reuters.com/world/us/prop-guns-spark-debate-after-cinematographers-death-set-2021-10-22 has sent shockwaves through Hollywood, prompting a debate about safety protocols in film and television - including whether certain types of guns https://www.reuters.com/world/us/prop-guns-spark-debate-after-cinematographers-death-set-2021-10-22 used as props should be banned - and working conditions on low-budget productions.
Gutierrez, whose job is formally called the film crew's armorer, said ammunition was not secured on the set during a lunch break before the shooting, the affidavit showed. It quoted her as saying that firearms were secured inside a safe during the break and that no live ammunition is ever kept on a movie set.
""Only a few people"" had access to the safe and knew the combination to open it, Gutierrez said, according to the affidavit.
Authorities have collected three firearms, 500 rounds of ammunition - some believed to be live bullets - and several pieces of clothing, Mendoza said. Some of the ballistic evidence is being sent to an FBI crime lab for analysis, Mendoza added.
Authorities have the firearm used in the shooting and recovered the bullet from the shoulder of director Joel Souza, who was wounded but released from the hospital, Mendoza said. It appears the same bullet struck Souza and Hutchins, Mendoza added.
Mendoza said the gun used by Baldwin was an Italian-made Pietta Long Colt revolver.
""We would consider it a live round - a bullet, live - because it did fire from the weapon and obviously caused the death of Ms. Hutchins and injured Mr. Souza,"" Mendoza said.
Baldwin, 63, serves as a co-producer of ""Rust,"" a Western film set in 1880s Kansas. Production on the Bonanza Creek (NYSE:BCEI) Ranch, near Santa Fe, has been halted.
Mendoza said Baldwin, Halls and Gutierrez all are cooperating with the investigation. 
Asked about the use of real weapons on a movie set, the sheriff said, ""I think the industry has had a record recently of being safe. I think there was some complacency on this set. And I think there are some safety issues that need to be addressed by the industry and possibly by the state of New Mexico.""
Before the incident, camera operators had walked off the set to protest working conditions. 

Baldwin was drawing a revolver https://www.reuters.com/world/us/alec-baldwin-seen-consoling-family-slain-cinematographer-set-problems-mount-2021-10-24 across his body and pointing it at a camera while rehearsing when the weapon fired, according to court documents. There is no video footage of the incident, Mendoza said.
The film's producers have hired the law firm https://www.reuters.com/article/us-film-rust-shooting-lawfirm-idUSKBN2HH24S Jenner & Block to investigate the shooting. They said the lawyers ""will have full discretion about who to interview and any conclusions they draw.""

The number of new infections per 100,000 people over seven days - one of the metrics used to determine policy measures - stands at 130.2, up 12.2 points from 118.0 the previous day. New infections have been steadily creeping up since mid-October. 
The number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care units (ICUs) has risen 15% within a week, the head of the German Hospital Federation (DKG), Gerald Gass, told the Redaktionsnetwork Deutschland media group. 
If the trend continues, he said, there could be 3,000 cases in the ICU in two weeks. 
""Even if the hospitals could handle it, it would not be possible without constraints on normal operations,"" Gass said. 
SPD health expert Karl Lauterbach told the Rheinische Post newspaper that lockdowns or school closures were not on the cards, but the decision on whether to lift safety measures such as mask mandates would depend on the situation in spring.
The three political parties in talks to form the next government have said they do not support extending a pandemic-related state of emergency set to expire on Nov. 25. 

Instead, they have recommended amending Germany’s Infection Protection Act to allow states to impose protective measures.
State leaders fear a patchwork of different regulations in each region could make them harder to enforce.

VILLA COMALTITLAN, Mexico (Reuters) -Thousands of mostly Central American migrants trekking across southern Mexico on Wednesday advanced only a short distance, with children and painfully blistered feet, the latest human caravan seeking to reach either Mexico City or the U.S. border.
The mass of men, women and children left the village of Huixtla early in the morning, walking about 10 miles (16 km) north along a local highway to the town of Villa Comaltitlan, in Mexico's southern Chiapas state, witnesses told Reuters.
""We haven't had any problems with immigration officials. God is opening doors for us,"" said a hopeful Julio Gonzalez, a Honduran migrant who spent Tuesday night sleeping near a street in Huixtla with his wife and two children under a steady rain.
In Villa Comaltitlan, some migrants told Reuters they sought to rest before departing early Thursday morning, which was especially important due to the large number of young children with them. 
The latest migrant caravan has not yet faced off with Mexican migration agents or soldiers who have increasingly used tough tactics to stem the tide of fleeing migrants, many of whom want to escape violent gangs and grinding joblessness back home.
The United States has registered record levels of migration this year, as border agents have apprehended or expelled more than 1.7 million migrants over the past 12 months.
The majority of the latest caravan are families with young children, according to a witness who estimated at least 2,000 migrants had gathered on Tuesday in Huixtla to rest and receive medical attention before resuming their journey north.
Among them was Arleth Chavez from Guatemala, who had walked with the caravan for about 28 miles since it departed the southern border city of Tapachula over the weekend.
""My feet are burning and in pain from the blisters,"" said Chavez, who nonetheless expressed a determination to continue.
Migrants have denounced the lengthy asylum process in Tapachula, located near Mexico's border with Guatemala, and thousands have departed the city in a series of caravans this year, including many Haitians.
Mexico's immigration agency INM said in a statement on Wednesday that some families in the caravan had asked to be returned to Tapachula, but did not provide numbers.
Many members of the caravan aim to reach Mexico City, where they hope the asylum process might be faster, while others say they seek to make it to the United States.

The U.S. government has put pressure on Mexico to contain migrants before reaching the U.S. border, and Mexican authorities have obliged by beefing up patrols.
The caravan's slow movement across Mexico comes as U.S. President Joe Biden has been facing increasing criticism from Republicans over the high levels of migration, which comes amid widespread violence and growing hunger in Central America and parts of the Caribbean.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. military officer, General Mark Milley, has provided the first official U.S. confirmation of a Chinese hypersonic weapons test that military experts say appears to show Beijing's pursuit of an Earth-orbiting system designed to evade American missile defenses.
The Pentagon has been at pains to avoid direct confirmation of the Chinese test this summer, first reported by the Financial Times, even as President Joe Biden and other officials have expressed general concerns about Chinese hypersonic weapons development.
But Milley explicitly confirmed a test and said that it was ""very close"" to a Sputnik moment -- referring Russia's 1957 launch of the first man-made satellite, which put Moscow ahead in the Cold War-era space race.
""What we saw was a very significant event of a test of a hypersonic weapon system. And it is very concerning,"" Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Bloomberg television, in an interview aired on Wednesday.
Nuclear arms experts say China's weapons test appeared to be designed to evade U.S. defenses in two ways. First, hypersonics move at speeds of more than five times the speed of sound, or about 6,200 kph (3,853 mph), making them harder to detect and intercept.
Second, sources tell Reuters that the United States believes China's test involved a weapon that first orbited the Earth. That's something military experts say is a Cold War concept known as ""fractional orbital bombardment."" 
Last month, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall alluded to his concerns about such a system, telling reporters about a weapon that would go into an orbit and then descend on a target.
""If you use that kind of an approach, you don't have to use a traditional ICBM trajectory -- which is directly from the point of launch to the point of impact,"" he said.
""It's a way to avoid defenses and missile warning systems.""
Fractional Orbital Bombardment would also be a way for China to avoid U.S. missile defenses in Alaska, which are designed to combat a limited number of weapons from a country like North Korea. 
Jeffrey Lewis at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies summed up fractional orbital bombardment this way: ""The simplest way to think about China's orbital bombardment system is to imagine a space shuttle, put a nuclear weapon into the cargo bay, and forget about the landing gear.""
Lewis said the difference is that the Chinese re-entry system is a glider.
China's foreign ministry denied a weapons test. It said it had carried out a routine test in July, but added: ""It was not a missile, it was a space vehicle.""

U.S. defenses are not capable of combating a large-scale attack from China or Russia, which could overwhelm the system. But the open U.S. pursuit of more and more advanced missile defenses has led Moscow and Beijing to examine ways to defeat them, experts say, including hypersonics and, apparently, fractional orbital bombardment.
The United States and Russia have both tested hypersonic weapons.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced in June that the X marker would be offered as an option on passports, following other countries including Canada, Germany, Australia and India, which already offer a third gender on documents.
State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement that the United States was moving toward adding the ""X"" gender marker as an option for those applying for U.S. passports or Consular Reports of Birth Abroad.
Price did not identify the holder of the first ""X"" gender passport, but civil rights organization Lambda Legal said its client Dana Zzyym was the recipient. 
""I almost burst into tears when I opened the envelope, pulled out my new passport, and saw the 'X' stamped boldly under 'sex,'"" Zzyym, an intersex and nonbinary U.S. Navy veteran, said in a statement on Wednesday. ""It took six years, but to have an accurate passport, one that doesn’t force me to identify as male or female but recognizes I am neither, is liberating.""
Zzyym, who uses gender-neutral pronouns ""they,"" ""them"" and ""their,"" was born with ambiguous sex characteristics. Lambda Legal said in the statement that Zzyym underwent several ""irreversible, painful, and medically unnecessary surgeries"" after their parents decided to raise them as a boy.
After serving in the U.S. Navy and attending Colorado State University, Zzyym came to understand they were born intersex, according to the statement. 

Zzyym's previous applications for a passport were denied as they required the applicant to select either ""male"" or ""female"" as a gender marker.
""When you're denied the access to go places it feels like a prison,"" Zzyym said in a television interview on Wednesday. ""I would really like to take a fishing trip down to like Costa Rica or Mexico or something ... So that's kind of like my first dream thing.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Federal prosecutors said on Wednesday that an accused participant in the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump made false claims about his medical needs while in jail awaiting trial.
That came two weeks after a judge ruled https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-judge-says-dc-jail-violated-civil-rights-jan-6-defendant-2021-10-13 that Washington, D.C. Department of Corrections officials violated the rights of Christopher Worrell, a member of the right-wing Proud Boys, by limiting his access to medical care.
In a court filing, prosecutors said Worrell's claims of neglect and mistreatment ""have repeatedly been contradicted"" by medical records from his doctors.
The Justice Department ""has repeatedly been unable to sort fact from fiction in reviewing Mr. Worrell's many claims of medical mistreatment, because those claims have often been refuted, or at best unsubstantiated, by the medical notes and records that the government later obtains.""
Alex Stavrou, a lawyer for Worrell, said he disputed the Justice Department's characterizations. Stavrou said Worrell had a hand injury that a doctor said required surgery, but the surgery may no longer be necessary.
Worrell, 50, is facing numerous criminal charges for his role in the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, including assaulting police and civil disorder. He has pleaded not guilty.
Worrell's lawyer at the time, John Pierce, said in an August court filing that his client had fallen and injured his hand in May but was denied care for months, despite a doctor at a nearby hospital saying he needed surgery.
On Oct. 13, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said jail officials had violated Worrell's civil rights.
Prosecutors said in Wednesday's filing that ""new information"" had emerged casting doubt on Worrell's claims.
The filing said the hand surgery Worrell has sought was an ""elective procedure"" and not urgent, citing notes from a doctor who treated Worrell.

""On Oct. 20, 2021, Mr. Worrell canceled his upcoming pinky fracture surgery — which had been scheduled quickly at Mr. Worrell's insistence — to seek a second opinion,"" prosecutors said.
Prosecutors also said medical notes make clear that Worrell has denied experiencing pain and experiences no impairment of function from the injury.

WASHINGTON/BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN (Reuters) -President Joe Biden told Southeast Asian nations on Wednesday the United States would stand with them in defending freedom of the seas and democracy and called China's actions towards Taiwan ""coercive"" and a threat to peace and stability. 
Speaking at a virtual East Asia Summit attended by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, Biden said Washington would start talks with partners in the Indo-Pacific about developing a regional economic framework, something critics say his regional strategy has lacked.
Southeast Asia has become a strategic battleground between the United States and China, which controls most of the South China Sea, and Beijing has turned up military and political pressure on fiercely democratic Taiwan, a self-ruled island Beijing considers its own.
Biden reiterated that the United States had a ""rock-solid"" commitment to Taiwan. ""We are deeply concerned by China's coercive ... actions,"" Biden said, charging that they ""threaten regional peace and stability.""
Li Keqiang told the summit, which brought together leaders of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) with regional partners, that upholding peace, stability, freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea was in everyone's interest. ""The South China Sea is our common home,"" he said.
Biden last week said the United States, which is obliged by a 1979 law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, would come to Taiwan's defense if it was attacked by China. Those comments caused a stir because they appeared to depart from a long-held U.S. policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" as to how Washington would respond to such a scenario.
The White House said Biden was not signaling a change in U.S. policy toward Taiwan, and some analysts dismissed his comments as a gaffe.
Tensions between Taiwan and China have escalated in recent weeks as Beijing has staged repeated air missions over the Taiwan Strait, the waterway separating the island and the mainland. 
China expressed displeasure at Biden's comments last week, urging Washington ""not to send the wrong signals to the forces of Taiwan independence, to avoid seriously harming Sino-U.S. ties and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.""
Biden joined Southeast Asian leaders in rebuking Myanmar's junta. 
""In Myanmar, we must address the tragedy caused by the military coup which is increasingly undermining regional stability,"" he said, calling for the release of political prisoners and a return to democracy.
ASEAN began three days of summits on Tuesday without a representative from Myanmar following its top general's exclusion for ignoring peace proposals.
Biden also said he would speak out for ""human rights in Xinjiang and Tibet (and) the rights of the people of Hong Kong."" China denies rights abuses in its outlying regions of Xinjiang and Tibet and in the former British colony of Hong Kong.
BIDEN'S ECONOMIC INITIATIVE 
Biden said Washington would begin discussions with partners in the Indo-Pacific to develop a regional economic framework.
Critics of U.S. strategy for the region point to its lack of an economic component after former President Donald Trump withdrew from the trade deal now known as the Comprehensive and Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2017.
The Biden administration has so far avoided any moves to return to an agreement that critics say could cost U.S. jobs and a senior official of the U.S. administration stressed that the initiative the president referred to “is not a trade deal.”
“What the president said ... was that we will begin discussions with partners to develop an economic framework to position us well for the future – laser-focused on making life better for workers and the middle class - and that will guide our economic engagement in the region,” the official said.
A White House readout said the envisaged network would also ""define our shared objectives around trade facilitation"" as well as standards for decarbonisation and clean energy.
Australia and ASEAN agreed on Wednesday to establish a ""comprehensive strategic partnership,"" a sign of Canberra's ambition to play a bigger role in the region.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the pact would strengthen diplomatic and security ties and promised the country would ""back it with substance"".
Morrison sought to reassure ASEAN that a trilateral security pact agreed last month between the United States, Britain and Australia, under which Australia will get access to nuclear-powered submarines, would not be a threat to the region.

BOSTON (Reuters) - The Harvard University scientist who has called for setting aside half the planet as a nature preserve says the slope of human history will always be downward unless there is global cooperation to save existing species.
Edward O. Wilson, a 92-year old naturalist hailed as the Darwin of the 21st century, said humankind is not too polarized to save the planet, even as some of the world's biggest polluters drag their feet on cutting carbon emissions and arresting global warming.
He sees preventing catastrophic climate change -- the aim of U.N. climate talks starting in Scotland on Sunday -- and saving biodiversity, or the variety of plant and animal species in the world, as two initiatives that must happen together.
""This is the most communal endeavor with a clear definable goal that humanity has ever had and we need to get the kind of cooperation and ethical harmony and planning in order to make it work,"" Wilson told Reuters in an interview outside Boston on Oct. 21.
""Otherwise, the slope of human history will always be downward.""
Today, species are going extinct at a rate not seen in 10 million years, with around 1 million currently on the brink. To limit the loss, the United Nations has urged countries to commit to conserving 30% of their land and water – almost double the area currently under some form of protection - by 2030.
The so-called ""30 by 30"" target is in part inspired by Wilson's Half-Earth Project. First outlined in 2016, it calls for protecting half the planet's land and sea so there are enough diverse and well-connected ecosystems to reverse the course of species extinction.
""The point is that human nature has not changed enough. Our strongest propensities of a social nature tend to disfavor the lives of most other species,"" Wilson said. 
Humanity continues to solve problems by burning materials - coal and oil - left behind by ancient organisms, Wilson said, decrying the continued exploration and burning of fossil fuels, which amplifies the destruction of biodiversity. 
The Group of 20 rich countries remain divided over phasing out coal and committing to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial temperatures. G20 nations account for 80% of global emissions, but big polluters such as China and India have also so far dug in their heels.
THE ANT MAN STARTED YOUNG
Alongside British naturalist Sir David Attenborough, Wilson is considered the world's leading authority on natural history and conservation.
He is also the world's foremost authority on ants, of which he has discovered over 400 species. He has written two Pulitzer Prize-winning books and popularized the term ""biodiversity"", leading to a movement to preserve all species on the planet while safeguarding against humankind's domination of natural resources. He has worked at Harvard for 70 years and still puts in time as a curator in entomology. 
His trajectory as an entomologist - someone who studies insects - was set at age 10, when he spent hours in the woods of Rock Creek Park in Washington D.C.
""I already had a serious library from my collection of bugs and butterflies,"" Wilson recounted during the interview. 
A highlight of his career would come years later when he climbed more than 13,000 feet (3,962 meters) to the center of the Sarawaged Range in Papua New Guinea. 
He said he owes part of his adventuresome spirit to his great-grandfather, William ""Black Bill"" Wilson, who piloted a steam ship during the U.S. Civil War. He was captured and imprisoned by Union troops for trying to move arms and other supplies to the Confederacy.
Wilson is a natural storyteller and his accessible writing style is on full display in ""The Ants"", a 1990 book he wrote with Bert Holldobler. The monograph is more than 700 pages and weighs more than 7 pounds (3.2 kg).
He said one of his greatest achievements was working out how ants communicate danger and food trails, for example, by emitting chemicals.
Now living in a retirement community in a suburb of the northeastern U.S. city of Boston, Wilson continues to write and is working on a book about ecosystems. 
Despite his love and fascination of ants, he waves off any suggestion that humans should model themselves after their traits or those of any other species as a way of improvement.
""I'm going to say something daring,"" Wilson said. ""To follow the ethics and behavior of most other species would lead us to even more warfare over (resource) utilization ..."" 

Still, he is optimistic humankind will set aside more space than it has in the past to save the rest of Earth's biology.
""It will be one of humanity's proudest achievements,"" Wilson said. ""If we fail to do it, and a large portion of the biological diversity of the world is allowed to be exterminated, for all of the generations to come that carelessness will be regarded as one of humanity's greatest failures.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A sample of Sitting Bull's hair has helped scientists confirm that a South Dakota man is the famed 19th century Native American leader's great-grandson using a new method to analyze family lineages with DNA fragments from long-dead people.
Researchers said on Wednesday that DNA extracted from the hair, which had been stored at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, confirmed the familial relationship between Sitting Bull, who died in 1890, and Ernie LaPointe, 73, of Lead, South Dakota. 
""I feel this DNA research is another way of identifying my lineal relationship to my great-grandfather,"" said LaPointe, who has three sisters. ""People have been questioning our relationship to our ancestor as long as I can remember. These people are just a pain in the place you sit - and will probably doubt these findings, also.""
The study represented the first time that DNA from a long-dead person was used to demonstrate a familial relationship between a living individual and a historical figure - and offers the potential for doing so with others whose DNA can be extracted from remains such as hair, teeth or bones.
The new method was developed by scientists led by Eske Willerslev, director of the Lundbeck Foundation GeoGenetics Centre at the University of Cambridge.
The researchers took 14 years to discover a way of extracting useable DNA from the hair, which was degraded after being stored at room temperature before being handed over by the Smithsonian to LaPointe and his sisters in 2007.
Willerslev said he read in a magazine about the Smithsonian turning over the lock of hair from Sitting Bull's scalp and reached out to LaPointe.
""LaPointe asked me to extract DNA from it and compare it to his DNA to establish relationship,"" said Willerslev, senior author of the research published in the Science Advances. ""I got very little hair and there was very limited DNA in it. It took us a long time developing a method that, based on limited ancient DNA, can by compared to that of living people across multiple generations.""
The novel technique centered on what is known as autosomal DNA in the genetic fragments extracted from the hair. Traditional analysis involves specific DNA in the Y chromosome passed down the male line or specific DNA in the mitochondria - powerhouses of a cell - passed down from mothers to children. Autosomal DNA instead is not gender specific.
""There existed methods, but they demanded for substantial amounts of DNA or did only allow to go to the level of grandchildren,"" Willerslev said. ""With our new method, it is possible to establish deeper-time family relationships using tiny amounts of DNA.""
Sitting Bull, whose Lakota name was Tatanka-Iyotanka, helped bring together the Sioux tribes of the Great Plains against white settlers taking tribal land and U.S. military forces trying to expel Native Americans from their territory. He led Native American warriors who wiped out federal troops led by George Custer at the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn in what is now the U.S. state of Montana. 

Two official burial sites exist for Sitting Bull, one at Fort Yates, North Dakota and the other at Mobridge, South Dakota. LaPointe said he does not believe the Fort Yates site contains any of his great-grandfather's remains.
""I feel the DNA results can identify the remains buried at the Mobridge, South Dakota site as my ancestor,"" LaPointe said, raising the possibility of moving the Mobridge remains to another location in the future.

LONDON (Reuters) -Lawyers for the United States launched a fresh attempt on Wednesday to have Julian Assange extradited from Britain, arguing that concerns about the WikiLeaks founder's mental health should not prevent him from facing U.S. justice.
The 50-year-old Australian is wanted in the United States on 18 criminal charges, including breaking a spying law, after WikiLeaks published thousands of secret U.S. files and diplomatic cables in 2010.
The United States is appealing against a Jan. 4 ruling by a London District Judge that Assange should not be extradited because he would likely commit suicide in a U.S. prison.
Lawyer James Lewis told the court the United States had addressed the District Judge's concerns by making assurances to Britain regarding how Assange would be treated if extradited.
These included that he would not be subject to a set of strict detention conditions known as Special Administrative Measures and would not be detained at a maximum security penitentiary in Florence, Colorado, known as ADX.
The U.S. authorities had also assured Britain that they would consent to Assange serving in Australia any custodial sentence imposed by a U.S. court, Lewis said.
Assange, who denies any wrongdoing, is being held at Belmarsh Prison. In the morning, the court was told he felt too unwell to appear via video link, but later in the day he did appear on the screen. Wearing a shirt, tie and mask, he was sitting at a table, holding his head in his hand.
In a court document circulated to media, Assange's lawyers rejected the U.S. assurances, saying he could be held in another maximum security facility under oppressive conditions that would drive him to suicide.
They said Australia had given no indication it would consent to Assange being transferred there to serve a U.S. sentence, and he would be at high risk while awaiting a transfer.
""On the evidence, Mr Assange will most likely be dead before it (the proposed transfer) can have any purchase,"" they wrote.
The appeal hearing is scheduled to last two days, with the judges expected to give their ruling at a later date.
'FREE JULIAN ASSANGE'
Supporters of Assange gathered outside the court building from early on Wednesday, chanting ""free Julian Assange"", before his father and Stella Moris, his partner and mother of his two children, arrived.
Another subject of dispute in the appeal is whether the evidence of a psychiatric expert called by Assange's defence team in the original extradition hearing was reliable.
The U.S. lawyers argue the evidence should be dismissed because the expert initially failed to disclose that Moris was Assange's partner and that the pair had children -- information they said was highly relevant to the issue of his suicide risk.
Assange's lawyers said the District Judge had been right to take into account the expert's evidence.
WikiLeaks came to prominence when it published vast troves of confidential U.S. military records and diplomatic cables which the United States says put lives in danger.
Soon afterwards Sweden sought Assange's extradition from Britain over allegations of sex crimes. He was ordered to be sent to Sweden in 2012, but instead fled to the Ecuadorean embassy in London and lived there for seven years.

He was dragged out in April 2019 and jailed for breaching his British bail conditions, although the Swedish case against him had been dropped. The U.S. authorities then sought his extradition.
Supporters see Assange as an anti-establishment hero victimised for exposing U.S. wrongdoing in Afghanistan and Iraq. U.S. prosecutors regard him as a reckless enemy of the state whose actions threatened the lives of agents named in the leaked material.

(Reuters) - A man who opened fire with a handgun at a shopping mall in Boise, Idaho, killing two people and injuring several others, including a police officer, died on Tuesday from wounds sustained during the violence a day earlier, authorities said.
Investigators have yet to determine whether the fatal injuries resulted from an exchange of gunfire with police at the scene, or from a self-inflicted gunshot before he was taken into custody, according to Boise Police Chief Ryan Lee.
The motive for Monday's midday bloodshed remained under investigation, Lee told reporters in a briefing a day after the attack at Boise Towne Square mall on the west end of Idaho's capital.
The suspect was publicly identified on Tuesday as 27-year-old Jacob Bergquist, a Boise resident. Police Chief Lee described him as having had previous run-ins with mall security and police for ""disruptive behavior.""
""We have had contact with him in the past (but) we did not have any reason to arrest him,"" Lee said, adding that Bergquist was not believed to have had any employment history at the mall.
Police also disclosed new details about incident, saying that the suspect, dressed in black, fired multiple shots inside the mall before he fled the building and was confronted by officers arriving on the scene within 2 1/2 minutes.
He credited the swift response by law enforcement with preventing a ""more grave tragedy.""
The slain victims were identified by the county coroner as Joseph Acker, 26, a mall security officer who was the first person shot, and Roberto Arguelles, 49, who was gunned down near and elevator and died at a hospital.
Two women, aged 52 and 23, were injured as the suspect proceeded through the mall firing rounds into the floor, and a third woman, 68, was injured in her vehicle outside the building, apparently caught in the crossfire between police and the gunman, authorities said. 
A Boise police officer called to the scene was shot at through the window of his vehicle and was injured by shards of broken glass, though evidence shows that gunfire struck the hat he was wearing, police said. 
Another man was taken by private vehicle to a hospital and treated for injuries suffered in a fall while fleeing the mall, police said.

None of the wounded people's injuries were considered life-threatening, authorities said.
Lee said the suspect did all his shooting with a handgun, but a police statement online said he was carrying multiple firearms.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court panel on Wednesday cast doubt on an effort by the National Rifle Association to revive its lawsuit challenging New York state's closing of gun stores early in the COVID-19 pandemic because they were ""non-essential"" businesses.
The NRA, which is also defending itself against a lawsuit by New York's attorney general seeking its dissolution, had sued over a March 2020 executive order by then-Governor Andrew Cuomo, saying the closures violated the Second Amendment and other provisions of the U.S. Constitution.
A federal judge dismissed the NRA's lawsuit in August 2020, but Cuomo's order was later rescinded and another legal challenge to the order was declared moot. 
Philip Furia, a lawyer for the NRA, told the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan that the gun rights group still had ""viable claims,"" but drew skepticism in arguing it be allowed to replead its case and seek compensatory damages.
""I'm not sure what you want,"" Circuit Judge Michael Park said. ""I'm not sure what this lawsuit is about anymore.""
Brian Ginsberg, a lawyer for the state, said there were constitutional problems with a repleading, and the NRA already had three chances to seek compensatory damages.
""This would be the fourth bite at the apple, and I think that's at least two bites too many,"" he said.
The appeals court did not say when it will rule.
In seeking the NRA's dissolution, state Attorney General Letitia James has said the group, a New York nonprofit, is racked by corruption, including by diverting millions of dollars to insiders including longtime Chief Executive Wayne LaPierre.
The NRA had in January filed for bankruptcy and sought to reincorporate in the more gun-friendly Texas, but a judge called the Chapter 11 case an improper effort to gain an ""unfair litigation advantage"" and avoid James' oversight.

James is also seeking LaPierre's ouster.
The case is National Rifle Association of America v Cuomo et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 20-3187.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Two U.S. senators have urged President Joe Biden to waive sanctions against India over its purchase of Russia's S-400 air defense system, saying such a punitive measure would endanger growing cooperation.
India signed a $5.5 billion deal with Russia in 2018 for five of the surface-to-air missile systems for defense against longtime adversary Pakistan, and China, with which it is locked in a standoff on their disputed border.
The proposed transfer has caused friction with the United States, which passed a law in 2017 under which any country engaged with Russia's defense and intelligence sectors could face sanctions.
Republican Senator John Cornyn and Democratic Senator Mark Warner wrote a letter to Biden on Tuesday calling for a waiver on the grounds of national security and broader cooperation.
""We believe there is a national security imperative to waiving sanctions,"" the senators said in their letter.
They said they were concerned the transfer of the Russian systems would trigger sanctions against India under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), which was enacted to hold Russia accountable for interfering in U.S. elections, cyber hacking and bullying Ukraine.
India has made a downpayment on the S400 systems and the first set of missile batteries is expected to be begin deployment later this year. 
The United States imposed sanctions on Turkey for buying the same equipment last year.
Cornyn and Warner, who are co-chairs of a Senate India Caucus, said they shared the administration's concerns about Russia but they warned of damage to cooperation with India if sanctions were to be imposed.
""We believe that the application of CAATSA sanctions could have a deleterious effect on a strategic partnership with India, while at the same time, not achieve the intended purpose of deterring Russian arms sales,"" they wrote. 
India has been cutting back on purchases of military equipment from Russia, which for years was its main source, with a 53% drop in Russian arms exports to India from 2016 to 2020 compared with the preceding five-year period. 
India's defense deals with the United States, on the other hand, have been increasing with sales at $3.4 billion in 2020 financial year. These are positive trends, the senators said.

""Imposing sanctions at this time could derail deepening cooperation with India across all aspects of our bilateral relationship – from vaccines to defense cooperation, from energy strategy to technology sharing.""

(Reuters) - A pivotal defense argument of the three white men on trial in Georgia for killing Ahmaud Arbery, a Black jogger, is that they were trying to make a citizen's arrest under a Civil War-era law that was later repealed amid an uproar over the shooting.
When the fatal encounter occurred on Feb. 23, 2020, it was legal in Georgia for people to arrest someone where they had ""reasonable and probable grounds of suspicion"" that the person had just committed a felony. Outcry over the killing led to lawmakers revoking the statute in May.
Legal observers say prosecutors will seek to convince the jury that there was no felony over which to arrest Arbery, 25, and that the three men lacked the ""reasonable and probable suspicion"" required under the old citizen's arrest law. The trial is in the second week of jury selection.
Before Arbery's killing, the law had been largely unchanged since it was codified in 1863, when Georgia was part of the slaveholding Southern Confederacy during the U.S. Civil War.
Most U.S. states have codified some form of a law allowing citizen's arrests. The American Civil Liberties Union and others that successfully sought to repeal the law said the state's statute was originally passed to enable the capture of escaped slaves.
Chris Slobogin, a law professor at Tennessee's Vanderbilt University, said citizen's arrest laws put dangerous powers in untrained hands.
    ""Things can get out of control quickly,"" he said.
Travis McMichael, 35, his father, Gregory McMichael, 65, and their neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 52, say they suspected Arbery was a burglar and chased him in two pickup trucks as he ran down a street in mostly white Satilla Shores, a suburb of the small coastal city of Brunswick (NYSE:BC). 
Just before he was cornered and shot to death, Arbery had entered an unoccupied property where a house was under construction. The owner of the property has said nothing was taken and that Arbery, who was on a Sunday afternoon jog, probably just stopped there for a drink of water.
""Citizen's arrest is a big part of our case, a big part,"" Kevin Gough, a lawyer for Bryan, said in an interview earlier this month before the judge presiding over the murder trial in Glynn County Superior Court issued a partial gag order. 
""They changed the law, but changing the law doesn't affect us. It doesn't change what was the law of the land at the time.""
Arbery's family believes, however, that the three men were suspicious of Arbery simply because he was Black. In a statement made to investigators, Bryan said the younger McMichael cursed Arbery, using a racial slur while standing over the body.
'NOBLE IDEA'
Ira Robbins, a law professor at American University in Washington, wrote in an academic paper that many states' citizen's arrest laws are broad. In California, for example, someone can make an arrest for a felony if the person has probable cause to believe it was committed. 
""While recruiting citizens to aid in eradicating crime is a noble idea,"" Robbins wrote, strict safeguards are needed to prevent the law being abused.
New York state has the strictest law, holding residents liable for false arrest if no crime was committed, even if they had reasonable belief, ""leaving no room for mistakes,"" Robbins wrote.
In Georgia, the elected county prosecutor who first looked at the Arbery case accepted the citizen's arrest rationale offered by the three white men and concluded they should not be arrested, according to Glynn County police.
That decision drew outrage after May 5, when a cellphone video recorded by Bryan showing the men chasing and killing Arbery was published by a local news outlet and quickly spread online.
After the Georgia Bureau of Investigation took over the case from the police, the men were quickly arrested and charged with crimes including false imprisonment, aggravated assault and murder, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.
In repealing the law, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said Arbery was ""the victim of vigilante-style violence that has no place in Georgia,"" and that the statute was ""ripe for abuse.""

The ACLU's Georgia chapter said the old law was an example of systemic racism and empowered mobs that lynched Black people in more than 500 recorded cases in Georgia between 1882 and 1968.
A new, narrower law still allows for private citizens to detain people in a few limited circumstances, such as a shopkeeper who catches someone shoplifting.

Tensions between Taiwan and China, which claims the democratically-governed island as its own territory, have spiked over the past year as Beijing ups its military and political pressure to force Taipei to accept Chinese sovereignty.
That has included repeated missions by Chinese warplanes in Taiwan's air defence identification zone, or ADIZ, which covers a broader area than Taiwan's territorial air space which Taiwan monitors and patrols to give it more time to respond to any threats.
China is in the midst of a military modernisation programme, building new aircraft carriers and stealth fighters, while Taiwan is also increasing military spending, especially on developing new missiles and submarines.
In its report to parliament, Taiwan's Defence Ministry described the situation in the Taiwan Strait that separates it from its giant neighbour as ""severe and unstable"" and labelled the actions of China's military ""provocation"".
""Taiwan will not engage in an arms race with the Chinese Communists' military and will not seek military confrontation, hoping for peaceful coexistence across the strait,"" it said.
""But in the face of the Chinese Communists' threat to our national security, we will do our best to defend our country's sovereignty and will never give in under duress.""
What it termed the ""confrontation"" between Taiwan and China would be ""difficult to alleviate in the short term"".
The military will strive to hone its abilities to monitor Chinese aircraft and ships so it can react earlier, and will also exchange intelligence with foreign countries so it can be fully informed of the regional security situation, it added.
Speaking earlier on Wednesday in Beijing, a Chinese government spokesman reiterated their determination to prevent Taiwan's formal independence and bring the island under China's rule, preferably peacefully.
But Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, added: ""We do not promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option to take all necessary measures"".

Democratically-ruled Taiwan says it is an independent country and will defend itself if attacked.
The tensions have sparked international concern of a conflict that could pit the United States and its allies against China.

PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Haiti's streets were unusually quiet on Tuesday and gasoline stations remained dry as gangs blocked the entrance to ports that hold fuel stores and the country's main gang boss demanded that Prime Minister Ariel Henry resign. 
Days-long fuel shortages have left Haitians with few transportation options and forced the closure of some businesses. Hospitals, which rely on diesel generators to ensure electricity due to constant blackouts, may shut down as well. 
The situation has put further pressure on a population already struggling under a weakening economy and a wave of gang kidnappings, which include the abduction earlier this month of a group of Canadian and American missionaries. 
Jimmy ""Barbecue"" Cherizier, leader of the ""G9"" coalition of gangs in the metropolitan area of the capital, Port-au-Prince, said in a radio interview on Monday night that he would ensure safe passage of fuel trucks if Henry leaves office.
""The areas under the control of the G9 are blocked for one reason only - we demand the resignation of Ariel Henry,"" Cherizier said in an interview on Haiti's Radio Mega.
""If Ariel Henry resigns at 8 a.m., at 8:05 a.m. we will unblock the road and all the trucks will be able to go through to get fuel.""
A spokesperson for Henry's office did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters was unable to contact Cherizier.
His statements show how gangs have taken on an increasingly political role following the July assassination of President Jovenel Moise. Cherizier has said Henry should ""answer questions"" linking him to Moise's murder. Henry has denied any involvement. 
Elections had originally been scheduled for November but were suspended after Henry last month dismissed the council that organizes elections, which critics had accused of being biased in favor of Moise. Henry has promised to appoint a non-partisan council that will set a new date.
Kidnappings have been in the headlines for months as Haitians from all walks of life face abduction by the increasingly powerful gangs. 
The missionaries traveling as part of a trip organized by Ohio-based Christian Aid Ministries were abducted by a gang called 400 Mawozo that operates east of the capital and is seeking a ransom of $1 million for each person.
Christian Aid Ministries asked people in a statement on Tuesday to remember both those ""being held hostage as well as those recovering from the experience of being kidnapped.""
The State Department said last week the U.S. government had dispatched a ""small team"" to assist in efforts to locate and free the missionaries.
White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday the United States had deployed ""a significant number of law enforcement specialists and hostage recovery specialists"" to Haiti. 
'THE WORST I'VE SEEN'
Haiti's foreign aid bureau, BMPAD, which oversees fuel procurement, tweeted a video saying the country had 150,000 barrels of diesel and 50,000 barrels of gasoline, with another 50,000 barrels of gasoline set to arrive on Wednesday.
A total of 100,000 barrels of diesel and gasoline would supply Haiti's fuel needs for five to seven says, said Marc Andre Deriphonse, head of the country's service-station owners' association, ANAPROSS.
Businesses have been warning that they may have to halt operations for lack of fuel. Telecoms firms said some cell towers are no longer in operation.
""This is the worst I've seen,"" said one motorcycle taxi driver waiting to pick up passengers outside Port-au-Prince, when asked about the fuel shortages. He declined to give his name.
Motorcycle drivers strap one-gallon containers to their bikes in the hopes of filling them with fuel sold on the black market. A gallon of gasoline on the street can now fetch $20, compared with typical filling-station prices of around $2.
Transportation industry leaders have called for strikes to protest the wave of kidnappings, which have disproportionately affected truck drivers and public transport workers.
United Nations children's agency UNICEF said on Sunday https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/unicef-warns-haiti-fuel-shortages-put-hospitalised-women-children-risk-2021-10-24 it had negotiated fuel deliveries to Haitian hospitals but that the provider later refused to make the deliveries, citing security conditions.

At one police station near Port-au-Prince, two officers had been unable to get to work due to fuel shortages, according to a police official, who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak with reporters.
""Most of our vehicles have about a quarter of a tank,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - A Cambridge University college will on Wednesday hand over to Nigeria a sculpture that was looted by British troops in 1897, setting a precedent that will put pressure on other institutions to return stolen artefacts.
The sculpture of a cockerel was one of hundreds of Benin Bronzes that were pillaged from the once mighty Kingdom of Benin, located in what is now Nigeria. They are among Africa's most culturally significant artefacts and Nigerian authorities have been calling for years for their return.
""This is the right thing to do out of respect for the unique heritage and history of this artefact,"" said Sonita Alleyne, Master of Jesus College, Cambridge, in a statement ahead of a ceremony to hand over the cockerel to a Nigerian delegation.
The college described the handover as ""the first institutional return of its kind"".
Germany has agreed to start returning Benin Bronzes held in its museums next year, but the British Museum in London, which holds the largest and most significant collection of them, has made no such commitment.
""We thank Jesus College for being a trailblazer and we look forward to a similar return of our artefacts by other institutions that are in possession of them,"" said Lai Mohammed, Nigeria's Minister of Information and Culture.
After being looted, the cockerel was given to Jesus College in 1905 by the father of a student. The college announced in 2019 it would return it to Nigeria.
In recent years, a range of British institutions have been grappling with the cultural legacies of colonialism, particularly the issue of what to do about disputed heritage.

The British Museum and other European museums, along with Nigerian authorities, are involved in a Benin Dialogue Group that aims to facilitate the construction in Benin City of a new museum to house returned bronzes.
The British Museum has spoken about ""opportunities for sharing and displaying"" items from its collection in Nigeria, but has never said it would transfer ownership.
