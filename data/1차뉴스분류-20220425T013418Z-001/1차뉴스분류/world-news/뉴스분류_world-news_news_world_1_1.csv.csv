SEOUL (Reuters) - The U.S. envoy for North Korea arrived in Seoul on Monday for talks with his South Korean counterparts on ways to address Pyongyang's increased missile launches and concerns over the possible resumption of nuclear testing.
U.S. Special Representative Sung Kim and his deputy, Jung Pak, will meet with South Korean officials, including nuclear envoy Noh Kyu-duk, during a five-day visit.
Their arrival coincided with the start of a nine-day annual joint military drill by U.S. and South Korean troops. The exercise is a ""defensive command post training using computer simulation"" and will not involve field manoeuvres by troops, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said on Sunday.
North Korea has condemned the joint drills as rehearsals for war, and they have been scaled back in recent years amid efforts to engage Pyongyang in diplomacy, and because of COVID-19 restrictions.
On Saturday North Korea test fired what state media said were missiles involved in delivering tactical nuclear weapons. 
On arrival, Kim told reporters he was in Seoul to continue ""close coordination"" on North Korea developments, Yonhap news agency reported, without elaborating.
He has said he is open to talks with North Korea at any time and without preconditions, but Pyongyang has so far rebuffed those overtures, accusing Washington of maintaining hostile policies such as sanctions and the military drills.

South Korean media reported that Kim was also expected to meet with the transition team for President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol, who takes office in May. 
A spokesperson for the team said there was no meeting confirmed between Yoon and Kim, and could not immediately confirm whether the envoy would be meeting other transition officials.

LVIV/KYIV (Reuters) - Ukrainian soldiers resisted a Russian ultimatum to lay down arms on Sunday in the pulverised port of Mariupol, which Moscow said its forces had almost completely seized in what would be its biggest prize of the nearly two-month war.
Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said troops in Mariupol were still fighting despite a Russian demand to surrender by dawn. 
""The city still has not fallen,"" he told ABC's ""This Week"" programme, adding that Ukrainian soldiers continue to control some parts of the southeastern Ukrainian city. 
Russia said on Saturday it had control of urban areas, with some Ukrainian fighters remaining in the Azovstal steelworks overlooking the Sea of Azov.
Capturing Mariupol, the main port in the Donbas region, would be a strategic prize for Russia, connecting territory held by pro-Russian separatists in the east with the Crimea region that Moscow annexed in 2014.
After failing to overcome Ukrainian resistance in the north, the Russian military has refocused its ground offensive on Donbas while launching long-distance strikes at targets elsewhere including the capital, Kyiv. 
About four million Ukrainians have fled the country, cities have been shattered and thousands have died since the start of the invasion on Feb. 24.
The economic damage is significant too - Shmyhal said Ukraine's budget deficit was around $5 billion a month and called for Western governments to provide more financial aid.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) he had discussed ensuring Ukraine's financial stability and preparations for post-war reconstruction with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva. She replied that support was ""essential to lay the foundations for rebuilding a modern competitive #Ukraine.""
Earlier, he posted on his Telegram account images of destruction he said were akin to World War Two. 
""The occupiers will be responsible for everything they did in Ukraine,"" Zelenskiy said. 
'CRUEL AND SENSELESS WAR'
Implicitly criticizing Russia, Pope Francis pleaded for an end to the bloodshed and lamented the ""Easter of war"" during his address in St. Peter's Square after Mass. 
""May there be peace for war-torn Ukraine, so sorely tried by the violence and destruction of the cruel and senseless war into which it was dragged,"" he said.
Zelenskiy accused Russia on Saturday of ""deliberately trying to destroy everyone"" in Mariupol. 
The Azovstal steelworks, one of Europe's biggest metallurgical plants with a maze of rail tracks, tunnels and blast furnaces, has become a last stand for the city's outnumbered defenders.
""All who lay down their arms are guaranteed that their lives will be spared,"" Russia's Defence Ministry said on Saturday.
It was not known how many soldiers were in the steelworks. Satellite images have shown smoke and fire coming from the area. Zelenskiy has said killing his troops would put an end to peace efforts. 
Russia said Ukraine had lost more than 4,000 soldiers in Mariupol as of Saturday. Kyiv says its total troop losses nationwide so far in the war are less than that, between 2,500 and 3,000. Reuters has not been able to verify either side's figures.
Russia calls its action a special military operation to demilitarise Ukraine and eradicate what it calls dangerous nationalists. The West and Kyiv accuse Russian President Vladimir Putin of unprovoked aggression. 
A representative in Mariupol of the Azov forces – a one-time far-right militia now part of Ukraine's National Guard whose destruction is among Moscow's war objectives – said international intervention was needed to help civilians, including children, sheltering at the steelworks.
""There are civilians at Azovstal who are afraid of Russia's guarantees for their exit,"" the Azov representative said in a message to Reuters.
Reuters has not been able to verify whether there are significant numbers of civilians at the plant.
There have been on-off negotiations between Ukraine and Russia since the start of the war. 
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a CBS News interview on Sunday that the situation in Mariupol was ""dire"" and could be a ""red line"" in the path of negotiations.
NATIONWIDE ATTACKS
Elsewhere in Ukraine, there were more reports on Sunday of Russian strikes around major population centres. 
Local media reported an explosion in Kyiv, though deputy mayor Mykola Povoroznyk said air defence systems had thwarted Russian attacks. The mayor of Brovary city, close to Kyiv, said a missile attack had damaged infrastructure. 
Russia said it had destroyed an ammunition factory near the capital, according to the RIA news agency. 
Shelling in Ukraine's second biggest city, Kharkiv, killed five people and injured 13, Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne reported. A Reuters correspondent in Kharkiv heard multiple explosions in quick succession and saw debris from missiles.
""This is nothing but deliberate terror: mortars, artillery against ordinary residential quarters, against ordinary civilians,"" Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address.
As cleanup operations continued in areas where the Russians have retreated, Ukraine's human rights ombudswoman said almost all high-rise buildings in the town of Okhtyrka were unfit for occupation. The State Emergencies Service said 41 bodies had been recovered in the town of Borodyanka.
Most Ukrainians celebrate Orthodox Easter next Sunday, but in Bucha, a town north of Kyiv where Ukraine accuses Russia of killing dozens of civilians, some 50 people attended a church service, carrying pussy willow and praying for the dead. 
Russia denies targeting civilians and has called images from Bucha fake.
""I just prayed today to stop crying,"" said resident Evgeniya Lebedko after the service. ""We have survived these horrors and we are constantly crying.""

Despite the desperate situation in Mariupol, Ukraine said it was holding off Russian forces in other parts of the Donbas regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which before the invasion were already partly controlled by Russian-backed separatists.
On Sunday, police in Donetsk region said that over the past 24 hours Russian forces opened fire on 13 settlements under Ukrainian control, killing two civilians.

The two victims were both under 18 while eight more sustained gunshot wounds, police said, revising an earlier tally. An additional five were injured as they jumped out of windows or otherwise tried to flee gunfire that erupted at the short-term rental property where hundreds of people, mostly juveniles, had gathered at a large party. 
""This shouldn't have happened. We're sick about it and we're going do everything we can to get those responsible for it,"" Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert said at a news conference on Sunday.
Schubert said evidence suggested there were multiple shooters and that investigators believed an altercation might have led to the violence but offered no further details. Authorities did not immediately provide the names of the two victims. 
Over 90 rounds were fired at the ""very chaotic"" scene that investigators were combing for clues and where they recovered multiple weapons as well as different casings, Schubert said. 
Gunshots were fired both inside and outside the residence and police pleaded with witnesses and people who attended the party to come forward and share videos or any other evidence they might be able to provide. 
The shooting in Pittsburgh took place just hours after a shooting at a South Carolina mall left several people injured and days after a gunman opened fire in a New York City subway car, injuring dozens.

Valdeci Alves dos Santos, known as Colorido, was captured on Saturday in the northeastern town of Salgueiro, the justice ministry said. It said he had been on the run since 2014 and was on its list of most wanted criminals. He is one of the main suppliers of drugs to Brazil's southeast, the ministry said.
Born in the prisons of Sao Paulo state, the PCC has become one of the most powerful criminal organizations in the Americas, responsible for moving drugs from South American producer nations to supply consumer markets in Brazil and Europe. 

Much of the top leadership has been in prison for years; Colorido was the gang's No. 2 among those still living in liberty, the ministry said.

In some places counter-protesters attacked police ahead of planned right-wing extremist demonstrations. Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson has condemned the violence.
""Three people seem to have been hit by ricochets and are now being cared for in hospital. All three injured are arrested on suspicion of crime,"" police said in an online statement, adding none of the injuries were life-threatening. 
Police said the situation in Norrkoping was calm on Sunday evening. 

Police and protesters have been engaged in serious clashes during the past days where several police have been injured and multiple vehicles have been torched. 
The violence began on Thursday after a demonstration organised by Rasmus Paludan, leader of Danish far-right political party Hard Line. Paludan, who had permission for a series of demonstrations across Sweden during the Easter weekend, is known for Quran burnings.

ETHEKWINI, South Africa (Reuters) -Rescuers searched for dozens of people still missing in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province on Sunday after heavy rains in recent days triggered floods and mudslides that have killed more than 440 people.
The floods have left thousands homeless, knocked out power and water services and disrupted operations at one of Africa's busiest ports, Durban. A provincial economic official estimated the overall infrastructure damage at more than 10 billion rand ($684.6 million).
The province's premier, Sihle Zikalala, said the death toll had risen to 443, with a further 63 people unaccounted for.
In some of the worst-affected areas, residents said they were terrified by the thought of more rain, which was forecast to fall on Sunday. Some faced an agonising wait for news of missing loved ones.
""We haven't lost hope. Although we are constantly worried as (the) days continue,"" Sbongile Mjoka, a resident of Sunshine village in the eThekwini municipality whose 8-year-old nephew has been missing for days.
""We are traumatised by the sight of rain,"" Mjoka, 47, told Reuters, adding that her home had been badly damaged.
In a nearby semi-rural area, three members of the Sibiya family were killed when the walls of the room where they slept collapsed and 4-year-old Bongeka Sibiya is still missing.
""Everything is a harsh reminder of what we lost, and not being able to find (Bongeka) is devastating because we can't grieve or heal. At this stage we are left feeling empty,"" Lethiwe Sibiya, 33, told Reuters.
President Cyril Ramaphosa's office said late on Saturday he had delayed a working visit to Saudi Arabia to focus on the disaster. Ramaphosa will meet cabinet ministers to assess the response to the crisis.
KZN Premier Zikalala told a televised briefing that the floods were among the worst in his province's recorded history.

""We need to summon our collective courage and turn this devastation into an opportunity to rebuild our province,"" he said. ""The people of KwaZulu-Natal will rise from this mayhem.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Securities regulators in the U.S. states of Texas and Alabama on Wednesday ordered an online casino developer to stop selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs), alleging the firm was illegally offering unregistered securities and defrauding the public.
Cyprus-based Sand Vegas Casino Club and co-founders Martin Schwarzberger and Finn Ruben Warnke allegedly offered 11,111 NFTs in a ""high-tech fraudulent securities offering"" to fundraise to build virtual casinos in the metaverse. They also erroneously told potential buyers the tokens were not securities, the Texas State Securities Board said in a statement.
Sand Vegas promised buyers of its Gambler and Golden Gambler NFTs they would share in virtual casino profits, forecasting proceeds of as much as $81,000 each year, the regulators said.
Schwarzberger told Reuters in an email that Sand Vegas is working toward compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as well as state regulators.
""We are absolutely confident we can solve this situation and possibly even lead the way for other NFT projects,"" he said. 
The cease-and-desist order appears to be the first of its kind tied to internet-based virtual environment platforms, colloquially known as the metaverse. It also marks a new frontier for U.S. authorities seeking to clamp down on NFTs, blockchain-based tokens that represent assets such as a piece of digital art. Last month, two men were arrested and charged with scamming NFT buyers worth $1.1 million.
Though this latest case is relatively small, state actions often spark interest from federal regulators. NFTs have seen a surge in investor interest, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not yet offered formal guidance on whether they could be considered securities in some instances.
A spokesperson for OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, said the firm had disabled buying, selling and transferring of Sand Vegas tokens because the collections were in violation of the platform's service terms.

Joe Rotunda, enforcement director at the Texas State Securities Board, said the regulator has spotted a number of securities offerings in the metaverse.
""This is a hot area,"" he told Reuters. ""We are coordinating among states to investigate the offerings and plan enforcement actions if necessary.""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Clashes in Jerusalem that have stoked tensions during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan spread into Sunday, triggering 18 arrests and putting further strain on Israel's coalition government.
Israeli riot police faced off with fireworks-hurling Palestinians in the alleyways of the walled Old City after a visit by Jews to a disputed holy site.
Several passengers on two buses were lightly wounded when stone-throwing Palestinians smashed the vehicles' windows. And a small group of Jewish worshippers was attacked.
Sunday's confrontations were less violent than clashes at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque compound two days earlier, but they were enough to prompt a small but pivotal Arab party to review its membership in Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's ruling coalition, which no longer has a majority in parliament.
The United Arab List - the first party drawn from the country's 21% Arab minority to join an Israeli government - said it was suspending its government membership over Israel's handling of the Al-Aqsa violence and would consider officially resigning if things did not change.
Bennett's coalition controls 60 of 120 seats in parliament, including four from the United Arab List.
Some political commentators said the announcement was a symbolic gesture to take pressure off party leaders during the crisis and it could be resolved by the time parliament reconvenes next month.
The Old City lies in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured in a 1967 war and which Palestinians seek to make the capital of a future state. 

Tensions over Jerusalem fanned an 11-day war last May between Israel and Hamas Islamist militants in the Gaza Strip.
Bennett lost his razor-thin parliamentary majority this month after a lawmaker from his nationalist party quit.

Delivering a sermon on Easter Sunday at Canterbury Cathedral, Justin Welby said the strategy announced last week by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson posed ""serious ethical questions"".
Anyone who arrived in Britain illegally since Jan. 1 could be relocated to Rwanda under the deal.
Johnson's government said it would help to break people-smuggling networks and stem the flow of migrants across the Channel, but it drew immediate and heavy criticism from politicians and charities.
""The details are for politics and politicians. The principle must stand the judgment of God and it cannot,"" Welby said. 
""It cannot carry the weight of our national responsibility as a country formed by Christian values, because sub-contracting out our responsibilities, even to a country that seeks to do well like Rwanda, is the opposite of the nature of God who himself took responsibility for our failures,"" he said.
Welby is the spiritual leader of the worldwide Anglican Communion of about 85 million Christians.

Last year, more than 28,000 migrants and refugees made the crossing from mainland Europe to Britain.
The arrival of migrants on rickety boats has been a source of tension between France and Britain, especially after 27 migrants drowned when their dinghy deflated in November.

Erdogan's comments come amid efforts by Turkey and Israel in recent weeks to normalise their long-strained ties, as part of a regional charm offensive launched by Ankara in 2020.
On Friday, at least 152 Palestinians were wounded in clashes with Israeli riot police inside the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, the latest outbreak in an upsurge of violence that has raised fears of a slide back to wider conflict.
Most of the Palestinian injuries were incurred from rubber bullets, stun grenades and beatings with police batons, the Palestine Red Crescent said.
""During our call, I told Mr Abbas that I strongly condemned Israel's intervention on worshippers at Al-Aqsa Mosque and that we will stand against provocations and threats to its status or spirit,"" Erdogan said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
""Turkey always stands with Palestine,"" he added.
Erdogan later said he had discussed developments at Al-Aqsa with United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres, adding he Israel's ""interventions and provocations"" had ""unacceptable"" results. They also discussed possible joint steps for regional peace, Erdogan added.
Turkey has in the past launched various initiatives within the United Nations and Organisation for Islamic Cooperation (OIC) against Israeli actions towards Palestinians and its policies regarding Jerusalem or its status.
The Al-Aqsa compound sits atop the Old City plateau of East Jerusalem, which was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, and is known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif, or The Noble Sanctuary, and to Jews as Temple Mount.
Tensions this year have been heightened in part by the Muslim holy month of Ramadan coinciding with the Jewish celebration of Passover.
Regional rivals Turkey and Israel expelled ambassadors in 2018 and have often traded barbs over the Palestinian conflict, Turkish support of the Hamas militant group, which runs Gaza, and other issues.
Turkey, which supports a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, has said it believes a rapprochement with Israel will also help find a solution to the issue, but that it would not abandon commitments to Palestinians for better ties with Israel.

Earlier this month, Erdogan had told his Israeli counterpart Isaac Herzog, whom he also met in Ankara last month, that Ankara expected Israeli authorities to be sensitive over Al-Aqsa during Ramadan and stressed the importance of allowing Palestinians to enter Israel.
Last month, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said he would visit Israel and Palestine with Energy Minister Fatih Donmez in mid-May and discuss the re-appointment of ambassadors with his Israeli counterpart during the visit.

PARIS (Reuters) -The party of far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon gave no voting instructions for the French presidential runoff after its internal consultations showed most people would abstain or vote blank on April 24, adding to the uncertainty over the outcome.
President Emmanuel Macron and his far-right challenger Marine Le Pen are looking to attract voters who chose Melenchon, after he came third in the first round on April 10 with about 22% of the vote. 
With the electorate fragmented and undecided, the election will likely be won by the candidate who can reach beyond his or her camp to convince voters that the other option would be far worse.
After the first round, Melenchon called on his supporters not to vote Le Pen, but he stopped short of advocating Macron and said his party would hold a public consultation to help guide the millions who backed him.
According to results published on Sunday, about 215,000 party sympathizers who participated in that, more than 66% said they would abstain, leave their ballot paper blank or spoil it. Just over 33% said they would vote for Macron. The option of voting for Le Pen was not given to respondents.
""The results are not an instruction to vote for anybody... everyone will conclude from this and vote as they see fit,"" Melenchon's campaign team wrote on its website.
Pollsters estimate the overall abstention rate for next Sunday's election at about 30%, similar to the first round.
It is not clear what a high abstention rate either overall or among Melenchon voters would mean for either candidate. Both Macron and Le Pen were able to mobilise their core support in the first round, but are struggling to appeal beyond their own camps.
The vote next Sunday is a repeat of the 2017 match-up in the second round. Then, Macron, a pro-European Union centrist, easily beat Le Pen when voters rallied behind him to keep her party out of power.
This time round he is seen as facing a much tougher challenge, although the latest opinion polls give him a nine-10 point lead over Le Pen.
An IPSOS-Sopra-Steria opinion poll on Saturday showed that some 33% of Melenchon voters would back Macron, with 16% supporting Le Pen on April 24. But 51% of people were undecided.
WOOING MELENCHON VOTERS 
For decades, a ""republican front"" of voters of all stripes rallying behind a mainstream candidate has helped to keep the far right out of power.
But Macron, whose sometimes abrasive style and policies that veered to the right have upset many voters, can no longer automatically count on that sentiment.
Le Pen is going for the more working-class, rural part of the Melenchon base by focusing on the cost of living, rising food costs and high petrol prices following the war in Ukraine.
Macron, meanwhile, is trying to woo the more educated, centre-left and urban segments of Melenchon supporters.
On Saturday he told supporters in Marseille, which voted massively for Melenchon, that he had heard their message and would focus his new presidency on making France free of fossil fuels. He slammed Le Pen as a ""climate sceptic"".
""I don't know what he is basing that on, but I've never been climate sceptic and have a programme that takes into consideration the environment and ecology,"" Le Pen told France 3 television.
Macron's promises to do more on the environment may not hit the spot for some voters. The head of the Green party, Julien Bayou, said the president was not credible on the subject. 

""He had five years to act and he didn't,"" he told Franceinfo radio, adding that the Green call to vote for Macron was purely to stop the far-right coming to power. 
Climate change activists from Extinction Rebellion forced the closure of a main square and avenue in the capital on Saturday, protesting the environmental programmes of both candidates.

Le Pen is challenging Emmanuel Macron in a presidential election with opinion polls showing Macron edging ahead in next Sunday's second round runoff.
The Paris prosecutor's office confirmed that it was studying a report it received from the EU anti-fraud agency OLAF on March 11. 
Investigative website Mediapart wrote on Saturday that the OLAF report claimed Le Pen had misappropriated 140,000 euros of public money with party members in total diverting 617,000 euros. None are accused of profiting directly, but of claiming EU funds for staff and event expenses.
Le Pen's office could not immediately be reached for comment. 
""The French will not be fooled by attempts of the European Union and the European institutions (...) to interfere in the presidential campaign and harm Marine Le Pen,"" National Rally president Jordan Bardella told Europe 1 radio. 
He said his party had filed two legal complaints against OLAF, and that it would be filing a third in response to the report.
Speaking to BFM TV, Le Pen's lawyer Rodolphe Bosselut said his client denied the charges. He said she had yet to be questioned and neither he nor Le Pen had seen the OLAF report.

Le Pen has been under investigation since 2017 as part of a probe into the alleged misuse of European Union funds to pay parliamentary assistants.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis implicitly criticised Russia for dragging Ukraine into a ""cruel and senseless"" conflict and urged leaders to strive for peace as he marked what he called an ""Easter of war"" on Sunday.
The 85-year-old pope made the comments in his ""Urbi et Orbi"" (to the city and the world) address - traditionally an overview of world conflicts - to about 100,000 people in St. Peter's Square.
It was the first Easter since 2019 that the public was allowed into the square to hear the twice-yearly address following two years of COVID-19 restrictions.
Francis dedicated much of the message to Ukraine, comparing the shock of another war in Europe to the shock of the apostles when the gospel says they saw the risen Jesus.
""Our eyes, too, are incredulous on this Easter of war. We have seen all too much blood, all too much violence. Our hearts, too, have been filled with fear and anguish, as so many of our brothers and sisters have had to lock themselves away in order to be safe from bombing,"" he said.
""May there be peace for war-torn Ukraine, so sorely tried by the violence and destruction of the cruel and senseless war into which it was dragged,"" he said.
Moscow describes the action it launched on Feb. 24 as a ""special military operation"".
Francis, who did not mention Russia by name, has already rejected that terminology, calling it a war and previously using terms such as unjustified aggression and invasion.
""Let there be a decision for peace. May there be an end to the flexing of muscles while people are suffering,"" Francis said on Sunday, going on to thank those who had taken in refugees from Ukraine, most of whom have gone to Poland. 
Earlier this month in Malta, Francis implicitly criticised Russian President Vladimir Putin over the invasion, saying a ""potentate"" was fomenting conflict for nationalist interests.
NUCLEAR SPECTRE
Francis again raised the spectre of the war leading to a nuclear conflict, something he has spoken of several times since the Russian invasion began.
This time, he quoted the 1955 manifesto by philosopher Bertrand Russell and physicist Albert Einstein: ""Shall we put an end to the human race, or shall mankind renounce war?""
Francis, who suffers from leg pain, appeared comfortable during the long Mass that preceded the ""Urbi et Orbi"" address, and then toured the crowd in the square and a nearby street while sitting in an open white pope mobile.
Afterwards, he read most of the address from the balcony sitting down, standing only at the start and for the final blessing.
On Saturday night, he attended but did not preside at an Easter vigil service, apparently to rest up for Sunday, the most important day in the Christian liturgical calendar.
""Please, let us not get used to war,"" Francis said, looking down on the square bedecked by tens of thousands of flowers donated by the Netherlands.
""Let us all commit ourselves to imploring peace, from our balconies and in our streets. May the leaders of nations hear people's plea for peace.""

""I hold in my heart all the many Ukrainian victims, the millions of refugees and internally displaced persons, the divided families, the elderly left to themselves, the lives broken and the cities razed to the ground,"" he said.
He also called for reconciliation among Israelis and Palestinians and among the people of Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Libya, Myanmar, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, which he is due to visit in July.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Remaining Ukrainian forces in the southern port of Mariupol are still fighting and continue to defy a Russian demand that they surrender, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Sunday. 
""The city still has not fallen,"" Shmyhal told ABC's ""This Week"" program, adding that Ukrainian soldiers continue to control some parts of the city. 
""So there is no whole control"" of Mariupol by Russian forces, Shmyhal said. 
Shmyhal said that he and Ukrainian finance officials will seek more financial assistance this week during International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Washington.

""We need more money for executing of our humanitarian and social obligations,"" Shmyhal said. ""Now, only half of our economy is working. So we ask for financial support.""

In March, Finland and Sweden, which are both considering joining the U.S.-led military NATO alliance, conducted combined NATO military drills. The exercise was long planned, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 added intensity to the war game. Moscow describes its actions in Ukraine as a ""special military operation"". 
""The recent increase in NATO's activity in the Arctic is a cause for concern. Another large-scale military exercise of the alliance was recently held in northern Norway. In our view, this does not contribute to the security of the region,"" Korchunov said.
According to Korchunov, such activity raises the risk of ""unintended incidents"", which, in addition to security risks, can also cause serious damage to the Arctic ecosystem.
He did not specify what type of incident he might be referring to.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Ramadan bombings in Thailand's Muslim-majority deep south will not derail peace talks with separatist rebels, the government said on Sunday after a sidelined insurgent group claimed responsibility for the attacks.
Two explosions on Friday, which killed a civilian and injured three policemen, were carried out by ""G5"", a militant group of the Patani United Liberation Organisation (PULO), its president, Kasturi Mahkota, told Reuters.
PULO has been excluded from the talks between the Bangkok and the Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN), which agreed two weeks ago to stop violence during the Muslim holy month through May 14.
More than 7,300 people have been killed since 2004 in the fighting between the government and shadowy groups seeking independence for the Malay-Muslim provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and parts of Songkhla. The area was part of the Patani sultanate that Thailand annexed in a 1909 treaty with Britain. 
Government negotiators condemned the violence in an email to Reuters on Sunday but said the truce agreement with the BRN remains in effect. Coordinators from both sides were working closely to prevent others from spoiling the talks, they said.
""The bringing together of groups for the peace dialogue is an internal matter for the other side, and the Thai team is ready and happy to talk to all groups,"" the government delegation wrote.
The BRN declined to comment.

The talks seek a political solution to the decades-long conflict under the framework of the Thai constitution. Talks have been frequently disrupted since beginning in 2013. The latest round started in 2019.
PULO's Kasturi told Reuters on Saturday that ""the talks are not inclusive enough and it is going too fast."" The insurgent group objects to the agreement that would exclude the possibility of independence from Buddhist-majority Thailand.

The number of prisoners released in the annual amnesty was a fraction of last year's 23,000. It was unclear whether it would include jailed members of the civilian government overthrown in a Feb. 1, 2021 coup.
A local reporter on the scene told Reuters that no political protesters had been released so far from Insein.
Lieutenant General Aung Lin Dwe, a state secretary of the junta, signed a statement announcing ""1,619 prisoners, including 42 detained foreigners, will be released under the Amnesty as part of the celebration of Myanmar's new year, to bring joy for the people and address humanitarian concerns.""
The military has arrested at least 13,282 people and killed 1,756 opponents since the coup, according to the Assistance Association of Political Prisoners (AAPP) activist group.
Among those detained are the ousted government's leader, Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, being held in the capital Naypyidaw, and her Australian economic adviser, Sean Turnell, who is in the Insein facility on the outskirts of Yangon.
""The junta uses the political prisoners as hostages,"" an AAPP spokesman told Reuters on Sunday. A spokesman for the junta, which has disputed AAPP's figures, did not respond to a request for comment.
Standing near plainclothes police on Sunday, nervous-looking families held placards with names of their loved ones, said the local reporter, who asked not to be named for security reasons.
The mother of a 22-year-old protester arrested eight months ago told the reporter she was waiting outside Insein after her son wrote saying he might be released in an April amnesty.

Another mother, whose police officer son was arrested in June for participating in the Civil Disobedience Movement against the junta, said she had waited outside the prison several times during previous amnesty periods.
""I have a feeling he will be freed today,"" she added, asking not to be named for fear of retaliation, the reporter said.

The incident has increased already simmering tensions between the neighbours.
Taliban authorities on Saturday summoned Pakistan's ambassador in Kabul on Saturday to protest against the strikes. A local Taliban official and residents said the strikes were carried out by Pakistani aircraft inside Afghan airspace.
""In the last few days, incidents along Pak-Afghan border have significantly increased, wherein, Pakistani security forces are being targeted from across the border,"" Pakistan's foreign office said in a statement on Sunday. 
It added the attacks were being carried out ""with impunity"" and that Islamabad had repeatedly asked Afghan authorities to act to stop them, but to no avail.
It said seven Pakistani soldiers were killed in the border area of North Waziristan on Thursday. North Waziristan borders the eastern Afghan province of Khost, where the strikes are said to have taken place on Friday. 
Taliban authorities say they have controlled cross-border attacks since taking over the country in August last year.
Pakistan's foreign office did not confirm the strikes, nor addressed if they were carried out by aircraft, which would be the first time a military incursion is officially confirmed. 
Pakistan's embassy in Kabul denied it carried out air strikes.
The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) expressed concern on the incident.
""UNAMA is deeply concerned by reports of civilian casualties, including women and children, as a result of airstrikes in Khost & Kunar provinces,"" the body said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), adding it was working to establish the facts and verify losses. 
There was no confirmation of the death toll. A local Taliban official in Khost claimed at least 36 people, including civilians, had been killed.

The Taliban government spokesman released a strongly-worded statement warning Islamabad of ""bad consequences"" if there was a repeat.

Six police officers and several others were injured on Saturday during scuffles that marred the procession at a festival in Jahangirpuri, a suburban section of New Delhi.
""Remaining rioters are being identified for strict legal action,"" the police said.
There were no reported deaths from the incident.
In recent weeks, religious clashes have broken out between the majority Hindu and minority Muslim communities during religious processions in several parts of the country. 
The rule of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has emboldened hardline religious groups in recent years to take up causes that they say defend the Hindu faith, although his party has denied any rise in communal tensions during Modi's reign.
Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, who is part of Modi's government, said in an interview published on Sunday that intolerance among religious communities was not worsening, while he played down recent incidents.
""Fringe elements, who are unable to digest the peace and prosperity in the country, try to defame India's inclusive culture and commitment,"" he told The Economic Times newspaper.
He added that it was not the government's job to dictate dietary practices to the people, after university students in New Delhi recently clashed on campus over the serving of non-vegetarian food in the canteen during a week that Hindus consider auspicious.
""Every citizen has freedom in the country to eat food of their choice,"" Naqvi said.
He also dismissed concerns about a controversy earlier this month over Muslim students wearing the hijab head-scarf to school in the southern state of Karnataka, home to the country's tech-sector capital Bengaluru. 

""There is no ban on hijab in India. One can wear hijab in markets and other places,"" he said.
""But every college or institution has a dress code, discipline and decorum. We will have to accept this. If you do not like it, you can choose a different institution.""

(Reuters) - The family of an African refugee killed by a Michigan police officer during a traffic stop demanded on Thursday that authorities dismiss the officer from the force and file criminal charges against him, a day after a video of the fatal shooting was released.
Patrick Lyoya, a 26-year-old Congolese refugee who is Black, was killed in a Grand Rapids neighborhood during a routine traffic stop after he struggled with the officer over a stun gun. The officer has not been publicly identified.
Speaking through a translator at a press conference on Thursday, Lyoya's parents mourned the loss of their first-born son, saying they did not believe that this could happen in the United States.
""My heart is broken to see an officer being on top of my son and to shoot him in the back of his head, my heart is really broken,"" said Peter Lyoya, his father. ""I'm asking for justice for Patrick.""
The family fled violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo for the United States in 2014, according a statement from the governor's office.
Ben Crump, a prominent U.S. civil rights attorney who is representing the family, said the officer did not follow basic training protocols and that the use of fatal force was unnecessary and unjustifiable.
""Another senseless killing of a Black person in America by the very people who are supposed to protect them,"" he said referring to the video footage. ""You see a police officer escalate a minor traffic stop into a deadly execution.""
Crump again called for federal police reform, noting that Lyoya's death is one in a growing list of police killings of racial minorities, including that of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, in situations that could have been de-escalated.
Tamika Palmer, Taylor's mother, was present at the news conference in Grand Rapids. 
After the release of the videos, hundreds of demonstrators gathered to protest the shooting, call for accountability and demand police reform, the Detroit Free Press reported.
Lyoya, who was driving with a front seat passenger on April 4, was pulled over after the officer ran the car's license plate and discovered it did not match the vehicle. 
He exited the vehicle and the officer sought to detain him. A short foot chase followed and ended on the lawn of a home where Lyoya attempted to block the officer from using his Taser, video footage shows.
The two had fell to the ground when the officer drew his firearm and fired one shot in the back of his head, video footage shows.

The officer, who has not been charged, is on paid leave and under investigation by the Michigan State Police. 
Kent County prosecutors told CNN on Wednesday that a decision about criminal charges would be made after the investigation has concluded.

SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korean leader Kim Jong Un observed the test firing of a new type of tactical guided weapon aimed at boosting the country's nuclear capabilities, the North's KCNA state news agency reported on Sunday.
The report comes amid signs North Korea could soon resume nuclear testing according to South Korean and U.S. officials and after Kim broke a self-imposed moratorium on intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) testing with a launch last month. 
South Korea's military said on Sunday it had detected two projectiles launched on Saturday from the North's east coast towards the sea. The projectiles flew about 110 km (70 miles) with an apogee of 25 km and maximum speed of less than Mach 4, indicating they were short-range missiles.
The KCNA report gave no details on the launch but linked it to the North's nuclear objectives.
""The new-type tactical guided weapon system ... is of great significance in drastically improving the firepower of the frontline long-range artillery units and enhancing the efficiency in the operation of tactical nukes,"" KCNA said.
It said Kim ""gave important instructions on further building up the defence capabilities and nuclear combat forces of the country.""
North Korea has been developing short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) that analysts say are designed to evade missile defences and strike targets in the South.
On April 5, Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of leader Kim, said North Korea opposes war but would use nuclear weapons to strike South Korea if attacked, in a warning seen aimed at the South's incoming conservative president, Yoon Suk-yeol.
Yoon spokesperson Bae Hyun-jin said there was nothing new or surprising in the North's ""show of force"" as a new administration comes in.
President Moon Jae-in, who will leave office on May 10, has received real-time briefings on the North's missile launch, his office said. 
RESTORING NUCLEAR TEST SITE
The weapon appears to be the North's first tactical nuclear-weapons delivery system, said Ankit Panda, senior fellow at the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, citing indications of work to restore North Korea's Punggye-ri nuclear test site.
""You don't have to be particularly imaginative to put this two and two together,"" Panda said.
U.S. and South Korean officials have noted activity at the Punggye-ri site which could be preparations for a test, although the timing and nature of that were unclear.
As early as 2017, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency assessed that North Korea was able to miniaturise nuclear weapons across the spectrum of its missiles, from SRBMs to ICBMs. 
Kim Jong Un in January 2021 said the country was able to ""miniaturise, lighten and standardise nuclear weapons and to make them tactical ones"". He also outlined goals of developing other weapons such as hypersonic missiles and spy satellites, which have been tested this year.
Duyeon Kim, a North Korea expert at the U.S.-based Center for a New American Security, said the timing could be taken as a protest against anticipated joint U.S.-South Korea military drills, which Pyongyang has long denounced as a war rehearsal. 
The United States and South Korea plan to launch the annual springtime exercise on Monday for a nine-day run, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said. 
On Saturday the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division, based in South Korea, shared photos of troops test-firing a multiple-launch rocket system, although the timing of the event was not indicated.
A U.S. Defense Department spokesperson on Sunday acknowledged the latest missile test. ""We are aware of the North Korean statement that they conducted a test of a long-range artillery system,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Marty Meiners.
U.S. nuclear envoy Sung Kim will visit Seoul on Monday to discuss a response to the North's recent missile launches with his South Korean counterparts. 

The U.S. envoy has said Washington is open to talks without preconditions but Pyongyang has rebuffed those overtures, accusing the United States of hostile policies evidenced by sanctions and military drills.
On Friday, North Korea celebrated the 110th anniversary of the birth of state founder Kim Il Sung.

(Reuters) - Russia's defence ministry has told the Ukrainian forces still fighting in the besieged southern port of Mariupol to lay down their arms starting 6 a.m. Moscow time (0300 GMT) on Sunday to save their lives.
Russia's earlier claim that its troops had cleared the urban area of Mariupol, scene of the war's heaviest fighting and worst humanitarian catastrophe, could not be independently verified. It would be the first major city to have fallen to Russian forces since the Feb. 24 invasion.
Moscow said the remaining fighters in Mariupol - who it says are both Ukrainian and foreign - are blockaded in the Azovstal steelworks plant.
""Taking into account the catastrophic situation that has developed at the Azovstal metallurgical plant, as well as being guided by purely humane principles, the Russian Armed Forces offer the militants of nationalist battalions and foreign mercenaries from 06:00 (Moscow time) on April 17, 2022, to stop any hostilities and lay down their arms,"" the defence ministry said in a statement. 
""All who lay down their arms are guaranteed that their lives will be spared.""
Under the terms of deal proposed by Russia on Saturday, the remaining defenders in the Azovstal plant would leave between 6 a.m. and 1 p.m. Moscow time, without weapons or ammunition.
The start of the surrender would be indicated by raising flags, the ministry said: ""From the Russian side - red; from the Ukrainian side - white, around the whole perimeter of Azovstal.""
There was no immediate reaction from Kyiv to the offer.
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russia on Saturday of ""deliberately trying to destroy everyone"" in Mariupol and said his government was in touch with the defenders. But he did not address Moscow's claim that Ukrainian forces were no longer in urban districts.
""I want to be heard correctly right now: there has not been a single day since the beginning of the blockade of Mariupol that we have not been seeking a solution - military or diplomatic,"" Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. 
""But finding this solution is extremely difficult. Until now, there has not been a 100% realistic option."" 
Mariupol, with its strategic location on the coast of the Azov Sea, has been a target since the start of the war. It lies on the route between the Russian-annexed peninsula of Crimea to the west, and the Donetsk region to the east, which has been partially controlled by pro-Russian separatists since 2014. 
The Russian defence ministry said also that it has ""evacuated"" 168,000 people out of Mariupol so far. Ukraine has said that thousands have been forcefully departed.

Efforts to evacuate civilians from Mariupol - some with the help of the International Committee of the Red Cross - have repeatedly broken down, with both sides blaming each other.
The total capture of Mariupol would give Russia an option to build a land bridge to Crimea and control the entire north shore of the Sea of Azov.

Canberra is concerned the security deal, details of which have not been publicised, could foreshadow a Chinese military presence fewer than 2,000 km (1,200 miles) from Australia. 
Despite a national election campaign putting the Australian government in caretaker mode, an Australian minister this week met with Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare in Honiara and asked him not to sign the proposed agreement. 
Queried over whether Australia would continue security cooperation with the Solomons Islands if the deal went ahead Payne told ABC television: ""Yes, that is absolutely my view and it is the view of Pacific partners"".
""But there is also a concern that there has been a lack of transparency in relation to this agreement,"" Payne said.
She described as ""very important"" recent assurances from Sogavare that no Chinese military base would be established in the Solomons Islands if the deal with China went ahead.
Officials from China and Solomon Islands have initialled but not yet signed the security pact, which Australia, New Zealand, United States and some Pacific island neighbours have criticised as undermining regional stability.

The agreement has sparked concerns among U.S. allies Australia and New Zealand about Chinese influence in a region where they have for decades held strong sway.
Beijing this week said security ties between China and the Pacific nation were not aimed at any third party and did not contradict cooperation Solomons Islands has with other nations.

KYIV/LVIV/MARIUPOL, Ukraine (Reuters) -Russia said its troops had cleared the urban area of Mariupol and only a small contingent of Ukrainian fighters remained inside a steelworks in the besieged southern port on Saturday, as missile strikes hit Ukraine's capital Kyiv and other cities.
Moscow's claim to have all but taken control of Mariupol, scene of the war's heaviest fighting and worst humanitarian catastrophe, could not be independently verified. It would be the first major city to have fallen to Russian forces since the Feb. 24 invasion. 
""The situation is very difficult"" in Mariupol, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the Ukrainska Pravda news portal. ""Our soldiers are blocked, the wounded are blocked. There is a humanitarian crisis ... Nevertheless, the guys are defending themselves."" 
Russia's Defence Ministry said if Ukrainian forces in the Azovstal steelworks lay down their arms starting at 0300 GMT on Sunday, their lives would be spared, Tass news agency said. A senior Russian officer was quoted as saying the offer, made after weeks of fierce fighting, was prompted by ""the catastrophic situation"" in the steelworks as well as ""purely humane principles"".
There was no immediate response from Kyiv.
As Moscow launched long-range missile attacks across the country following the sinking of its Black Sea flagship, Moscow said its warplanes had struck a tank repair factory in Kyiv on Saturday. An explosion was heard and smoke rose over the southeastern Darnytskyi district. The mayor said at least one person was killed and medics were fighting to save others.
The Ukrainian military said Russian warplanes that took off from Belarus had fired missiles at the Lviv region near the Polish border and four cruise missiles were shot down by Ukrainian air defences.
The western city has been relatively unscathed so far and serves as a haven for refugees and international aid agencies.
In Mariupol, Reuters journalists reached the Ilyich steelworks, one of two metals plants where defenders had held out in underground tunnels and bunkers. Moscow claimed to have captured it on Friday.
The factory was reduced to a ruin of twisted steel and blasted concrete, with no sign of defenders present. Several bodies of civilians lay scattered on nearby streets.
The Russian defence ministry said its troops had ""completely cleared"" Mariupol's urban area of Ukrainian forces and blockaded the ""remnants"" in the Azovstal steelworks, RIA news agency said. It said that as of Saturday, Ukrainian forces in the city had lost more than 4,000 personnel.
Later on Saturday, Zelenskiy accused Russia of ""deliberately trying to destroy everyone"" in Mariupol and said his government was in touch with the defenders. But he did not address Moscow's claim that Ukrainian forces were no longer in urban districts.
The governor of Kharkiv province in the east said at least one person was killed and 18 injured in a missile strike. Smoke billowed from burning cars and the remains of what appeared to be an office building in the city.
In Mykolaiv, a city close to the southern front, Russia said it had struck a military vehicle repair factory.
The attacks followed Russia's announcement on Friday it would intensify long-range strikes in retaliation for unspecified acts of ""sabotage"" and ""terrorism"", hours after it confirmed the sinking of its Black Sea flagship, the Moskva.
Kyiv and Washington say the ship, whose sinking has become a symbol of Ukrainian defiance, was hit by Ukrainian missiles. Moscow says it sank after a fire and its crew of around 500 were evacuated. 
Russia's Defence Ministry published video of the head of the navy, Admiral Nikolai Yevmenov, meeting on a parade ground with about a hundred sailors it said were members of the crew. 
A month and a half into President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, Russia is trying to capture territory in the south and east after withdrawing from the north following an assault on Kyiv that was repelled at the capital's outskirts.
Russian troops that pulled out of the north left behind towns littered with bodies of civilians, evidence of what U.S. President Joe Biden this week called genocide.
Russia denies targeting civilians and says the aim of its ""special military operation"" is to disarm its neighbour, defeat nationalists and protect separatists in the southeast.
CAPTURE WOULD BE RUSSIA'S BIGGEST PRIZE
If Mariupol falls it would be Russia's biggest prize of the war so far. It is the main port of the Donbas, a region of two provinces in the southeast which Moscow demands be fully ceded to separatists.
Ukraine says it has so far held off Russian advances elsewhere in the Donbas regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where at least one person was killed in shelling overnight.
Ukraine gained the upper hand in the early phase of a war, in part by successfully deploying mobile units armed with anti-tank missiles supplied by the West against Russian armoured convoys confined to roads by muddy terrain.
But Putin appears determined to capture more Donbas territory to claim victory in a war that has left Russia subject to increasingly punitive Western sanctions and with few allies.
The European Union's forthcoming round of sanctions on Russia will target banks, including Sberbank, as well as oil, the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen told the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag.
The Ukrainian military command in the east of the country, where Kyiv says it expects a major assault, said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post it had repelled 10 attacks on Saturday, destroying 15 tanks, 24 other armoured vehicles and three artillery systems. Reuters could not independently verify the report. 
Zelenskiy told Ukrainian reporters the world should prepare for the possibility Russia might use nuclear weapons. He did not give evidence for the assertion.
Last month, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would resort to nuclear weapons only in the case of a ""threat to the existence"" of the country - and not as a result of the Ukraine conflict.
An advisor to Zelenskiy said the country needed a swifter supply of weapons from its European Union partners.
The Russian defence ministry said its anti-aircraft systems in the Odesa region shot down a Ukrainian transport plane delivering weapons supplied by Western governments. It did not provide any evidence. There was no immediate comment from Kyiv.
Zelenskiy said about 2,500-3,000 Ukrainian troops have been killed so far and up to 20,000 Russian troops. 
Moscow has given no updates on its casualties since March 25, when it said 1,351 had died. Western estimates of Russian losses are many times higher.

Ukraine says civilian deaths are impossible to count, estimating at least 20,000 killed in Mariupol alone.
Overall, around a quarter of Ukrainians have been driven from their homes, including a tenth of the population that has fled abroad.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) -Pope Francis condemned the cruelty of the war in Ukraine on Saturday at an Easter vigil Mass he attended but at which he did not preside, presumably because of leg pain that has forced him to curtail activities.
The Mass was attended by Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of Melitopol, who was detained by Russian forces last month and later freed in a prisoner exchange.
Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re replaced the pope as the main celebrant at the service, which involved a procession in near-total darkness up the central nave of Christendom's largest church.
The pope sat at the front of Saint Peter's Basilica in a large white chair on the side, appeared alert and stood during the reading of the gospel.
He read his homily while sitting but in his normal voice and later rose to baptize seven adult converts to Catholicism.
The pope departed from his prepared text to acknowledge the presence of Fedorov, his family and three Ukrainian parliamentarians sitting in the front.
He spoke of the ""darkness of war, of cruelty"".
""All of us pray for you and with you. We pray because there is so much suffering. We can only give you our company, our prayers and say to you 'courage, we accompany you,'"" Francis said.
He ended by saying ""Christ is risen"" in Ukrainian.
The Vatican said Francis met privately with the Ukrainian delegation before the Mass. 
Presiding at the Mass, which was attended by 5,500 people, would have required long periods of standing during the chanting and gospel readings, genuflecting at the altar.
The 85-year-old pope suffers from sciatica, which causes pain in one leg and results in a pronounced limp. Recently Francis also has had a flare up of pain in his right knee.
The condition appears to come and go.
A programme issued by the Vatican on Friday listed the pope as chief celebrant at the Saturday evening service. The Vatican gave no official reason for the change.
On Friday afternoon, the pope was well enough to walk the entire aisle both at the start and the end of a Good Friday service in the basilica but he did not prostrate himself on the floor as he normally does during that service.
He had to curtail some of his movements during a trip to Malta at the start of April and also had to ask a cardinal to stand in for him at a Mass in December.

The Holy Week activities, which culminate on Sunday, mark the first time since 2019 that the public has been allowed to attend following two years of COVID-19 restrictions.
On Easter Sunday, the most important day in the Christian liturgical calendar, he is due to say Mass in St. Peter's Square and then deliver his twice-yearly ""Urbi et Orbi"" (to the city and the world) message and blessing.

31,"<span>Apr 16, 2022 05:55PM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will seek to put his domestic problems behind him when he visits India this week on a trip to strengthen links between the two countries which have not seen eye to eye over the response to the Ukraine crisis.
Johnson will head to India on Thursday with calls for his resignation ringing in his ears after he was fined for breaking his own COVID-19 lockdown rules by attending a birthday party for him in Downing Street in June 2020. 
Parliament returns from its Easter vacation on Tuesday and Johnson has said he would ""set the record straight"" about gatherings in his office. He had previously told lawmakers there were no parties and guidance was always followed. 
In details released late on Saturday, Johnson's office said the British leader would use his trip to India to deepen relations, including in-depth talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Mod on the two nations' ""strategic defence, diplomatic and economic partnership"".
He will also push for progress in talks on a free trade deal, which Britain is hoping to strike as part of its post-Brexit strategy. His office said such a trade deal was predicted to boost Britain's total trade by up to 28 billion pounds ($36.5 billion) annually by 2035.
But the visit will be overshadowed in part by disagreement over the Ukraine conflict.
Western allies have called for India, which imports arms from Russia, to condemn Russian President Vladimir Putin in stronger terms, and U.S. President Joe Biden earlier this week told Modi that buying more oil from Russia was not in India's interest.
British trade minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan also said last month Britain was very disappointed with India's stance. However, Johnson's office made no direct reference to the conflict, although a source said it was expected Ukraine would be discussed ""among other geopolitical issues"". 
Johnson said India, as a major economic power, was a highly valued strategic partner.
""As we face threats to our peace and prosperity from autocratic states, it is vital that democracies and friends stick together,"" he said in a statement. Last year, he was forced to cancel a planned trip to India because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Last May, the two countries announced a partnership involving more than 530 million pounds of Indian investment into Britain, and Downing Street said Johnson was expected to announce further major investment and new collaboration on cutting-edge science, health and technology.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. border authorities arrested 210,000 migrants attempting to cross the border with Mexico in March, the highest monthly total in two decades and underscoring challenges in the coming months for U.S. President Joe Biden.
The March total is a 24% increase from the same month a year earlier, when 169,000 migrants were picked up at the border, the start of a rise in migration that left thousands unaccompanied children stuck in crowded border patrol stations for days while they awaited placement in overwhelmed government-run shelters.
Biden, a Democrat who took office in January 2021, pledged to reverse many of the hardline immigration policies of his Republican predecessor, former President Donald Trump, but has struggled both operationally and politically with high numbers of attempted crossings.
Republicans, who hope to gain control of the U.S. Congress in Nov. 8 midterm elections, say Biden's rollback of Trump-era policies has encouraged more illegal immigration.
Biden officials have cautioned that migration could rise further after U.S. health officials said they will end a pandemic-era border order by May 23. The order, known as Title 42, allows asylum seekers and other migrants to be rapidly expelled to Mexico to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
While more than half of the migrants encountered at the U.S.-Mexico border in recent months have been from the traditional sending countries of Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, migrants have increasingly been arriving from more far-flung places, including Ukraine and Russia.
U.S. officials are preparing for as many as 18,000 migrant encounters per day in the coming weeks, but are also readying for smaller increases.
The 210,000 migrants arrested in March, a figure made public in a court filing on Friday night, is the highest monthly total on record since February 2000, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection statistics dating back to 2000.

Another 11,000 migrants attempted to enter at a legal crossing along the southwest border in March without a valid visa or permission, the court filing said. 
Roughly half of the migrants encountered in March were expelled under the Title 42 order, the court filing said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Clashes broke out during a Hindu religious procession in the Indian capital New Delhi on Saturday, injuring several people, including policemen, police said, days after similar religious violence in three states. 
Eyewitnesses told Reuters that the violence erupted between Muslims and Hindus during the procession in Jahangirpuri, a suburb of New Delhi. Police said they were still investigating.
""We are still assessing how many people are injured... some policemen have also been hurt,"" said Deependra Pathak, a police official in Jahangirpuri, wearing riot gear.
The violence broke out during a procession to mark the Hindu festival of Hanuman Jayanti, police said without giving more details.
Earlier on Saturday, protesters in New Delhi shouted slogans against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government saying Muslims were violently targeted by authorities in the aftermath of Hindu-Muslim clashes in parts of three states ruled by Modi's Hindu nationalist party.
The clashes last Sunday during a religious festival prompted police to impose a curfew in one town and ban gatherings of more than four people in parts of the states.
Local authorities tore down the homes and shops of suspected Muslim rioters in central Madhya Pradesh state in the aftermath of violence that broke out during the Hindu festival of Ram Navami, according to a police official who did not want to be named.
In Modi's home state, Gujarat, authorities demolished makeshift shops belonging to those they said were involved in the riots in which one man was killed, said an official in Anand district in Gujarat, where the clashes erupted.
Police and local authorities told Reuters after the clashes that they were free from bias and acting within the law.
Opposition politicians have accused Modi's right-wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party of stoking tensions between majority Hindus and Muslims in states that it rules.
Leaders of 13 opposition parties have issued a joint statement calling for peace and harmony and after the religious clashes.

""We are extremely anguished at the manner in which issues related to food, dress, faith, festivals and language are being deliberately used by sections of the ruling establishment to polarize our society,"" the leaders said.
Police in India's most populous state of Uttar Pradesh on Friday arrested nine people from a hardline Hindu group suspected of torching the home of a Muslim man who married a Hindu woman.

KWANDENGEZI, South Africa (Reuters) -Rains that have killed around 400 people and left thousands homeless in South Africa this week began pounding the east coast again on Saturday, threatening more flooding and forcing many to take refuge in community centres and town halls.
The heavy downpours in Kwazulu-Natal Province have already knocked out power lines, shut off water services and disrupted operations at one of Africa's busiest ports of Durban, the main eastern coastal city. 
In Umlazi, one of the country's largest townships, south of Durban, flood victims huddled under blankets in a community hall, while others formed long queues for handouts of food and water donated by charities.
""What makes me angry is that this situation is always happening,"" Mlungeli Mkokelwa, a 53-year-old man who arrived at the settlement a decade ago to look for work that he never found, told Reuters TV. 
""Our possessions keep getting destroyed by continuous floods that should be addressed by authorities. No one ever comes back with a plan to solve it.""
Climate change activists are calling for investments to help communities around the world better prepare for worsening weather, as Africa's southeastern coast is expected to see more violent storms and floods in the coming decades linked to human emissions of heat-trapping gases.
While the east coast suffers more violent rainstorms, other drier parts of the country have in recent years been hit with devastating floods, also blamed on climate change, that have wiped out crops and led to water rationing.
The latest rains, which have left at least 40,000 people with no shelter, power or water this week, are expected to continue until early next week. 
""We've got no water, no electricity, even our phones are dead. We're stuck,"" said Gloria Linda, sheltering under a large umbrella by a muddy road in her Kwandengezi township, about 30 kilometres (20 miles) inland from Durban, before meandering down a dirt track to a funeral of a friend killed by the floods.
Elsewhere in Kwandengezi, a family stood in the rain looking at their collapsed metal shack, one of several homes that lay in ruins.

State broadcaster SABC said on Saturday the death toll was now 398, with 27 people still missing. In places wrecked by flooding, many relatives were searching only to recover victims' bodies for burial.
""We phoned the police, we phoned the ambulance, we phoned fire brigade, none of them responded in time,"" Muzi Mzobe, 59, a prefessional landlord in Kwandengezi, told Reuters in front of a pile of rubble -- what was left of a house he was renting out to tenants who were killed in it.

PARIS (Reuters) -Thousands of anti-far right protesters marched across France on Saturday as opponents of presidential candidate Marine Le Pen seek to form a united front to prevent her from winning an election runoff against incumbent Emmanuel Macron on April 24.
Macron, a pro-European Union centrist, won the presidency in 2017 after easily beating Le Pen when voters rallied behind him in the runoff to keep her far-right party out of power. 
This year, the first round of voting last Sunday set up the same battle, but Macron is facing a much tougher challenge.
In central Paris, thousands of people gathered chanting anti-far right slogans and warning of democratic upheaval if Le Pen were to win. One banner read: ""Against the far-right. For justice and equality, not Le Pen at the Elysee,"" referring to the French president's official residence. 
""If the far-right is in power we will see a major collapse of the democratic, anti-racism and progressive camps,"" Dominique Sopo, president of SOS Racism, which along with dozens of rights groups, unions and associations called for the protests, told Reuters. 
""People need to realise that despite their anger towards Emmanuel Macron and his policies, there is no equivalence between a liberal, conservative candidate and a far-right candidate.""
Police had warned of possible incidents as demonstrators convened in some 30 cities, but the protests ended peacefully.
Macron, who held a rally in Marseille as he tries to convince left-wing voters to pick him on April 24, is slightly ahead in opinion polls.
""The far-right is a risk to our country,"" he told supporters overlooking the Mediterranean port city, which put far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon first on April 10. ""Don't heckle them! Beat them!,"" he said. 
Prior to the first round of the election Le Pen successfully tapped into anger over the cost of living and a perception that Macron is disconnected from everyday hardships. That saw her finish with 23.1% of votes compared to 27.85% for Macron. 
However, she has appeared more rattled this week as the focus has turned to her manifesto and opinion polls have shown Macron extend his lead. An IPSOS-Sopra-Steria poll on Saturday showed the president winning the runoff with 55.5% of votes. 
He has won backing from former presidents Nicolas Sarkozy and Francois Hollande. Hundreds of celebrities and sporting figures have also endorsed him to block Le Pen coming to power.
DEEPLY UNDEMOCRATIC PROTESTS
Le Pen, whose stance is anti-immigration and eurosceptic, has sought in recent years to soften her image and that of her National Rally party. Opponents, including Macron, have said her programme is full of lies and false promises - an accusation Le Pen has rejected.
Speaking to reporters on a campaign stop in southern France, Le Pen dismissed the planned protests as undemocratic.
""The establishment is worried,"" she said. ""That people are protesting against election results is deeply undemocratic. I say to all these people just go and vote. It's as simple as that."" 
With the electorate fragmented and undecided, the election will likely be won by the candidate who can reach beyond his or her camp to convince voters that the other option would be far worse.
For decades, a ""republican front"" of voters of all stripes rallying behind a mainstream candidate has helped to keep the far right out of power.
But Macron, whose sometimes abrasive style and policies that veered to the right have upset many voters, can no longer automatically count on that backing.
Highlighting how, for some voters, picking Macron is no easy decision, one banner read in Paris: ""Neither Le Pen, neither Macron.""

Climate change activists from Extinction Rebellion had earlier forced the closure of a main square and avenue in the capital, protesting the environmental programmes of both candidates.
""This election leaves us no choice between a far-right candidate with repugnant ideas ... and a candidate who during five years cast the ecology issue aside and lied,"" Lou, 26, a history teacher, who joined the Extinction Rebellion movement two years ago, told Reuters.

FUENTES DE ANDALUCIA, Spain (Reuters) - A peaceful white-walled village in southern Spain has changed its name to Ukraine in solidarity with those caught up in the conflict more than 4,000 km (2,500 miles) away. 
On a sign at a roundabout at the village's entrance, Ukraine has replaced Fuentes de Andalucia and the country's blue and yellow flag has been painted alongside. 
Streets have been renamed City of Kyiv, Odesa and Mariupol in the village of more than 7,100 inhabitants east of Seville. 
""The main objective is to raise awareness about the conflict in Ukraine but also about where countries are at war in current times,"" Francisco Martinez told Reuters as he stood in City of Kiev street. 
Martinez said the name change was more than a gesture and villagers had also raised 3,500 euros ($3,780) within two days towards a planned refugee centre. The village wants to offer homes to up to 25 refugees at the centre or with families. 
Rafael Osuna, 68, a pensioner, said he would take a Ukrainian couple into his house.

""The people of Fuentes are very proud of what we are doing,"" he said. ""As I live alone and have a big house I have thought of taking in a Ukrainian couple for a while.""

The astronauts landed nine hours after they left a key module of China's first space station.
While in orbit, the Shenzhou-13 mission astronauts took manual control in the Tianhe living quarters module for what state media called a ""docking experiment"" with the Tianzhou-2 cargo spacecraft.
Following their launch in October, the astronauts - Zhai Zhigang, Ye Guangfu and a female crew member Wang Yaping - spent 183 days in space, completing the fifth of 11 missions needed to finish the space station by the end of the year.
Shenzhou-13 was the second of four planned crewed missions to complete construction of the space station, which began last April. Shenzhou-12 returned to Earth in September.
China's next two missions will be Tianzhou-4, a cargo spacecraft, and the three-person Shenzhou-14 mission, Shao Limin, deputy technology manager of Manned Spaceship System was quoted by state media as saying.

Barred by the United States from participating in the International Space Station (ISS) in orbit, China has spent the past decade developing technologies to build its own space station, the only one in the world other than the ISS.
China, which aims to become a space power by 2030, has successfully launched probes to explore Mars and became the first country to land a spacecraft on the far side of the Moon.

A local Taliban official and residents said 36 people were killed in air strikes on Friday by Pakistani aircraft entering Afghan airspace. Pakistan denied it carried out the strikes.
Islamabad claims militants carry out attacks inside Pakistan by crossing its lawless western border with Afghanistan. Taliban authorities say they have controlled the attacks since taking over the country in August last year. 
A statement from Afghanistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Pakistan's Ambassador in Kabul had been summoned over the recent attacks in Khost and Kunar provinces and given a diplomatic demarche to deliver to Islamabad. 
""Military violations including those in Khost and Kunar must be prevented as such acts deteriorate relations ... allowing antagonists to misuse the situation leading to undesired consequences,"" the statement quoted acting Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi as saying. 
The statement did not elaborate on the nature of the strikes, but a local Taliban leader in Khost, Mawlawi Mohammad Raes Helal, said two districts were bombed by Pakistani helicopters and that 36 people had been killed.
The claim was echoed by some residents, but the Pakistan embassy spokesman denied there had been air strikes and told Reuters the ambassador and Taliban authorities discussed a resolution of border issues.
There was no official confirmation of the death toll.
Pakistan has enjoyed good relations with the Taliban for years even though Islamabad was officially an ally of the United States during its 20-year occupation of Afghanistan.
Since the Taliban took over Afghanistan, there have been numerous standoffs along the 2,600 km (1,615 mile) border with Pakistan - drawn by British colonial rulers and disputed by Kabul.
Increasingly frustrated by continuing militant attacks, Pakistan's military has stepped up operations along the Afghan border in recent months.

TROSTYANETS, Ukraine (Reuters) - The handmade sign on the gate warns ""The cemetery is mined. Danger."" but residents of the formerly occupied town of Trostyanets in northern Ukraine still come to visit the fresh graves of family killed in the war.
The graveyard in this town in Sumy region has only been partly made safe since Russian forces planted mines there as they pulled back in early April, cemetery manager Olena Matvienko said.
""De-mining teams came later and de-mined it partially. Then they didn't go further inside,"" Matvienko said on Saturday, standing in the cemetery where a number of gravestones were shattered or riddled with bullet holes.
Some areas were still dangerous for people, she said.
Even so mourners gathered around different graves, some clutching bunches of spring flowers. 
One of those disregarding the warnings was Natalia Evdokimova, 46. She and her husband were visiting the grave of their son Dmytro, a Ukrainian soldier who was killed on the northeastern frontline on March 29 and buried back home soon after Russian forces left the area.
She said her son, who was fighting near the town of Izyum in Kharkiv region, had been most worried about what might happen to his parents under Russian occupation.
""'Mom, leave, it will be too dangerous in Trostyanets,’"" Evdokimova recalled him saying, tears spilling down her cheeks. ""And he went to hell himself, near Izyum. And died there.""
Her husband stood silently at the flower-heaped grave. Before they left, Evdokimova reached both her hands towards a framed photo of her son that was attached to the grave marker, as if trying to hug him.
Russia denies its troops kill or target civilians or have carried out war crimes in occupied areas of Ukraine since the Feb. 24 invasion. Reuters could not independently verify casualty estimates or accounts of deaths in Trostyanets. 
The cemetery manager said a further 20 people had recently been buried in the cemetery, who had died while Trostyanets was occupied.

Mayor Yuri Bova told Reuters that at least 50 people are estimated to have died or been killed while Russian forces controlled the town, which had a pre-war population of around 20,000.
""Some of them were just shot on the street, some were found with tied hands, eyes taped. We found people in villages shot in the head,"" he said.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistan's new ruling alliance took control of the lower house of parliament on Saturday with the election of a new speaker, cementing control of the assembly after former premier Imran Khan was ousted in a no-confidence vote.
The previous speaker and his deputy, both Khan allies, had attempted to block and then delay the vote, only for the country's top court to deem their actions illegal. 
The lower house of parliament eventually voted in favour of removing Khan from office on Sunday.
The new ruling alliance has already elected their candidate, Shehbaz Sharif as the new prime minister.
The new speaker is Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, a former prime minister who belongs to the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), part of the new ruling alliance. He was elected unopposed in the absence of Khan's party, which resigned en masse from the house on Monday. 
""Raja Pervaiz Ashraf took oath as the 22nd Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan,"" said a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account run by the staff of Pakistan's National Assembly, the lower house of parliament.

The resignations are yet to be fully processed. If accepted, Pakistan faces the prospect of close to 100 by-elections within two months, a major distraction for Sharif and his coalition partners and a potential platform for Khan to mobilise support.
Sharif is expected to name his cabinet in the coming days with a number of policy challenges facing the new government, in particular dealing with an economy in deep trouble.

She had been searching with a growing sense of foreboding since Monday's disaster. Then her elder son, Zamani, 23, got a call on Thursday from some other townspeople who had discovered a body by the river. It was Baphiwe, her 17-year-old.
Mtshali's daughter was one of about 400 people, possibly more, killed in extremely powerful rains that battered the coast, leaving about 13,600 people homeless and numerous families in mourning for lost relatives. 
There is no sign of Mtshali's 11-year-old daughter, Ntwenhle. She has lost hope of finding her alive in her township by a river on the outskirts of Durban, the port city at the epicentre of the floods that have upended the lives of 40,000 people. 
""I feel numb, blank and still empty,"" she told Reuters at the wreckage of her home which had collapsed into a pile of rubble falling into a gash in the earth. 
""There is nothing I can do except to keep looking for my youngest so that they can both be buried together. I don't think I can recover,"" she said, staring wistfully into the distance. ""The loss is too deep.""
SHATTERED LIVES
South Africans were still searching for survivors on Friday, and the government has mobilised emergency funds to bring relief to the thousands without shelter, power or water - a tragedy experts say will become more common as the climate warms. 
Others simply sought closure by finding the dead.
""The body was naked and covered in sand. But I could see that it was my sister,"" security guard Zamani said of his sibling, a promising student who dreamt of being a scientist. 
""I covered her body, and took her away.""

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine's richest man has pledged to help rebuild the besieged city of Mariupol, a place close to his heart where he owns two vast steelworks that he says will once again compete globally.
Rinat Akhmetov has seen his business empire shattered by eight years of fighting in Ukraine's east but remains defiant, sure that what he calls ""our brave soldiers"" will defend the Sea of Azov city reduced to a wasteland by seven weeks of bombardment.
For now, though, his Metinvest company, Ukraine's biggest steelmaker, has announced it cannot deliver its supply contracts and while his financial and industrial SCM Group is servicing its debt obligations, his private power producer DTEK ""has optimised payment of its debts"" in an agreement with creditors.
""Mariupol is a global tragedy and a global example of heroism. For me, Mariupol has been and will always be a Ukrainian city,"" Akhmetov said in written answers to questions from Reuters.
""I believe that our brave soldiers will defend the city, though I understand how difficult and hard it is for them,"" he said, adding he was in daily contact with the Metinvest managers who run the Azovstal and Illich Iron and Steel Works plants in Mariupol.
On Friday, Metinvest said it would never operate under Russian occupation and that the Mariupol siege had disabled more than a third of Ukraine's metallurgy production capacity.
Akhmetov praised President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's ""passion and professionalism"" during the war, seemingly smoothing relations after the Ukrainian leader last year said plotters hoping to overthrow his government had tried to involve the businessman. 
Akhmetov called the allegation ""an absolute lie"" at the time.
""And the war is certainly not the time to be at odds... We will rebuild the entire Ukraine,"" he said, adding that he returned to the country on Feb. 23 and had been there ever since. 
'A MARSHALL PLAN FOR UKRAINE'
Akhmetov did not say where exactly he was, but that he had been in Mariupol on Feb. 16, the day some western intelligence services had expected the invasion to begin. ""I talked to people in the streets, I met with workers...,"" he said.
""My ambition is to return to a Ukrainian Mariupol and implement our (new production) plans so that Mariupol-produced steel can compete in global markets as before.""
Russia invaded on Feb. 24 when President Vladimir Putin announced a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" the country. Kyiv and its Western allies reject that as a false pretext for an unprovoked attack.
Akhmetov, long Ukraine's richest man, has seen his business empire shrink since 2014, when Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and two eastern Ukrainian regions - Donetsk and Luhansk - proclaimed independence from Kyiv.
According to Forbes magazine, Akhmetov's net worth in 2013 reached $15.4 billion. It currently stands at $3.9 billion. 
""For us, the war broke out in 2014. We lost all of our assets both in Crimea and in the temporarily occupied territory of Donbas. We lost our businesses, but it made us tougher and stronger,"" he said.
""I am confident that, as the country's biggest private business, SCM will play a key role in the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine,"" he said, citing officials as saying the damage from the war has reached $1 trillion.

""We will definitely need an unprecedented international reconstruction programme, a Marshall Plan for Ukraine,"" he said, in reference to the U.S. aid project that helped rebuild Western Europe after World War Two.
""I trust that we all will rebuild a free, European, democratic, and successful Ukraine after our victory in this war.""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai rebels sidelined from peace talks claimed responsibility on Saturday for deadly bombings in the country's Muslim-majority deep south that broke a Ramadan holiday agreed between the main rebel group and the government.
The two explosions on Friday, which killed a civilian and injured three policemen, were carried out by ""G5"", a militant group of the Patani United Liberation Organisation (PULO), its president, Kasturi Mahkota, told Reuters.
More than 7,300 people have been killed since 2004 in the fighting between the government and shadowy groups seeking independence for the Malay-Muslim provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and parts of Songkhla. The area was part of the Patani sultanate that Thailand annexed in a 1909 treaty with Britain. 
Mahkota said by telephone the blasts in Pattani province represent ""business as usual"" for PULO, left out of the talks between the government and the Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN), which agreed two weeks ago to stop violence during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan through May 14.
A spokesman for the Thai security forces in the south, Colonel Kiatisak Neewong, said without naming PULO that a group not included in the peace talks were likely responsible for bombings aimed at disrupting the Ramadan truce.
The Thai team at the peace talks and the BRN declined to comment.

""The talks are not inclusive enough and it is going too fast,"" said Kasturi, whose group objects to the agreement that would exclude the possibility of independence from Buddhist-majority Thailand.
The talks seek a political solution to the decades-long conflict under the framework of the Thai constitution. Talks have been frequently disrupted since beginning in 2013. The latest round started in 2019.

Ankara has criticised the invasion and sold drones to Kyiv despite Russian objections. But it has also opposed Western sanctions against Moscow and maintained a careful rhetoric by refraining from accusing either country over the conflict, even amid reports of war crimes in parts of Ukraine. 
""We would be happy if Turkey joined the sanctions"" and cut flights from Russia. ""But we understand this reality,"" the diplomat told foreign journalists on Friday on condition of anonymity.
""...Instead of criticising Turkey we are working with the Turkish side as much as possible, and not demanding something that is improbable,"" the person added, noting that it was still the only country that had managed to bring together Russian and Ukrainian officials for peace talks.
Turkey, which relies heavily on Russian energy imports and tourists, has emerged as a safe haven for Russians fleeing fallout from the sanctions, and many have invested in Turkish property. 
The diplomat cited data showing more than 100,000 Russians had arrived in Turkey and sought residence documents since the war began. Over the same period, however, some 85,000 Ukrainians have also arrived, of whom around 47,000 have since moved on to other countries or returned home, the person said.
Turkey has also barred some Russian warships from transiting its straits to the Black Sea, thereby ""saving"" Ukraine's coastal city of Odessa, which has resisted Russian attacks, the diplomat said. 

Some Russian vessels are still transiting and could bring supplies from Syrian waters, the diplomat said, adding: ""We are asking the Turkish side to monitor what they are bringing from Syria to Russia."" 
Turkey opposes Russia's policies in Syria and Libya and its 2014 annexation of Crimea but has bought Russia's S-400 missile defence system, for which Ankara was hit with U.S. sanctions in December 2020.

Beijing blamed the lawmakers, who included chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Bob Menendez, for raising tensions with their ""provocative"" trip. China claims democratically ruled Taiwan as its own territory.
In a statement late on Friday, Taiwan's Foreign Ministry condemned China's ""recalcitrant and ridiculous"" reaction to the two-visit, the first by a group of U.S. lawmakers this year.
""The threat of force by the Chinese Communist Party's totalitarian government against Taiwan will only strengthen the Taiwanese people's will to defend freedom and democracy, and will also attract support for democratic Taiwan from the United States and even more democratic partners,"" it said.
Taiwan will continue to deepen cooperation with the United States and other like-minded countries to defend the free and open Indo-Pacific region, and prevent China's ""continuous expansion"", the ministry said.
Senator Ben Sasse, one of the six bipartisan lawmakers who visited Taiwan and met President Tsai Ing-wen, said in a statement that China could not bully the United States or its elected representatives.
""The American people have no love of tyrants and instead instinctively support the freedom-loving people of Taiwan,"" he said.
Taiwan has been heartened by the U.S. support offered by the Biden administration, which has repeatedly talked of its ""rock-solid"" commitment to the democratically governed island.
While the United States has no formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, it is the island's most important international supporter and arms supplier. That has added to strains in Sino-U.S. relations.
Taiwan's government says only the island's 23 million people can decide their future.

In a pre-recorded video message to a forum organised by Taiwan independence groups on Saturday, Tsai said Russia's invasion of Ukraine showed the threat democracies face from authoritarianism.
""Taiwan's position is to uphold sovereignty, uphold democracy, stand with like-minded countries, assist each other, and contribute our strength,"" she said.

52,"<span>Apr 16, 2022 01:16AM ET</span>",,,,,,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) -At least 152 Palestinians were injured in clashes with Israeli riot police inside Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque compound on Friday, the latest outbreak in a recent upsurge of violence that has raised fears of a slide back to wider conflict. 
Most of the Palestinian injuries were incurred from rubber bullets, stun grenades and beatings with police batons, the Palestine Red Crescent said, at the most sensitive site in the generations-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
Israeli security forces have been on high alert after a series of deadly Arab street attacks throughout the country over the past two weeks. Confrontations at the Al-Aqsa compound in Jerusalem's walled Old City pose the risk of a relapse into a broader conflagration like last year's Gaza war.
The Al-Aqsa compound sits atop the Old City plateau of East Jerusalem, which was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, and is known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif, or The Noble Sanctuary, and to Jews as Temple Mount.
Tensions this year have been heightened in part by Ramadan coinciding with the Jewish celebration of Passover.
In a statement, Israeli police said hundreds of Palestinians hurled firecrackers and stones at their forces and toward the nearby Jewish prayer area of the Western Wall in the Old City after Ramadan morning prayers. 
It said police then entered the Al-Aqsa compound to ""disperse and push back (the crowd and) enable the rest of the worshippers to leave the place safely."" adding that three officers were injured in the clashes.
Police detained hundreds of Palestinians, a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said in a tweet.
""We are working to restore calm, on the Temple Mount and across Israel. Alongside that, we are preparing for any scenario and the security forces are ready for any task,"" Bennett said.
Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations stepped up their mediation between Palestinian factions - led by the Islamist group Hamas, which runs Gaza - and Israel in a bid to prevent further escalation of violence, a Palestinian official told Reuters.
Hamas demanded that Israel frees nearly 500 people it had detained on Friday, stop ""provocative visits"" to Al-Aqsa mosque by Jewish groups, and end military incursions into West Bank cities.
In a sign of lowering tensions, Israel released all but 100 of those detained, Palestinians said. 
The Palestinian Foreign Ministry, referring to the violence in the holy compound, said it ""holds Israel fully and directly responsible for this crime and its consequences.""
'FLAGRANT VIOLATION'
The international community should intervene immediately to ""stop Israeli aggression against Al-Aqsa mosque and prevent things from going out of control,"" said Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesperson for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas who governs self-ruled areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Jordan, whose Hashemite monarchy is the custodian of Muslim and Christian sanctuaries in East Jerusalem, condemned the Israeli police raid into the compound as ""a flagrant violation"".
Israel recognized the Hashemite role as custodian of Al-Aqsa as part of the two countries' 1994 peace treaty, and maintains overall security control over the site.
U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said tensions should be eased. ""We call on all sides to exercise restraint, avoid provocative actions and rhetoric, and preserve the historic status quo on the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount,"" he said in a statement.
Tor Wennesland, the U.N. special envoy for Middle East peacemaking, urged all sides ""to help calm the situation, avoid spreading inflammatory rhetoric and speak up against those seeking to escalate the situation"".
Last year, there were nightly clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police during the Muslim fasting month. Threats of Palestinian displacement in East Jerusalem and police raids at Al-Aqsa helped ignite an 11-day Israel-Gaza war that killed more than 250 Palestinians in Gaza and 13 people in Israel.
Since last month, Israeli forces have killed 29 Palestinians in the course of carrying out raids in the West Bank after Palestinian assailants killed 14 Israelis in a string of attacks in Israeli cities.

Al-Aqsa is the third holiest site in Islam and also revered by Jews as the location of two ancient temples.
Israel claims all of Jerusalem as its eternal capital. Palestinians seek to make East Jerusalem, including its Muslim, Christian and Jewish holy sites, the capital of a future state.

Throngs of people, many from ultranationalist organizations, joined the march from the city center to the nearby Russian embassy, where they fired signal flares, played Russian and Serbian anthems and hailed the two countries as brotherly nations.
""I came to this rally to support Russia and to say a loud and clear 'no' to policies of authorities in Belgrade who made a shameful decision to vote against Russia in the U.N.,"" said Mladen Obradovic, a protester.
In recent weeks Belgrade voted three times for United Nations' resolutions that condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine and suspended it from the main U.N. human rights body. Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation.""
Still, Serbia, which is almost entirely dependent on Russian gas and oil, refuses to impose sanctions against the Kremlin and it maintains regular flights to Moscow.

Protesters chanted ""No NATO"" and ""Serbians and Russians are brothers,"" and slogans against President Aleksandar Vucic who won the presidential vote on April 3, while his Progressives secured the most votes to form a government. 
Earlier this week, in a move seen by experts as a departure from military cooperation with Russia, Vucic said Serbia was eyeing a purchase of two dozen new and used Western jet fighters.

Some embraced and others laid flowers in memory of the Moskva missile cruiser at a monument to the 1696 foundation of the Russian navy in the centre of Sevastopol, headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet. 
Moscow, which annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, said the ship sank while being towed in stormy seas after a fire caused by an ammunition explosion. 
Ukraine said one of its missiles had caused it to sink. 
Reuters was unable to verify the exact circumstances of the ship's demise.

""There will be victories, there will be tragedies, but the memory remains,"" Gorbachev said.
The crowd, which included a number of people who served on the ship, stood in respectful silence. Some wore the ribbon of St. George, a symbol of the Russian military. 

""The loss of every ship, especially a flagship, is a tragedy for all those tens of thousands of people who served there for over 20 years,"" said priest Georgiy Ployakov.

Frank James, the man accused of carrying out one of the most violent attacks on the city's mass transit system, was arrested in lower Manhattan on Wednesday following a 30-hour manhunt that was helped by a barrage of tips from the public. James, 62, also called the police tipline to turn himself in, aiding in his own capture, according to his lawyers.
""We appreciate all of those who responded to our call for information to locate this suspect, including all of those whose tips did not pan out,"" Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell said in a statement. ""We urged the public to join us in this effort to find this suspect and New Yorkers stepped up.""
James, 62, is accused of injuring 30 people by setting off smoke bombs and spraying the inside of a subway car with gunfire during Tuesday morning's rush-hour commute in Brooklyn. 
Police said 10 people were shot, although all were expected to survive. About 20 others were injured by smoke canisters or in the stampede of terrified passengers pouring out of the subway car onto the platform, according to prosecutors.
The NYPD said its detectives used the flow of public tips to build a timeline of events that helped them locate James. Of the people who provided tips, five were chosen whose ""information contributed directly"" to the suspect's arrest.

The NYPD did not identify the five people who will evenly split the $50,000 reward, which is comprised of funds from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Transport Workers Union Local 100, and the New York City Police Foundation.

KYIV (Reuters) -Ukraine said on Friday it was trying to break Russia's siege of Mariupol as fighting raged around the city's massive steel works and port, and the capital Kyiv was rocked by some of the most powerful explosions in two weeks.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the military situation in the south and east of the country was ""still very difficult,"" while praising the work of his armed forces.
""The successes of our military on the battlefield are really significant, historically significant. But they are still not enough to clean our land of the occupiers. We will beat them some more,"" Zelenskiy said in a late-night video address, calling again for allies to send heavier weapons and for an international embargo on Russian oil.
Russia said it struck what it described as a factory on the outskirts of Kyiv that made and repaired anti-ship missiles, in apparent retaliation for the sinking on Thursday of the Moskva, the flagship of Moscow's Black Sea fleet.
Ukraine said one of its missiles had caused the Moskva to sink, a powerful symbol of its resistance to a better-armed foe. Moscow said the ship sank while being towed in stormy seas after a fire caused by an explosion of ammunition.
The United States believes the Moskva was hit by two Ukrainian missiles and that there were Russian casualties, although numbers were unclear, a senior U.S. official said.
Russia has said more than 500 sailors on board the Moskva were evacuated after the blast. Neither that assertion nor the U.S. assessment could be independently verified.
MARIUPOL REDUCED TO RUBBLE
Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov in southeastern Ukraine, has seen the worst fighting of the seven-week-long war. Home to 400,000 people before Russia's invasion, the city has been reduced to rubble. Thousands of civilians have died and tens of thousands remain trapped in the city.
""The situation in Mariupol is difficult and hard. Fighting is happening right now. The Russian army is constantly calling on additional units to storm the city,"" defence ministry spokesperson Oleksandr Motuzyanyk told a televised briefing, although he said the Russians have not completely captured it.
Motuzyanyk said Russia had used long-range bombers to attack Mariupol for the first time since its Feb. 24 invasion.
In his address, Zelenskiy said Ukraine's allies have the power to make the war much shorter, by sending the weapons his government needs. ""I always tell all our partners ... that the amount of support for Ukraine directly affects the restoration of peace. It literally defines how many more Ukrainians the occupiers will manage to kill,"" he said.
Moscow has said its main war aim is to capture the Donbas, an eastern region already partly held by Russian-backed separatists, after its invasion force was driven from the outskirts of Kyiv this month.
Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said 2,864 people were evacuated from conflict areas on Friday, including 363 people from Mariupol who used their own transport.
Zelenskiy recently made a direct appeal to U.S. President Joe Biden for the United States to designate Russia a ""state sponsor of terrorism,"" the Washington Post reported on Friday, citing people familiar with their conversation.
The list currently includes four countries: North Korea, Cuba, Iran and Syria.
A White House spokesperson declined to respond specifically to the report, adding, ""We will continue to consider all options to increase the pressure on Putin.""
RUSSIA THREATENS STRIKES ON KYIV
If Moscow captures Mariupol, it would be the only big city to fall to the Russians so far.
Russia's defence ministry said it had captured the city's Illich steel works. The report could not be confirmed. 
Ukrainian defenders are mainly believed to be holding out in Azovstal, another huge steel works. 
Both plants are owned by Metinvest - the empire of Ukraine's richest businessman and backbone of Ukraine's industrial east - which told Reuters on Friday it would never let its enterprises operate under Russian occupation.
The Moskva was by far Russia's largest vessel in the Black Sea fleet, equipped with guided missiles to shoot down planes and attack the shore. It had radar to provide air defence cover for the fleet.
Moscow has used its naval power to blockade Ukrainian ports and threaten a potential amphibious landing along the coast. Without its flagship, the largest warship sunk during conflict since Argentina's General Belgrano in the 1982 Falklands war, its ability to menace Ukraine from the sea could be crippled. 
Russia's Defence Ministry said its forces would step up strikes on Kyiv. 
""The number and scale of missile strikes on targets in Kyiv will increase in response to any terrorist attacks or acts of sabotage on Russian territory committed by the Kyiv nationalist regime,"" the ministry said. 
Kirill Kyrylo, 38, a worker at a car repair shop in the Ukrainian capital, said he had seen three impacts on an industrial building, causing a blaze that was put out by firefighters.
""The building was on fire and I had to hide behind my car,"" he said, pointing out the shattered glass of the repair shop and bits of metal that had flown from the burning building. 

Russia initially described its aims in Ukraine as disarming its neighbour and defeating nationalists there. 
Kyiv and its Western allies say those are bogus justifications for an unprovoked war of aggression that has driven a quarter of Ukraine's 44 million people from their homes and led to the deaths of thousands.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas will travel with a delegation to Panama next week for a ministerial conference on migration with the Central American country's government, the State Department said on Friday.
In the trip scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday, Blinken will meet with Panamanian President Laurentino Cortizo Cohen, Foreign Minister Erika Mouynes and multilateral development banks, among others, the State Department said.
The United States saw a record number of migrants attempt to cross its border with Mexico during President Joe Biden's first year in office, and U.S. officials are preparing for even higher numbers this year, including many from other Central American countries: Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.
Biden, a Democrat, has pledged to address the so-called ""root causes"" that drive those migrants to leave their homes, and his administration has secured private-sector investments in Central America worth over $1.2 billion.
Brian Nichols, assistant secretary of State for Western Hemisphere, said during a call with reporters on Friday that the region faces ""unprecedented challenges"" when it comes to migration and that results might not come quickly.
""The challenges did not begin yesterday and they will take time for us to resolve alongside our partners,"" he said.

The United States will host the Ninth Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles in June and aims to strike a migration compact with other nations that ""helps us keep populations safe and integrated and in place where they are in our hemisphere,"" Nichols said.
A record number of unauthorized migrants entered Panama in 2021 from Colombia, according to government data provided to Reuters toward the end of last year, as mostly Haitians entered the Central American country en route to the United States.

""We are prepared to put forward what we can to create the atmosphere for a dialogue that leads to solutions,"" he added. 
He, along with other military leaders, staged a coup on October 25, ending a two-year power-sharing arrangement with a civilian political coalition following the ouster of Omar al-Bashir. 
Since then, at least 94 people have been killed in security crackdowns on protests and dozens have been arrested.
Burhan said that while there were no ""political detainees,"" he met with the public prosecutor and the head of the judiciary to discuss expediting the release of detainees, among whom are key civilian political leaders. 
He also said they discussed the possibility of reducing the current the state of emergency.
Such steps have been often requested by the international community as trust-building measures.
Burhan said these steps came in the context of concessions made by some political groups towards coming to an agreement. 
Reuters earlier this month reported that a deal was under consideration, presented by parties aligned with the military, to form a new government. 
Burhan had previously said that the military would only hand over power to an elected government. In Friday's comments, he once again called for political parties to come to a consensus.

In his comments, Burhan said that, unlike in the past, no one group should be in control of the political scene. In comments before and after the coup, military leaders accused the civilian coalition of monopolizing power.
Burhan also said that court orders that led to the return of scores of civil servants associated with the Bashir regime would be reviewed.

The demonstration, which had received police permission, was organised by Rasmus Paludan, leader of Danish far-right political party Hard Line. Police disbanded the demonstration to calm the situation, and later in the evening said most counter-demonstrators had left the area.

At a news conference in Moscow, Viktor Medvedchuk's wife Oksana Marchenko said that one of two photos released by Ukraine this week showed he had been beaten. 
Reuters could not independently confirm this, and neither Ukraine's security service, the SBU, nor the Kremlin immediately responded to requests for comment. 
On Wednesday, Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said: ""Those freaks who call themselves the Ukrainian authorities say that they want to beat testimony out of Viktor Medvedchuk, 'quickly and fairly', convict him, and then exchange him for prisoners."" The SBU said on Tuesday it had arrested Medvedchuk, who has long advocated closer ties to Russia and is leader of the Opposition Platform - For Life party. The party is Ukraine's largest opposition party.
One photo of him in handcuffs was released on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's official Telegram account, and another was posted by the SBU on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Displaying the two photos, Marchenko said one had been taken before he was interrogated and showed no sign of injury. A second image, which she said had been taken during his interrogation, showed him with his hair over his forehead. 
""It shows a big bruise and marks which they have tried to conceal with his hair. There is no doubt that he was beaten in the first hours after his arrest,"" she said. 
That photo shows what could be a mark on his forehead beneath a wisp of hair, although Reuters could not determine what caused it.
Three days after Russia moved its forces into Ukraine on Feb. 24, Ukraine said Medvedchuk had escaped from house arrest. He had been placed under house arrest in May 2021 and charged with high treason and later with aiding terrorism. 
The pro-Russian figure, who says Putin is godfather to his daughter, has denied wrongdoing.
The head of the SBU said on Wednesday that Medvedchuk had planned to escape Ukraine by secretly crossing into the breakaway Transdniestria region of Moldova, but that his plan had been foiled.

Marchenko said she wanted to know where her husband was, for him to be protected from abuse and for him to be granted medical care and access to his lawyer. 
Zelenskiy has proposed swapping Medvedchuk for Ukrainian prisoners being held by Russian forces. Russia on Wednesday turned down this proposal with a warning that those holding him might soon be detained themselves.

(Reuters) - The Biden administration will grant temporary deportation relief and work permits to Cameroonians living in the United States due to the ongoing conflict between government forces and armed separatists in that country, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced on Friday.
The decision will apply to Cameroonians residing in the United States by April 14 and last a period of 18 months, DHS said. An estimated 12,000 Cameroonians will be eligible for the status, according to the department.
President Joe Biden has championed the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program, which grants immigrants who cannot return to their countries safely due to extraordinary circumstances, such as violent conflict or natural disasters, the ability to stay and work in the United States.
Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas cited the conflict and a rise in attacks in Cameroon by the Islamist group Boko Haram in a statement announcing the move.
Violence against the armed forces in the western regions of Cameroon has intensified over the past year as Anglophone separatists fighting the French-speaking government increase their use of explosive devices. 
In late 2020 and early 2021, Reuters spoke to more than a half dozen Cameroonian asylum seekers when they had been deported back to their country after losing U.S. immigration court cases. While all declined to be named, they told similar stories of having their identity documents confiscated by the government after returning to Cameroon, and several were in hiding, fearing retaliation from local authorities.

A February Human Rights Watch report documented dozens of cases of Cameroonian authorities subjecting asylum seekers deported by the United States to human rights violations such as arbitrary arrest and torture between 2019 and 2021.
Biden, a Democrat, has greatly expanded TPS enrollment, which his predecessor, Republican then-President Donald Trump, largely sought to wind down.

67,"<span>Apr 15, 2022 11:50AM ET</span>","(Reuters) -Russia has confirmed the Moskva missile cruiser, the flagship of its Black Sea Fleet, has sunk while being towed to port following what it said was a fire and explosions involving ammunition stowed onboard.
Ukraine says the Moskva's fate was sealed by a missile strike launched by its forces from the coast which ripped open the hulking Soviet-era ship's hull. Russia's defence ministry has not confirmed that version of events. Reuters is unable to verify either side's assertions.
Here's what we do know, and what the sinking means (and does not mean) for Russia's battle-readiness:
WHAT CAPABILITIES DOES THE SINKING DEPRIVE RUSSIA OF?
Russia has powerful air defence systems deployed in Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, but the Moskva was able to provide long-range and mobile air defence protection for the entire Black Sea Fleet and was a floating command and control centre. Its loss degrades the fleet's air defences, particularly on longer range missions.
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CREW?
The ship had a crew of around 500 sailors who Russia said were successfully evacuated to other ships before being returned to their home port of Sevastopol in Crimea on Friday. Ukraine has suggested there are likely to have been fatalities, but Russia has not said anything on the subject yet. 
WILL IT LOSS CHANGE THE COURSE OF THE UKRAINE CONFLICT?
Unlikely to, but Britain's Ministry of Defence says its loss is likely to prompt Russia to review its naval posture in the Black Sea. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that while the sinking would have a symbolic impact and potentially raise questions about Russia's longer-term naval capabilities, it would be unlikely to have a major impact on the course of the conflict. The Russian navy has so far not played a big role.
One U.S. official said that Russia had only used its warships in a limited fashion, to carry out occasional strikes and resupply troops in the south. Russia retains naval dominance in the immediate region and the Moskva was equipped to destroy enemy vessels at sea but little is left of Ukraine's navy. 
WILL RUSSIA'S NAVY NOW CHANGE THE WAY IT OPERATES AND DOES THAT MATTER? 
Yes it will, but that change is not seen as being hugely significant. After the fire on the Moskva started, which U.S. officials believe was likely a Ukrainian attack, about five Russian warships in the northern part of the Black Sea moved further away from the coast, about 80 nautical miles. But U.S. officials said they believed those ships were still capable of carrying out strikes into Ukraine from that distance and were less likely to be targeted by the Ukrainians that far away from the coast. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think tank, said the Ukrainian military’s ability to hit Russian warships in the Black Sea could force the Russian Navy to deploy additional air defence and other assets for protection. 
WAS THE MOSKVA EARMARKED FOR A ROLE IN THE UNFOLDING CONFLICT?
Not clear, but some analysts say it may have helped support a possible Russian amphibious landing in the Ukrainian port of Odesa that has not happened yet because of resistance from Ukrainian forces. Its sinking may be seen in some quarters in Ukraine as reducing the chances of such an assault and allow Ukraine to redeploy some of its forces elsewhere. 
CAN RUSSIA EASILY REPLACE THE MOSKVA'S CAPABILITIES
No. Russia has two other ships of the same class, the Marshal Ustinov and the Varyag, which serve with Russia's Northern and Pacific fleets respectively. Turkey, which controls access to the Black Sea via the Bosphorus, will not let them enter at a time of war. 
WAS THE MOSKVA ARMED WITH UNIQUE WEAPONS?
No. It had anti-ship missiles and surface-to-air missiles, but was not equipped with Russia's latest generation Kalibr cruise missiles or hypersonic missiles. 
HOW MODERN A SHIP WAS IT?
Not very. Designed in the 1970s Soviet Union during the Cold War, it was conceived to destroy U.S. aircraft carriers and had been in service for nearly four decades. It underwent an extensive refit, and according to Britain's Ministry of Defence, only returned to operational status in 2021. Despite that refit, some of its hardware remained outdated. 

HOW BIG A BLOW TO RUSSIAN MILITARY PRIDE IS THE SINKING?
It's a bitter loss for the Russian military as the ship, though ageing, was a symbol of the Crimea-based Black Sea Fleet and of Russian military pride. If it was holed by Ukrainian anti-ship missiles, it would be the biggest Russian warship to be lost in action since 1941, when German dive bombers crippled the Soviet battleship Marat in Kronshtadt harbour. The sinking, whether by Ukrainian missile strikes or through a mishap, “is a major propaganda victory for Ukraine,” said an assessment by the ISW. Western diplomats and experts expect senior officers in the Black Sea Fleet to lose their jobs over the sinking.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - One year after events in Jerusalem led to war in Gaza, clashes during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan are raising fears of renewed Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with leaders on both sides warning of possible escalation.
At least 152 Palestinians were wounded when Israeli riot police entered the Al-Aqsa mosque compound on Friday to disperse Palestinians who threw firecrackers and stones at them and towards a Jewish prayer area.
The Al-Aqsa compound sits on a plateau in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed. Known to Jews as Temple Mount, the area is the most sensitive in the generations-old conflict.
""Jerusalem is perhaps the number one issue that has the potential of triggering widescale violence,"" said Palestinian pollster Khalil Shikaki, director of the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research. ""We have seen that in the past.""
Already strained by deadly attacks on Israelis by Palestinian assailants in the last two weeks and Israeli army killings of Palestinians in the West Bank, the atmosphere in the holy city has been heightened as Ramadan, Passover and Easter are all being marked this month.
Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh described the Israeli riot police actions at Al-Aqsa as a ""brutal assault on worshipers during the holy month"" and a dangerous omen.
At a rally in Gaza, a spokesman for the armed Islamist group Hamas, which rules the enclave, said that Israeli use of force would not go unanswered.
""We will draw the line again in defence of Jerusalem and we will launch a new era; weapons for weapons, and force will only be met by force and we will defend Jerusalem by all our might,"" Fawzi Barhoum said.
Last May, Palestinian militants fired rockets into Israel after Hamas demanded Israeli police withdraw from Al-Aqsa and the Jerusalem neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah, where a court threat to dispossess Palestinian residents had led to protests and confrontation.
In the 11-day war that followed, 250 Palestinians in Gaza and 13 people in Israel were killed.
Israel's Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said authorities were working to restore calm in Jerusalem and across Israel, but were ready if the situation deteriorated. 
""We are preparing for any scenario and the security forces are ready for any task,"" Bennett said in a statement.
WAVE OF KILLINGS
Last week, a Palestinian from a refugee camp in the West Bank town of Jenin shot dead three Israelis and wounded several more at a Tel Aviv bar. The shooting was the latest in a string of Palestinian attacks in Israeli cities that killed 14 people.
Bennett called the attacks, which were the deadliest since 2016, ""a new wave of terror"".
The Israeli army has killed 40 Palestinians this year in a cycle which Dahlia Scheindlin, an Israeli public opinion expert and political analyst, said could be traced to early February when Israeli forces killed three Palestinian militants in Hebron.
The Palestinian Foreign Ministry described that killing as ""an ugly field execution"".
Alongside what it considers as security measures, such as mending breaches in the barrier which separates it from the West Bank and conducting mass arrests, Israel has also relatively eased Palestinian movement from the West Bank and Gaza into Israel and Jerusalem.
""There are no restrictions on the use of force,"" Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said on Thursday, echoing Bennett. He added that Israel would allow Palestinians who ""maintain the quiet"" to work and celebrate Ramadan without disruptions.
Until Friday's clashes at Al-Aqsa, those relief measures had appeared to ease some Palestinian frustrations, Shikaki said.
However, the pent-up anger and grievances over Israel’s 55-year military occupation of territories it captured in the 1967 war, and where Palestinians seek to establish a state, outweigh the current concessions, he added.
In the West Bank and East Jerusalem, 2021 marked the highest rate of Palestinian home demolitions since 2016, according to the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem.

In the last five years, Israel has granted just 33 building permits to Palestinians and over 16,500 building permits to Jewish settlers in the 60% of the West Bank it directly controls, according to Itay Epshtain, a humanitarian law and policy consultant, citing data disclosed by Israel's Defence Ministry.
""The whole structure that is in place, of the occupation, is violent,"" said Diana Buttu, a former legal advisor to the Palestine Liberation Organization. ""It's been decades of this, decades of daily violence, and it gets to a point where eventually it just boomerangs back onto Israel.""

(Reuters) - Explosions rumbled and smoke rose this week from a steel making district in besieged Mariupol where dwindling Ukrainian forces are holed up as Russia tries to take full control of its biggest city yet. 
The Azovstal iron and steel works, one of Europe's biggest metallurgical plants, has become an aptly apocalyptic redoubt for Ukrainian forces who are outgunned, outnumbered and surrounded seven weeks into Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
In the east of the southern port devastated by weeks of shelling, the plant lies in an industrial area that looks out to the Sea of Azov and covers more than 11 square kilometres (4.25 square miles), containing myriad buildings, blast furnaces and rail tracks. 
""The Azovstal factory is an enormous space with so many buildings that the Russians ... simply can't find (the Ukrainian forces),"" said Oleh Zhdanov, a military analyst based in Kyiv. 
""That's why they (the Russians) started talking about trying a chemical attack, that's the only way to smoke them out,"" Zhdanov said.
Ukraine has said it is checking unverified information that Russia may have used chemical weapons in Mariupol. Russia-backed separatists have denied using chemical weapons.
In peace time, the Azovstal iron and steel works pumped out 4 million tonnes of steel a year, 3.5 million tonnes of hot metal and 1.2 million tonnes of rolled steel. 
Like the city's other Illich Steel and Iron Works, Azovstal is held by Metinvest, the group controlled by billionaire Rinat Akhmetov, Ukraine's richest man. 
A Russian separatist deputy commander said on Russian state TV on Monday that Moscow had captured 80% of the port, but that resistance continued and that Ukrainian forces had all tried to ""exit towards the Azovstal factory"".
He described the factory as a ""fortress in a city"".
The city's defenders include Ukrainian marines, motorised brigades, a National Guard brigade and the Azov Regiment, a militia created by far-right nationalists that was later incorporated into the National Guard. 
It is the Azov Regiment, whose destruction is among Moscow's war objectives, that is prominently associated with Azovstal and one of its founders, Andriy Biletskiy, has also called it ""the fortress of the Azov"".
Russian President Vladimir Putin calls the invasion a ""special operation"" for the ""demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine"" but Ukraine and the West say Russia launched an unprovoked war of aggression.
""Azov is indeed on Azovstal's territory ... These are huge territories with workshops that can't be destroyed from the air, which is why the Russians are using heavy bombs,"" said Sergiy Zgurets, a military analyst. 
Russia's defence ministry said on Wednesday that more than 1,000 soldiers of Ukraine's 36th Marine Brigade, including 162 officers, had surrendered in Mariupol, though Ukraine has not confirmed that. 
Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych later said that members of the 36th Marine Brigade had managed to punch through in a ""highly risky manoeuvre"" to join up with the Azov Regiment. 
""The 36th brigade avoided being ripped to pieces and now have serious additional opportunities, essentially getting a second chance,"" he said. 
The lack of mobile reception and internet in the city means information is scant. Ukraine has kept tight control of things like troop numbers that could compromise their defence. 
The Azov's Biletskiy told Ukraine's NV news site on March 20 that Ukraine had a total of 3,000 fighters defending the city against up to 14,000 Russians. 
DIFFICULT TO OCCUPY 
Private U.S. satellite company Maxar was able to peer down at the raging battles from space on Tuesday. 
""Smoke and fire was observed coming from a number of buildings throughout the western and eastern sections of the city as well as in and near the Azovstal iron and steel works factory — the site of ongoing battles between Russian and Ukrainian forces,"" it said. 
An EU security source told Reuters it was to difficult to say how long the Ukrainians could hold on and also difficult for Russia to occupy the whole city because of the industrial complexes. ""There are underground tunnels systems under the steel factory."" 
""Mariupol is very important to Putin because after a victory there (and the surrender of Azov-troops) he can claim that the 'denazification' process is successful,"" the source added. 
An assistant to Mariupol's mayor said on Wednesday that Russia planned to celebrate victory in the city on May 9, the date Moscow marks victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two with an annual parade on Red Square. 

Zhdanov, the military analyst, said he saw little chance of Ukrainian forces from the outside breaking through Russia's siege. 
""How many supplies the defenders have and how long they can hold on is anyone's guess. But they have no other way out. They're surrounded on all sides, they have to stand till the end. If they give in, they will not be spared,"" he said.

HUSARIVKA, Ukraine (Reuters) - Smashed tanks in the mud, destroyed buildings and mourning families mark a recaptured east Ukrainian village whose residents are contemplating the price both they and their former Russian occupiers have had to pay. 
Ukrainian soldiers last month retook Husarivka, an agricultural village with a peacetime population of 500-600 around 150 km southeast of Kharkiv city, after heavy fighting following the Russian invasion on Feb. 24.
As Russian forces pull back after failing to take major cities including Kyiv and Kharkiv to refocus their offensive on the Donbas region in the southeast, residents of the surrounding areas are beginning to clean up after weeks of occupation.
Echoing accounts of ill-disciplined and poorly-supplied Russian forces from other localities in north and east Ukraine where the Russians have retreated, 79-year-old Nadezhda Syrova said young soldiers had gone house-to-house asking for food.
Some of the invading Russians said they were on a training exercise or there to clear Ukraine of bandits and ""Nazis"", she added, standing on a patch of ground near her house. 
""Where do you see bandits and Nazis here? We are just normal, peaceful people. Ukrainians,"" she said.
In fields above the village, burned-out armoured personnel carriers and two smashed Russian anti-aircraft gun carriers sit abandoned in the mud surrounded by detritus including gas masks, computer printers and sodden footwear.
In the village itself, a destroyed Russian tank, already rusting, rests on the road, its blown off turret by its side.
A Ukrainian soldier said fighting went on for around three weeks with his side using anti-tank weapons, including artillery and foreign-supplied Javelin missiles, finally driving out two Russian battalion tactical groups.
""We bypassed the enemy from the right and the left, got into good positions and destroyed their equipment,"" said the soldier, who spoke to reporters on condition he be identified only by his nickname Parker.
He said his unit had captured a Russian officer and two scouts from an engineering unit trying to plant mines around the village to stop the Ukrainian attack and had to fight off counter-attacks by what he described as Russian sabotage and reconnaissance groups.
""Three times we fought off attacks when they tried to enter,"" he said. 
BURNED BODIES
It was not possible to confirm his account independently but at least a dozen destroyed armoured vehicles, including tanks with the distinctive ""Z"" markings of Russian forces, remained in the village and surrounding fields.
Ukrainian authorities say their forces have killed almost 20,000 Russian troops and destroyed hundreds of tanks and armoured personnel carriers since the invasion began. Other estimates are much lower but Western officials estimate the numbers of Russian dead run into the thousands.
Ukraine also says that hundreds of Ukrainian civilians have been killed while under Russian occupation. Russia has denied targeting civilians but locals in Husarivka said several local people were killed or had disappeared.
Three bodies, burned beyond recognition, have been recovered from the cellar of one house and taken away to be investigated for possible signs of torture, they said.
The state of Husarivka matches accounts in a string of villages east of Kharkiv, a mainly Russian-speaking city near Ukraine's northeastern border, which was targeted by President Vladimir Putin's army from the first days of the war.

Though no longer threatening to enter the city, Russia has kept up a partial blockade and subjected it to days of increasingly heavy bombardment.
Kharkiv residential buildings and infrastructure have been hit, causing dozens of casualties, with more than 60 artillery and rocket attacks in one night this week. On Friday, Reuters journalists heard mortar rounds hit northern areas of the city.

BOBIGNY, France (Reuters) - Boxing coach Kab Thiam has voted in a French election twice: in 2002 to block the far right's Jean-Marie Le Pen from power and again last Sunday for the hard left's presidential candidate.
Now, though, with his favourite Jean-Luc Melenchon out, the 39-year-old does not plan to vote in the April 24 runoff. He finds both aspirants, incumbent President Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, daughter of Jean-Marie, distasteful. 
""Macron and Le Pen share the same ideas,"" Thiam said, between sparring with a young boxer at the Mohamed Ali gym in Bobigny, an ethnically-diverse northern suburb of Paris.
Melenchon won 60% of first round votes in Bobigny, which lies in France's poorest administrative department Seine-Saint-Denis. Now his supporters in the Paris suburbs and beyond will be crucial to determining a tight-looking runoff. 
Many, like Thiam, feel France has become increasingly Islamophobic as the Macron government has passed a raft of laws and measures that, it says, are to tackle religious extremism and preserve national secular values.
There are also perceptions that Macron is a ""president of the rich"", aloof from the people, as he has adopted right-wing economic positions. That seems to be stopping another united front against the far right, as occurred in past votes, and may cause the lowest turnout in decades, polls show.
A Reuters analysis of first round results showed he struggled to garner support in low-income areas and will have a tough time reaching voters outside his base of educated, middle-class city dwellers. 
Macron is, though, forecast to win by a narrow margin. 
In a runoff between the same candidates in 2017, Macron won 79% of votes - above the national average of 66% - in Seine-Saint-Denis which voted overwhelmingly to keep Le Pen out.
Now, though, ""Macron is polarizing in these areas because he is seen as being on the right and favouring the rich, while Le Pen is less scary than her father,"" said Jean-Yves Dormagen, a professor at University of Montpellier. 
""She has done everything to soften her discourse on the identity subject and so she seems reasonable and less racist."" 
'I LOOK AT MY POCKETS'
Growing up, Sami Mahdjoub, who brings his son to box at Thiam's gym, remembers how his parents would invoke Jean-Marie Le Pen to persuade him to behave well, saying: ""work hard at school or you will get deported."" 
Nowadays, the 38-year-old Franco-Algerian said he no longer viewed the Le Pen name as a threat. 
""I don't listen to what she says, I look at what's left in my pockets, and with Macron I have nothing,"" Mahdjoub said. ""With Le Pen will it be better? I don't know.""
Melenchon has told his supporters not to vote for the far-right, but has not endorsed Macron. His party is holding an online vote on its stance, with the result due on Saturday.
Sabine Rubin, a Melenchon lawmaker in Seine-Saint-Denis, said she understood reluctance to vote for Macron. 
""They see public services disappear, their own purchasing power dropping … the abandonment of these neighbourhoods is not new but now there is disdain on top of that,"" she said.
Rubin cited past remarks Macron had made, including comments to one jobless man that all he needed to do was ""cross the road"" and ask for work. 
But for many, Le Pen and her far right Rassemblement National party remain unpalatable too. 
Melenchon voter Emma D’Angelo, an unemployed graduate from Bondy, cried at the results of the first round and considered burning her electoral card. But she has come round to the idea of voting Macron. 
""For students it's like choosing between the plague and cholera. We expect nothing from him but we're going to vote for him because it is out of the question that Marine Le Pen wins,"" said D'Angelo, 22, who is applying for masters programmes.

Carlos Tavares, another coach at the Mohamed Ali gym who described growing up in fear of Le Pen and far-right ""skinheads"", said he was shocked friends may withhold their vote. 
""To vote blank or to abstain, whose game are we playing? It's Marine Le Pen we're talking about. For me, it's aberrant and scary,"" he said.

KYIV/LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - (This April 14 story corrects paragraph 21 to make clear that Moldova did not directly accuse Russia's army of trying to recruit its citizens; corrects third bullet point to say that Ukraine alleges Moscow is massing troops in Belarus and Transdniestria not Moldova and Transdniestria) 
Russia said its lead warship in the Black Sea sank on Thursday after an explosion and fire that Ukraine claimed was caused by a missile strike, dealing a blow to Moscow as it readied for new attacks that were likely to determine the conflict's outcome. 
The Moskva, Russia's flagship in its Black Sea fleet, sank as it was being towed to port in stormy weather, Russian news agencies quoted the defence ministry as saying. 
Russia said earlier that over 500 crew aboard the Soviet-era missile cruiser were evacuated after ammunition on board exploded. Ukraine said it hit the warship with a Ukrainian-made Neptune anti-ship missile. 
Russia, which has not acknowledged an attack, said the incident is under investigation. Reuters was unable to verify any of the statements, including whether the ship had sunk. 
""While the cruiser 'Moskva' was being towed to the destination port, the ship lost stability due to damage to the hull from the fire,"" the defence ministry said.
""In the stormy sea conditions, the ship sank,"" it said. 
The incident came as Russia's navy continues its bombardment of Ukrainian cities on the Black Sea nearly 50 days after it launched the invasion. Residents of Odesa and Mariupol, on the adjacent Azov Sea, have been bracing for new Russian attacks. 
The United States said it did not have enough information to determine whether the Moskva was hit by a missile.
""(But) certainly, the way this unfolded, it's a big blow to Russia,"" said national security adviser Jake Sullivan.
Russian forces have pulled back from some northern parts of Ukraine after suffering heavy losses and failing to take the capital Kyiv. Ukraine and its Western allies say Moscow is redeploying for a new offensive in the eastern Donbas region.
Russia launched its assault in part to dissuade Ukraine from joining NATO. But the invasion has pushed Finland, which shares a long border with Russia, and nearby Sweden to consider joining the U.S.-led military alliance.
Moscow warned NATO on Thursday that if Sweden and Finland join, Russia would deploy nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles in a Russian enclave on the Baltic Sea, in the heart of Europe.
Commenting on Russia's military setbacks, CIA Director William Burns said the threat of Russia potentially using nuclear weapons in Ukraine cannot be taken lightly, but that the agency has not seen much practical evidence reinforcing that concern.
STAGING TROOPS
Russia's navy has fired cruise missiles into Ukraine and its Black Sea activities are crucial to supporting land operations in the South and East, where it is battling to seize full control of the port of Mariupol, its main target in the Donbas.
Russia said on Wednesday more than 1,000 Ukrainian marines from one of the units still holding out in Mariupol had surrendered. Ukrainian officials did not comment.
If taken, Mariupol would be the first major city to fall to Russian forces since they invaded, allowing Moscow to reinforce a land corridor between separatist-held eastern Donbas areas and the Crimea region it seized and annexed in 2014.
Ukraine said thousands of people were believed to have been killed in Mariupol, where efforts were under way to evacuate civilians. On Thursday, Russia's defence ministry said 815 people had been evacuated from the city over the past 24 hours. Ukraine said that figure was 289. 
Ukrainian officials have long warned that Russia was massing troops for assaults in the East, including on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. 
But Ukraine's deputy defence minister, Hanna Malyar, said on Thursday that Russia was also staging troops along the country's borders with Belarus and Moldova's breakaway Transdniestria region. Authorities in Transdniestria, bordering southern Ukraine, denied Russia was preparing forces there.
Asked about reports that Russia's army was trying to recruit Moldovan citizens in Transdniestria, Moldova's foreign minister said ""these are dangerous things and should be discouraged"". Moscow's foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
Maylar said that shelling in Kharkiv had killed four civilians, with missile strikes there and in the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions in the South. Donetsk Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said three civilians were killed in the region. 
Russia said Ukraine had carried out a helicopter attack on the Russian Bryansk region, the latest of several cross-border attacks that Moscow has said may trigger a retaliatory strike on Kyiv.
Seven people were injured in the Bryansk attack, which hit residential buildings, Russian officials said. Another Russian region, Belgorod, said a village there was attacked but that no one was wounded. Neither side's statements could be verified. Ukraine's military did not reply to requests for comment. 
'TERRIBLE THINGS'
Moscow's incursion, the biggest attack on a European state since 1945, has seen more than 4.6 million people flee abroad, killed or wounded thousands and raised fears of conflict between Russia and the United States, the world's top nuclear powers.
Andriy Nyebytov, head of the Kyiv region police, said more than 800 bodies had been found in three districts which had been occupied by Russian forces.
""We are finding terrible things: buried and hidden bodies of people who were tortured and shot, and who died as a result of mortar and artillery fire,"" Nyebytov said in televised comments. His statements could not immediately be verified.

Russia has denied attacking civilians and said some reports have been staged for propaganda purposes.
Warning that spillover effects from the Ukraine war were worsening crises elsewhere, U.N. aid chief Martin Griffiths on Thursday released $100 million in emergency funding for Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, South Sudan, Nigeria and Yemen.

BORODYANKA, Ukraine (Reuters) - After surviving World War Two and the fall of the Soviet Union, among other seismic events, Zinaida Makishaiva now has her chickens to thank for getting through her most recent ordeal - the brief but brutal occupation of her town by Russian troops.
The 82-year-old was not too shaken when Russian tanks first showed up in early March in Borodyanka, northwest of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, but then Grad missiles smashed into her home, destroying her chicken coop.
A neighbour next door was killed by shelling. And then Russian troops began to visit every day.
Her daily routines, established since early childhood when she started ""rural work"", were soon punctured by shelling and missile attacks.
""Scared doesn't fully describe how I felt. I felt dead, senseless... I didn't have time to bring logs because of the shelling, small and big. That's how they destroyed all those houses... What I know is: one missile - no house,"" said Makishaiva, who spent much of her life in Ukraine's Black Sea port city of Odesa.
""The doors were blown out. I took the chickens in because I needed something to eat. I didn’t have anything to eat except for potatoes, just that. There is no water, no gas, nothing.""
The Russian troops came in three waves, she said, the first being the most violent. One day several soldiers entered her house, demanding that she stay in the cellar.
""'Get in the cellar, you old bitch!’ (the Russian troops said). I told them: 'Kill me, but I won’t go',"" said Makishaiva.
EGGS
During the days of occupation, Makishaiva braved crossfire to fetch pails of water from a nearby well.
When food was scarce, she still had the eggs laid by her own chickens. Her family was far away, as her one son and three grandchildren live in different parts of the country.
Since Borodyanka was retaken by Ukrainian forces over a week ago, Makishaiva, who used to love dancing the waltz when she was younger, walks more than three hours a day, past shattered buildings and wrecked Russian tanks, to collect whatever food aid is available at the town's community centre or church.
Thirty days of sleepless nights are now a thing of the past, with the help of the herb valerian.
""It's calmer now, we have radio again. There was nothing for a month, I felt deaf, no conversations, except with my dogs and cat,"" she said.
""Now when the radio says it's midnight, I take some valerian and sleep soundly until 5. The dreams are better now, more happiness. Because it was so bad before, so many people died. It was frightening.""
""What God decides will happen. I’ve been through two wars and now this. I pray that this has passed and the fighting won't come back again,"" Makishaiva said.

Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called ""a special operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" its southern neighbour.
Kyiv and its Western backers say this is a pretext for an act of unprovoked aggression. Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance to the invasion and the West has imposed sweeping economic sanctions on Russia.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A federal judge on Thursday ordered the man charged with this week's mass shooting in a New York subway to remain in custody and undergo a psychiatric exam as he awaits trial for one of the most violent attacks on the city's mass transit system.
Frank James, 62, making his initial court appearance a day after his arrest in lower Manhattan, is accused of injuring 30 people by setting off smoke bombs and spraying the inside of a subway car with gunfire during Tuesday morning's rush-hour commute in Brooklyn.
James was represented by two public defenders as he was formally presented with a criminal complaint charging him with a single count of committing a terrorist or other violent attack against a mass transportation system - a felony carrying a maximum sentence of life in prison. 
""The defendant terrifyingly opened fire on passengers in a crowded subway train, interrupting their morning commute in a way this city hasn't seen in more than 20 years,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Sara Winik told the federal court in Brooklyn, in an apparent reference to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
Arguing that James poses a ""severe and ongoing danger"" to the public if released, prosecutors said in a court filing that he carried out ""a premeditated violent attack on unsuspecting commuters trapped underground with their assailant in a subway car.""
The mass shooting followed a string of violent crimes that had already unnerved riders of one of the largest subway systems in the world, including instances of commuters being pushed onto subway tracks from station platforms.
James, dressed in beige jail clothes and wearing a blue surgical mask, spoke only briefly to say he understood the charges.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Roanne Mann ordered James to be held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, the main jail for defendants awaiting federal trial in New York City, and ordered the psychiatric evaluation requested by his lawyers.
The defense stressed the examination was not aimed at determining James' competence to face trial but to establish the state of his mental health for any treatment he needs. 
Authorities have offered no possible motive for the attack. 
VIDEO RANTS UNDER SCRUTINY
Investigators have said they are examining lengthy videos James apparently recorded and posted to YouTube, which included bigoted rants and comments on New York City's mayor, homelessness and the subway system. The YouTube account was taken down Wednesday for violating the online video platform's ""community guidelines,"" the company said. 
James was arrested without incident on Wednesday afternoon on a street in Manhattan's East Village neighborhood, about 5 miles (8 km) from the scene of Tuesday's attack, capping a 30-hour manhunt for the lone suspect. His lawyers told reporters after the hearing that James himself had called the New York Police Department's tipline to turn himself in after seeing his photograph in the news.
""He called 'Crime Stoppers' to help,"" Mia Eisner-Grynberg, a lawyer from the Federal Defenders of New York, told reporters. ""He told them where he was."" Earlier news reports said James placed the call from a McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) restaurant in the East Village. He was taken into custody a short distance away.
Eisner-Grynberg called the attack a tragedy, which unfolded as the Manhattan-bound N train was pulling into the 36th Street subway station in Brooklyn's Sunset Park community.
Police said 10 people were shot, five of them hospitalized in critical but stable condition. About 20 others were injured by the smoke canisters the attacker set off before shooting or in the stampede of terrified passengers pouring out of the subway car onto the platform, according to prosecutors. All were expected to survive.
The attacker apparently followed the panicked passengers into another train and rode it one stop toward Manhattan, investigators said. 
Surveillance video shows James emerging one station north at about 14 minutes after the shooting. An image included in the complaint shows him in a dark outfit, without the fluorescent orange jacket and yellow helmet worn earlier.
Video footage from the scene may prove to be less extensive than it should. The New York Police Department (NYPD) issued a statement on Wednesday saying security cameras were out of service at the 36th Street station and two other subway stops on Tuesday.
Investigators said they established James as a suspect after finding on the platform a credit card in his name and keys to a U-Haul van he had rented and left parked several blocks away.
Authorities at the scene also recovered the semi-automatic handgun used in the attack, along with three extended-ammunition magazines, a torch, a hatchet, a bag of fireworks and a container of gasoline, according to police and court documents.

James is a Bronx native with recent addresses in Philadelphia and Milwaukee. He had nine prior arrests in New York and three in New Jersey, according to the New York Police Department.
In addition to items found at the subway station, searches of James' apartment and a storage locker in Philadelphia uncovered more handgun and rifle magazines, ammunition, a Taser and a pistol barrel attachment for a silencer, the FBI said.

""Where our focus will be over the course of the coming days is on evasion,"" national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in an interview at the Economic Club of Washington.
""I think we'll have some announcements in the next week or two that identify targets that are trying to facilitate that evasion both inside Russia and beyond,"" he said, without giving details on the coming plans.
But Sullivan did say that Washington has no desire to give back yachts and other assets seized from people they see as oligarchs with ties to Putin.
""The president is actively looking at how we can deal with the fact that as we seize these assets, our goal is not to give them back,"" he said.
""Our goal is to put them to a better use than that. But I'll be careful in what I say today because there's an ongoing - kind of - policy process around how we end up dealing with that question. But rest assured that the goal is not just to sit on them for a while and then pass them all back.""
ARMING UKRAINE
He also said that any efforts by Russia to disrupt weapons transfers benefiting Ukraine could escalate the standoff with the West.
""The United States is not operating inside the territory of Ukraine, so if the Russians, obviously, were to strike NATO territory, where materiel is being assembled, that would invoke Article 5 and would be a complete game changer.""
Article 5 of the NATO charter says an attack on one member of the military alliance is an attack on all of its members. It has been invoked only once, after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.
Sullivan said an attack on a Russian missile cruiser claimed by Ukraine on Thursday had dealt a blow to Russia. 
""We've been in touch with the Ukrainians overnight, who had said that they struck the ship with anti-ship missiles,"" he said. ""We don't have the capacity at this point to independently verify that but certainly, the way this unfolded, it's a big blow to Russia.""
Russia's defense ministry, however, said a fire had broken out on the missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of its Black Sea fleet, after ammunition blew up on board, and did not mention an attack. Reuters was unable to verify either side's statements. 

The ship sank after the U.S. official's comments.
Sullivan declined to discuss whether any senior U.S. official would soon visit Kyiv, as leaders of other countries including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson have recently done. [nL2N2WB2V3] He warned that fighting in Ukraine could go on for months or longer.

(Reuters) - The family of an African refugee killed by a Michigan police officer during a traffic stop demanded on Thursday that authorities dismiss the officer from the force and file criminal charges against him, a day after a video of the fatal shooting was released.
Patrick Lyoya, a 26-year-old Congolese refugee who is Black, was killed in a Grand Rapids neighborhood during a routine traffic stop after he struggled with the officer over a stun gun. The officer has not been publicly identified.
Speaking through a translator at a press conference on Thursday, Lyoya's parents mourned the loss of their first-born son, saying they did not believe that this could happen in the United States.
""My heart is broken to see an officer being on top of my son and to shoot him in the back of his head, my heart is really broken,"" said Peter Lyoya, his father. ""I'm asking for justice for Patrick.""
The family fled violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo for the United States in 2014, according a statement from the governor's office.
Ben Crump, a prominent U.S. civil rights attorney who is representing the family, said the officer did not follow basic training protocols and that the use of fatal force was unnecessary and unjustifiable.
""Another senseless killing of a Black person in America by the very people who are supposed to protect them,"" he said referring to the video footage. ""You see a police officer escalate a minor traffic stop into a deadly execution.""
Crump again called for federal police reform, noting that Lyoya's death is one in a growing list of police killings of racial minorities, including that of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, in situations that could have been de-escalated.
Tamika Palmer, Taylor's mother, was present at the news conference in Grand Rapids. 
After the release of the videos, hundreds of demonstrators gathered to protest the shooting, call for accountability and demand police reform, the Detroit Free Press reported.
Lyoya, who was driving with a front seat passenger on April 4, was pulled over after the officer ran the car's license plate and discovered it did not match the vehicle. 
He exited the vehicle and the officer sought to detain him. A short foot chase followed and ended on the lawn of a home where Lyoya attempted to block the officer from using his Taser, video footage shows.
The two had fell to the ground when the officer drew his firearm and fired one shot in the back of his head, video footage shows.

The officer, who has not been charged, is on paid leave and under investigation by the Michigan State Police. 
Kent County prosecutors told CNN on Wednesday that a decision about criminal charges would be made after the investigation has concluded.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A jury on Thursday convicted an Ohio man who claimed he was following former President Donald Trump's orders when he looted items from U.S. Capitol during last year's riot, handing another notable win to prosecutors.
A federal jury in the District of Columbia found Dustin Thompson, 38, guilty on all charges he faced, including obstruction of an official proceeding and theft of government property.
Thompson had admitted to entering the Capitol and stealing a bottle of liquor and a coat rack during the riots.
But in a novel legal strategy, Thompson argued to the jury that he was acting at Trump's behest and that the former president is ultimately responsible for the mob that stormed the Capitol.
“Besides being ordered by the president to go to the Capitol, I don’t know what I was thinking,” Thompson told the jury, according to CNN. “I was caught up in the moment.”
U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton, who oversaw the trial, will sentence Thompson at a hearing in July. The judge ordered Thompson detained in jail until that hearing.

The U.S. Justice Department has now won all three Jan. 6 prosecutions that have gone to a jury trial. One defendant was acquitted in a non-jury trial.
About 800 people have been charged with crimes relating to the Jan. 6 attack.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The threat of Russia potentially using tactical or low-yield nuclear weapons in Ukraine cannot be taken lightly, but the CIA has not seen a lot of practical evidence reinforcing that concern, CIA Director William Burns said on Thursday.
Burns' most extensive public comments since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 underscored concerns that the biggest attack against a European state since 1945 risks escalating to the use of nuclear weapons.
Earlier on Thursday, Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council and a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, warned NATO that Moscow would deploy nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles in Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave in the heart of Europe, if Sweden and Finland joined the Atlantic alliance.
Burns spoke at Georgia Tech of the ""potential desperation"" and setbacks dealt Putin, whose forces have suffered heavy losses and have been forced to retreat from some parts of northern Ukraine after failing to capture Kyiv.
For those reasons, ""none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear weapons,"" Burns said.
That said, despite ""rhetorical posturing"" by the Kremlin about putting the world's largest nuclear arsenal on high alert, ""We haven't seen a lot of practical evidence of the kind of deployments or military dispositions that would reinforce that concern.”
Tactical and low-yield nuclear weapons refer to those designed for use on the battlefield, of which some experts estimate Russia has about 2,000 that can be delivered by air, naval and ground forces.
Burns' comments came in response to a question from former U.S. Senator Sam Nunn, a leading arms control advocate, at the end of the CIA chief's first public speech since taking the helm of the premier U.S. spy agency in March 2021.
In a wide-ranging address, the former career U.S. diplomat said U.S. spy agencies began last fall collecting ""disturbing and detailed"" intelligence on a plan by Putin for a ""major new invasion"" of Ukraine.
Burns said President Joe Biden dispatched him to Moscow in November ""to convey directly to Putin and several of his closest advisers the depths of our concern about his planning for war, and the consequences for Russia"" if they proceeded.
""I was troubled by what I heard,"" he continued, saying that while Putin may not have made a final decision, he appeared convinced his forces would ""achieve a quick decisive victory at minimal costs.""
Putin believed Washington's European allies were distracted by their own domestic politics and he had a ""sanctions-proof"" war chest of foreign currency reserves, Burns said.
""Putin was proven wrong on each of these counts,"" he said.
The Russian leader ""stewed"" in grievance, ambition and insecurity and apparently saw the ""window was closing for shaping Ukraine's orientation"" away from the West, said Burns, who called Putin an ""apostle of payback.""
U.S. intelligence has been vital to Ukraine's fight against Russian forces, said Burns, whose diplomatic posts included one as U.S. ambassador to Moscow.
The ""crimes"" he said those forces committed in the Ukrainian town of Bucha are ""horrific.""
Russia, which has repeatedly denied targeting civilians, has called the accusations its forces executed civilians in Bucha while occupying the town a ""monstrous forgery"" aimed at denigrating the Russian army.
The Kremlin says it launched a ""special military operation"" to demilitarize and ""liberate"" Ukraine from nationalist extremists.
In other remarks, Burns called China a formidable competitor seeking to overtake the United States in every domain, from economic and military power to space and cyberspace.

China’s ambitions under its leader Xi Jinping are “quite threatening,” and include the possibility that Beijing would seek control over Taiwan by military means, he said.
“The further out we get in this decade, the greater that risk becomes,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) -One of Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest allies warned NATO on Thursday that if Sweden and Finland joined the U.S.-led military alliance then Russia would deploy nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles in a European exclave.
Finland, which shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border with Russia, and Sweden are considering joining the NATO alliance. Finland will decide in the next few weeks, Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on Wednesday.
Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said that should Sweden and Finland join NATO then Russia would have to strengthen its land, naval and air forces in the Baltic Sea.
Medvedev also explicitly raised the nuclear threat by saying that there could be no more talk of a ""nuclear free"" Baltic - where Russia has its Kaliningrad exclave sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania.
""There can be no more talk of any nuclear–free status for the Baltic - the balance must be restored,"" said Medvedev, who was Russian president from 2008 to 2012.
Medvedev said he hoped Finland and Sweden would see sense. If not, he said, they would have to live with nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles close to home. 
When asked how Washington views the potential addition of Sweden and Finland to NATO in light of Russia's warning, the U.S. State Department said there was no change in Washington's position and repeated that ""NATO's open door is an open door.""
""Without speaking to any countries in particular, we would not be concerned that the expansion of a defensive alliance would do anything other than promote stability on the European continent,"" Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a briefing.
Russia has the world's biggest arsenal of nuclear warheads and along with China and the United States is one of the global leaders in hypersonic missile technology. 
Lithuania said Russia's threats were nothing new and that Moscow had deployed nuclear weapons to Kaliningrad long before the war in Ukraine. NATO did not immediately respond to Russia's warning.
Still, the possible accession of Finland and Sweden into NATO - founded in 1949 to provide Western security against the Soviet Union - would be one of the biggest strategic consequences of the war in Ukraine.
Finland gained independence from Russia in 1917 and fought two wars against it during World War Two during which it lost some territory. On Thursday, Finland announced a military exercise in western Finland with the participation of Britain, the United States, Latvia and Estonia.
Sweden has not fought a war for 200 years. Foreign policy has focused on supporting democracy and nuclear disarmament.
KALININGRAD
Kaliningrad, formerly the port of Koenigsberg, capital of East Prussia, lies less than 1,400 km from London and Paris and 500 km from Berlin. 
Russia said in 2018 it had deployed Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad, which was captured by the Red Army in April 1945 and ceded to the Soviet Union at the Potsdam conference.
The Iskander, known as SS-26 Stone by NATO, is a short-range tactical ballistic missile system that can carry nuclear warheads. Its official range is 500 km but some Western military sources suspect it may be much greater.
""No sane person wants higher prices and higher taxes, increased tensions along borders, Iskanders, hypersonics and ships with nuclear weapons literally at arm's length from their own home,"" Medvedev said.
""Let's hope that the common sense of our northern neighbours will win.""
While Putin is Russia's paramount leader, Medvedev's comments reflect Kremlin thinking and he is a senior member of the security council - one of Putin's main chambers for decision making on strategic issues.
Lithuanian Defence Minister Arvydas Anusauskas said Russia had deployed nuclear weapons in Kaliningrad even before the war.
""Nuclear weapons have always been kept in Kaliningrad ... the international community, the countries in the region, are perfectly aware of this,"" Anusauskas was quoted as saying by BNS. ""They use it as a threat.""
Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people, displaced millions and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States - by far the world's two biggest nuclear powers.
Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Moscow had to defend against the persecution of Russian-speaking people.

Ukraine says it is fighting an imperial-style land grab and that Putin's claims of genocide are nonsense. U.S. President Joe Biden says Putin is a war criminal and a dictator.
Putin says the conflict in Ukraine as part of a much broader confrontation with the United States which he says is trying to enforce its hegemony even as its dominance over the international order declines.

GENEVA (Reuters) -Some of the estimated 1,000 seafarers trapped in Ukraine have escaped, the International Labour Organization (ILO) and industry officials told Reuters, while voicing concern for those remaining trapped onboard ships or unaccounted for.
Several foreign cargo ships have been struck by crossfire in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24 and U.N. agencies have called for urgent action https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_841806/lang--en/index.htm to protect some 1,000 seafarers, including in the besieged port city of Mariupol that has been under bombardment for weeks.
An estimated 100 vessels have been prevented from departing because of risks of drifting sea mines https://shipping.nato.int/nsc/operations/news/-2022/risk-of-collateral-damage-in-the-north-western-black-sea-2, industry sources say.
Fabrizio Barcellona, seafarers' section coordinator at the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF), said the ""vast bulk"" of the seafarers, from at least 20 countries including India, Syria, Egypt, Turkey the Philippines and Bangladesh, as well as Ukraine and Russia, had left, traveling overland to Poland and Romania.
He cited information from Philippine government sources saying seafarers of the Philippines had left. The Philippine Labour Ministry said 371 had been repatriated, 68 had resumed work outside of Ukraine, and some 15 remained there. 
""A small number (of the estimated 1,000) remain stranded and unable to return home due to the ongoing threat of potential military crossfire,"" Barcellona said.
An ILO spokesperson said in an email that some seafarers were still trapped on their ships, within earshot of shellfire, without giving details. Others had been disembarked, including some who were repatriated home, while others were under the protection of the Ukrainian army.
Russia said on Wednesday it had taken control of Mariupol's trading port and had freed what it called ""hostages"" from vessels.
On April 11 a letter was circulated to International Maritime Organization members by Dominica maritime authorities about its ship that sank in Mariupol this month, saying the crew was hiding on other vessels ""under an immense amount of intense fear and distress.""

Barcellona said the ITF, which represents some 200 seafarers' unions, had been seeking to establish ""blue corridors"", or safe passage routes, but this was impossible due to mines. 
The International Committee of the Red Cross urged parties to the conflict to allow civilians, including commercial crews, to leave and said it would raise this with authorities.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris condemned attacks in Israel that have killed 14 people and said U.S. support for Israel's security was unwavering in a call with Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Thursday, the White House said.
""The Vice President expressed support for continued efforts to reduce tensions,"" the White House said in a statement.
The Israeli military had stepped up its raids in the West Bank following attacks by two Palestinians from the territory and three members of Israel's Arab minority in which 14 people in Israel have been killed since late March.

More than 20 Palestinians, many of them gunmen, have been killed by Israeli forces since January.
Israel has accused the Palestinian Authority of not doing enough to rein in militants and of encouraging violence against Israelis.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's powerful military on Thursday dismissed ousted Prime Minister Imran Khan's accusation that the United States had conspired to topple him in a parliamentary vote of confidence. 
Khan, 69, who led the nuclear-armed South Asian country of 220 million people for 3-1/2 years, accused Washington of backing his ouster because he had visited Moscow against U.S. advice. Washington denies the charge.
Khan met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Feb. 24, the day Russian forces invaded neighbouring Ukraine.
Khan initially blocked the no-confidence move, saying a forum of civil and military leaders, the National Security Committee, had endorsed the alleged conspiracy.
The military's spokesman, Major General Babar Iftikhar, denied this.
""You can see clearly whether there's any word of conspiracy in that statement. I don't think so,"" he told a news conference in reference to an NSC statement this month which had expressed concern over non-diplomatic language used in a cable from a ""foreign country"", widely assumed to mean the United States, about the no-confidence vote. 
Pakistan's lower house of parliament eventually voted in favour of removing Khan from office on Sunday.
Opposition parties and analysts say the military helped Khan win election in 2018, which they both deny, but that support waned after a falling-out over the appointment of the country's next intelligence chief late last year.
Khan's former information minister, Fawad Chaudhry, called for the setting up of a judicial commission to probe into the accusation that the United States conspired to topple Khan. 
Iftikhar denied Khan's assertion that the army chief of staff, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, had offered to help mediate in his deadlock with the opposition. 
Instead, he said, Khan had asked Bajwa to convey to the opposition on his behalf that he would call snap elections if the no-confidence motion was withdrawn. 
""(Bajwa) went to the opposition and placed this request in front of them, and after a detailed discussion they said that they wouldn't take any such step, and that 'we will go on as we have planned',"" said Iftikhar.
He also clarified that the United States had never asked for military bases in Pakistan after U.S.-led forces' withdrawal from Afghanistan last August. Khan's party had said that Washington turned against him after he said ""absolutely not"" in a TV interview in response to a question whether he would give the bases to the Americans. 

Khan has aired the conspiracy allegations in his public rallies, demanding snap elections. 
The next parliamentary election is due in 2023.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Elon Musk's takeover bid for Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) has prompted speculation that he would restore Donald Trump's account if he succeeds in purchasing the social-media platform. But the former U.S. president says he ""probably"" would not go back.
In an interview with Sirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI)'s Americano Media on Wednesday, before Musk's announcement, Trump said he ""probably wouldn't have any interest"" in returning to the platform, where he had almost 90 million followers.
""You know, Twitter has become very boring. They've gotten rid of a lot of their good voices ... a lot of their conservative voices,"" Trump said. 
Musk, the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO and billionaire entrepreneur, said he hopes to take Twitter private with the intent of making it a platform for free speech.
Trump was permanently suspended by Twitter following the assault on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters on Jan. 6, 2021. The platform cited the risk of ""further incitement of violence.""
The attack on Congress followed a speech by Trump in which he reiterated false claims that his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden was because of widespread fraud, an assertion rejected by multiple courts and state election officials.
Twitter's decision was criticized by Trump's Republican Party and others as an attempt to stifle conservative voices and an attack on free speech.

Trump has since launched his own social media platform, Truth Social, which has been plagued by technical issues and long waiting times to sign up. 
In the interview, Trump said he would wait until after the U.S congressional elections in November to announce whether he will run for another presidential term. But, he said, ""I think a lot of people are going to be very happy,"" about his decision.

The United States has no formal relations with Chinese-claimed Taiwan, but is its most important international backer and arms supplier.
Taiwan has been heartened by the continued U.S. support offered by the Biden administration, which has repeatedly talked of its ""rock-solid"" commitment to the democratically governed island. That has strained already poor Sino-U.S. relations.
The bipartisan group, which will meet with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen on Friday morning on their two-day visit, arrived at Taipei's downtown Songshan airport on a U.S. Air Force aircraft and were greeted by Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu.
The visit not only shows the bipartisan U.S. support for Taiwan, but also the ""rock solid"" nature of Taiwan-US relations, Presidential Office spokesman Xavier Chang said in a statement.

COLOMBO (Reuters) -At an auspicious time early on Thursday, Dilani Jayaratne lit a small wood fire to boil a small pot of milk to mark the start of Sri Lanka's New Year.
    The island nation's Sinhala and Tamil communities usually conduct the ceremony at home. But this year, Jayaratne and her family were at a tent camp in Sri Lanka's commercial capital Colombo, where thousands of people are protesting against the government's handling of a devastating economic crisis.
    Demonstrations have raged across Sri Lanka for weeks as people angered by prolonged power cuts and shortages of fuel and medicine demand President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's resignation.
    Jayaratne, 38, said she left home with her husband and two young sons around dawn and travelled for more than an hour to reach the protest site in Colombo located near Rajapaksa's office, which has been named ""Gota-Go Village"" by some.  
""We cannot just sit at home,"" said Jayaratne, adding that she hoped the protests would pressure Rajapaksa to leave the presidency.
    Behind her, dozens of protesters lined up outside a tent where volunteers were distributing squares of kiribath or coconut milk rice, bananas, spicy pickles, and butter cake on paper plates - traditional New Year delicacies that were donated by supporters.
    ""We used to say best wishes for the New Year,"" said Jayaratna Teekanoon, 56, as he handed out bananas. ""Now we say best wishes for the struggle.""
    In a New Year's message, Rajapaksa said the current crisis was the biggest challenge the country had faced in recent years. ""We should overcome this challenge with unity and better understanding,"" he said in a statement.
    Earlier this week, Sri Lanka said it would suspend repayment of external debts ahead of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for a loan programme, instead using its meagre foreign reserves to provide essentials to its 22 million people.
    Besides shortages, Sri Lankans are also struggling with rocketing inflation that has hit middle-class families like that of K.D.H. Kumara, a 44-year-old mechanic who said he was unable to meet household expenses and repay loans. 
    ""I was someone who supported this president from the heart. I voted for Rajapaksa and even organised campaign meetings for him,"" said Kumara, carrying his two-year-old son who was munching away at a piece of kiribath. 
    ""But now I'm extremely sad and disheartened. Things are so bad I can barely feed my family,"" Kumara said.
    Hundreds of protesters had gathered closer to the colonial-era presidential secretariat, some waving the Sri Lankan flag. Other carried hand-written posters demanding the resignation of Rajapaksa and other members of his powerful family that have long dominated Sri Lankan politics. 
    Behind tall barricades, a contingent of helmeted police watched the protesters as they shouted slogans. 
    The president's elder brother, Mahinda Rajapaksa, currently serves as prime minister. Their younger brother, Basil Rajapaksa, was finance minister until earlier this month. Other members of the family also held government positions.
    Carefully watching the pot of milk boil over, Jayaratne said she brought her sons to the site to show them the scale of the protests that have brought together Sri Lankans, cutting across ethnic, economic and religious divisions. 

""My sons must know the truth. They must experience what is really happening in this country,"" she said.
""They will remember this New Year for the rest of their lives.""

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -China's financial hub Shanghai reported over 27,000 coronavirus cases on Thursday, a new high, a day after President Xi Jinping said that the country must continue with its strict ""dynamic COVID clearance"" policy and pandemic control measures.
Shanghai is battling China's worst COVID-19 outbreak since the virus first emerged in Wuhan in late 2019, with its 25 million residents remaining largely under lockdown, though restrictions were partially eased in some areas this week.
Wider curbs to stop the spread of the highly infectious Omicron variant have led to logistical and supply chain disruptions that are taking a growing economic toll, adding to expectations that China's central bank will soon announce more stimulus measures.
An April 7 study by Gavekal Dragonomics found that 87 of China's 100 largest cities by GDP have imposed some form of quarantine curbs.
Shanghai residents, meanwhile, have taken to social media to vent frustration over the difficulties of getting enough food and China's policy that requires anyone testing positive, symptomatic or not, to be centrally quarantined, where many people have complained about poor conditions.
Raising hopes for a shift in policy, on Wednesday the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a guide on home quarantining on its social media.
The CDC's guide - quarantine in a well-ventilated room stocked with masks, sanitizer and other gear - raised hopes that the central quarantine rule might be relaxed.
However, when asked by a social media user in an online comments section about who might be eligible for home quarantine, the CDC referred to the old rules. 
Shanghai authorities also gave no hint of any change in approach during a Thursday briefing.
TESTING PATIENCE
On Wednesday, Xi said during a visit to south China's Hainan island that China must stick to its strict ""dynamic COVID clearance"" policy while the global pandemic remains very serious, promising those enduring lockdowns that persistence will win out in the end.
He indicated there would be no immediate change of approach in pandemic control measures, saying that the country must stick to its approach, which has all but shut China's borders to international travel, and not relax prevention measures.
Xi's remarks follow several recent state media articles supporting China's aggressive COVID strategy even as Shanghai residents chafe under restrictions.
On Thursday, an article titled ""The people of Shanghai's patience has reached its limit"" by a blogger called Lady Moye, enumerating the human toll of Shanghai's hardline anti-COVID measures including family separations, went viral on social media platform WeChat.
One comment, ""Whoever deletes this article should die a sorry death,"" received over half a million likes in seven hours, before the article was removed for violating regulations, according to a WeChat notice.
A video provided on Thursday to Reuters from inside one quarantine centre showed people in camp beds separated by less than an arm's length. An occupant said more than 200 people there shared four toilets, with no showers.
On Thursday, Shanghai reported a record 2,573 symptomatic cases for the previous day, up from 1,189 a day earlier, while asymptomatic cases reached 25,146, up from 25,141.
A city official said that cases continued to rise despite the lockdown in part because of a backlog of test results and because of ongoing transmission among family members.

In the coronavirus-hit northeastern province of Jilin, authorities said they had stamped out the local spread of COVID-19 after battling to bring cases down since mid-March.
But the southern technology hub of Shenzhen appeared to be seeing a resurgence after quashing an outbreak last month. On Thursday, authorities reported 21 new infections, including 8 with symptoms and 13 without, its highest total since March 21.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The man suspected of setting off smoke bombs and spraying gunfire inside a New York City subway car, injuring 23 people, was arrested on Wednesday on a federal charge of violently attacking a mass transportation system, capping an around-the-clock manhunt.
Frank Robert James, 62, was taken into custody in lower Manhattan, about 8 miles from the scene of Tuesday's assault, after authorities determined his whereabouts with the help of tips from residents, some of whom posted sightings on social media, police said.
The New York Times and New York Post, each citing law enforcement sources, reported that James himself alerted police to his general whereabouts on Wednesday in a call he placed to a tip line from a McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) fast-food outlet. Those news accounts could not be independently verified by Reuters.
James' arrest came 30 hours after an attack that erupted during the morning commuter rush as the Manhattan-bound N line train was pulling into an underground station in Brooklyn's Sunset Park community, renewing fears of violence in the city's subway system.
""My fellow New Yorkers, we got him. We got him,"" Mayor Eric Adams told a press conference announcing the arrest. ""We're going to protect the people of this city and apprehend those who believe they can bring terror to everyday New Yorkers.""
James, a Bronx native with recent addresses in Philadelphia and Milwaukee, had nine prior arrests in New York and three in New Jersey, according to the New York Police Department (NYPD).
A 10-page criminal complaint filed by federal prosecutors on Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn charges James with a single count committing a terrorist or other violent attack against a mass transportation system. If convicted, he could face life in prison, officials said.
He was scheduled to make his first court appearance on Thursday, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn said. 
James is accused of setting off two smoke bombs inside a subway car moments before opening fire on fellow passengers with a semi-automatic handgun. The pistol, purchased in 2011, was later recovered from the scene, along with three extended-ammunition magazines, a torch, a hatchet, a bag of fireworks and a container of gasoline, according to police and court documents.
SMOKE AND GUNFIRE
Police said 10 people were struck by gunfire, five of them listed in critical but stable condition on Wednesday. Thirteen others were injured in the frantic rush to flee the smoke-filled train. All of the victims were expected to survive.
The attack was the latest in a string of violent crimes unnerving passengers in the America's largest metropolitan transit system, including instances of commuters being pushed onto subway tracks from station platforms. The issue has posed a new challenge for Adams, who has pledged to help rebuild passenger numbers that plunged during the coronavirus pandemic and ensure greater public safety.
Police said James was apprehended without incident in Manhattan's East Village neighborhood after he was spotted by onlookers who recognized him from wanted posters and relayed his location to authorities.
""I said, 'Oh my God, this is the guy,'"" one bystander, Zack Dahhan, told reporters of his encounter with the suspect before he helped alert police in a nearby patrol car. 
""He had a bag and was walking on the sidewalk,"" Dahhan recounted. ""I saw a lot of people come behind him. I said to the people, 'Please guys, please keep some space, this guy is going to do something.'""
Officers were initially dispatched to a McDonald's outlet on the basis of a hotline tip, then widened their search around the restaurant until he was located nearby a short time later, police said.
YOUTUBE AND U-HAUL AS CLUES
Authorities told reporters they were still investigating what James' motive might have been. One focus of that inquiry, according to an FBI affidavit in the case, was a number of YouTube videos he posted addressing statements to New York City's mayor about homelessness and the subway system.
A YouTube account apparently belonging to James was taken down Wednesday for violating the online video platform's ""community guidelines,"" the company said.
Investigators initially linked James to the attack, the FBI affidavit said, when a sweep of the crime scene in Brooklyn's 36th Street subway station turned up a credit card in his name and keys to a rented U-Haul van later found parked two blocks from an N-train stop.
In addition to items found at the subway station, searches of James' apartment and a storage locker in Philadelphia uncovered more handgun and rifle magazines, ammunition, a Taser and a pistol barrel attachment for a silencer, the FBI said.

On Wednesday morning, with the gunman then still at large, New Yorkers went about their daily commutes, saying the violence gave them pause but did not diminish their need for mass transit.
""I was a little cautious but, hey, we're back to normal,"" passenger Matthew Mosk said on an N train that had just passed through the 36th Street station. ""NYC strong. Just like it never happened.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean official likely to oversee North Korean ties said on Thursday he opposed a ban on sending propaganda into North Korea, signalling the possible return to the skies of leaflet-laden balloons that infuriate North Korea.
Kwon Young-se, nominated for the post of unification minister in a new conservative government, said he believed a ban on people sending propaganda, introduced by the outgoing liberal government as it tried to improve ties with the North, was a violation of the right to free speech.
""I thought legally regulating such activities was constitutionally problematic,"" Kwon told reporters.
North Korean defectors and activists in South Korea had for decades sent balloons carrying leaflets floating across the tightly guarded border between the two Koreas.
They also sent food, medicine, money, mini radios and USB sticks loaded with South Korean news and dramas via balloons and plastic bottles on border waterways. 
North Korea, which is still technically at war with the South after their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, has in the past threatened to attack South Korea over the balloons.
The outgoing government banned the propaganda efforts in 2020 saying they jeopardised the safety of residents on the border.
Defectors and activists denounced the ban as part of efforts to white-wash the North and silence critics as the government tried to improve ties. 
President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol, set to take office on May 10, nominated Kwon on Wednesday for the job of handling North Korea policy at the Unification Ministry as a new government takes shape that is expected to take a harder line with the North.
Kwon said he maintained a position set out in a 2021 commentary in which he called for abolishing the ban and accused the then administration of neglecting ordinary North Koreans. 
""The current government appeared to be only keen to improve relations with the North's leadership, and not interested in changing North Korean society,"" he wrote at that time.

Kwon, who will face a parliamentary confirmation hearing, said it would be ""difficult to normalise"" inter-Korean ties at a time when Pyongyang continues to develop its nuclear programme. 
A Yoon administration might look ""hardline"" and ""hawkish"" as it sought to build up its military capability to better deter North Korean threats but he would work to create momentum for dialogue to defuse tension, Kwon said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday stopped short of promising to launch its own inquiry to determine whether genocide was committed by Russia in Ukraine but said it will support international efforts to hold Russia accountable.
President Joe Biden said for the first time on Tuesday that Russia's invasion of Ukraine amounts to genocide, a significant escalation of his rhetoric.
U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price on Wednesday declined to say whether Biden's comments reflected the overall position of the U.S. government, but said the president ""was speaking to the impression he had garnered from watching the horrific footage that we've all seen"" from Ukraine.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the Biden administration would further assess whether to launch its own formal review.
Price said the United States supported international lawyers trying to determine whether a legal threshold was met, but did not say whether the United States would launch its own inquiry.
""What we are doing is the most effective means of achieving that ultimate goal of accountability,"" Price said.
Such a State Department determination normally follows a meticulous internal process, but the final decision is up to the secretary of state, who weighs whether it advances American interests, officials said.
Genocide, considered the most serious international offense, was first used to describe the Nazi Holocaust. It was established in 1948 as a crime under international law in a United Nations convention.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands and displaced millions.

Moscow calls its actions a ""special operation"" to destroy Ukraine's military capabilities and capture what it views as dangerous nationalists, but Ukraine and the West say Russia launched an unprovoked war of aggression.
The Kremlin said on Wednesday it categorically disagreed with Biden's description of Russia's actions in Ukraine as ""genocide,"" and accused Washington of hypocrisy.

Biden said on Tuesday that Russia's behaviour in Ukraine amounted to genocide in his view, using that word for the first time.
""We consider this kind of effort to distort the situation unacceptable,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on a conference call with reporters. ""This is hardly acceptable from a president of the United States, a country that has committed well-known crimes in recent times."" 
Biden told reporters on Tuesday ""it has become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of being able to be Ukrainian and the evidence is mounting"".
Under international law, genocide is an intent to destroy - in whole or in part - a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. 
Biden had earlier called Putin a ""war criminal"", a comment Moscow angrily rejected and said had brought relations with the United States to the brink of collapse.
Putin on Tuesday dismissed accusations that Russia had committed war crimes in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, where mass graves and tied bodies shot at close range were found after Russian troops withdrew, as ""fake"". 
Moscow has said it believed the incident was staged. 

Moscow's incursion into Ukraine, the biggest attack on a European state since 1945, has seen more than 4.6 million people flee abroad, killed or wounded thousands and left Russia increasingly isolated on the world stage.
The Kremlin says it launched a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Kyiv and its Western allies reject that as a false pretext for an unprovoked attack.

(Reuters) -Rubble and ashes, overlooked by a single golden pagoda, are almost all that remain of the wood and brick houses most people had built for themselves in the quiet riverside village of Bin in the Buddhist heartland of central Myanmar. 
Bin is one of more than 100 villages partially or completely burned by Myanmar's military since the start of this year, its homes among more than 5,500 civilian buildings razed as troops try to suppress opposition to last year's coup, according to media reports collated by activist group Data For Myanmar.
Dozens of satellite images reviewed by Reuters, supplied by U.S earth-imaging company Planet Labs and U.S space agency NASA, show widespread torching of villages in the central part of the country. The photos, largely confirming the local media reports, are among the strongest evidence to date that the military is using widespread arson to step up its assault on resistance in the central Sagaing region, where residents have told Reuters there is armed opposition to the junta.
""It's a campaign of terror,"" Tom Andrews, the United Nations special envoy for human rights in Myanmar, told Reuters. ""If you live in an area or village that they (the junta) think is particularly supportive of those that have taken up arms then you are, in their view, the enemy.""
Andrews, who is based in the United States, told Reuters he has spoken by phone with several witnesses and other people providing him with information on the ground. He said these people told him that the military had increased attacks in Sagaing over the past few months, with soldiers leading ground assaults and jets carrying out air strikes. 
The junta, which overthrew the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1, 2021, has declared any opposition to it illegal and says the military is seeking to restore order in the country. Myanmar's military did not respond to requests for comment for this story. Over the past few months the junta has accused opposition forces of burning villages, without presenting evidence. 
The military and pro-military militias have been setting fire to villages in central Myanmar almost every day since December, according to reports from BBC Burmese and local media collated by Data For Myanmar and seen by Reuters. Publicly available NASA satellite photos confirm the location of almost all the largest blazes. 
Military attacks and arson have led to large-scale displacements, residents told Reuters. More than 52,000 people fled their homes in the last week of February alone, according to the United Nations.
The recent burnings are the first time such a tactic has been seen in the formerly peaceful, mostly Buddhist central heartland. Over the past year, the region has been the site of intense fighting between junta troops and groups belonging to the People's Defence Force (PDF), the armed wing of the National Unity Government (NUG), which was ousted in the coup. The junta has declared the NUG and PDF illegal and branded them terrorists. 
Reuters spoke to 14 villagers from the Sagaing region who described how soldiers torched their settlements. Reuters was unable to confirm certain aspects of their accounts. But they were nonetheless consistent with the satellite images seen by the news agency. 
'DESTROYED IN A SECOND'
Bin was set ablaze by the military on Jan. 31, according to seven residents who spoke to Reuters. 
Photographs and video of Bin taken by locals over the following days, seen by Reuters, show villagers picking their way through a burned wasteland. ""We lost everything we have,"" 41-year-old Maung Zaw, a peanut farmer, told Reuters by phone. ""I will fight against this military dictatorship to the end.""
Three people said they helped carry elderly relatives and friends out of their homes as they were about to be torched or already blazing. One man, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution by the military, told Reuters he crawled into nearby fields and covered himself with tomato plants to hide from the soldiers. 
A satellite photo dated Feb. 7, shared with Reuters by Planet Labs, shows much of the village burned to ashes, with about 100 homes destroyed. A photo from Nov. 27 shows the village intact. Reuters also saw six photographs and a video taken by residents from a drone, showing the destruction.
The witnesses said nobody was killed but they lost storehouses full of crops and food for animals as well as their homes, built over generations. 
""We built our house our whole lives, it has been destroyed in a second,"" said a teacher in his 20s from Bin, who asked not to be named, for fear of retribution from the military. 
Reuters was unable to reach local authorities in the region to confirm the attack on Bin and other villages. 
The burning of villages and displacement of inhabitants in areas such as Sagaing and Magway – where much of the country's crops are produced - will disrupt sowing and harvesting, according to the Myanmar Food Security Cluster, a body coordinating the response of U.N. and aid organizations to food crises in the country. ""Reduction in production in such areas will lead to deficit in overall food supply and will further escalate the already high food prices,"" the group told Reuters in a statement this week. 
FAMILIAR TACTIC 
Beyond the razing of Bin, seven other people told Reuters they witnessed the burning of another three villages in the Sagaing region in February: Ohn Hnae Bok, Hna Ma Sar Yit and Chaung-U. Three NASA images and eight Planet Labs photos show fires took place in those villages on the dates the people described the attacks.
Two people from Hna Ma Sar Yit said soldiers shot two people dead while three elderly people burned to death in their homes. Reuters could not independently verify their accounts. Myanmar's military has cut internet access across Sagaing region, complicating efforts to authenticate information. The junta did not respond to requests for comment. 
Burning villages is a decades-old tactic of the Myanmar military, several analysts told Reuters, used to deprive insurgencies of support. Most recently, the army destroyed hundreds of villages in 2017 as it pushed hundreds of thousands of Muslim Rohingya out of the Rakhine region. 
Last month the United States formally determined that the Myanmar military committed genocide against the Rohingya. The United Nations has said Myanmar troops carried out a crackdown with ""genocidal intent"" that included mass killings, arson and rape. Without evidence, Myanmar's military said the Rohingya burned their own homes down.

The military is ""attempting to crush, or at least reduce to a manageable level,"" resistance forces in Sagaing before the onset of the monsoon season in May or June, when troop movement becomes more difficult, said Anthony Davis, a security analyst with the UK-based Janes defence intelligence company. 
The junta did not respond to requests for comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine on Wednesday, expanding the scope of the systems provided to include heavy artillery ahead of a wider Russian assault expected in eastern Ukraine.
The package, which brings the total military aid since Russian forces invaded in February to more than $2.5 billion, includes artillery systems, artillery rounds, armored personnel carriers and unmanned coastal defense boats, Biden said in a statement after a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
Biden said he had also approved the transfer of additional helicopters, saying equipment provided to Ukraine ""has been critical"" as it confronts the invasion.
""We cannot rest now. As I assured President Zelenskyy, the American people will continue to stand with the brave Ukrainian people in their fight for freedom,"" Biden said in a written statement.
The new package includes 11 Mi-17 helicopters that had been earmarked for Afghanistan before the U.S.-backed government collapsed last year. It also includes 18 155mm howitzers, along with 40,000 artillery rounds, counter-artillery radars, 200 armored personnel carriers and 300 additional ""Switchblade"" drones. 
This was the first time howitzers have been provided to Ukraine by the United States.
Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said some of the systems, like the howitzers and radars, will require additional training for Ukrainian forces not accustomed to using American military equipment. 
""We're aware of the clock and we know time is not our friend,"" Kirby said when asked about the speed of deliveries.
'BIGGER, MORE POWERFUL WEAPONS'
The new aid - first reported by Reuters on Tuesday - will be funded using Presidential Drawdown Authority, or PDA, in which the president can authorize the transfer of articles and services from U.S. stocks without congressional approval in response to an emergency.
John Spencer, a retired U.S. Army major and expert on urban warfare at the Madison Policy Forum, said he was excited to see that the United States was sending artillery and artillery rounds. 
""You need these bigger, more powerful weapons ... to match what Russia is bringing to try to take eastern Ukraine,"" Spencer said.
As news of the latest security assistance came out, executives from the top U.S. weapons makers met with Pentagon officials to discuss the industrial challenges in the event of a protracted Ukraine conflict. 
These included executives from BAE Systems (OTC:BAESF) Plc, General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD),  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), Huntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII) Industries, L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX), Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp and  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC).
In a statement, Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon said the discussion ""focused primarily on accelerating production and building more capacity across the industrial base for weapons and equipment that can be exported rapidly, deployed with minimal training, and prove effective in the battlefield."" 
Zelenskiy has been pleading with U.S. and European leaders to provide heavier arms and equipment. Thousands have been killed and millions displaced in the seven-week-long invasion.
Russia has been unable to achieve most of its military goals as Ukrainians have put up a fiercer-than-expected resistance.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" to destroy Ukraine's military capabilities and capture what it views as dangerous nationalists, but Ukraine and the West say Russia began an unprovoked war of aggression. 
On Wednesday, Russia said it had taken control of the southeastern Ukrainian port of Mariupol and that more than 1,000 Ukrainian marines had surrendered.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Securities regulators in the U.S. states of Texas and Alabama on Wednesday ordered an online casino developer to stop selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs), alleging the firm was illegally offering unregistered securities and defrauding the public.
Cyprus-based Sand Vegas Casino Club and co-founders Martin Schwarzberger and Finn Ruben Warnke allegedly offered 11,111 NFTs in a ""high-tech fraudulent securities offering"" to fundraise to build virtual casinos in the metaverse. They also erroneously told potential buyers the tokens were not securities, the Texas State Securities Board said in a statement.
Sand Vegas promised buyers of its Gambler and Golden Gambler NFTs they would share in virtual casino profits, forecasting proceeds of as much as $81,000 each year, the regulators said.
Sand Vegas and the co-founders could not be reached immediately for comment. 
The cease-and-desist order appears to be the first of its kind tied to internet-based virtual environment platforms, colloquially known as the metaverse. It also marks a new frontier for U.S. authorities seeking to clamp down on NFTs, blockchain-based tokens that represent assets such as a piece of digital art. Last month, two men were arrested and charged with scamming NFT buyers worth $1.1 million.
Though this latest case is relatively small, state actions often spark interest from federal regulators. NFTs have seen a surge in investor interest, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not yet offered formal guidance on whether they could be considered securities in some instances.
A spokesperson for OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, said the firm had disabled buying, selling and transferring of Sand Vegas tokens because the collections were in violation of the platform's service terms.

Joe Rotunda, enforcement director at the Texas State Securities Board, said the regulator has spotted a number of securities offerings in the metaverse.
""This is a hot area,"" he told Reuters. ""We are coordinating among states to investigate the offerings and plan enforcement actions if necessary.""

KYIV/LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukraine warned on Wednesday that Russia was ramping up efforts in the South and East as it seeks full control of Mariupol, in what would be the first major city to fall, while Western governments committed more military help to bolster Kyiv. 
The Kremlin's nearly seven-week-long incursion, the biggest attack on a European state since 1945, has not gone to plan. 
Russia has been forced to pull back from some northern areas even as attacks across the country have turned Ukrainian cities to rubble and caused more than 4.6 million people to flee abroad. 
Russia's defence ministry on Wednesday said 1,026 soldiers from Ukraine's 36th Marine Brigade, including 162 officers, had surrendered in Mariupol, which has been besieged for weeks, and that the port was fully under its control. 
Capturing its Azovstal industrial district, where the marines have been holed up, would give the Russians full control of Ukraine's main Sea of Azov port, reinforce a southern land corridor and expand its occupation of the country's East.
Ukraine's general staff said Russian forces were attacking Azovstal and the port, but a defence ministry spokesman said he had no information about any surrender.
""Russian forces are increasing their activities on the southern and eastern fronts, attempting to avenge their defeats,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a Wednesday night video address. 
Reuters journalists accompanying Russian-backed separatists saw flames billowing from the Azovstal area on Tuesday, a day after Ukraine's 36th Marine Brigade said its troops had run out of ammunition.
The United States announced on Wednesday an extra $800 million in military assistance including artillery systems, armoured personnel carriers and helicopters. This took total U.S. military aid to more than $2.5 billion. France and Germany also pledged more.
Russia will view U.S. and NATO vehicles transporting weapons on Ukrainian territory as legitimate military targets, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the TASS news agency.
It will impose tit-for-tat sanctions on 398 members of the U.S. House of Representatives and 87 Canadian senators, Interfax cited the foreign ministry as saying, after Washington targeted 328 members of Russia's lower house of parliament. 
Britain announced new financial measures on separatists. 
'LIBERATE US FROM WHAT?' 
Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol and accuses Russia of blocking aid convoys to civilians marooned there. 
Its mayor, Vadym Boichenko, said Russia had brought in mobile crematoria ""to get rid of evidence of war crimes"" - a statement that was not possible to verify. 
Moscow has blamed Ukraine for civilian deaths and accused Kyiv of denigrating Russian armed forces.
In the village of Lubianka northwest of Kyiv, from where Russian forces had tried and failed to subdue the capital before being driven away, a message to Ukrainians had been written on the wall of a house that had been occupied by Russian troops.
""We did not want this ... forgive us,"" it said.
The Kremlin says it launched a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""liberate"" Ukraine, a message villagers said had been repeated to them by the Russian troops.
""To liberate us from what? We're peaceful... We're Ukrainians,"" Lubianka resident Viktor Shaposhnikov said.
Polish President Andrzej Duda said on a visit to Kyiv with his Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian counterparts that those who had committed and ordered crimes must be brought to justice.
Germany's president did not join them as he had planned.
Zelenskiy said there had been no official approach and one of his officials denied a newspaper report he had rejected the visit due to Steinmeier's recent good relations with Moscow.
BIDEN'S GENOCIDE COMMENTS 
The Kremlin denounced President Joe Biden's description of Moscow's actions in Ukraine as amounting to genocide, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying this was unacceptable coming from the leader of a country he said had committed crimes of its own.
The White House said a legal process will be undertaken.
An initial report by a mission of experts set up by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe documents a ""catalogue of inhumanity"" by Russian troops in Ukraine, according to the U.S. ambassador to the OSCE.
""This includes evidence of direct targeting of civilians, attacks on medical facilities, rape, executions, looting and forced deportation of civilians to Russia,"" Michael Carpenter said. 
Russia has denied targeting civilians and has said Ukrainian and Western allegations of war crimes are fabricated.
The Kyiv district police chief said 720 bodies had been found in the region around the capital from where Russian forces had retreated, with more than 200 people missing.
International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan said after visiting Bucha, a town where bound bodies of people apparently shot at close range were found, that Ukraine was a ""crime scene"" and this was within ICC jurisdiction.
""We have to pierce the fog of war to get to the truth,” Khan said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
The mayor of the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest, said bombing had increased significantly on Wednesday and satellite photos from Maxar Technologies (NYSE:MAXR) showed long columns of armoured vehicles in the region.

At least seven people were killed, including a two-year-old boy, and 22 wounded in Kharkiv over the past 24 hours. Ukrainian forces shot down two Russian planes attacking towns in the region, regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said earlier.
Reuters could not immediately verify his statement but filmed people in Kharkiv quietly carrying bodies from an apartment block hit by shelling.

PARIS (Reuters) -French President Emmanuel Macron launched a scathing attack on far-right rival Marine Le Pen on Wednesday, saying her true ""authoritarian"" intentions were showing after she banned a team of reporters and did not rule out a return to the death penalty.
Macron, a pro-European centrist, became president in 2017 after easily beating Le Pen when voters rallied behind him to keep the far-right out of power. This time, he faces a tougher challenge.
Slightly behind in opinion polls, Le Pen has successfully softened her image and tapped into anger over the cost of living and a perception Macron is disconnected from everyday hardships. Some polls show her victory in the April 24 runoff is within the margin of error.
""Despite all the efforts, the true face of the far-right is coming back. It is a face that doesn't respect freedoms, the constitutional framework, press independence and fundamental freedoms, rights,"" Macron told France 2 television.
Such comments are the start of an ""authoritarian drift,"" said Macron, who has of late categorised Le Pen's manifesto as full of lies and false promises that conceal a far-right agenda ultimately leading to France leaving the European Union.
Le Pen said the show whose journalists were refused accreditation was entertainment rather than journalism and that she reserved the right - now as a candidate, and later as president if elected - to choose who may attend her news conferences.
She retorted that Macron was showing his ""weakness"" and was in no position to give lessons on how to handle the press.
Macron has had a bumpy relationship with the media during his presidency and last week was criticised for refusing to take part in several prime time shows ahead of the first round.
""He'd be better off going into the substance of my project. It is known, transparent. We can discuss it and argue over our disagreements,"" Le Pen said at a campaign stop outside of Paris.
FREXIT?
Later on Wednesday, Le Pen - a eurosceptic who had long professed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin - gave a news conference on her foreign policy plans, which she said was aimed at clearing up what she called misunderstandings.
""Nobody is against Europe,"" said Le Pen, who has ditched plans to leave the EU or the euro, which cost her votes in past elections. 
She said she aimed to reform the EU from the inside, in what critics say would be a ""Frexit"" departure from the bloc in all but name. 
LEFTWING VOTES
Ahead of the second round, both candidates are seeking to win over left-wing voters, especially from hard-left third-place candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon.
Melenchon's party launched a consultation on Wednesday to ask his supporters if they planned to vote for Macron, put in a blank ballot or not vote. 
""Neither Emmanuel Macron nor Marine Le Pen are up to the task,"" Melenchon wrote. ""However, the two are not equivalent. Marine Le Pen adds a dangerous ferment of ethnic and religious exclusion to the project of social damage that she shares with Emmanuel Macron.""
Even after the consultation closes on Saturday, Melenchon signalled he would give voters no instruction on what they should do on the 24th - whereas other parties have urged voters to back Macron in order to block the far-right. 
Macron, who already had said he would increase pensions this summer if re-elected, told TF1 television that it would be a 4% increase. On Monday, he opened the door to potentially pushing the retirement age from 62 at the moment to 64, rather than to 65, his initial proposal.

Macron's efforts to woo leftwing voters could be hurt after former conservative President Nicolas Sarkozy, a reviled figure on the left, endorsed him and forced Macron to deny there was any wider political agreement.
Macron will need a new majority after legislative elections in June and political sources have said Sarkozy's endorsement could pave the way for an alliance between the centre-right Les Republicains party and Macron's LaRem.

COLOMBO (Reuters) -Sri Lanka's prime minister offered talks on Wednesday with protesters calling for the government to step down over its handling of an economic crisis as the opposition threatened to bring a no-confidence motion against it in parliament.
The island nation of 22 million people is in the throes of its worst financial crisis since independence in 1948, with a foreign currency shortage stalling imports of fuel and medicines and bringing hours of power cuts a day.
Thousands of people have taken to the streets, many staging a sit-in in the commercial capital, Colombo, to denounce the government led by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his elder brother, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.
""The prime minister is ready to start talks with the protesters at Galle Face Green,"" his office said in a statement, referring to a protest site that has become the focus of discontent.
""If protesters are ready to discuss their proposals to resolve the challenges currently facing the nation, then the prime minister is ready to invite their representatives for talks,"" the office said.
Some of the protesters at the tent encampment, which has been growing over recent days with food stalls, medical facilities and phone charging stations, said this week they would only leave if the Rajapaksas stepped down.
Sri Lanka is due to begin negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) next week for a loan programme, after months of delay as the crisis worsened.
Multiple ratings agencies on Wednesday downgraded Sri Lanka's sovereign rating, citing the economic crisis in the country and rising external funding pressures.
Fitch also downgraded Sri Lanka's foreign-currency rating and said the move reflects its view that a sovereign default process has begun.
""Sri Lanka's debt restructuring process is likely to be complicated and may take months to complete,"" S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) said in a statement.
Earlier on Wednesday, the World Bank revised Sri Lanka's growth estimates to 2.4% from 2.1% earlier, but warned that the economic outlook continues to remain uncertain.
On Tuesday, the central bank chief said he was suspending foreign debt payments and diverting dwindling foreign reserves to importing essentials.
The IMF said it was assessing the specific implications of Tuesday's announcement but supported the country's plans to engage with creditors.
""We assessed Sri Lanka's debt to be unsustainable and that the country's fiscal efforts and macroeconomic policy adjustments alone could not restore debt sustainability,"" Masahiro Nozaki, IMF's mission chief for Sri Lanka, told Reuters in a statement on Wednesday.
""Therefore, we welcome the Sri Lankan authorities plan to engage in a collaborative dialogue with their creditors.""
Analysts at JP Morgan have underlined political instability as a key risk as the government scrambles to secure external assistance. 
Adding to the uncertainty, the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) alliance said it would give the president and prime minister a week to step down before moving a no-confidence motion in parliament.
""Political stability is a pre-condition for IMF talks. The people have no confidence in this government,"" the SJB's national organiser, Eran Wickramaratne, told Reuters.
""The president and the prime minister must resign,"" Wickramaratne said, adding that the opposition had the necessary numbers in parliament.

The government has said it holds a majority in the 225-member parliament, which is scheduled to meet next week, despite more than two dozen lawmakers leaving the ruling coalition and declaring themselves independent last week.
The roots of the crisis lie in mismanagement of public finances that critics say has been exacerbated by tax cuts enacted by the government just before the COVID-19 pandemic.

DUBAI (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy on Wednesday said it was establishing a new multinational task force that would target arms smuggling in the waters around Yemen, the latest American military response to Houthi attacks on Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Washington has sought to reassure Saudi Arabia and the UAE, who see the U.S. commitment to the region as waning, by providing additional military support in recent months following the missile and drone attacks on the Gulf nations.
Fifth Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Brad Cooper said that the task force would, from Sunday, ensure a force presence and deterrent posture in the Red Sea, Bab al-Mandab and Gulf of Aden.
""These are strategically important waters that warrant our attention,"" Cooper said on a call with reporters, adding that the trafficking of people and drugs would also be targeted.
The waters around Yemen are a key passageway for global trade, including oil supplies, and vessels have in the past been targeted by the Houthis, as well as other forces.
More than a decade ago, increased naval patrols helped curb pirate attacks on commercial vessels navigating nearby waters.
Asked about the air raids from Yemen on U.S. partners Saudi Arabia and the UAE, Cooper said the task force would impact the Houthi's ability to obtain the weaponry needed for such attacks.
""We'll be able to do it more vibrantly and more directly than we do today,"" Cooper added.
A U.S. official told Reuters that the waters between Somalia, Djibouti and Yemen were well-known ""smuggling paths"" for weapons destined for the Houthis.
""The new international task force will certainly go after this issue,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
Iran has long been accused of smuggling weapons to the Houthis, a charge it denies.
The new naval task force would consist of between two and eight vessels and is part of the 34-nation Combined Maritime Forces, which Cooper also commands, that has three other task forces in nearby waters targeting smuggling and piracy.
The United States has provided Saudi Arabia and the UAE this year with additional air defence support following the Houthi attacks.

But diplomatic sources have said that the Gulf states remain convinced that the U.S. commitment to the region is weakening.
The launch of the task force comes amid a two-month truce in the nearly seven-year Yemen war that has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions more.

Mariupol, which has been encircled by Russian troops for weeks, has seen the fiercest fighting and the most comprehensive destruction since Russia invaded on Feb. 24.
Russian television on Wednesday broadcast clips of what it said was the surrender. In the footage, unarmed men in military fatigues were visible walking with their hands up along a grass- and tree-lined path towards masked soldiers cradling assault rifles.
In one clip, four marines walked away from a damaged industrial building carrying a wounded person on a stretcher. One of the four carried a makeshift white flag as well. Wounded men were loaded onto a yellow bus. 
An unidentified Russian soldier said: ""You may be scared or not, but it is necessary to surrender anyway. The choice is not a big one. First, the encircling is tight enough. Second, there are at least five echelons (of troops), so it is not that simple to exit if someone would think that he can easily leave.""
More than a dozen solders were lined up in formation in a dark room, where an unidentified prisoner of war said in Russian: ""I was in a group of 13 to 15 men who moved together and survived. We had to surrender as we had been encircled."" 
The main Sea of Azov port is the biggest target in the eastern Donbas region that Moscow now calls the focus of its campaign. If captured, it would be the first major city to fall since the war began. Its capture would help secure a land passage between separatist-held eastern areas and Crimea, which Russia seized and annexed in 2014. 
Reuters could not independently confirm the surrender. Ukrainian defence ministry spokesperson Oleksandr Motuzyanyk said he had no information about it, and there was no immediate comment from the Ukrainian president's office or the Ukrainian general staff.
""In the town of Mariupol, near the Ilyich Iron and Steel Works, as a result of successful offensives by Russian armed forces and Donetsk People's Republic militia units, 1,026 Ukrainian soldiers of the 36th Marine Brigade voluntarily laid down arms and surrendered,"" the Russian defence ministry said in a statement.
On Monday, a post on the Ukrainian marine brigade's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page had said the unit was preparing for a final battle in Mariupol that would end in death or capture as its troops had run out of ammunition.
""Today will probably be the ultimate battle, as there is no ammo left,"" said the post. ""Beyond that: hand to hand fighting. Beyond that, for some death, for others capture.""

Some Ukrainian officials said at the time that the post may have been fake, and that troops were still holding out.
The Russian defence ministry said 151 wounded Ukrainian soldiers were treated on the spot and taken to Mariupol's city hospital.

BOSTON (Reuters) - The city of Springfield, Massachusetts has agreed to carry out reforms to resolve claims that its narcotics officers routinely used excessive force, the U.S. Justice Department said on Wednesday, in the first settlement of its type under President Joe Biden.
The settlement was the first court-enforced consent decree to require overhauls at a police department reached with a city since Attorney General Merrick Garland in April 2021 rescinded a policy implemented under the Democrat Biden's Republican predecessor Donald Trump that sharply curtailed their use. 
A Justice Department investigation found that officers in the Springfield Police Department's now-disbanded Narcotics Bureau engaged in a pattern or practice of using excessive force, routinely punching people in the face and often facing no discipline.
U.S. Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said the consent decree would help restore public trust in the city's police and stressed that the Justice Department is pursuing similar probes in cities including Minneapolis, Louisville and Phoenix.
The Minneapolis probe was announced after a white police officer was convicted last year of murdering a Black man named George Floyd in a 2020 incident that triggered racial justice protests in many U.S. cities.
""We are not going to turn our backs on the need for policing reform and the need for constitutional policing in communities across out country,"" Clarke told a news conference.
Springfield is a city of about 155,000 people located approximately 90 miles (145 km) west of Boston.
The Springfield investigation began in 2018 and resulted in 2020 in the only pattern-or-practice case of Trump's administration.
While consent decrees had long been used to overhaul police departments, the Justice Department announced no new ones during Trump's four years in office. The since-rescinded 2018 memo by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions curtailed their use.

The Springfield consent decree calls for a court-appointed independent monitor, requires officers to report all uses of force and calls for the creation of a team to investigate the most serious uses of force.
""We want to have the best police department,"" Springfield Mayor Domenic Sarno said at the news conference.

VIENNA (Reuters) - A mission of experts set up by Organization for Security and Cooperation and Europe (OSCE) nations has found evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity by Russia in Ukraine, the mission said in a report on Wednesday.
The mission was set up last month by 45 of the OSCE's 57 participating states to look into possible offences in Ukraine including war crimes and to pass on information to bodies such as international tribunals. Russia opposed it.
The OSCE is an international organisation that includes former Cold War foes the United States and Russia and various countries in Europe, Central Asia and North America.
""The mission found clear patterns of IHL (international humanitarian law) violations by the Russian forces,"" the report said, citing failures to take necessary precautions, act proportionately or spare sites like schools and hospitals.
Not all violations of international humanitarian law are war crimes. The mission comprised three professors of international law from Austria, Switzerland and the Czech Republic.
Russia's mission to the OSCE said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) the report ""is based solely on unfounded propaganda theses, contains references to dubious sources and logical stretches in the style of 'highly likely'"".
Despite Russian denials, the report said a March 9 attack on the Mariupol Maternity House and Children's Hospital was carried out by Russia and those responsible had committed a war crime. 
It also said the March 16 attack on Mariupol's Drama Theatre, in which local Ukrainian officials said roughly 300 people were killed, was a war crime.
""The Mission is not able to conclude whether the Russian attack on Ukraine per se may qualify as a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population,"" it said, referring to the context in which crimes like murder and rape constitute crimes against humanity.
""It however holds that some patterns of violent acts violating IHRL (international human rights law), which have been repeatedly documented in the course of the conflict, such as targeted killing, enforced disappearance or abductions of civilians ... are likely to meet this qualification,"" it said.
""Any single violent act of this type, committed as part of such an attack and with the knowledge of it, would then constitute a crime against humanity.""
The mission also found what it called violations by Ukraine, particularly in its treatment of prisoners of war, but it said Russia's violations ""are by far larger in nature and scale"".

""Taken as a whole, the report documents the catalog of inhumanity perpetrated by Russia's forces in Ukraine,"" U.S. ambassador to the OSCE Michael Carpenter said in a statement. 
""This includes evidence of direct targeting of civilians, attacks on medical facilities, rape, executions, looting, and forced deportation of civilians to Russia.""

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Human rights activist Nadia Murad launched global guidelines at the United Nations on Wednesday on how to safely and effectively collect evidence from survivors and witnesses of sexual violence in conflict.
Murad, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2018 for her efforts to end rape as a weapon of war, first addressed the U.N. Security Council in 2015 at the age of 22 - describing the torture and rape she suffered while enslaved by Islamic State a year earlier.
Dubbed the Murad Code, the new guidance was developed with British funding by campaign group Nadia's Initiative and the Institute for International Criminal Investigations, aiming to reduce the risk of further trauma for survivors when providing evidence.
""The Murad Code lays out clear and practical guidelines for centering the needs of survivors when collecting evidence, and ensuring that they receive justice and support, rather than repercussions. Survivors deserve at least that,"" she said.
The announcement comes as the United Nations says it is increasingly hearing accounts of rape and sexual violence in Ukraine and a Ukrainian human rights group accused Russian troops of using rape as a weapon of war. Since invading Ukraine on Feb. 24, Russia has denied attacking civilians.

""I am appalled by the growing number of reports of sexual violence by Russian forces emerging from the conflict in Ukraine,"" British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in a statement, describing the Murad Code as a ""vital step"" towards support for survivors and bringing perpetrators to justice.
Murad worked with human rights lawyer Amal Clooney to lobby the Security Council for a U.N. investigative team to collect, preserve and store evidence in Iraq of acts by Islamic State that may be war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide. The council created the team in 2017 and it began work a year later.

Adressing the Estonian parliament, Zelenskiy said: ""The Russian army is using all types of artillery, all types of missile, air bombs in particular phosphorous bombs against residential districts and civilian infrastructure.
""This is clear terror against the civilian population.""
He did not provide evidence and Reuters has not been able to independently verify his claims.
Russia has denied targeting civilians since it invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 and has said Ukrainian and Western allegations of war crimes are fabricated.
Ukraine has said it is checking unverified information that Russia may have used chemical weapons while besieging the southern Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. But Russia-backed separatists trying to seize complete control of the city have denied using chemical weapons and Moscow has in the past labelled U.S. talk of Russian forces using chemical weapons a tactic to divert attention away from awkward questions for Washington.
There was no immediate reaction from Moscow to Zelenskiy's comments.
Zelenskiy also said Russia had been forcibly deporting Ukrainians, again without producing evidence, and called for economic sanctions on Russia to continue, saying they were the only way to force Russia to agree peace terms.
Ukraine should get European Union candidate status and that a visit by the presidents of Poland and Baltic countries later on Wednesday was important as a signal of support to Ukraine, he said.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands and displaced millions. 
Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" to destroy Ukraine's military capabilities and root out what it views as dangerous nationalists, but Ukraine and the West say Russia launched an unprovoked war of aggression.

Investing.com -- The last defenders of the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol reportedly surrendered on Wednesday, as Russian troops massed for a new attack on the surrounding regions.
The Russian Defense Ministry said that over 1,000 members of the Ukrainian Marines had been taken prisoner.
Ukrainian authorities disputed the claim, saying elements of the 36th Marine Brigade had broken out of the encircling Russian lines. The reports couldn't be independently verified.
The city, which has been largely destroyed by Russian artillery and airstrikes over the last month, has been a major strategic goal for Russia since it invaded Ukraine at the end of February. Attacks on the city included one that killed over 300 civilians sheltering in a theater, and the destruction of a maternity hospital.
The developments come a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said that peace talks with Ukraine had reached “a dead end”, comments that were widely taken as signaling the start of a fresh offensive. Russia is now concentrating its forces on the eastern Ukraine region of Donbas, having been defeated in its attempts to take the capital Kyiv. 
A draft report by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe published by Politico earlier found a clear pattern of international humanitarian law violations by the Russian forces in their conduct of hostilities"" in Ukraine. The report also found ""credible evidence"" that ""the most fundamental human rights"" have been violated.
Late on Wednesday, President Joe Biden signaled that the U.S. will speed up the delivery of military aid to the country, after accusing Putin of committing 'genocide' for the first time. 
“Yes, I called it genocide. It’s become clearer and clearer that Putin is trying to wipe out the idea of even being Ukrainian,” Biden said.
Separately, Ukrainian authorities reported that they had captured Viktor Medvedchuk, a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician who had escaped house arrest in March. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had closed down television stations owned by Medvedchuk last year for spreading what he called pro-Russian propaganda.
Medvedchuk was seen as Putin’s closest ally in Ukrainian politics. Putin is reportedly the godfather of Medvedchuk’s daughter, and the two have often been photographed together.
Zelensky has now proposed exchanging Medvedchuk for Ukrainian soldiers captured by the Russians.",,,,,

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican's decision to have both Ukrainians and Russians take part in Pope Francis' ""Way of the Cross"" procession on Friday has caused friction with Ukrainian Catholic leaders, who want it to be reconsidered.
The annual Via Crucis event on Good Friday at the Colosseum consists of the 14 Stations of the Cross, stages between the condemnation of Jesus to death and his burial. It is often customised so that those who carry the cross from one station to the next reflect world events.
This year's programme for the evening candlelight service has a Ukrainian family and a Russian family sharing the carrying of the cross at the 13th station, which commemorates Jesus being taken down from the cross after his death.
""I consider such an idea inopportune, ambiguous, and such that it does not take into account the context of Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine,"" said Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk, head of Ukraine's Byzantine-rite Catholic Church.
The text of the meditation to be read at the 13th station speaks of reconciliation and reconstruction after bombings.
'OFFENSIVE' TEXT
Shevchuk, who is in Kyiv and has invited the pope to visit the Ukrainian capital, said in a statement on Tuesday that the text was ""incoherent and even offensive, especially in the context of the expected second, even bloodier attack of Russian troops on our cities and villages"".
He said he had asked the Vatican to review the decision.
In an accompanying statement, Shevchuk's Rome office said many Ukrainians were ""convinced that gestures of reconciliation between our peoples will be possible only when the war is over and those guilty of crimes against humanity are justly condemned"".
In a tweet, Ukraine's ambassador to the Vatican, Andrii Yurash, said he shared Shevchuck's concern and was working with the Vatican on ""trying to explain difficulties of its realisation and possible consequences"".
Since the war began, Francis has only mentioned Russiaexplicitly in prayers, such as during a special global event forpeace on March 25. But he has made clear his opposition toRussia's actions, using the words invasion, aggression andatrocities.
Moscow calls it actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" designed not to occupy territory but to demilitarise and ""denazify"" the country.

The Kremlin says allegations that Russian forces have committed war crimes by executing civilians in Ukraine were a ""monstrous forgery"" aimed at denigrating the Russian army.
Most Russians and Ukrainians are Orthodox Christians and this year will mark Easter a week later than Western churches.

The United States and Iran came close to full-blown conflict in 2020 after Soleimani's killing in a U.S. drone attack at Baghdad airport and Tehran's retaliation by attacking U.S. bases in Iraq. 
""Martyr Soleimani was such a great character that if all American leaders are killed, this will still not avenge his assassination,"" senior commander of the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) Mohammad Pakpour was quoted as saying by Iranian state media. 
""We should avenge him by following Soleimani's path and through other methods.""
Then-U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration said Soleimani was targeted for plotting future attacks on U.S. interests and that he had helped coordinate strikes on American forces in Iraq in the past through militia proxies.
Pakpour's comments came days after U.S. Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that he does not support removing Iran's Quds Force, an arm of its Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), from a list of foreign terrorist organizations, as demanded by Tehran for the revival of a 2015 nuclear deal.
Trump abandoned the deal under which Iran had agreed to curbs on its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of international financial sanctions, and Iran responded by violating its limits. President Joe Biden aims to restore it.
Almost a year of indirect talks between Iran and the United States have stalled since March as both Tehran and Washington blame each other for failing to settle remaining issues. One of the unresolved questions is whether the United States would remove Iran's Guards from the terrorist list.
Washington has been considering removing the IRGC from its foreign terrorist organization blacklist in return for Iranian assurances about reining in the elite force's influence in the Middle East.

Critics of dropping the IRGC from the list, as well as those open to the idea, say doing so will have little economic effect because other U.S. sanctions force foreign actors to shun the group.
Iran's top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said on Tuesday that his country's future should not be tied to the success or collapse of nuclear talks with world powers.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - On a patch of grass near Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's office in the commercial capital Colombo, around two dozen tents have been erected in a small but growing camp that is becoming the focal point of national protests.
Thousands of people have taken to the streets nearby and across the country in recent days to call for Rajapaksa to step down, venting their anger at soaring inflation and lengthy power cuts caused by the spiralling economic crisis.
On a handwritten board next to the tents, not far from the colonial-era presidential building adjoining Colombo's water front, stands the sign: ""Gota-Go Village"".
The slogan ""Gota go back,"" also referring to Gotabaya, is being chanted at demonstrations sweeping Sri Lanka, in an unprecedented public outcry that has brought together people of different faiths, ethnicities and social groups.
Close to the protest camp on Monday evening, a group of Christian nuns in white habits walked past a police barricade, atop which 11 protesters sat chanting. One held a poster saying ""Our Govt Failed Us"".
A short distance away, three Buddhist monks in bright saffron robes stood amid the crowd.
'OUR ONLY HOPE'
At the edge of a lawn, behind some tents, around 30 Muslim men sat in two lines to break their Ramadan fast.
Farzana F. Haniffa, a professor of sociology at the University of Colombo, said the protest site had become a space where all Sri Lankans could come together in a rare show of unity.
One common cause was anger at what protesters said was economic mismanagement by the Rajapaksa family.
Mahinda Rajapaksa, the president's elder brother, serves as prime minister and their younger brother, Basil, was finance minister until recently.
The administration says it is doing what it can to drag Sri Lanka out of a crisis that has left it unable to buy fuel and medicine and struggling to pay its debts.
Some protesters said they would only leave if the Rajapaksas stepped down. Mahinda Rajapaksa said in a televised address that the protests were hampering attempts to improve the situation.
Walking around barefoot early on Tuesday, after another night of heavy rain, Mary Suwen was rearranging tents that her husband had brought in from his adventure tourism business.
""The country is in a crisis so you can't stay at home,"" said Suwen, 27, a civil engineer.
""We need to pressure them,"" she said, talking of the Rajapaksas. ""They need to be accountable to the people.""
Gagana Atapattu, 22, said he was part of the election campaign that brought Gotabaya Rajapaksa to power in 2019, but now regretted working for him.
""I'm now suffering for what I did,"" he said, as he helped to manage donations of food, water and other supplies that Sri Lankans were bringing to be stored in large open tents.

Among those donating was Y.C. Kanthi, who waited in a long queue for fuel and then drove 15 km (9 miles) to deliver a pile of buns stuffed with caramelised onions for the protesters.
""I gave a special order to a nearby bakery and had them made for these youngsters,"" said Kanthi, 53. ""They are our future, they are our only hope out of this mess.""

(Reuters) -Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt on Tuesday signed a bill that makes it illegal to perform an abortion in the state except in medical emergencies, penalizing those who do with up to $100,000 in fines and 10 years in prison.
The legislation, which is one of several anti-abortion measures advanced by the state's Republican-controlled legislature this year, will take effect this summer unless it is blocked in court. 
""We want to choose life in Oklahoma. We do not want to allow abortions in the state of Oklahoma,"" Stitt said as he signed the bill at a news conference. 
If it takes effect, the ban will widen a swath of the country where there is little to no legal abortion access. Oklahoma has become a frequent destination for Texas women seeking abortions since the larger neighboring state in September banned abortions for pregnancies from about six weeks, before many women even know they are pregnant. 
Planned Parenthood abortion providers in Oklahoma saw a nearly 2,500% increase in Texas patients in the months after the Texas law took effect compared to the same period in 2020, the organization said.
""The ban signed today is cruel and if it takes effect this summer, will have a devastating impact on people in Oklahoma, neighboring Texans, as well as an entire region facing attacks on their rights to abortion access,"" Melissa Fowler, the National Abortion Federation's chief program officer, said in a statement. 
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki condemned the ban in a statement and called on Congress to pass legislation that would codify abortion rights nationally.
""The actions today in Oklahoma are a part of disturbing national trend attacking women’s rights and the Biden Administration will continue to stand with women in Oklahoma and across the country in the fight to defend their freedom to make their own choices about their futures,"" Psaki said. 
Separate legislation introduced in Oklahoma this year proposes banning almost all abortions and relying on private citizens to sue any person who ""aids or abets"" abortions, similar to Texas' six-week abortion ban. That bill contains an emergency clause, which would allow it to take effect immediately once it is signed by the governor. 
In the past few months, Republican-led states like Oklahoma have been quickly passing ever-stricter abortion bans with the anticipation that an impending U.S. Supreme Court decision could help the bans withstand legal challenges. 

The Supreme Court is due to rule by the end of June on a case involving a Republican-backed Mississippi law that gives its conservative majority a chance to undermine or even repeal the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.
During arguments in the case, the conservative justices signaled a willingness to dramatically curtail abortion rights in the United States.

Kadyrov is an ardent supporter of Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin and has deployed many of his fighters in Ukraine to bolster Russia's drive to ""demilitarise"" and ""denazify"" Ukraine.

In earlier postings, he vowed to proceed with the capture of Mariupol and to press on to take all other Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv

From winning his first PGA Tour event at the Phoenix Open just two months ago to claiming his first major title at Augusta National, Schleffer's rise has been nothing short of meteoric.
Starting the final round with a three-shot advantage over Australian Cameron Smith, the 25-year-old American carded a one-under 71 for a 10-under 278 total, three clear of Rory McIlroy and five ahead of Smith.
McIlroy's eight-under 64 matched the final-round record at the Masters as the Northern Irishman made a stirring late charge in a bid to claim the elusive title that would see him complete the career Grand Slam.
Scheffler said he could afford to focus on his own game thanks to his three-shot cushion.
""I may have looked calm on the outside, but it's a long day. It's a tough day,"" said Scheffler. 
""I was fortunate to put myself in a position where I was in control of the tournament today, so I didn't have to worry about what anyone else was doing out there.
""If I took care of my stuff and played good solid golf, I felt like I would get the job done.""
The year's first major was poised for a showdown between the planet's two hottest golfers in Scheffler, the winner of three of his last five PGA Tour starts, and Smith, who claimed golf's unofficial fifth major at the Players Championship in March.
And that is how the final round unfolded until the par three 12th in the heart of the notorious Amen Corner when Smith put his tee shot into Rae's Creek on the way to a triple bogey six, sending him down the leaderboard.
""It's just a really bad swing,"" said Smith. ""Probably one of the worst swings of the week and just at the worst time of the week. Just unfortunate, but I'll grow from this and be stronger for it.""
A rattled Smith never recovered, slumping to a one-over 73 to finish five back in a tie for third with Irishman Shane Lowry, who closed with 69.
'ENJOY THIS'
Smith got his day off to a scintillating start with back-to-back birdies.
But Scheffler hit back with a spectacular chip-in birdie at the third, which Smith would bogey, restoring the world number one's three-shot cushion.
Smith slumped to a second bogey on the par three fourth and suddenly Scheffler had stretched his lead to four.
As the pair started the back nine, a mighty roar rolled across Augusta National after McIlroy carded an eagle at the 13th to get to six-under for the tournament.
That left McIlroy five back of Scheffler and one behind Smith, raising pressure on the pair as they entered Amen Corner -- holes 11, 12 and 13, perhaps the most famous stretch of golf real estate where so many Masters have been won and lost.
""I've had the lead on the back nine here and haven't been able to get it done,"" said McIlroy. ""I just wanted to try and put a little bit of pressure on and I feel like I did that.""
A long birdie putt at 11 by Smith triggered an explosion of cheers that would have been heard back home in Brisbane.
But then came the 12th, where so many Green Jacket dreams have turned into nightmares, Smith's now among them after his tee shot found the water.
""It was definitely nice to build up a lead,"" said Scheffler. ""Nothing is safe out there on the back nine on this golf course. 
""I've heard all the things that everybody says, it doesn't start till the back nine on Sunday, anything can happen, don't hit in the water on 12, all the stuff.
""I just blocked most of that out and tried to execute and hit good golf shots.""
The only moment Scheffler showed any hint of nerves came at the very end, standing on the 18th green and missing two short putts that would have given him a bigger margin of victory.

""I didn't want any stress towards the end of the day,"" said Scheffler. ""I didn't break my concentration until we got on to the green on 18. 
""Once we got on to the green, I was like, all right, I'm going to enjoy this, and had some fun with it.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Police mounted an intense manhunt on Tuesday for a gunman who set off two smoke bombs and opened fire in a New York subway car, injuring more than 20 people in a morning rush-hour attack that prompted new calls to fight violence in the city's transit system.
Police said the gunman was believed to have acted alone and immediately fled the crime scene. The attack unfolded as a Manhattan-bound subway train on the N line was pulling into an underground station in Brooklyn's Sunset Park neighborhood.
Ten people were hit directly by gunfire, including five hospitalized in critical but stable condition, authorities said.
Police said 13 more people suffered from smoke inhalation or were otherwise injured in the chaos as panicked riders fled the smoke-filled subway car. Some collapsed to the pavement as they poured onto the platform of the 36th Street station. The fire department said two of those hurt were treated at the scene.
All of the victims were expected to survive their injuries, police said.
New York Police Department (NYPD) Commissioner Keechant Sewell said a U-Haul van believed to be connected to the shooting was later located in Brooklyn, but the perpetrator remained at large several hours after the shooting.
At an early evening news briefing, police named a ""person of interest"" in the investigation as Frank James, who investigators believed had rented the U-Haul vehicle. 
Police said they recovered the key to the van at the crime scene and it had been rented in Philadelphia. James had addresses in Philadelphia and Wisconsin, officials said. Attempts by Reuters to reach any of the phone numbers associated with James were unsuccessful.
The subway assailant was described by police from eyewitness accounts as a man of heavy build, wearing an orange vest, a gray sweatshirt, a green helmet and surgical mask.
The commissioner said the attack began in the train car as it was about to enter the station. The gunman removed two canisters from his bag and opened them, sending smoke throughout the train car.
Police said the man then fired 33 rounds from a Glock 9 mm semi-automatic handgun, which was later recovered along with three extended ammunition magazines, a hatchet, some consumer-grade fireworks and a container of gasoline.
Sewell said earlier that the shooting was not immediately being treated as an act of terrorism. There was no known motive for the attack, but investigators found a number of social media posts linked to an individual named Frank James that mentioned homelessness and the New York City mayor, Sewell said.
SUBWAY VIOLENCE RISING
New York City has seen a sharp rise in violent crime during the pandemic, including a string of seemingly random attacks on its subways. The transit violence has included a number of attacks in which passengers were pushed onto the tracks from platforms, including a Manhattan woman whose murder was seen as part of a surge in hate crimes against Asian Americans.
Mayor Eric Adams, a former NYPD captain and Brooklyn borough president who took office in January, has vowed to improve subway safety by increasing police patrols and expanding mental health outreach programs.
Speaking to CNN, Adams said Tuesday's incident ""was a senseless act of violence"" and pledged to double the number of officers on subway patrol.
New York Governor Kathy Hochul pledged ""the full resources of our state to fight this surge of crime, this insanity that is feeding our city."" The White House said President Joe Biden had been briefed on the incident.
Outside the 36th Street station, in an area known for its thriving Chinatown and views of the Statue of Liberty, authorities cordoned off the immediate vicinity with crime-scene tape, while nearby schools were placed under security lockdowns. 
John Butsikares, a 15-year-old who passed through the 36th Street subway stop soon after the incident, said the conductor of another train that pulled into the station ordered everyone still on the station platform to get aboard. 
""I didn't know what happened. It was a scary moment. And then at 25th Street (the next station) we were all told to get off. There was people screaming for medical assistance,"" said Butsikares, who was going to school. 

Brooklyn resident Yayha Ibrahim said he saw people running from the 36th Street station, and decided to walk down into it to see what was happening. 
""I saw a lady, she was shot right in her leg and she was screaming for help,"" he said. Rescue workers ""did a good job of coming quick and fast, and the ambulance came in and they took her.""

At least 17 people were injured when a gunman wearing a gas mask set off a smoke bomb and opened fired on the train. Police said the man, believed to have acted alone, fled the scene. 
The morning rush-hour attack unfolded as a Manhattan-bound subway train on the N line was pulling into a station in Brooklyn's Sunset Park neighborhood setting off an intense manhunt by local and federal law enforcement.
""Our community was affected this morning in a tragic and senseless way,"" Nash said prior to the tip-off of the Nets play-in tournament home game against the Cleveland Cavaliers. 
""That's the subway stop for our practice facility and for our office, so it does hit home. You just feel for all those affected.""
The team held a moment of silence before the start of the game at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Center and said they and the WNBA's New York Liberty would donate $50,000 to help those who were injured.
Ten people were hit directly by gunfire, five of whom were hospitalized in critical but stable condition, authorities said. Seven others were injured by shrapnel or otherwise hurt in the chaos as panicked riders fled the smoke-filled subway car, some collapsing to the pavement as they poured onto the platform of the 36th Street station. The fire department said two of those hurt were treated at the scene.
According to CNN and other media organizations, a total of 29 people suffering various injuries in the incident turned up at area hospitals, though most appeared to have been emergency room walk-ins who were treated and discharged.

""And you recognize that we have a lot of growing to do as a society and a community and you feel for everybody,"" Nash said.
""It's more important now for our community to look at how to support each other and continue to live with conviction and find ways to overcome.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexican truck drivers blockaded bridges at the U.S. border for a second day on Tuesday to protest an order by the Texas governor meant to increase safety inspections that has snarled traffic and led business groups to warn of supply chain disruptions.
Mexico's government said in a statement it ""rejects"" the inspections imposed by Texas, estimating that two-thirds of normal trade was being held up and costing ""significant revenue"" for both U.S. and Mexican businesses. 
The slowdowns began after Abbott, a Republican, ordered officials last week to conduct vehicle safety inspections at entry ports to uncover smuggling of people and contraband. 
""Yesterday it took me 17 hours to cross into the United States and return,"" said Raymundo Galicia, a Mexican driver protesting at the Santa Teresa bridge connecting San Jeronimo, Chihuahua, to Santa Teresa, New Mexico.
The bridge is the third in the bustling Ciudad Juarez-El Paso area to be blockaded by drivers who have seen their pay plummet since lengthy wait times began last week. 
Traffic at a fourth bridge connecting Reynosa to Pharr, Texas, was also halted on Tuesday by drivers who parked their trucks and began barbecuing on the Mexican side of the port of entry, according to photos sent to Reuters.
""I get paid the same whether it takes me an hour or ten hours to cross, so this is affecting us a lot,"" Galicia said, noting he and his co-workers would target more bridges if delays continued. 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said in a statement the long waits were due to ""additional and unnecessary inspections"" ordered by Abbott and were causing ""critical impacts to an already-strained supply chain.""
The new measures have infuriated industry groups, which have warned of shortages of perishable products over the Easter holiday weekend.

""This plan is ... exacerbating our already disrupted supply chain, and will cripple an economy that relies so heavily on cross-border trade,"" U.S. Representative Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes most of El Paso, tweeted on Tuesday.
Mexico's National Chamber of Freight Transportation estimated the delays at the Pharr bridge alone caused economic losses of $8 million per day and called on Abbott to withdraw the order to prevent a ""collapse in international cross-border trade.""

(Reuters) - Gilbert Gottfried, a stand-up comic with a screwy voice and a penchant for pushing boundaries with jokes about the Sept. 11 attacks and the Japanese tsunami, has died at age 67, his family said on Tuesday.
Gottfried, a former cast member on NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" and the voice of a sarcastic parrot in the animated Disney film ""Aladdin,"" suffered a long, unspecified illness, the family statement said.
""In addition to being the most iconic voice in comedy, Gilbert was a wonderful husband, brother, friend and father to his two young children,"" the statement said. ""Although today is a sad day for all of us, please keep laughing as loud as possible in Gilbert's honor.""
Born in Brooklyn, and rising up through the New York City stand-up scene, Gottfried was known for edgy comedy that made some people squirm.
Two weeks after the attacks on New York and Washington that killed nearly 3,000 people in 2001, Gottfried joked about it during a roast of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, saying he could not book a direct flight from New York to California.
""They said they have to stop at the Empire State Building first,"" Gottfried said, drawing laughs and moans of ""too soon.""
Reflecting on the moment later, Gottfried said in a television interview, ""That's the way my mind works. I wanted to basically address the elephant in the room.""
That style of humor also cost him a lucrative role as the Aflac (NYSE:AFL) duck in television commercials for the insurer, which severed ties with Gottfried after he made a series of jokes on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) about the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that killed 18,000 people in Japan.
""I love to go where it's a dark area. You never know what people will choose to be offended by,"" Gottfried told The New York Times in 2013.
Tributes poured in from other comic actors.
Seth MacFarlane, creator of the animated series ""Family Guy"" and director of the comedy film ""A Million Ways to Die in the West,"" said Gottfried's outrageous send-up of Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg address in that movie made him laugh so hard on set that ""I could barely do my job.""
""A wholly original comic, and an equally kind and humble guy behind the scenes,"" MacFarlane said on Twitter. ""He will be missed.""
Jason Alexander, who played George on the television comedy ""Seinfeld,"" said on Twitter, ""Gilbert Gottfried made me laugh at times when laughter did not come easily. What a gift."" 
One of Gottfried's best known movie roles was as the voice of Iago, the loud-mouthed, sarcastic talking parrot of the evil Jafar in Disney's 1992 animated film hit ""Aladdin.""
He also reached what would normally be considered the pinnacle for American comic actors by getting named to the cast of ""Saturday Night Live"" in 1980, but the new cast was poorly received, having replaced highly popular players such as John Belushi, Gilda Radner and Bill Murray. 

Gottfried said he could not enjoy the experience, telling interviewer Joe Rogan last year that he felt like a ""sacrificial lamb.""
""You don't want to be the replacement,"" Gottfried said. ""You want to be the replacement of the replacement.""

BOSTON (Reuters) - Boston officials will increase the number of police around subway stations ahead of Monday's Boston Marathon after a mass shooting in a New York subway but stressed there was no known threat to the race and voiced confidence in it going ahead.
A gunman wearing a gas mask set off a smoke bomb and shot 10 people in a New York City subway car during Tuesday's morning commute, authorities said. None of the wounded had life-threatening injuries, they added, and a manhunt for the perpetrator was underway.
""There is no known credible threat to the marathon. Like everybody else, we're monitoring the situation in New York,"" Boston Police Superintendent-In-Chief Gregory Long told a news conference on Tuesday, adding that his department had been in touch with their New York counterparts and the FBI.
""In the short term you can expect to see an increased police presence around MBTA stations the next couple of days through the weekend. In terms of Monday, depending on what kind of information we have and intelligence, we'll adjust our assets accordingly around the marathon,"" he said.
Security is of top concern for local authorities with heightened measures put in place after the Boston Marathon bombing attacks of 2013.
The Boston Police Department will have uniformed and undercover officers along the marathon route on Monday, and set up cameras and checkpoints along the Boston part of the race to monitor the crowd.
The city is expecting especially large crowds on Monday because the marathon is returning to its traditional April race date for the first time in three years following pandemic-related disruptions, while baseball's Boston Red Sox will also be playing at home that day.
Boston Athletic Association (BAA) President Tom Grilk expressed his confidence in the ability of the city authorities to safeguard the event.

""We are the grateful beneficiaries, we at the BAA and all involved in the marathon, of the work of all the agencies you see represented here and many others. So concerned? Not concerned in any unusual way,"" he told the same news conference.
""Alert, vigilant in every possible way. But knowing that that vigilance is in the hands of all the right people we're very comfortable to proceed.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Eric Adams ran for mayor of New York City with campaign ads featuring old photographs of him in his police uniform and a vow to secure a pandemic-scarred metropolis against the gun violence that surged alongside COVID-19.
On his 102nd day in office, Adams, a former police captain, faced the latest challenge in his efforts to allay New Yorkers' fears: A gunman opened fire on a subway car Tuesday morning, shooting 10 people.
Violent crime has risen across the United States over the pandemic, and New York City has been no exception. Adams, a Democrat, has set himself the challenge of balancing New Yorkers' anxieties about crime with the distrust some have of a $10 billion police department that continues to reckon with a history of brutality and racism.
While the city remains one of the safest in the country and far less dangerous than it was in the 1990s, when Adams was rising through the New York City Police Department's ranks, the new mayor has revived some of the tough-on-crime policing tactics associated with that era under the Republican mayor Rudy Giuliani. 
These include a crackdown on low-level ""quality of life"" offenses such as public drinking and the revival of a plain-clothes police unit disbanded in 2020 over complaints of deadly violence and unaccountability.
To civil rights groups alarmed that police might again disproportionately target poor, Black and Latino New Yorkers, Adams has pointed to his own experiences with police brutality growing up as a Black man in Brooklyn's poorest corners. 
""I became a police officer to bridge the gap between us and to take on systemic racism from within,"" Adams, 61, said in a campaign ad. ""To revitalize our city New Yorkers need to feel safe and secure that our kids can play without getting hit by a stray bullet.""
Since he took office on Jan. 1, 363 people have been shot in the city as of last week, up about 9% from the same period last year. Rapes have increased 17%, assaults nearly 20% and robberies 48%. Murders have fallen 11% from early 2021, to 103 so far.
Some crimes have been front-page news: a woman pushed to her death onto the tracks at the Times Square subway station in February; a man who stabbed two workers at the Museum of Modern Art. Just last week, Adams stood beside a mother whose 12-year-old son was killed by the kind of stray bullets he had worried about in his campaign ads.
A few weeks earlier, Adams was defending police officers who shot an 18-year-old man in the head, leaving him critically wounded, after they said he tried to flee a traffic stop.
Adams, who often visits scenes of high-profile crimes and has made a point of riding the subways in which he began his policing career, was stuck in the mayor's residence on Tuesday, isolating after testing positive for COVID-19. In a recorded video statement, he said: ""We will not allow New Yorkers to be terrorized, even by a single individual.""
Haitham Taher, 20, who was waiting to pick up his brother from a school near the subway station where Tuesday's shooting occurred, said he felt the police were at best ineffective.
""You feel you're not protected,"" he said, as hundreds of police milled around him. ""If there's a parking ticket violation they will catch you right away but a person with a gun they won't catch for hours.""
As of Tuesday evening, roughly 11 hours after the subway shooting, the suspected gunman was still at large, though police named a man whom they called ""a person of interest."" https://twitter.com/NYPDnews?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor
In restoring the anti-gun unit, Adams has said officers are receiving additional training and wear body-worn cameras and a modified uniform instead of plain clothes.
They have made 26 arrests for illegal gun possession, but have more often made arrests for lower-level offenses, including possession of a fake ID, according to data obtained by the City & State news outlet.
Continuing a practice of his predecessors, Adams has also touted his effort to sweep hundreds of homeless encampments, saying he hopes to ""rebuild trust"" and induce homeless people into the much-maligned shelter system.
Adams, who also ran on a platform of affordable housing, says he is acting out of sympathy for people living in ""inhumane"" conditions. But homeless people and their advocates say the goal is to obscure visible signs of poverty, and say the sweeps are cruel and ineffectual, shuffling around people who have decided that the streets are safer than shelters.

Some legal observers say the sweeps are unconstitutional when sanitation workers and police trash New Yorkers' belongings without due process.
""It's just very easy for someone who came up in the NYPD through the Giuliani years to reach back to that playbook,"" Beth Haroules, a staff attorney at the New York Civil Liberties Union, said after watching city officials throw homeless New Yorkers' tents in a garbage truck last week.

121,"<span>Apr 12, 2022 07:27PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Wednesday mocked Moscow's insistence that the war against his nation was going well, asking how President Vladimir Putin could have approved a plan that involved so many Russians dying.
Putin, speaking on Tuesday, said Russia would achieve all of its ""noble"" aims and ""rhythmically and calmly"" continue what it calls a special operation.
Moscow said on March 25, its most recent update, that 1,351 soldiers had been killed since the start of the campaign. Ukraine says the real number is closer to 20,000.
""In Russia it was once again said that their so-called 'special operation' is supposedly going according to plan. But, to be honest, no one in the world understands how such a plan could even come about,"" Zelenskiy said in a video address.
""How could a plan that provides for the death of tens of thousands of their own soldiers in a little more than a month of war come about? Who could approve such a plan?""
Zelenskiy asked how many dead Russian soldiers would be acceptable to Putin, giving a range of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.
Moscow had lost more men in 48 days since the war started than in the 10-year Afghan war from 1979 to 1989, he said.
Zelenskiy said that while some had made fun of the Russians, their failures in the field and inferior technology, their opponents were not all hopeless.

""We must understand that not all Russian tanks are stuck in fields, not all enemy soldiers simply flee the battlefield and not all of them are conscripts who do not know how to hold weapons properly,"" he said.
""This does not mean that we should be afraid of them. This means that we must not diminish the accomplishments of our fighters, our army.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A U.S. judge on Tuesday declined to jail two men accused of impersonating federal agents and supplying Secret Service personnel with gifts, dealing a blow to prosecutors who had argued that the defendants pose a danger and should be detained.
Arian Taherzadeh, 40, and Haider Ali, 35, were arrested last week and are accused of providing gifts worth thousands of dollars such as rent-free apartments and iPhones to Secret Service agents, including one who protected first lady Jill Biden. The Secret Service is the agency responsible for protecting the president and other top U.S. officials.
""There's been no showing that national security information has been compromised,"" U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael Harvey said.
Harvey ordered both men to remain in home confinement, subject to GPS monitoring, with their parents and that they surrender their passports and stay away from airports and embassies. Harvey agreed to stay his order until Wednesday morning while the government mulls whether to appeal.
The judge said prosecutors did not prove the defendants tried to infiltrate the Secret Service with nefarious purposes, and noted they were so ""spectacularly outed"" that there is no risk anymore that they can continue to pose as agents.
Harvey said neither defendant is charged with a violent crime and neither one faces a stiff prison term if convicted - all elements that work against the prosecution's claims they pose a danger to the community. Harvey added there have been ""significantly worse and more dangerous impersonation cases"" before the court in the past.
At the same time, Harvey said he does believe prosecutors have enough evidence to secure convictions in the case.
The challenges prosecutors faced in convincing Harvey to detain the defendants appeared to stem, at least in part, from the rushed nature of the investigation.
Earlier on Tuesday, federal prosecutor Joshua Rothstein told the judge the FBI was forced to move before it was ready against the two after a Secret Service investigator for unclear reasons tipped them off that they were under scrutiny.
In a hearing, Rothstein said the tip-off occurred on April 4 after the Secret Service launched an internal inquiry and placed four agents on administrative leave for accepting gifts from Taherzadeh and Ali.
""An investigator, as part of that internal investigation, reached out to Mr. Taherzadeh via email ... saying that he needed to get information, and Mr. Taherzadeh responded,"" Rothstein told the judge. 
Rothstein did not explain why the Secret Service investigator informed Taherzadeh about the inquiry. 

There was no indication the tip-off was intended to protect the defendants, but it prompted the Justice Department to rush the next day for the court's approval for a warrant that preceded the arrests last Wednesday.
“Because this matter is pending adjudication by a federal court, it is not appropriate for the Secret Service to make any comments on prosecutorial statements,"" a Secret Service spokesperson said in an email to Reuters.

(Reuters) - A former researcher at a high-profile cryptocurrency group was sentenced to five years and three months in prison on Tuesday for conspiring to help North Korea evade U.S. sanctions using cryptocurrency, federal prosecutors in Manhattan said.
Virgil Griffith was arrested in 2019 and pleaded guilty last September to conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act by traveling to North Korea to present on blockchain technology. 
Griffith formerly worked for the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit that works to support the technology behind the cryptocurrency ether.
The sentence, imposed by U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel, was the minimum amount of prison time prosecutors had sought. Griffith had asked for a sentence of two years. Castel also fined Griffith $100,000, below the $1 million prosecutors suggested. 
Griffith's attorney Brian Klein said in a statement that while the sentence was disappointing, the judge ""acknowledged Virgil's commitment to moving forward with his life productively, and that he is a talented person who has a lot to contribute.""
U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement on Tuesday that ""justice has been served.""
Griffith, who has a doctorate from the California Institute of Technology, traveled to North Korea via China in April 2019 to deliver a presentation at the Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference, despite being denied permission by the U.S. Department of State to go, according to prosecutors.
Prosecutors said Griffith understood the information could be used to evade sanctions the U.S. had imposed on North Korea over its development of nuclear weapons technology.

""The most important feature of blockchains is that they are open. And the DPRK can't be kept out no matter what the USA or the UN says,"" Griffith said during the presentation, according to prosecutors, using the initials of North Korea's official name.
The Ethereum Foundation said at the time of Griffith's arrest that it had not approved or supported his travel to North Korea.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Mexican drug cartels appear to be shipping high-powered weapons to Colombia to purchase shipments of cocaine, a trade Colombian authorities say is fueling the deadly struggle between rival traffickers for control of the nation's drug routes.
A bevy of machine guns, assault rifles and semi-automatic handguns are flowing into the South American country, a dozen Colombian law enforcement officials told Reuters.
Among the weapons popping up in traffickers' arsenals is the Belgium-made FN Five-seveN pistol, sources said. Nicknamed the ""cop killer,"" the 5.7-caliber weapon can penetrate bullet-proof vests.
Most of the 1,478 long arms confiscated from Colombian armed groups in 2020 and 2021 were foreign-made and imported clandestinely, the police say, along the same smuggling routes used to get drugs out.
Mexican drug gangs have easy access to guns purchased in the United States and long-term business relationships with Colombian armed groups, from whom they have purchased cocaine for decades, Colombian authorities said.
Now cartel emissaries are increasingly paying for shipments of cocaine with guns, authorities say, in part to avoid the need to move large quantities of cash across borders.
The potent firepower of the cartel-supplied arsenal has potential implications for Colombia's security. Heavy arms in the hands of criminals put law enforcement at risk and could further complicate the troubled implementation of a 2016 peace deal between Bogota and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels.
Last year 148 members of the armed forces and the national police were killed in Colombia, the highest figure in six years and a 57% increase from 2020, according to figures from the Ministry of Defense.
""What illegal armed groups in Colombia are doing is using the Mexicans to equal and exceed the armed forces of the state in terms of weaponry,"" an official at the police's Anti-Terrorism and Arms Tracing Information Center (CIARA) said.
""In the future, that could have serious implications, like an increase in hostilities,"" according to the official, who said armed groups may use the weapons not only against law enforcement but in battles with each other.
The agency authorized the person to speak to Reuters on the condition they not be identified.
The Colombian police say they have a permanent dialogue with their U.S. and Mexican counterparts on keeping weapons out of drug traffickers' hands.
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) declined to comment, while the Mexican government did not respond to Reuters questions.
MEXICAN CONNECTION
Colombian authorities say the battle for control of their country's drug trade is waged between former FARC members who reject the peace accord; guerrillas from the still-active National Liberation Army (ELN); and members of a plethora of criminal syndicates, including the Clan del Golfo, Colombia's largest cartel.
Though FARC dissidents and the ELN espouse some of the same Marxist ideals, and they occasionally allied against the government during the height of the civil war, they now regularly fight each other and rival crime gangs to dominate lucrative drug routes, security officials said.
Law enforcement encounters with these groups are turning up powerful weapons.
In mid-December last year, Colombia's army conducted an operation against FARC dissidents in southwestern Narino province, a major coca-producing region. The military said it captured 16 people and seized a cache of weapons, including 24 U.S.-made M16 assault rifles and AR-15 semiautomatic rifles.
A similar haul was found in a different FARC dissident camp in the southern jungle province of Caqueta in 2019, according to the army: a M60 machine gun, an AR-15 rifle with an added scope for use by a sniper, and a dozen assault rifles, including M4s and M16s.
Authorities said they believe such guns are supplied by Mexico's Sinaloa, Zeta and Jalisco New Generation cartels, all of which have emissaries on Colombian soil.
Their representatives are present in 11 of Colombia's 32 provinces, according to a 2021 police intelligence report seen by Reuters.
The Sinaloa cartel, once headed by jailed kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, has the most extensive geographic reach and deepest relationships with Colombian armed groups, the report said.
Some 55 Mexicans have been accused or convicted of drug trafficking offenses in Colombia in the last three years, according to the national prisons agency.
Colombia's national police said last week they had captured Brian Donaciano Olguin, a Mexican national whom they allege served as the Sinaloa cartel's most important go-between with FARC dissidents, calling his arrest the most important yet of a cartel emissary. Reuters was unable to contact Olguin or determine if he has legal counsel.
Mexico's warring drug gangs have been bulking up on military-grade armaments at home, alarming officials in their own country.
Last year, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's government sued gunmakers, accusing them of facilitating weapons trafficking, which the gunmakers deny.
U.S. gunmakers support stronger enforcement of existing laws, including imprisoning people who steal and smuggle guns, Mark Oliva, director for public affairs at the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms industry trade group, said in an email.
Guns are a handy form of currency for gangsters.
Paying coke suppliers with weapons, rather than bulky cash, helps Mexican cartels launder profits and move money around more easily, said General Fernando Murillo, head of DIJIN, the investigative division of Colombia's national police.
""Every day (conducting) drug trafficking through cash payments gets more difficult. So now they are using different methods: a Mexican cartel might pay with sophisticated arms,"" Murillo said.
TRADING UP
Until the 1990s, Colombian guerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries largely used Russian-made AK-47s left over from wars in Central America, officials from the police and armed forces told Reuters.
As drug trafficking expanded and grew more lucrative, armed groups upgraded to newer AK-47s, U.S.-made M16s and AR-15s and Israeli-made Tavor assault rifles, police officials said. While some guns go for as little at $500 in Colombia, machine guns can fetch up to $5,000, they said.
The leaders of the Segunda Marquetalia, a group of FARC dissidents, have appeared repeatedly in YouTube videos armed with Tavor assault rifles likely supplied by Mexican cartels, according to the police's CIARA center.
The U.S. DEA estimates Colombian criminal groups earn some $10 billion from drug transactions per year.
The flow of weapons southward comes as Colombian provinces like Norte de Santander (MC:SAN), on the border with Venezuela, and Narino and Cauca, on the Pacific coast, have seen increases in coca production and associated violence by armed groups, despite U.S.-backed efforts by President Ivan Duque to slash narcotics production.
The Clan del Golfo alone moves some 20 tonnes of cocaine per month for clients including the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels, according to Colombian police, who say the Clan's gangster allies in Medellin have used the FN Five-seveN pistol in internal disputes.
It is possible some cartel-supplied guns enter Colombia through Venezuela, officials from the Colombian police and army say.
Dissident leaders like Ivan Marquez, who heads Segunda Marquetalia, meet in Venezuela with Sinaloa and Jalisco emissaries, General Jorge Luis Vargas, the head of the national police, told Reuters.

Bogota has long accused Venezuela's government of providing refuge for Colombian armed groups, including dissidents, allegations denied by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
The Venezuelan government did not respond to a request for comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -New York Lieutenant Governor Brian Benjamin, the state's No. 2 official after Governor Kathy Hochul, resigned on Tuesday after being charged with bribery and fraud for allegedly directing state funds toward a real estate developer in exchange for campaign contributions.
Hochul, who handpicked Benjamin for the lieutenant governor's job last August, announced the resignation a few hours after the 45-year-old Benjamin pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court to charges in a five-count indictment.
""While the legal process plays out, it is clear to both of us that he cannot continue to serve as lieutenant governor,"" Hochul said in a statement. ""New Yorkers deserve absolute confidence in their government, and I will continue working every day to deliver for them.""
Benjamin's resignation is effective immediately, Hochul said. Lawyers for Benjamin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Prosecutors said Benjamin in 2019 directed a $50,000 state grant to a non-profit controlled by the developer from the Harlem section of Manhattan, which Benjamin represented at the time as a state senator.
The developer then sent Benjamin's reelection campaign thousands of dollars through several checks in the names of relatives and a limited liability company, according to the indictment.
Prosecutors said the developer also raised money for Benjamin's unsuccessful 2021 run to become New York City's comptroller. 
""Taxpayer money for campaign contributions. Quid pro quo. This for that. That's corruption,"" said Damian Williams, the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan. ""Public corruption remains a problem in New York. It is a bipartisan problem. It is an ongoing problem.""
The Harlem real estate developer was not identified by name in the indictment.
Just over two months after Benjamin became lieutenant governor, real estate developer Gerald Migdol was criminally charged with steering illegal campaign contributions to an unnamed candidate for city comptroller. Migdol pleaded not guilty.
Benjamin faces charges including bribery, wire fraud and falsification of records. His case and Migdol's are in the same case file.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Ona Wang released Benjamin on $250,000 bond, and imposed travel restrictions that left him unable to travel to Albany, New York's state capital, without permission from authorities.
Benjamin is next due to appear in court on April 19. 
The charges could complicate Hochul's reelection bid in November.

Hochul, a Democrat who had been lieutenant governor, replaced Andrew Cuomo as governor last August, when he resigned following an inquiry that found that he had sexually harassed 11 women.
She faces challenges from New York City Comptroller Jumaane Williams and Long Island U.S. Congressman Tom Suozzi for Democratic gubernatorial nomination.

BUCHA, Ukraine (Reuters) - French forensic experts have arrived in Bucha near Kyiv to help Ukraine authorities establish what happened in the town where hundreds of bodies have been discovered since Russian forces withdrew.
Ukraine says the people were killed by Russian forces during their occupation of the area. Reuters has not been able to verify the number of people found dead in Bucha or the circumstances of their deaths. 
The discovery of so many slain civilians in Bucha after the Russian withdrawal has provoked a global outcry. Moscow has denied responsibility and dismissed allegations its troops committed war crimes as fake news.
As the group from the French Gendarmerie's forensic science department looked on, workers in hazmat suits dug earth from a shallow grave and lifted out a heavy mass wrapped in an orange blanket.
Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said, citing witnesses, that the burnt body parts inside were those of a woman and her two children.
Venediktova said over the next couple of weeks the French experts would help the Ukrainian authorities establish what happened to the people in Bucha.
""We have now a lot of jobs unfortunately with war crimes,"" Venediktova said at the churchyard site, where locals hastily buried people who died during the town's occupation.
""When you see dead bodies here, from the other side, from the Russian Federation, they say it is all fake, all this is our theatre,"" Venediktova said.
Venediktova said the international experts would be able to see the situation for themselves. ""They can see everything, they can see the situation here: real graves, real dead bodies, real bomb attacks. That's why for us this moment is very important.""
Moscow, which has repeatedly denied targeting civilians since its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, has called allegations that Russian forces executed civilians in Bucha while they occupied the town a ""monstrous forgery"" aimed at denigrating the Russian army.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that images and footage of dead bodies strewn across the Ukrainian town of Bucha were fake.
Speaking at a televised news conference Putin compared Ukrainian allegations that Russian servicemen executed civilians in Bucha to what he said was the staging by the West of a chemical weapons attack in Syria aimed at incriminating Bashar al-Assad.
""It's the same kind of fake in Bucha,"" Putin said. 
On Monday, the French authorities said the team, which includes experts on ballistics, explosives, and rapid DNA testing, would also be able to contribute what they find to an International Criminal Court investigation.
Local priest Andriy Halavin said their work would help prove to the world what happened to the people of Bucha, including those recently unearthed in his churchyard.
""They didn't just die from explosions, by chance, being in the wrong place at the wrong time, but they were deliberately shot,"" Halavin said. 

""Some were in cars, driving, and they were shot. Some were walking on the street and they were shot.""
""It's very important that the whole world sees the truth because Russian propaganda always tells stories and lies.""

LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukraine on Tuesday said it arrested the Kremlin's most prominent ally in the country as Russian President Vladimir Putin gave his strongest signal yet the war will grind on, warning peace talks were at a dead end.
In February, Ukraine said Viktor Medvedchuk, the leader of the Opposition Platform - For Life party, escaped from house arrest after the authorities opened a treason case against him. 
The pro-Russian figure, who says Putin is godfather to his daughter, has denied wrongdoing. On Tuesday a spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.
""Pro-Russian traitors and agents of the Russian intelligence services, remember - your crimes have no statute of limitations,"" Ukraine's security service posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) alongside a photo of Medvedchuk in handcuffs.
Operatives ""conducted this lightning-fast and dangerous multi-level special operation"", the head of the organisation Ivan Bakanov said.
A Kremlin spokesman was cited by the Tass news agency as saying he had seen the photo and could not say whether it was genuine. 
Hours earlier Putin used his first public comments on the conflict in more than a week to insist Russia will ""rhythmically and calmly"" continue its operation, citing the need to achieve goals on security.
""That Blitzkrieg on which our foes were counting did not work,"" he said, batting aside the impact of sanctions and warning that on-and-off peace talks were in a ""dead-end situation."" 
But he frequently seemed to ramble or stammer. Only occasionally did he adopt the icy, confident demeanour that has been his trademark in public appearances over more than 22 years as Russia's leader.
Putin, who had been ubiquitous on Russian television in the early days of the war, had largely retreated from public view since Russia's withdrawal from northern Ukraine two weeks ago.
On Monday he met the visiting chancellor of Austria. 
But the meeting was held at a country residence outside Moscow and no images were released, a contrast from talks with Western leaders on the eve of the war, when they were pictured seated at opposite ends of a huge table in the ornate Kremlin palace.
MARIUPOL DENOUEMENT
Moscow's nearly seven-week long incursion, the biggest attack on a European state since 1945, has seen more than 4.6 million people flee abroad, killed or injured thousands and led to Russia's near total isolation on the world stage.
Russia says it launched what it calls a ""special military operation"" on Feb. 24 to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Kyiv and its Western allies reject that as a false pretext.
Russian tanks pulled out of northern Ukraine after failing in what the West believes was a mission to swiftly capture the capital Kyiv. 
Many of the towns they left behind were littered with the bodies of civilians killed in what Kyiv says was a campaign of murder, torture and rape. 
Moscow denies targeting civilians or carrying out war crimes.
Russia says its campaign now aims to capture more territory on behalf of separatists in two eastern provinces, a region known as the Donbas. It includes Mariupol port, which has been reduced to a wasteland under Russian siege.
Ukraine says tens of thousands of civilians have been trapped inside that city with no way to bring in food or water, and accuses Russia of blocking aid convoys.
The battle for Mariupol appeared on Tuesday to be reaching a decisive phase, with Ukrainian marines holed up in the Azovstal industrial district. Reuters journalists accompanying Russian-backed separatists saw flames billowing from the Azovstal district.
Pavlo Kyrylenko, governor of the eastern Donetsk region, which includes Mariupol, said he had seen incident reports on possible chemical weapons use in the city but could not confirm them. 
""We know that last night around midnight a drone dropped some so-far unknown explosive device, and the people that were in and around the Mariupol metal plant, there were three people, they began to feel unwell,"" he told CNN.
They were taken to hospital and their lives were not in danger, he said.
Late on Tuesday, Ukraine said its forces in the east had beaten off six Russian attacks, destroying two vehicles and three artillery systems as well as shooting down a helicopter and two drones. Reuters could not immediately verify the report.
NEW ASSAULT
Zelenskiy had said on Monday that Russia may resort to chemical weapons as it massed troops for a new assault. He did not say if they actually had been used. The United States and Britain said they were trying to verify the reports.
Chemical weapons production, use and stockpiling is banned under the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention.
Russia's defence ministry has not responded to a Reuters request for comment. Russian-backed separatist forces in the east denied using chemical weapons in Mariupol, the Interfax news agency reported.
After their troops got bogged down in the face of Ukrainian resistance, the Russians abandoned their bid to capture the capital Kyiv. But they are redoubling efforts in the east, including Donetsk and the neighbouring Luhansk region, where Governor Serhiy Gaidai urged residents to evacuate.
""It's far more scary to remain and burn in your sleep from a Russian shell,"" he wrote on social media. ""Evacuate, with every day the situation is getting worse. Take your essential items and head to the pickup point.""

Zelenskiy pleaded overnight for more weapons from the West to help it end the siege of Mariupol and fend off the expected eastern offensive.
""Unfortunately we are not getting as much as we need to end this war faster ... in particular, to lift the blockade of Mariupol,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Children as young as 8 years old should be screened for anxiety and those ages 12 and over for depression, according to new recommendations by the government-backed U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).
The guidance for healthcare providers, still in draft form, applies to children and teens who are not showing signs or symptoms of these conditions. 
""To address the critical need for supporting the mental health of children and adolescents in primary care, the Task Force looked at the evidence on screening for anxiety, depression, and suicide risk,"" task force member Martha Kubik of George Mason University said in a statement. ""Fortunately, we found that screening older children for anxiety and depression is effective in identifying these conditions."" 
Follow-up care can reduce symptoms of depression and can improve, and potentially resolve, anxiety, the statement said.
While the problem of undiagnosed mental health issues in children predates the COVID-19 pandemic, doctors and psychologists have warned that the impact of the health crisis on some children may be traumatic.
Online schooling, lockdowns, social distancing requirements, mask wearing and other lifestyle changes could have significant impacts on children's mental health, experts have said.
The USPSTF did not find enough evidence to determine whether it would be beneficial to screen children for anxiety before age 8 or for depression before age 12, or whether to screen any children for suicide risk. 

""More research on these important conditions is critical,"" said task force member Lori Pbert of University of Massachusetts Medical School. ""In the meantime, healthcare professionals should use their clinical judgment based on individual patient circumstances when deciding whether or not to screen.""
The drafts are available for public comment until May 9.

Ukraine said earlier it was checking unverified information that Russia may have used chemical weapons while besieging the city of Mariupol.
""We're in direct conversation with partners to try to determine what actually has happened,"" Blinken told reporters, adding that it had been a focus of concern even before Russia moved its troops into Ukraine.
A senior U.S. defense official on Tuesday said much the same thing about Mariupol, adding that the United States had no information to support the movement of chemical agents by Russia in or near Ukraine. 
U.S. President Joe Biden last month said Russia's unsubstantiated accusations that Kyiv had biological and chemical weapons suggested Russian President Vladimir Putin may be laying the groundwork to use them.
Chemical weapons production, use and stockpiling is banned under the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. Although condemned by human rights groups, white phosphorous is not banned under the convention. 
Russia's defence ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Russian-backed separatist forces in the east denied using chemical weapons in Mariupol, the Interfax news agency reported.
""There is a theory that these could be phosphorous munitions,"" Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar said on Tuesday.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands and displaced millions.

The state's Republican-controlled House of Representatives voted 36-31 to impeach Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg for his conduct during and after the incident that claimed the life of Joseph Boever, 55, the Argus Leader newspaper reported.
Ravnsborg must temporarily step aside and the Senate must wait at least 20 days before conducting an impeachment trial. The 35-member Republican-led Senate would then hold another vote with 24 votes needed to remove him from office.
South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, also Republican, had demanded that Ravnsborg step down after the crash. 
In two letters to lawmakers ahead of Tuesday's proceedings, Ravnsborg apologized for the incident and said impeachment would set a ""dangerous precedent."" 
He said his office had multiple ongoing investigations looking into Noem's activities, claiming she had ""politically weaponized"" the incident. 
On Sept. 12, 2020, Ravnsborg was driving home from a fundraiser when he hit and killed Boever, who was walking along a highway in Highmore, South Dakota, about 50 miles east of Pierre. 
Ravnsborg told police he believed he had run into a deer rather than a person, until he returned to the scene the following day to find the body of the victim lying in a roadside ditch.

Toxicology tests released by state authorities showed no evidence of impairment.
In August, Ravnsborg pleaded no contest to two misdemeanor charges involving illegal lane change and using a phone while driving. Ravnsborg faced jail time for each charge, but the judge overseeing the case ordered him to pay $1,000 and perform public service for five years.

Official statistics show an increase in murders in the city in each of the past four years, but total numbers of murders were still far lower than three decades ago when crime in the United States crested thanks in part to the crack cocaine epidemic of that era. 
Here is a look at three categories of violent crime for selected years, based on New York City police statistics.
MURDER
The city recorded 488 murders in 2021, 468 in 2020, 319 in 2019 and 295 in 2018 after falling to a low of 292 in 2017 following a steady decline since the early 1990s. The number of murders in 2010 was 536, in 2000 was 673, and in 1990 was 2,262.
RAPE
The city recorded 1,491 rapes in 2021, an increase over 1,427 in 2020 but a decline from 1,755 in 2019 and 1,794 in 2018. It went as low as 1,205 in 2009. The number of rapes in 2010 was 1,373, in 2000 was 2,068, and in 1990 was 3,126.

ROBBERY
The city recorded 13,831 robberies in 2021, 13,106 in 2020, 13,371 in 2019 after going as low as 12,913 in 2018. The number of robberies in 2010 was 19,486, in 2000 was 32,562, and in 1990 was 100,280.

The self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, a Russian-backed separatist region, announced the evacuation of its residents to southeast Russia due to increased shelling days before Moscow sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a ""special military operation"".
As residents rushed to flee, many pets were left to their own devices.
Yulia from Donetsk, has already made nine trips to the Russian border, carrying up to 18 pets each time. There she hands abandoned cats and dogs over to Russian volunteers who then drive them to Moscow some 900 kilometres (560 miles) to the north. 
Volunteers headed by Irina Marchenko, a pet store owner in Moscow, have come together from both sides of the border to bring the abandoned cats and dogs of Donetsk to new homes in Russia.
Yulia said she felt compelled to help, even if that meant driving for hours through checkpoints with misbehaving cats and squealing puppies as passengers in her dark green Lada.
""Volunteers are caring for so many pets right now,"" said Yulia as she stroked a tabby cat. ""In Donetsk we don't know where we can find them homes because tons of people are leaving.""
Russia has recognised the breakaway territories in Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states, though the rest of the world considers them part of Ukraine. Russian-backed separatists in those two regions have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014.
Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance to Russia's military intervention and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces
Marchenko, the mastermind of the rescue operation, first connected with Donetsk residents over social media, offering them to temporarily house their cats and dogs or find them new homes in the Russian capital. 

""When I woke up on Feb. 24, I understood that a lot of animals would end up on the street, that people would not be able to bring them along,"" the 36-year-old Muscovite said. 
""We wanted to first of all save the animals that were abandoned, those that have never been on the streets and wouldn't survive there.""

SEOUL (Reuters) -The USS Abraham Lincoln strike group is operating in waters off the Korean peninsula, the U.S. Navy said on Tuesday, amid tensions over North Korea's missile launches and concerns that it could soon resume testing nuclear weapons.
""The Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group is conducting bilateral operations with the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force in the Sea of Japan,"" Commander Hayley Sims, a spokesperson for the Japan-based U.S. Seventh Fleet, said in a statement.
This is the first time since 2017 that a carrier group has deployed to the waters between South Korea and Japan, and comes as U.S. officials are increasingly concerned that North Korea could carry out an underground nuclear test in the coming days.
Sims said the carrier was conducting ""routine bilateral operations"" to reassure our allies and partners of the U.S. commitment to maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific. 
""Our training enhances the credibility of conventional deterrence by demonstrating the strength of our bilateral partnerships,"" she added.
On March 15 the USS Abraham Lincoln led military exercises in the Yellow Sea, launching its F-35 stealth fighters and other jets in what the U.S. military said was a demonstration in response to the increased pace and scale of North Korea's ballistic missile launches.
Last month North Korea conducted a full test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) for the first time since 2017.
During the last major flurry of ICBM and nuclear tests in 2017 the USS Ronald Reagan, Theodore Roosevelt and Nimitz, and their multi-ship strike groups, deployed to the Sea of Japan, also known in Korea as the East Sea, in a show of force.
Advisers to South Korea's president-elect sought redeployment of U.S. strategic assets, such as aircraft carriers, nuclear bombers and submarines, to the Korean peninsula during talks held on a visit to Washington last week.

South Korea's defence ministry said it was aware that the carrier group was in international waters but declined to comment further. 
North Korea has previously criticised U.S. military drills as a rehearsal for war, and said they increase tensions.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has expressed concern that Russia could deploy chemical weapons in the war and there has been an unconfirmed report of their use in the besieged southern port of Mariupol.
Chemical weapons production, use and stockpiling is banned under the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Only Egypt, North Korea and South Sudan have not signed or ratified the international arms control treaty. Israel has signed but not ratified.
The convention is overseen by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague, which can determine whether toxic chemicals were used as weapons and, since mid-2018, identify perpetrators in Syria.
Under the treaty, the use of the most dangerous ""scheduled"" toxins and their precursors is banned. This includes nerve agents sarin, VX and the Soviet-era developed Novichok, as well as the poison ricin and blistering agent sulphur mustard. 
A chemical weapon is ""any chemical which through its chemical action on life processes can cause death, temporary incapacitation or permanent harm"" through its toxic properties, the OPCW says. A non-controlled chemical, such as chlorine, could also become a chemical weapon if used in a conflict.
Although condemned by human rights groups, white phosphorous is not banned by the CWC. Neither are cluster munitions, which fall under a separate international treaty.
PAST USE
Sulphur mustard was first deployed on a large scale in Ypres, Belgium, during World War One, when around 90,000 people died due to exposure to chemical weapons. 
Thousands of Kurdish people were killed, many of them women and children, in a large-scale chemical attack on Halabja in March 1988 during the Iran-Iraq war.
In 1995, a doomsday cult in Japan released sarin in the Tokyo subway, killing 13 people and making thousands ill.
After decades of little use, sarin and chlorine barrel bombs were used systematically in the battlefield during Syria's civil war, killing or injuring thousands. Roughly 150 cases are under investigation by the OPCW and 20 uses have been confirmed.
Syrian forces backed by Russia, and to a lesser extent Islamic State fighters, were found to have used chemical weapons during the decade-long war.
Russia and Syria deny using chemical weapons and instead blame rebel groups and political opponents, or say attacks were staged to falsely implicate them.
The largest single attack in Syria was in August 2013, in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta, when hundreds were killed in a sarin gas strike widely blamed by Western governments on Syrian government forces.
Russia has been blamed by states at the OPCW for two attacks with nerve agent Novichok, one against former Russian military intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Britain in March 2018 and another on a critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Alexei Navalny, in Siberia in August 2020.
In April 2021, Syria was stripped of its voting rights by member OPCW states after its forces were found to have repeatedly used poison gas during the civil war. Damascus has failed to declare several banned substances found by inspectors.
UKRAINE 
Kyiv said on Tuesday that it was checking reports that Russian forces had used chemical weapons in the besieged port city of Mariupol.
Ukraine had previously expressed fears that Russian forces could use prohibited chemicals, as has the United States. Neither has provided evidence to substantiate those concerns. 
Russian has formally destroyed tons of chemical weapons declared to the OPCW. But Moscow has repeatedly clashed with Western governments which blame it for the Skripal and Navalny chemical weapons incidents. 
In October, 45 OPCW members called on Russia to clarify its alleged involvement in Navalny's poisoning, in which Moscow also denies a role.
Novichok, developed in the 1970s in the Soviet Union, was added to the OPCW's list of scheduled chemicals and had been banned since July 2020.
Both Russia and Ukraine are member of the OPCW, where states split along political lines over the Syrian war. Moscow has sought to limit the power of the organisation to identify perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks, both in The Hague and at the United Nations.

The United States has donated $250,000 to the OPCW as part of efforts to provide Ukraine with supplies and equipment in case Russia were to deploy chemical weapons.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Some Shanghai residents were able to leave their homes for the first time in more than two weeks on Tuesday as the city took tentative steps towards easing a COVID-19 lockdown amid mounting worries over the economic impact of the strict curbs.
With a quarter of the population under what brokerage Nomura described as ""full or partial lockdowns,"" China's leadership is taking increasing steps to ease the economic toll of its ""zero-COVID"" strategy, but remains reluctant to risk larger waves of infection.
German auto parts giant Bosch and Taiwan's Pegatron Corp, which assembles iPhones for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), said on Tuesday they had suspended operations at their China plants due to the restrictions, underscoring the risks both to China's economy and global supply chains. 
Shanghai said on Monday that more than 7,000 areas - which local media reported as home to about 4.8 million of its 25 million residents - had been classified as lower-risk after no new infections for 14 days. Local officials have been announcing which residential compounds can open up.
But while some people were allowed out on Tuesday, there was still confusion about how freely they could move, with many awaiting permission from their residential committees.
One resident said she briefly left home for a scooter ride after getting permission from her compound, only to be told later that she could no longer do so.
“You know how it all changes very fast ... if you can go out you better do so quickly because you won’t know if it could change in the next hour,"" she said, declining to be named. 
Officials say daily infection rates were likely to remain high in the next few days, with Shanghai still struggling to get to grips with the outbreak - China's biggest since the coronavirus was discovered in late 2019 in the central city of Wuhan.
""The epidemic is in a rapid increase phase, with social transmission still not brought under effective control,"" Lei Zhenglong, of the National Health Commission, told a briefing in Beijing.
""The forecast for the next few days is that the number of infected people will remain at a high level,"" he said. 
Amid concerns about the tough curbs, the U.S. State Department ordered non-emergency government workers to leave its consulate in Shanghai.
FACTORIES HALTED
Bosch suspended output at sites in Shanghai and the city of Changchun in COVID-hit Jilin province, while putting two other plants - one in Shanghai and another in neighbouring Taicang - under ""closed-loop"" operation, with workers isolated inside.
Pegatron said it halted operations at its plants in Shanghai and neighbouring Kunshan, citing government measures to control the spread of infection.
Nomura estimates that as many as 45 cities in China are now implementing either full or partial lockdowns, making up 26.4% of the country's population and 40.3% of its GDP. 
The outbreaks have added to inflationary pressures as residents hoard goods and transport restrictions erode supplies, but that has been partly offset by weaker demand as incomes decline, Chinese brokerage Cinda Securities said, adding that relief measures were needed urgently. 
Premier Li Keqiang warned on Monday that China needed to be ""highly vigilant"" against further downward economic pressures and said the fight against COVID-19 needed to be ""coordinated"" with economic and social development. 
China is also encouraging long-term investors to buy more equities and major shareholders of listed firms to increase their holdings when stocks slump, in a bid to stabilise a stock market rocked by the worsening outbreak, the country's securities watchdog said late on Monday.
Liu Min, vice head of Shanghai's commercial commission, said efforts were being made to reopen supermarkets, convenience stores and pharmacies, but non-essential businesses will remain suspended.

Many in the city still struggled to buy food. E-commerce giant JD (NASDAQ:JD).com, which received a license on Saturday to supply the city, came in for online criticism on Tuesday when shoppers found that delivery dates had been pushed back more than a week.
On Monday, Shanghai's total new asymptomatic cases fell 11% from a day earlier to 22,348, with confirmed symptomatic cases rising to 994 from 914..

British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said on Monday Britain was working with its partners to verify the details of reports that Russian forces may have used chemical agents in an attack on the southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, where thousands are believed to have died during a near-seven week siege.
""There are some things that are beyond the pale, and the use of chemical weapons will get a response and all options are on the table for what that response could be,"" Heappey told Sky News, adding that British defence intelligence so far had been unable to verify the reports. 
Asked on LBC Radio whether he could rule out this including deploying British or NATO troops on Ukrainian soil, Heappey said: ""No, all options are on the table.""
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday that Russia could resort to chemical weapons in his country and called on the West to impose stronger sanctions on Moscow that would deter even talk of using such weapons. 

""If chemical weapons have been used, that is a very important moment for our prime minister and other heads of government around the world to consider how we would respond to that,"" Heappey told BBC TV. 
""(Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin should be clear that the use of chemical weapons is simply not acceptable and he shouldn't expect the West to stand by if they were used.""

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Rosanne White was first diagnosed with cancer eight years ago and lost a kidney. After the cancer returned five years ago, an oncologist in Sri Lanka's commercial capital Colombo started her on Bevacizumab last May, a treatment she was responding to.
White, a 58-year-old Sri Lankan retiree, said she had received the injections free of charge as part of the country's universal government health system, which the vast majority of its 22 million people depend on.
But after 13 rounds of treatment, White said she now cannot find the injection in government hospitals.
Bevacizumab costs 113,000 Sri Lankan rupees ($359) per shot in the private market and, because she does not have insurance, White said the costs were eating into her limited savings.
""We have to call the hospital before going in for treatment to find out if our medication is available,"" White told Reuters. ""But what do you do when the nurses say the hospital doesn't have the medication?""
White's struggle to find Bevacizumab in state-run facilities is an early sign of how Sri Lanka's healthcare system is close to collapse, under the weight of the island nation's worst economic crisis. As well as shortages of vital drugs, some procedures and tests have been suspended.
The lack of foreign exchange has left President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's government unable to import essentials including medicines and fuel, causing crippling power cuts and bringing thousands of protesters on to the streets demanding his ouster.
Reuters spoke to two government officials, six doctors and a healthcare union leader who said they had not seen Sri Lanka's health system in such a bad way before.
An internal memo from a major state-run hospital in Colombo seen by Reuters said that only emergency, casualty and malignancy surgeries would be conducted from April 7 onwards because of a lack of surgical supplies.
Sri Lanka's health ministry did not respond to detailed questions from Reuters about the problems facing the sector.
The economy, which relies heavily on tourism, has been devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic and hit by the sharp rise in oil prices in the wake of the war in Ukraine, which has made importing enough fuel unaffordable.
Some analysts have also criticised Rajapaksa's administration for its decision in 2019 to make deep tax cuts and delay talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Those negotiations are now going ahead.
A close aide to the Rajapaksas has said previously that the tax cuts had been designed to boost the economy, but that COVID-19 then struck.
Sri Lanka now has just $1.93 billion in foreign exchange reserves, the equivalent of less than a month's imports, while government debt repayments of twice that amount are due in 2022.
The Sri Lanka Medical Association, the country's oldest professional medical body, wrote to Rajapaksa last week warning him that even emergency treatments may have to be stopped in the coming days.
""This will result in a catastrophic number of deaths,"" the association said.
'CRUCIAL FIVE MINUTES'
In late March, a 70-year-old woman was wheeled into a government-backed tertiary care hospital in a Colombo suburb. The patient was in septic shock, leading to dangerously low blood pressure.
The doctor dealing with the emergency said the patient ideally needed to be injected with albumin.
""In this case, it wasn't available,"" said the doctor, who declined to be identified because hospital medical staff are not authorised to speak to the media. ""Which means I lost a crucial five minutes.""
The patient died, the doctor said.
Out of 1,325 drugs that the government provides to state-run hospitals, three life-saving medicines have completely run out and another 140 essential ones are in short supply, the secretary to Sri Lanka's pharmaceuticals ministry said.
""This will not end in two months,"" Saman Rathnayake told Reuters. ""The dollar crisis will go on.""
But he added that new sources of supply could help alleviate immediate shortages.
Some medicines ordered through a credit line with neighbouring India, which supplies 80% of the island's requirement, would likely arrive within two weeks.
""If this Indian credit line works, there won't be an issue for the next six months,"" Rathnayake said.
Beyond that, Sri Lanka has sought help from the World Health Organization, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. ""Their things will come after six months,"" he said. ""That is how we've planned.""
Desperate for supplies, some doctors' groups have made public appeals for donations.
Running out of endotracheal (ET) tubes used to help newborn infants with respiratory distress, the Perinatal Society of Sri Lanka issued a list of supplies that can be donated via the health ministry.
""We have almost used all the stocks and no ET tubes will be available in few weeks,"" the society's president Saman Kumara said in a letter shared on social media.
""I have instructed (staff) not to discard used ET tubes but to clean and sterilize them from now onwards as we may have to reuse them.""
A list of out-of-stock supplies from the major state-run hospital in southern Colombo seen by Reuters featured more than 40 items, including urethral catheters, different types of tubes, umbilical cord clamps and glucose test strips used for checking blood sugar levels.
'WE ARE FIGHTING'
A crowd of patients waited on plastic chairs and wooden benches inside a large, brightly lit hall at a major government hospital in northern Colombo late last week.
The hospital, which records around 50,000 patient visits every month with a staff of just over 2,500, is one of the country's major urban health facilities that serves multiple districts, an official said.
""We are still fighting,"" the official said, asking that he and the hospital not be named. ""But I don't know how long we can maintain services.""
Last August, as early signs of a brewing crisis became clear, the official said the hospital stopped infrastructure improvements and major renovations, diverting the money to shore up medical supplies.
In recent weeks, after Sri Lanka devalued its currency amid soaring inflation, the official said the cost of medical supplies had increased by 30-40% and put further pressure on the finances of the hospital, already some 350 million rupees ($1.11 million) in debt.
Overall, the government owed around 4 billion rupees ($12.70 million) to suppliers of items such as gloves and reagents used for medical testing, said Rathnayake from the pharmaceutical ministry.
Ravi Kumudesh, president of the Medical Laboratory (NYSE:LH) Technologists Association, said testing had dropped by 30%, with some high-end tests completely stopped. Maintenance of equipment like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machines has also been delayed. 
""There is a gap between the treatment a patient should be getting and what they are getting,"" Kumudesh told Reuters. 
""No one is being held accountable. Even though we are not calculating the numbers, people are dying,"" he said.
In an interview with Reuters on Saturday, Sri Lanka's new Finance Minister Ali Sabry said his first priority was to stabilise the supply of essentials such as medicines.
But for patients like White, coping with the crisis is becoming increasingly difficult. Slow-release morphine tablets to manage pain are often not available, she said.
""The other day my son went to get it and came back empty-handed,"" White said. 

""I feel very helpless ... I cannot even go to a protest.""

(Reuters) - A local prosecutor in Texas will dismiss criminal charges against a 26-year-old woman who was arrested for a self-induced abortion in a case that had drawn national scrutiny and led abortion rights activists to demonstrate on her behalf.
Following a grand jury indictment of her on March 30, Lizelle Herrera was arrested on Thursday by the Starr County Sheriff's Office, according to Valley Central.com, which cited a spokesperson who said she ""intentionally and knowingly caused the death of an individual by self-induced abortion.""
Starr County District Attorney Gocha Allen Ramirez said on Sunday his office would file a motion to dismiss charges against her on Monday.
""In reviewing applicable Texas law, it is clear that Ms. Herrera cannot and should not be prosecuted for the allegation against her,"" Ramirez said in a statement.
Neither the district attorney nor the sheriff's department responded to queries about when she would be released.
Starr County is on the Mexican border in the Rio Grande Valley region in the southern tip of Texas.
Ramirez said sheriff's deputies were right to arrest her as ""to ignore the incident would have been a dereliction of their duty."" But he also said district attorneys have prosecutorial discretion and that his oath is ""to do justice.""
""Following that oath, the only correct outcome to this matter is to immediately dismiss the indictment against Ms. Herrera,"" the prosecutor said.
The case also reignited controversy over Texas's strict abortion law that was largely upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in December. Known as Senate Bill 8, the law bans abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant, and does not exempt women who are impregnated by rape.
The Starr County prosecutor did not comment on what specific legal standard he applied and instead pointed to how the indictment has ""taken a toll"" on Herrera and her family.
""The issues surrounding this matter are clearly contentious, however based on Texas law and the facts presented, it is not a criminal matter,"" Ramirez said. 

A small group of protesters had gathered outside the sheriff's office on Saturday, led by La Frontera Fund, an abortion assistance group.
""She miscarried at a hospital and allegedly confided to hospital staff that she had attempted to induce her own abortion and she was reported to the authorities by hospital administration or staff,"" Rickie Gonzalez, the group's founder, said on Saturday.

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine on Monday said tens of thousands of people have likely been killed in Russia's assault on the southeastern city of Mariupol while the country's rights ombudswoman accused Russian forces in the region of torture and executions.
Reuters has confirmed widespread destruction in Mariupol but could not verify the alleged crimes or the estimate of those killed in the strategic city, which lies between Russian-annexed Crimea and eastern areas of Ukraine held by Russian-backed separatists.
""Mariupol has been destroyed, there are tens of thousands of dead, but even despite this, the Russians are not stopping their offensive,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video address to South Korean lawmakers without providing more details.
If confirmed, it would be by far the largest number of dead so far reported in one place in Ukraine, where cities, towns and villages have come under relentless bombardment and bodies, including civilians, have been seen in the streets.
The head of the Russia-backed self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, told Russia's RIA news agency on Monday that more than 5,000 people may have been killed in Mariupol. He said Ukrainian forces were responsible.
The numbers of people leaving the city had fallen because Russian forces had slowed pre-departure checks, Petro Andryushchenko, an aide to the mayor of Mariupol, said on Monday on the Telegram messaging service.
Around 10,000 people were awaiting screening by Russian forces, he said. Russia does not allow military personnel to leave with civilian evacuees. There was no immediate comment from Moscow, which has previously blamed Ukraine for blocking evacuations.
Citing figures from Mariupol's city administration, Ukraine's human rights ombudswoman Lyudmyla Denisova said 33,000 residents of Mariupol had been deported to Russia or territories held by Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia said on Sunday it had ""evacuated"" 723,000 people from Ukraine since the start of what it called its ""special operation."" Moscow denies attacking civilians.
""Witnesses report that Russian national guard troops and 'Kadyrovite' (Chechen) units are making illegal arrests, torturing detainees and executing them for any pro-Ukrainian stance,"" in Mariupol, Denisova said in a post on Telegram.
The Russian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the torture allegations.
Ukrainian Interior Ministry Adviser Anton Geraschenko said in a televised interview on Monday that Ukrainian ""deportees"" were kept in guarded sanatoria and holiday camps.
""These people are not allowed to move around freely, or to have free access to communication platforms in order to contact their relatives in Ukraine,"" he said, without citing direct evidence.
Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk told Reuters that the number of checkpoints along the Russian-controlled corridor between Mariupol to the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia had grown from three to 15. 
Mariupol was among nine humanitarian corridors agreed with Russia on Monday to evacuate people from besieged eastern regions, but its corridor was for private cars only, Vereshchuk said on Telegram.

It was not possible to agree the provision of buses, she said.
Ukraine says Russian forces are massing for a new offensive on eastern areas, including Mariupol, where people have been without water, food and energy supplies for weeks.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) -More than 100 lawmakers loyal to Pakistan's ousted prime minister Imran Khan resigned on Monday, creating a headache for the new, Western-friendly incumbent Shehbaz Sharif as he tries to drag his country out of political and economic crisis. 
Parliament's election of Sharif, 70, as prime minister on Monday followed a week-long constitutional crisis that reached a climax on Sunday when Khan, 69, lost a no-confidence vote in parliament.
His departure from power sparked street protests and a mass resignation of MPs from Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party in protest at the impending change of government.
If the resignations are accepted by the speaker, Pakistan faces a prospect of more than 100 by-elections within two months, a major distraction for Sharif and his coalition partners and a potential platform for Khan to mobilise his support.
That in turn could ensure the nuclear-armed nation of 220 million people remains prone to political and economic turbulence.
Sharif has a reputation domestically as an effective administrator more than as a politician. He is the younger brother of three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif. [L2N2W70HM]
Analysts say Shehbaz, unlike Nawaz, enjoys amicable relations with Pakistan's military, which traditionally controls foreign and defence policy.
After Monday's vote, Sharif vowed to tackle an economic malaise that has seen the rupee hit an all-time low and the central bank implement the biggest hike in interest rates in decades last week.
""If we have to save the sinking boat, what we all need is hard work, and unity, unity and unity,"" he told parliament. 
""We are beginning a new era of development today."" 
He took the oath of office at Pakistan's presidential residence late on Monday at a ceremony packed with lawmakers and leaders from the combined opposition.
RESET TIES
The younger Sharif emerged as the leader of a united opposition to topple Khan, a former cricket star who has claimed that the United States was behind his downfall, an assertion that Washington denies.
Sharif said in an interview last week good relations with the United States were critical for Pakistan for better or for worse, in stark contrast to Khan's prickly ties to Washington.
In his maiden speech, he also spoke of improving relations with neighbours India and China.
""We want good relations with India but a durable peace can't be possible without Kashmir's solution,"" he said, referring to the contested Himalayan territory the countries have fought several wars over.
He said his government will speed up construction of the $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) - a part of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative.
MILITARY FALLOUT
No elected prime minister has completed a full term in Pakistan since it won independence from colonial power Great Britain in 1947, though Khan is the first to be removed by a no-confidence vote.
The military has ruled the country for almost half its nearly 75-year history. It viewed Khan and his conservative agenda favourably when he won election in 2018.
That support waned after a falling-out over the appointment of a military intelligence chief and economic troubles.
Khan remained defiant following his defeat in parliament.
Thousands of his supporters in several cities held protests against his ousting that went on until Monday's early hours. 

Nawaz Sharif was barred by the Supreme Court in 2017 from holding public office and subsequently went abroad for medical treatment after serving just a few months of a 10-year jail sentence for corruption charges.
""There can't be any bigger insult to this country,"" Khan, ousted in the early hours of Sunday, told reporters on Monday on the prospect of Shehbaz Sharif being elected.

SUNLAND PARK, N.M., (Reuters) - Seventeen-year-old Santi sits in his car outside shops in Sunland Park, New Mexico, watching a pulsing blue dot on his mobile telephone. 
Human smugglers have hired him to pick up migrants here, less than a mile from the Mexican border, and take them to nearby El Paso, Texas.
His shiny red mobile phone pings every 15 seconds. He and the migrants share locations, as a contact on the U.S. side messages instructions.
The high schooler with a high-fade haircut is among a growing number of U.S. teenagers in communities from Texas to California recruited to transport migrants crossing the Southwest border, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
Around one in four drivers caught smuggling migrants last year in the Sunland Park-Santa Teresa area were children, most U.S. citizens living locally, according to U.S. Border Patrol, which began recording the juvenile driver data in fiscal year 2021. 
Mexican youth have long guided migrants into the United States. Recruiters tell both Mexican and U.S. teens they are unlikely to face legal consequences because they are minors, according to around two dozen government and law enforcement officials, attorneys, migrant advocates and local residents Reuters spoke to. 
U.S. children as young as 14 learn of the work from social media and friends and transport mainly Mexican adults.
The young drivers can earn hundreds of dollars per migrant, and locals jokingly call them ""Ubers."" Some see it as a way to get ahead in Sunland Park, a working-class town with three times the national poverty rate where a third of residents are under 18 and many children live with grandparents.
But the job can be dangerous and federal authorities in New Mexico appear keen to crack down on the juvenile drivers.
Teen drivers tend to flee at high speed when officers try to stop them, according to Border Patrol officials. That can lead to pursuits by Border Patrol and crashes.
GOOD DAY FOR PICKUPS
Santi is parked about 900 feet west of a white and green U.S. Border Patrol pickup. The migrants are hiding in the desert around 1,000 feet south. 
Smuggling groups in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, took advantage of a cloudy night to push migrants across rocky Mount Cristo Rey where there is no border barrier. 
U.S. agents in helicopters struggle to see migrants through clouds, and strong winds may be stopping their drones from flying, according to Santi. 
""It's a good day for pickups,"" said the teen, who asked to be identified only as Santi and that his vehicle details not be disclosed because ferrying migrants is illegal. 
Field agents check migrants' phones for information and pass it to anti-smuggling units looking for drivers, group leaders and local ""stash houses"" where migrants wait before travel.
Gerardo Galvan, the patrol agent in charge of the Sunland Park area, noticed the rise in juvenile drivers in 2021 after a 14-year-old fled agents and crashed into a Border Patrol van. 
""They're told that if they go fast enough we're going to stop pursuing them,"" Galvan said.
Galvan said he was working with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Las Cruces, New Mexico, to charge juvenile drivers.
The office of the federal defender in Las Cruces represented four minors for migrant smuggling in the first few months of 2022 after six cases in all of 2021, according to Assistant Federal Public Defender Amanda Skinner. 
Unless the child has been in trouble before, the majority of juvenile cases result in probation until the age of 21, she said.
""We don't typically see higher-ups charged. The vast majority of our cases are drivers,"" said Skinner.
CRIMINALIZED YOUTH
Sunland Park Mayor Javier Perea sees no easy fix to the juvenile driver problem. Meanwhile, the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden expects another record-breaking year for migrant arrests on the southwest border. A COVID-era policy that blocked most asylum claims is set to lift in May.
""The last thing we want to do is criminalize our youth,"" said Perea, whose town provides work opportunities for teenagers and is planning an outreach program to deter drivers.
For activists like Irma Cruz, teen drivers are caught between the multi-billion-dollar human smuggling business and the U.S. government's policy to ""militarize"" the border as a deterrence.
""They're easy prey, and they're being used,"" said Cruz, campaign director for Border Network for Human Rights, an immigration advocacy group that also educates border residents on civil rights.
Of greatest concern are incidents such as when an El Paso 18-year-old crashed his sedan crammed with 10 people after being chased by Border Patrol in 2020. Four local teens and three migrants were killed.
The American Civil Liberties Union and U.S. lawmakers are calling on Border Patrol to only chase suspects at high speed if they believe a violent felony has been committed.
""If Border Patrol itself knows that such a high percentage of the drivers of these vehicles in particular areas are children being recruited in this way, then that should hedge against them conducting these types of dangerous vehicle pursuits,"" said ACLU lawyer Shaw Drake.
Galvan said agents attempting to stop a vehicle did not know whether the driver was a child or adult. He said agents are not to engage in pursuits around schools and in residential areas at busy times of day, and must receive permission from a supervisor to continue a chase.
Santi has transported migrants for a year and has been stopped by Border Patrol but never charged. He knows the stakes will be higher once he is 18.

When the parked Border Patrol truck drives off down McNutt Road, Santi heads toward a migrant rendezvous.
""I don't want to go to jail for this,"" he says.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States was monitoring what he described as a rise in human rights abuses in India by some officials, in a rare direct rebuke by Washington of the Asian nation's rights record.
""We regularly engage with our Indian partners on these shared values (of human rights) and to that end, we are monitoring some recent concerning developments in India including a rise in human rights abuses by some government, police and prison officials,"" Blinken said on Monday in a joint press briefing with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and India's Defense Minister Rajnath Singh.
Blinken did not elaborate. Singh and Jaishankar, who spoke after Blinken at the briefing, did not comment on the human rights issue.
Blinken's remarks came days after U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar questioned the alleged reluctance of the U.S. government to criticize Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government on human rights.
""What does Modi need to do to India’s Muslim population before we will stop considering them a partner in peace?"" Omar, who belongs to President Joe Biden's Democratic Party, said last week.
Modi's critics say his Hindu nationalist ruling party has fostered religious polarization since coming to power in 2014.
Since Modi came to power, right-wing Hindu groups have launched attacks on minorities claiming they are trying to prevent religious conversions. Several Indian states have passed or are considering anti-conversion laws that challenge the constitutionally protected right to freedom of belief.
In 2019, the government passed a citizenship law that critics said undermined India's secular constitution by excluding Muslim migrants from neighbouring countries. The law was meant to grant Indian nationality to Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, Jains, Parsis and Sikhs who fled Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan before 2015.

In the same year, soon after his 2019 re-election win, Modi's government revoked the special status of Kashmir in a bid to fully integrate the Muslim-majority region with the rest of the country. To keep a lid on protests, the administration detained many Kashmir political leaders and sent many more paramilitary police and soldiers to the Himalayan region also claimed by Pakistan.
Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) recently banned wearing the hijab in classrooms in Karnataka state. Hardline Hindu groups later demanded such restrictions in more Indian states.

By Maria Starkova
LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukraine said on Monday it expects Russia to begin an offensive soon in the eastern Donbas region as Moscow shifts its focus to seizing territory there after its invasion force was driven from the gates of Kyiv this month. 
Russia's main target in Donbas is the port of Mariupol, where thousands are believed to have died under a near-seven week siege. Russia is amassing thousands of troops in the area for a new assault, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said.
The first European Union leader to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in person since the war began, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer, said following talks in Moscow that the offensive was ""evidently being prepared on a massive scale"".
Western sanctions on Moscow will intensify so long as the invasion persists, Nehammer said. ""(Telling Putin) once will not be enough. Ten times will not be enough. It might have to be done 100 times,"" he told reporters.
After withdrawing forces from northern Ukraine, including suburbs of the capital Kyiv lain to waste under its occupation, Russia has turned its sights toward Donbas. It is demanding Ukraine cede control of territory there to separatist fighters, apparently one of Russia's major goals in what it calls a ""special military operation"" against its neighbour.
Capturing Mariupol, the main eastern port, would allow Moscow to link troops advancing from the east with those from Russian-annexed Crimea in the south and shift their focus to a new attempt to encircle the main Ukrainian force in the east.
The United States, which warns Moscow is trying to reinforce and resupply troops in Donbas, has sought to pressure Putin to withdraw his forces by banning Russian oil and gas and encouraging allies to follow suit. 
But world powers including China and India have refrained from sanctioning Russia. Lured by steep oil discounts, India has purchased more Russian crude since the start of the Feb. 24 invasion than it did for the whole of last year, data compiled by Reuters shows.
In a video call, U.S. President Joe Biden told India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi ""very clearly that it is not in their interest"" to increase reliance on Russian energy, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said.
During a brief portion of the call open to reporters, Modi said he had suggested in recent talks with Russia that Putin and Zelenskiy hold direct negotiations. 
MARIUPOL FIGHTING, RAPE AS WEAPON
Thousands have fled from the Donbas region.
In his latest plea for international support, Zelenskiy told South Korea's parliament that tens of thousands had already been killed in Mariupol, a figure that has not been confirmed independently. 
Russia has repeatedly denied attacking civilians.
There were unconfirmed media reports on Monday suggesting chemical weapons were used in Mariupol. Zelenskiy warned in his nightly video address on Monday of potential Russian use of chemical weapons, but did not say that they had been used.
The number of people leaving Mariupol has fallen because Russian forces slowed pre-departure checks, said Petro Andryushchenko, an aide to the mayor of the city.
Around 10,000 people were awaiting screening by Russian forces, he said. Russia does not allow military personnel to leave with civilian evacuees. There was no comment from Moscow, which has previously blamed Ukraine for blocking evacuations.
Ukrainian fears intensified last week after 57 people were killed in a Russian missile strike on a train station in Donbas, where thousands were trying to flee the expected advance, Ukrainian officials said.
Moscow denied blame for the missile strike as well as Ukrainian and Western accusations that Russian forces committed war crimes north of Kyiv.
The United Nations is hearing accounts of rape and violence by both Russian and Ukrainian forces, U.N. officials said. 
Kateryna Cherepakha, president of La Strada-Ukraine, said the rights group's emergency hotlines had received calls accusing Russian soldiers of nine cases of rape, involving 12 women and girls.
""This is just the tip of the iceberg,"" she told the U.N. Security Council via video. ""We know and see - and we want you to hear our voices - that violence and rape is used now as a weapon of war by Russian invaders in Ukraine.""
Russia's deputy U.N. ambassador denied the allegations and accused Ukraine and allies of ""a clear intention to present Russian soldiers as sadists and rapists."" 
Ukraine's U.N. mission did not respond to a request for comment on allegations of sexual violence by Ukrainian forces and civil defence militias.
'NO PAUSE'
Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Moscow would not pause the fighting for any new round of peace talks, which last convened on April 1.
""A decision was made that during the next rounds of talks, there would be no pause (in military action) so long as a final agreement is not reached,"" Lavrov said.
Britain's defence ministry said Russian shelling continued in Donbas. But Ukrainian forces had beaten back several assaults and destroyed Russian tanks, vehicles and artillery equipment, it added.

The governor of another eastern region, Luhansk, told Ukrainian television that shelling was increasing day by day and urged all civilians to evacuate.
""Those that wanted to leave have already left, while now many are left in bomb shelters who are perhaps frightened to come out of the shelters, or scared to lose their possessions,"" Governor Serhiy Gaidai said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Defense attorneys for two men accused of impersonating federal law enforcement agents and supplying Secret Service personnel with gifts asked a U.S. judge on Monday to release their clients from jail pending trial, saying the government's case was flimsy and lacked evidence they pose a threat.
Prosecutors ""have jumped to the wildest conspiracy theories imaginable,"" said Michelle Peterson, an attorney representing Arian Taherzadeh, 40, who is accused along with Haider Ali, 35.
The two men were arrested last week for impersonating Department of Homeland Security agents and four U.S. Secret Service members were suspended from duty, on suspicion the defendants supplied or offered the Secret Service agents rent-free apartments and other gifts.
Those who were offered gifts included an agent assigned to protect President Joe Biden's wife Jill Biden.
At a detention hearing on Friday, prosecutor Joshua Rothstein asked U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael Harvey to detain both defendants, but Harvey resumed the hearing again on Monday amid lingering questions.
Then at Monday's hearing, Harvey said he needed still more time before issuing a ruling and expressed skepticism that the government's request for detention was the only way to address concerns the defendants could go on impersonating police.
""If I were to put both of these gentlemen under house arrest, what's the realistic likelihood ...that they could go and impersonate another police officer during the pendency of this case?"" he asked.
Harvey will further question all the parties on Tuesday and aimed to rule on the matter later the same day.
The government has pointed to a cache of weapons and other equipment seized by the FBI as evidence the men pose a threat. The items include firearms, surveillance equipment, tools used to manufacture identities and tactical gear.

Prosecutors have said Ali traveled to the Middle East in recent years and bragged of having ties to Pakistani intelligence, concerns they say justify detaining him as a flight risk.
Ali's attorney Gregory Smith on Monday said the government's claims about Ali's possible ties to Pakistani intelligence were ""utterly false and preposterous,"" and that his client traveled to the Middle East to visit religious shrines.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -An off-duty police officer who breached the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack was found guilty of multiple felonies on Tuesday, a notable victory for prosecutors in one of the first trials relating to the attack.
According to court documents, a federal jury in the District of Columbia found Thomas Robertson of Rocky Mount, Virginia, guilty on all six charges he faces, including obstructing an official proceeding of the U.S. Congress.
A judge will impose a sentence on Robertson at a later court hearing.
Robertson was a sergeant in Rocky Mount's police department at the time of the Capitol riot.
Robertson entered the Capitol along with another former police officer, Jacob Fracker, who pleaded guilty to similar charges last month.
Fracker testified on behalf of the prosecution in its case against Robertson after reaching a plea deal with the government last month. 
About 800 people have been charged with crimes relating to the Jan. 6 attack. Robertson was only the second defendant to gamble on a jury trial.
Last year, a judge ordered Robertson to be detained in jail pending trial, after prosecutors alleged Robertson was still buying firearms and ammunition online after his arrest.
The first Jan. 6 jury trial also ended up a victory for prosecutors. Last month, a different jury in the District of Columbia found Guy Reffitt of Texas guilty of all five of the felony charges he faced, including bringing a gun onto the Capitol grounds and obstructing an official proceeding.
Last week, a federal judge issued the first acquittal in a criminal trial stemming from the Jan. 6 attack.
Following a non-jury trial, U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden said prosecutors failed to prove their case against a New Mexico man facing misdemeanor trespassing charges.
McFadden accepted arguments by the defendant, Matthew Martin, that he did not know he was breaking the law when he entered the Capitol complex.

Thousands of Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol, battling police and sending lawmakers running for their lives after Trump in a fiery speech near the White House repeated his false claims that his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud.
Multiple courts, state election officials and members of Trump's own administration have rejected that claim as untrue.

BRASILIA (Reuters) -Brazil's top election authority, the Supreme Electoral Court (TSE), told Reuters on Monday it has invited the European Union for the first time to observe its general elections this year, when President Jair Bolsonaro will seek re-election.
Bolsonaro has questioned the validity https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-bolsonaro-escalates-rhetoric-over-electoral-fraud-2021-07-29 of Brazil's electronic voting system and made baseless allegations https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/bolsonaro-directly-spread-disinformation-brazils-voting-system-police-report-2021-12-17 of fraud in the 2018 race, stirring https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/attacked-by-bolsonaro-brazils-top-judges-say-electronic-voting-is-free-fraud-2021-08-02 concerns https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/biden-envoy-told-brazils-bolsonaro-important-not-undermine-elections-source-2021-08-08 that he may not accept the results https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-bolsonaro-says-may-not-accept-2022-election-under-current-voting-system-2021-07-07 of the October election. 
Recent opinion surveys show the far-right president trailing https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/bolsonaro-gains-lula-brazil-race-helped-by-moro-exit-poll-2022-04-07 well behind leftist former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
European Commission Vice-President Josep Borrell, who handles EU foreign policy, replied last month thanking the TSE for the invitation, saying he had to consult the bloc's 27 member states and the European Parliament, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
That source and another, who requested anonymity to discuss diplomatic deliberations, said the EU plans to send a mission to Brazil in May to assess the viability of being an official observer for the October general election.
The EU embassy in Brasilia declined to comment. Bolsonaro's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The TSE told Reuters it has invited other international groups and institutions to set up election observation missions, including the Organization of American States (OAS), the Carter Center, the parliament of South American trade bloc Mercosur and the Washington-based International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES). The electoral authority said the invitations were still being negotiated.
""The OAS has been invited before to observe the 2018 and 2020 elections. This year we are inviting other institutions,"" a TSE source said, requesting anonymity to speak freely.
Bolsonaro has recently renewed his attacks on the Brazilian voting system, saying it is open to tampering and demanding the adoption of paper ballots. He has questioned the independence of the TSE, whose top members are Supreme Court justices who have questioned his attacks on Brazil’s electronic voting system.

Last year, as supporters of former U.S. President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol seeking to overturn the election victory of current President Joe Biden, Trump admirer Bolsonaro said without providing evidence on social media that there were lots of reports of fraud in the U.S. vote.
His criticism of Brazil's election system and close ties to the armed forces have worried voters that he may copy Trump's refusal to accept defeat.

DENAIN, France (Reuters) -Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen traded blows at a distance on Monday over who would best protect French voters' purchasing power, kicking off a tense fight to win the presidential election runoff on April 24.
Macron, a pro-European centrist who became president in 2017 after easily beating Le Pen when voters rallied behind him to keep the far-right out of power, is facing a much tougher challenge this time.
He is slightly ahead in polls, but Le Pen, who ahead of Sunday's first round successfully tapped into anger over the cost of living and a perception that Macron is disconnected from everyday hardships, pressed on those points on Monday. 
""Emmanuel Macron, if by some mischance he was re-elected, would feel totally free to continue his policy of social wreckage,"" Le Pen said on a visit to a rural area southeast of Paris, mocking his comments on her policy plans and urging him to read her manifesto.
Warning of the ""dark clouds"" that inflation cast on France, she said Macron had failed to protect the French, adding that she would, if elected, slash the VAT on energy and bring it to zero for 100 essential food and hygiene products ""so the French can continue to put fuel in their car ... and feed themselves.""
Macron had equally harsh words about his rival, telling La Voix du Nord newspaper in an interview on Monday, ""Mrs. Le Pen is a demagogue. She is someone who tells people what they want to hear when they want to hear it.""
Macron, who has repeatedly accused Le Pen of lying, said her economic promises were a fantasy.
On a walkabout in Denain, one of the country's poorest towns in its former industrial heartland, he warned voters that Le Pen, who has successfully focused her campaign on the cost-of-living issues troubling millions, would not be able to finance her populist economic agenda and that she was lying to voters.
In hours of sometimes heated exchanges, locals called Macron out on everything from his plans to push back the retirement age to his saying at the height of the Omicron phase of the COVID-19 pandemic that he wanted to ""piss off"" anti-vaxxers. 
""I said that lovingly,"" he told a bewildered local about the much-commented ""piss-off"" comment.
""It's all fake. ... He's coming to talk to us now because he's scared of losing to Marine Le Pen,"" 36-year-old Stephanie Berta, an unemployed mother of six and a Le Pen voter, told Reuters outside the Denain town hall.
""IMPASSE""
But beyond Denain, where Le Pen on Sunday won 42% of votes in the town and the hard-left's Jean-Luc Melenchon came second, Macron was telling voters across France he had heard their concerns and wanted to create wealth so more could be redistributed.
He said he was ready to adapt his platform and improve it, in particular to better protect the environment.
Macron told BFM TV that he was open to discussing his unpopular proposal to push back the legal retirement age to 65. ""I don't want to divide the country,"" he said, while insisting that people would need to work longer for the pension system to be sustainable.
A Le Pen win would send shockwaves across Europe and beyond, and deliver a jolt to the establishment similar to Britain's Brexit vote to leave the European Union or Donald Trump's 2017 entry into the White House.
France's Medef employers group said that Macron's policy plans were best placed to help boost growth in France, while Le Pen's project would lead the country to lag behind its neighbours and trigger ""a very strong and unfunded increase in public spending expenditure (which) would risk placing the country in an impasse"".
Interior Ministry results showed that, on Sunday, Macron won 27.84% of votes, while Le Pen secured 23.15% and Melenchon got 21.95%. 
Investors appeared somewhat relieved that Macron was ahead, and France's CAC 40 stock index outperformed other European peers.

Le Pen, who has left the core of her far-right, anti-immigration programme unchanged, has focused her campaign on social policies including cutting the retirement age to 60 for those who start work before 20, scrapping income tax for the under-30s, and reducing the VAT on energy to 5.5% from 20%. She says her numbers add up.
Sunday's first round dealt a devastating blow to the traditional parties of the centre-left and centre-right, which governed France for decades.

158,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 01:23PM ET</span>","(Reuters) -Authorities in four Russian regions bordering Ukraine and in Russian-controlled Crimea announced they were stepping up security measures on Monday over what they said were ""possible provocations"" from the Ukrainian side. 
Moscow, which sent thousands of troops into Ukraine in what it calls a ""special military operation"", has accused Ukraine of targeting its border regions, including by striking a fuel depot in the city of Belgorod earlier this month. 
The authorities in the Belgorod, Voronezh, Bryansk and Krasnodar regions and in Crimea said they were boosting security and urged citizens to be more vigilant. Another region bordering Ukraine, Kursk, was the first to announce similar measures on Sunday. 
""During the special operation by Russian forces on the territory of Ukraine, the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic, issues pertaining to anti-terrorist security have become more pressing due to possible provocations from Ukrainian nationalists,"" said Alexander Gusev, the governor of the Voronezh region, which shares a border with Ukraine's Luhansk region.
Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the Belgorod region, said it would implement additional security measures until April 25 to counter what he called terrorist threats. The region borders Ukraine's Sumy, Kharkiv and Luhansk regions.
Gladkov said the population should steer clear of crowded public places, carry identity documents on them, have an evacuation plan and pay special attention to strangers and unusual vehicles near residential buildings. 
The Bryansk region, which shares a border with Ukraine's Sumy and Chernihiv regions, said it was also on alert for terrorist threats. 
The governors of the Krasnodar region, across the Sea of Azov from east Ukraine, and of Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, said they were raising ""terrorism alerts"" and would strengthen law enforcement in several districts. 
On Sunday, the governor of the Kursk region, Roman Starovoit, said police and military officers would set up checkpoints, less than a week after border guards allegedly came under fire in the region.

Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists. 
Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces.

GOUZON, France (Reuters) - At a bar in Gouzon, a village in central France, a few locals gathered on Monday to read news of the first round of voting in the presidential election, which saw incumbent Emmanuel Macron through to face far-right challenger Marine Le Pen in a run-off.
The brasserie's owner, William Levron, 53, was pleased with local results: though Macron came out narrowly ahead nationally, here Le Pen led with almost 31% of votes cast on Sunday. Macron gathered only 20%, while Leftist Jean-Luc Melenchon and conservative Valerie Pecresse were at 14% and 13% respectively.
""We're satisfied because we want change, real change,"" said Levron.
Gouzon, with fewer than 1,600 inhabitants and a small centre boasting a pretty Gothic church, a couple restaurants and a few boulangeries, is located in rural Creuse, a department with the country's lowest gross domestic product.
It is one of many such small towns and villages where Macron - who won the second round here five years ago with more than 58% votes - could this time be defeated by Le Pen.
Bar owner Levron said he believed that, with Le Pen in charge, it would mean less public subsidies and lower fuel prices, which would encourage people to work more. He also said he would have to pay fewer charges, and be able to offer better salaries.
Since one of his employee retired, he said he has been unable to replace him. Waiters and cooks are also hard to find.
""We need resources, and it's missing,"" he said. ""It's not logical that we don't find people to hire, it's just ridiculous.""
MANY VOTERS WAVERING
Levron said he was a long time voter of Le Pen's Rassemblement National (RN), formerly Front National, which pushes a nationalist and protectionist platform.
But others in Gouzon, such as Liliane Rebeix, 79, said they were considering voting for Le Pen for the first time.
On Sunday afternoon, as she left one of the town's two polling stations, Rebeix told Reuters she had voted for a minor right-wing candidate, Nicolas Dupont-Aignan. In the run-off on April 24 - which pollsters predict will be tight - she said she would cast her ballot for Le Pen, because she was too disappointed with Macron.
Jean-Pierre Vacher, 70, who was a conservative mayor to the village for almost 20 years, says he does not understand how RN, which he considers xenophobic, has become first choice in what was previously a heartland of the mainstream centre-right.
""Gouzon is a municipality that for 50, 60 years used to vote Gaullist, then Chirac, then Sarkozy predominantly,"" he said.
""The town is doing pretty well for the area, population is up, the local economy is growing, there are no security issues. I'm puzzled.""
He added, however, that one reason could be the ""healthcare desert"" the area has become. ""Ten years ago there were four doctors, now there's only one,"" he said.
Jeannine Alanord, 64 and a Gouzon resident, said she was also worried about the lack of healthcare - one reason she voted in the first round for Anne Hidalgo, the socialist party candidate.
Like many left-wing voters across France, including the 20% who voted for Melenchon, Alanord now faces the same choice she did five years ago - and is unsure what she will do.
""I don't know which decision I will make,"" she said. ""Between plague and cholera, I'm not sure, but I will have to choose.""

Seven other people in the village told Reuters they were still hesitant who they would vote for - if at all.
""I think it's going to be tight,"" said Vacher. ""I fear the outcome in two weeks.""

160,"<span>Apr 11, 2022 12:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - Moscow said on Monday that the United States and Britain were helping Ukraine prepare fake claims about the alleged persecution of civilians in Ukraine to feed to international media in an attempt to smear Russia.
Since Russian troops withdrew from towns and villages around the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, Ukrainian troops have been showing journalists corpses of what they say are civilians killed by Russian forces, destroyed houses and burnt-out cars.
The West says the dead civilians are evidence of war crimes. Reuters reporters saw dead bodies in the town of Bucha but could not independently verify who was responsible for the killings.
Russia's defence ministry said Ukraine's government was being directed by the United States to sow false evidence of Russian violence against civilians despite what it cast as Moscow's ""unprecedented measures to save civilians.""
""The United States, which has many years of experience in organizing provocations with human victims, continues its campaign to create and promote false 'evidence',"" the ministry said. 
Ukraine says Russia is guilty of genocide and has called on the West and the NATO military alliance to give it more support. 
Russia said British intelligence was helping Ukraine to prepare new fake claims about alleged abuses in northeastern Ukraine. The defence ministry did not provide evidence for its claims of British and U.S. involvement. 
""New false staged provocations accusing the armed forces of the Russian Federation of allegedly cruel treatment of the population of Ukraine are being prepared by the Kiev regime under the leadership of British special services on the territory of the Sumy region,"" the ministry said.
Russia said Western journalists had been invited to the Sumy region in northeastern Ukraine to ""conduct the filming of staged plots"". The ministry said Western media would publish such fake news shortly. It did not say which media.
It said that Russian troops had left the alleged scene of some of the abuses, the Ukrainian village of Nyzhnya Syrovatka, on March 20.
""The goal is to further stoke Russophobia against the backdrop of the rapidly developing economic crisis in Europe,"" the ministry said.
Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people, displaced millions and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States.

Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Moscow had to act to defend Russian-speaking people in Ukraine against persecution.
Ukraine says it is fighting against an imperial-style land grab and dismisses Putin's claims of genocide as nonsense.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday postponed a June trial date for two men accused of assaulting police during last year's attack on the U.S. Capitol after an attorney for one of the defendants expressed optimism a plea deal could be reached.
Julian Khater and George Pierre Tanios had been slated to go to trial on June 6 on multiple criminal charges including assaulting at least three U.S. Capitol and Washington police officers with a chemical agent. 
U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan agreed to reschedule the trial to Oct. 5 to give the parties more time to negotiate. 
One of those assaulted, Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, died of natural causes following multiple strokes the day after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack by former President Donald Trump's supporters in a failed bid to block Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.
Khater, of State College, Pennsylvania, was arrested last year as he disembarked from an airplane at Newark Airport in New Jersey. Tanios, of Morgantown, West Virginia, was arrested at his residence in West Virginia. Khater remains detained. Tanios was released with strict curfew orders.
""We've had significant discussions ... with the government about a potential resolution of this matter,"" said Chad Seigel, an attorney for Khater, adding that he recently provided prosecutors with a ""very detailed factual and legal submission"" for their review.
Seigel said that the trial had to be postponed because the rigorous schedule to prepare for it was impeding the ability to strike a plea deal.
Elizabeth Gross, an attorney for Khater's co-defendant Tanios, expressed less optimism that her client could also reach a plea deal, saying her talks with the government have proven less fruitful.

""Possibly more time could help us come to a better resolution,"" Gross said. ""A continuance won't hurt Mr. Tanios.""
Tanios told the judge on Monday he was fine with postponing the trial, saying, ""I look forward to my day in court.""

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) -The Vatican is studying the possibility of extending Pope Francis' trip to Lebanon in June so he can fly to Jerusalem to meet there Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill, who has backed Russia's war in Ukraine, two sources told Reuters on Monday.
It would be only their second meeting. Their first, in Cuba in 2016, was the first between a pope and a leader of the Russian Orthodox Church since the Great Schism that split Christianity into Eastern and Western branches in 1054.
Kirill, 75, has given his full-throated blessing for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a position that has splintered the worldwide Orthodox Church and unleashed an internal rebellion that theologians and academics say is unprecedented.
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the plan was for the 85-year-old pope, who is due in Lebanon on June 12-13, to fly to Amman, Jordan on the morning of June 14.
From there, he would board a helicopter to Jerusalem on the same day for the meeting with Kirill and then return to Rome from there, the sources said.
One source said the trip appeared to be almost certain, while the other said it was one possibility.
Returning from his trip to Malta last week, Francis said he hoped to meet Kirill somewhere in the Middle East this year but did not say where.
Kirill called on Russians on Sunday to rally around the authorities as Moscow pursues what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.
The patriarch has previously made statements defending Moscow's actions in Ukraine and views the war as a bulwark against a liberal Western culture that he considers decadent.
""Let the Lord help us unite during this difficult time for our Fatherland, including around the authorities,"" the Interfax news agency quoted Kirill as saying at a sermon in Moscow.
Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists.
Francis has already rejected that terminology, calling it a war.

Since the war began, Francis has only mentioned Russia explicitly in prayers, such as during a special global event for peace on March 25. But he has made clear his opposition to Russia's actions, using the words invasion, aggression and atrocities.
On Sunday, the pope called for an Easter truce in Ukraine, and in an apparent reference to Russia, questioned the value of planting a victory flag ""on a heap of rubble"".

KYIV (Reuters) - It's the five years spent serving in the Ukrainian army that drives Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk's passion to secure the release of every single prisoner of war being held in Russia.
Now in charge of negotiating prisoner swaps with Russia and humanitarian corridors out of besieged cities, Vereshchuk, 42, fights back tears as she describes the treatment of some women soldiers she has managed to bring back to Ukraine.
It is a brief glimpse of the toll her work is taking, but is quickly replaced by her overriding anger over the Russian invasion and the destruction it has wrought on her country, which she says just wants to be a part of Europe.
""If I was holding a weapon on the battlefield, I would have probably saved 10 to 20 people. And now I can rescue women officers from imprisonment,"" she told Reuters in an interview when asked if she would rather be fighting.
On Saturday she announced on the Telegram messenger service the third prisoner exchange with Russia, securing the release of 26 Ukrainians, including 10 women.
Out of some 1,700 soldiers and civilians she says are currently being held by Russia and pro-Russian separatists, it is the 500 women, and their treatment, which troubles her most.
""They force them to stand, don't let them sit down. They shave their heads, they force them to undress every day for checkups. They humiliate their human dignity. I know facts of rape, I saw spines that had been beaten,"" she said, pausing as her eyes fill with tears.
""They want us to be scared. They want us to cry and to be victims. But we aren't. Our girls and women ... ask us to continue fighting for our victory,"" she said in one of the few brightly lit rooms in the presidential administration, where sandbags piled up against the windows stop the light.
Moscow says it is providing Ukrainian POWs ""with everything necessary"" and ""highly qualified medical care"" in accordance with international law. In turn, Russia accuses Ukraine of torturing its POWs, an allegation rejected by Kyiv, which also says it upholds international agreements.
'RARE OPPORTUNITY TO WIN'
Comfortable in her army fatigues, Vereshchuk says her top priority is to secure the release of not only Ukrainian soldiers but also of hundreds of civilians, including priests, journalists and activists, who she says are being held in cells alongside criminals.
But this poses difficulties. Moscow will only exchange like-for-like but Kyiv says it holds no Russian civilians.
""Russia wants to use those people as an exchange fund.""
""The Russians could not forgive us wanting to be like Europe,"" she added.
Vereshchuk, like President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, calls for more sanctions against Russia to give Ukraine a chance of winning the war, which Moscow describes as a ""special operation"" aimed at demilitarising and ""denazifying"" its neighbour.
She became minister for the occupied territories in eastern Ukraine late last year and has spent time speaking to those populations in Donetsk and Luhansk who have been run by pro-Russian separatist administrations for eight years.
Vereshchuk is convinced those territories will be returned to Ukraine ""sooner or later"". But for the time being, she has to focus her energies on evacuating as many people as possible from eastern Ukraine, where Moscow is now concentrating its attacks.
She does not know how much time she has to get people out of places which could soon be under attack, but has learned some lessons from events in the southern port of Mariupol, which is now encircled by Russian troops and has been all but razed.

""This responsibility is on Russia,"" she said, denying there was much more the Ukrainian government could do to help save a population in Mariupol which she says numbered more than half a million before the war. Ukraine has so far evacuated 120,000 people from Mariupol but 100,000 remain stuck there, she added.
But Vereshchuk remains hopeful of eventual victory: ""Right now, for the first time in Ukrainian history, we have a rare opportunity to win.""

ROME (Reuters) - Italian government forecasts showing a steady decline in education spending triggered an angry reaction on Monday from the country's trade unions, which threatened strikes and protests.
The government's multi-year economic planning document (DEF) published on Friday showed education expenditure projected to fall to 3.5% of gross domestic product in 2025 from 4% in 2020.
The 2020 level was already well below the European Union average of around 5% of GDP, Eurostat data shows. 
The DEF projections ""show grave short-sightedness that our country will pay heavily for in the future,"" said Rino Di Meglio, the head of the Gilda teachers union. ""We will consult our members and organise protests over the next few days.""
The education ministry was not immediately available to comment.
Italian students are among the worst performers in the European Union in mathematics, science and reading, according to the Programme for International Student Assessment tests overseen by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
The DEF linked the projected fall in education spending to Italy's falling birth rate. This was rejected by the unions who said the fall in school age Italians was being compensated for by immigration.
""We expect no decline in the school population, we have just absorbed 10,000 Ukrainian children in our schools in the last few weeks, this is what we have to face,"" said Di Meglio.
The teachers' section of Italy's largest union confederation, the CGIL, said it was ""madness"" for the government to be projecting education cuts while increasing military spending, as Prime Minister Mario Draghi has pledged to do.
The unions accused the government of backtracking on the priorities Draghi set out when he stressed the importance of education in his maiden speech to parliament 14 months ago.

""After heaps of rhetoric, we're heading for spending cuts,"" said Francesco Sinopoli, head of the CGIL's teaching union.
""We are returning to an austerity scenario when we should be increasing investment. If this goes ahead we will take to the streets with every possible protest, including strikes.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government could lose the federal election to be held on May 21, according to polls on Monday, even as they showed him consolidating his position as the country's preferred leader on the first day of campaigning.
A Newspoll survey conducted for The Australian newspaper showed Morrison gaining a point to 44%, while opposition leader Anthony Albanese falling 3 points to 39%, the largest lead the prime minister has held over his rival since February.
But the poll said Morrison's conservative Liberal-National Party coalition, with a one-seat majority in the lower house of parliament, could lose 10 seats to Albanese's centre-left Labor in a campaign set to focus on cost-of-living pressures, climate change and questions over the major parties' competence.
A separate survey for the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper on Monday predicted the ruling coalition could lose at least 14 seats, including some previously deemed safe in resource-rich Queensland and Western Australia states. A win for Labor would see it back in power for the first time since 2013.
All 151 seats in the lower house will be up for election. Morrison's Liberal-National coalition holds 76, Labor 68 and seven are held by minor parties and independents.
Morrison kicked off his election campaign from the marginal seat of Gilmore in New South Wales - a narrow Labor gain from the Liberal Party in the last election in 2019 - as he prepares to spend six weeks on the road before the vote.
""This election ... is about a choice,"" Morrison said during a media briefing on Monday, describing Albanese's leadership as ""untested and unknown"".
""It's a choice between strong economic management and strong financial management ... that contrasts to a Labor opposition who Australians know can't be trusted to manage money.""
Albanese dismissed Morrison's attacks on his experience as a leader saying he was ""ready to govern"", but fumbled answers to questions from reporters about Australia's interest rates and jobless numbers. 
""The national unemployment rate at the moment is, I think it's 5.4% ... sorry, I'm not sure what it is,"" Albanese said, speaking during a media conference in Tasmania.
Australia's unemployment rate dipped to 4.0% in February, several months ahead of central bank forecasts as the economy rebounds, and looks certain to fall into the 3% range for the first time since the early 1970s. 

Morrison has been touting his government's handling of the economy after the emergence of the coronavirus and a faster rebound helped by the lifting of most COVID-19 restrictions despite the threat from the Omicron variant.
Recovery has also been boosted by surging prices for natural resource commodities, of which Australia is a major exporter.

LONDON (Reuters) - Dozens of international scientists have arrived each year since 2000 at Russia's remote Northeast Science Station on the Kolyma River in Siberia to study climate change in the Arctic environment. 
Not this year, though. 
Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Germany's Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry froze the funding used to pay personnel at the research station and to maintain instruments that measure how quickly climate change is thawing Arctic permafrost and how much methane - a potent planet-warming gas - is being released. 
The funding freeze will probably lead to an interruption of the continuous measurements at the station dating back to 2013, compromising scientists' understanding of the warming trend, said Peter Hergersberg, a spokesperson for the Max Planck Society, which is funded by the German state.
""(Russian) colleagues at the Northeast Science Station try to keep the station running,"" Hergersberg said. He declined to say how much funding was withheld. 
Reuters spoke with more than two dozen scientists about the impact of the Ukraine conflict on Russian science. Many expressed concern about its future after tens of millions of dollars in Western funding for Russian science has been suspended in the wake of European sanctions on Moscow. 
Hundreds of partnerships between Russian and Western institutions have been paused if not canceled altogether, the scientists said, as the invasion has unraveled years spent building international cooperation following the Soviet Union's 1991 collapse.
Many communication channels are closed and research trips have been postponed indefinitely. 
The projects affected by the suspension of Western assistance include the construction of high-tech research facilities in Russia, such as an ion collider and a neutron reactor for which Europe had pledged 25 million euros ($27.4 million). 
Such technology would unlock a generation of research that could contribute to everything from fundamental physics to the development of new materials, fuels and pharmaceuticals, scientists said. 
Another 15 million-euro ($16.7 million) contribution toward designing low-carbon materials and battery technologies needed in the energy transition to combat climate change has also been frozen, after the European Union halted all cooperation with Russian entities last month. 
""Emotionally, I can understand this suspension,"" said Dmitry Shchepashchenko, a Russian environmental scientist who studies global forest cover and has been affiliated with the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria since 2007. 
But for science overall, he said: ""This is a lose-lose solution. Global issues like climate change and biodiversity ... can hardly be solved without Russian territory (and) the expertise of Russian scientists."" 
FROZEN FINANCES 
When the Soviet Union broke apart, Russian spending on science plummeted, and thousands of scientists moved abroad or abandoned their fields altogether. 
""We felt as scientists that our work was not appreciated,"" said permafrost scientist Vladimir Romanovksy, who moved his work to Fairbanks, Alaska, in the 1990s. ""There was practically no funding, especially for field work.""
Russian funding has since improved, but remains far below that of the West. In 2019, Russia spent 1% of its GDP on research and development — or about $39 billion, adjusted for currency and price variation — according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). 
Most of that money has been spent in physical science fields, such as space technology and nuclear energy.
By comparison, Germany, Japan and the United States each spend around 3% of their respective GDPs. For the United States, that amounted to $612 billion in 2019. 
Russian science got a boost, though, from partnerships on projects with scientists abroad. Russia and the United States, for example, led the international consortium that launched the International Space Station in 1998. 
The head of Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, said this month it would suspend its participation in the space station until sanctions tied to the Ukraine invasion are lifted.
Russian scientists also helped build the Large Hadron Collider, the world's most powerful particle accelerator, at the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Switzerland, known as CERN. In 2012, the collider made the breakthrough discovery of the elusive Higgs boson, which until then had only been theorized. 
Scientific camaraderie with Europe continued uninterrupted after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. But CERN's governing council announced last month it was suspending any new collaboration with Russia. 
Germany alone has given some 110 million euros ($122 million) toward more than 300 German-Russian projects over the last three years. A further 12.6 million euros ($14 million) in EU funding was awarded to Russian organisations for another 18 projects focusing on everything from Arctic climate monitoring to infectious animal diseases.
Chemist Pavel Troshin recently won Russian state funding for his part in a Russian-German effort to develop next-generation solar cells to power communication satellites. But, with the German side now suspended, the project is up in the air.
Joint projects ""are supposed to be done for the benefit of all the world, and cutting out Russian scientists ... is really counter-productive,"" said Troshin, who works at Russia's Institute for Problems of Chemical Physics. 
""I would never expect something like this. It's shocking to me. I'm upset very much.""
ARCTIC BLACKOUT 
Among the more urgent research efforts on hold are projects to study climate change in the Russian Arctic. 
""Two-thirds of the permafrost region is in Russia, so data from there is critical,” said Northern Arizona University ecologist Ted Schuur of the Permafrost Carbon Network. 
""If you cut off your view of changing permafrost in Russia, you're really cutting off our understanding of global changes to permafrost."" 
That's alarming for scientists as global warming thaws the long-frozen ground that holds an estimated 1.5 trillion metric tons of organic carbon – twice the amount already in the atmosphere today. 
As permafrost thaws, organic material locked within the ice decays and releases more planet-warming gases like methane and carbon dioxide. Scientists fear that such emissions could cause climate change to spiral out of control. 
Scientists can use satellites to monitor landscape changes due to thaw, but can't pick up what's happening below ground, which requires on-site research, Schuur said. 
Russian scientists have collected and shared permafrost field data for years, but Western researchers aren't sure if those communication channels will remain open. Those datasets were also patchy, due to limited funding to cover the vast region.
Arctic ecologist Sue Natali, at U.S. Woodwell Climate Research Center, said her project's plans for boosting Russian monitoring capability is on hold. 
""Instrumentation that was supposed to go out this year has been halted,"" she said, as her colleagues' travel plans have been canceled. 
The U.S. government has issued no clear directive on interacting with Russian institutions, contrary to the European stance. 
A State Department spokesperson told Reuters: ""We do not hold the people of Russia responsible [for the conflict], and believe that continued direct engagement with the Russian people is essential – including in science and technology fields.""
SCIENCE AS COLLATERAL DAMAGE 
Projects under the Russian Science Foundation's state-funded 2021 budget of 22.9 billion rubles ($213 million) had relied on partnerships with India, China, Japan, France, Austria, and Germany, among others. 
A spokesperson did not answer Reuters questions about how the halt in European collaboration would affect its work, saying only that the foundation would ""continue to support leading teams of researchers and their research projects."" 
European scientists had been helping to build Russian research sites including the neutron reactor and the ion collider near St. Petersburg, said Martin Sandhop, a coordinator on this EU-funded effort called CremlinPlus. 
The facilities would help to drive research in fields like high-energy physics, biochemistry and materials science. 
But plans for a 25-million-euro project extension are now suspended and Sandhop's team is redirecting experts and equipment toward European institutions. 
Cremlin's neutron detectors needed for the planned reactor, for example, are now going to a facility in Lund, Sweden. 
Even if Russia manages to complete the expansion works, it's unclear how valuable the work will be without the suite of tools at Western institutions to analyse the data.
Physicist Efim Khazanov at the Institute of Applied Physics in Nizhny Novgorod, near Moscow, said not having access to European equipment would hurt his work using a high-energy laser to study topics such as the structure of spacetime in a vacuum, which could expand our understanding of the universe.
Khazanov was among thousands of Russian scientists who signed an open letter, posted on the independent online science publication Troitskiy Variant, saying Russia had ""doomed itself to international isolation"" with its invasion of Ukraine.
Many Russian scientists also fled the country https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Facademia.interfax.ru%2Fru%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F8241%2F&data=04%7C01%7CKaty.Daigle%40thomsonreuters.com%7C3496e75332214187562d08da166a1deb%7C62ccb8646a1a4b5d8e1c397dec1a8258%7C0%7C0%7C637846942271472634%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=%2FPsx1Vt6cZZmma1wkypEgajrN3PTax5p%2FZtecupKyo8%3D&reserved=0, said Alexander Sergeev, head of the Russian Academy of Sciences, according to Interfax state news agency.
The protest letter https://t-invariant.org/2022/02/we-are-against-war was temporarily removed from the site after Russia passed a law March 4 criminalizing ""fake news"" on the Ukraine campaign. 
That day, a letter was published on the state Russian Rectors' Union website in support https://www.rsr-online.ru/news/2022-god/obrashchenie-rossiyskogo-soyuza-rektorov1 of Russia's invasion and signed by more than 300 leading scientists, who have since been suspended from European University Association membership.

While foreign funding represents just a small part of Russia's scientific spending, its scientists relied on that money to keep projects and careers afloat.
""Those joint research grants were helping a lot of Russians,"" lamented Russian geographer Dmitry Streletskiy, at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. ""I'm just surprised the EU is targeting scientists, which is not the right crowd to target.""

(Reuters) - One of the last obstacles to reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal - Tehran's demand to remove its Revolutionary Guards from a U.S. terrorism list - is more an issue of politics than substance, analysts said.
While the two sides had appeared close to reviving the pact a month ago, talks have since stalled over last-minute Russian demands, the Nowruz holiday, and the unresolved issue of whether Washington might remove the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) from the U.S. Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) list.
The United States and Iran have been engaged it fitful, indirect talks for more than a year on reviving the 2015 deal under which Iran limited its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions.
The United States has weighed dropping the designation in return for some kind of action or commitment from Iran to rein in IRGC activities, one source has said. 
However, the White House is well aware of ""the political sensitivity and price associated with"" removing the elite force from the list, said Dennis Ross, a long-time U.S. Middle East negotiator, noting that some Democrats oppose dropping it.
""There is hesitancy on the part of the political side of the White House,"" he added.
A senior administration official said U.S. President Joe Biden did not intend to drop the terrorism designation, Washington Post columnist David Ignatius reported on Friday.
Asked about that report, a senior Biden administration official said, ""We are not going to negotiate in public. There are still gaps.""
""The onus here is really on Iran at this stage, particularly on this issue,"" the official added on condition of anonymity.
LITTLE ECONOMIC IMPACT
When the Trump administration designated the IRGC as an FTO in 2019, it was the first time Washington had so blacklisted part of another country's military and was seen by some as a poison pill to make it harder to revive the nuclear deal, which then-President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018. 
Critics of dropping the IRGC from the list, as well as those open to the idea, say doing so will have little economic effect because other U.S. sanctions force foreign actors to shun the group.
""It's the administration-wide assessment that it would not have a significant – if any – impact,"" said a senior U.S. official on condition of anonymity.
This is in part because the IRGC would remain sanctioned as a ""specially designated global terrorist"" (SDGT) on a separate U.S. blacklist list created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
The IRGC, a powerful political faction in Iran, controls a business empire as well as elite armed and intelligence forces that Washington accuses of a global terrorist campaign.
Iranian sources cited multiple reasons why they want the designation removed, including domestic politics and the desire of new Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi's team to show it can secure a better deal than his predecessor Hassan Rouhani.
""Mostly it is a matter of dignity for the establishment and Iran's negotiators,"" said a senior Iranian diplomat on condition of anonymity. 
""The new team from the beginning insisted on the FTO issue and sees it as a major achievement if those sanctions are lifted. That is mainly for domestic use because they criticized Rouhani's 2015 deal and cannot just revive it,"" added a former senior Iranian official briefed on the talks.
Another Iranian diplomat said Iran had rejected the idea of removing the designation from the IRGC as a whole but keeping it on the group's elite Quds Force.
SOFT ON TERRORISM?
While U.S. officials are loathe to admit it, the main issue in Washington is also political. Republicans argue dropping the FTO label would show the Biden administration is soft on terrorism, a charge U.S. officials deny.
Representative Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, last week called the IRGC ""a killing machine"" that threatens Americans and he stressed the political cost to the White House.
""That's going to split the Democratic party in half on this, if not more,"" he said.
Some Democrats have voiced misgivings, although there is little chance Congress could block a revived nuclear deal.
""We can't gamble with American lives and remove the ... FTO designation,"" U.S. Representative Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat, said last week.
Even critics admit removal would have few practical effects.
Matthew Levitt of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy think tank said labeling the IRGC as an FTO added only two authorities: allowing the U.S. government to bar entry by anyone associated with it and to impose criminal penalties to those who knowingly provided it ""material support.""

In a recent analysis, Levitt said Iran would use a removal to argue that it does not engage in terrorism, and that dropping the label would undermine the credibility of U.S. sanctions.
""The IRGC should not be removed from the FTO list until there is evidence it has ceased terrorist activities,"" he wrote.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea praised Kim Jong Un's leadership in developing nuclear weapons, touted his political achievements, and unveiled new portraits and exhibitions to celebrate his 10 years in charge of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea (WPK).
Kim is considered to have assumed power when he was named supreme commander of the military after his father, Kim Jong Il, died in Dec. 2011. 
Monday marks ten years since the younger Kim was elected as the top party and state leader. The Kim family has ruled the one-party state for its entire history.
In a speech at a national meeting on Sunday, Choe Ryong Hae, member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee and one of the most senior officials under Kim, praised the North Korean leader as ""a gifted thinker and theoretician, outstanding statesman and peerlessly great commander.""
The events started a week of commemorations that will also include the 110-year anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, North Korea's founder and Kim Jong Un's grandfather, on Friday.
Commercial satellite imagery has shown North Korean troops practicing for a military parade that could be held this week. Analysts also say there are signs that North Korea could display its ICBMs at the event.
Last month North Korea set alarm bells ringing in Seoul, Tokyo and Washington by conducting a full ICBM test for the first time since 2017, ending a self-imposed moratorium on such tests
New construction has been spotted at North Korea's nuclear test site, raising concerns that it could soon explode a weapon for the first time since 2017. Last week North Korea said it opposes war but will not hesitate to use its nuclear weapons if it is attacked by South Korea.
Choe called Kim ""a peerless patriot and a great defender of peace"" for making North Korea ""a full-fledged military power equipped with all powerful physical means of self-defence.""
Under Kim North Korea conducted four of its six nuclear tests, and developed massive intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that analysts believe may be capable of striking anywhere in the United States.
Despite facing unprecedented difficulties, Kim had opened up a new era for North Korea as a powerful socialist nation prospering and developing with self-sustenance and self-reliance, Choe said.
Kim has vowed to improve residents' lives and tried to boost North Korea's economy, but it suffered major contractions in recent years as it was battered by international sanctions, COVID-19 lockdown measures and bad weather. U.N. agencies have warned of possible humanitarian crises.

State media unveiled a rare new official portrait of Kim on Sunday, and reported that a Pyongyang museum had opened a new exhibition to showcase the achievements of his ""immortal leadership"".
""Ten years is a fine time for Kim to try and boost his cult of personality even higher,"" Colin Zwirko, an analytical correspondent with NK News, which monitors North Korea, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).

Safronov, who covered military affairs for the Vedomosti and Kommersant newspapers before becoming an aide to the head of Russia's space agency two months before his arrest in July 2020, faces up to 20 years in prison if found guilty.
He denies accusations of passing military secrets about Russian arms sales in the Middle East and Africa to the Czech Republic, a NATO member, while he worked as a reporter in 2017, calling them ""a complete travesty of justice and common sense"".
His detention sent a chill through Russia's media landscape, where controls were already tight and have been tightened further since Russia invaded Ukraine in February.
His trial resumes behind closed doors later on Monday.
Striking a defiant tone in personal correspondence seen by Reuters on Monday, Safronov said he harboured no illusions about the prospect of being imprisoned for his alleged offences. 
""I will fight until the end, there is no doubt about that,"" Safronov wrote in a letter sent from Moscow's Lefortovo prison and dated March 26. 
""If it's a prison term, then it's a prison term. It absolutely doesn't scare me,"" said the letter, shown to Reuters on condition the addressee remained anonymous.
Safronov has said state investigators pointed to his acquaintance with a Czech journalist he met in Moscow in 2010 who later set up a website which Safronov said he contributed to using information entirely based on open sources.

Since sending troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, Moscow has introduced a law outlawing the use of certain terms to describe its military intervention in Ukraine, which it calls a ""special military operation"".
That prompted many independent media outlets to close or relocate.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's national security police arrested a veteran journalist and former contributing writer with the now-shuttered liberal media outlet Stand News, on Monday for alleged sedition, police and local media said. 
A crackdown on the media based on a sedition law that dates from the British colonial-era, as all as a China-imposed national security law has seen several major media outlets raided by police and closed down, including the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily newspaper and the Stand News online news portal.
Local police said in a statement that the national security department of the police force had arrested a 54 year-old male for ""conspiracy to publish seditious publications"" and had detained him for further investigation.
Local media indentified the man as Allan Au, a veteran journalist and academic at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who wrote columns for newspapers including Ming Pao and the now closed Apple Daily. 
Reuters was not able to immediately reach Au for comment. 
Sedition is not among the offences listed under a sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing in June 2020 that punishes terrorism, collusion with foreign forces, subversion and secession with possible life imprisonment.
But court judgments in recent months have enabled authorities to use powers conferred by the new legislation to deploy rarely used colonial era laws covering sedition.
When questioned about Au's arrest, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam told a news conference she would not comment on individual cases, but said press freedom was enshrined in the city's mini-constitution, the Basic Law. 
The Hong Kong Journalists' Association expressed ""deep concern"" and said the arrest risked ""further damaging Hong Kong's press freedom"".
Au, who was known for his critical columns, is a former Knight Fellow at Stanford University. 
""I once wondered whether I could keep writing till 2047, but it's a delusion in the end,"" Au wrote in one of his last published columns, referring to China's constitutional promise under the Basic Law to keep Hong Kong's freedoms and autonomy intact for 50 years until 2047. 

""We still haven’t reached 2047, but 2047 has arrived before our very eyes,"" Au wrote.
Au's arrest adds to the number of journalists targeted after the enactment of the security law. Two former senior editors of Stand News had also been charged in December with conspiring to publish and or reproduce seditious publications.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Nine out of ten Mexicans voting on Sunday in an unprecedented recall election engineered by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador backed him to stay in office, underlining his domination of a polarized political agenda.
Both critics and supporters alike had viewed his victory as a foregone conclusion in a ballot that had fed speculation it could open the door to extending presidential term limits, now limited to a single six-year period.
Between 90.3% and 91.9% voters were predicted to have supported Lopez Obrador, a preliminary estimate from the National Electoral Institute (INE) showed on Sunday night.
Unleashing a string of barbs at adversaries, Lopez Obrador hailed the referendum result as ""historic"", and compared his tally favorably with the number of votes won by rivals he defeated to win the presidency, and in other elections.
""We don't have a king in Mexico,"" he said in a video address. ""It's a democracy, and the people are in charge.""
A pugnacious leftist, Lopez Obrador was the architect of the first so-called 'recall referendum' in modern Mexico, calling it vital to confirm his democratic mandate.
Turnout in the vote was forecast at between 17% and 18.2%, INE said, well below a threshold of 40% for it to be binding, and lower than some polls.
Opposition leaders had actively discouraged supporters from voting, with many condemning the plebiscite as a propaganda exercise and a costly distraction from real problems.
Turnout had been expected to range between 16% and 25% in a poll published by newspaper El Financiero this month.
Political analysts had said Lopez Obrador would seize on the result as a personal triumph in his bid to push a constitutional change to the electricity market through Congress in the coming week, although he looks short of votes.
Lopez Obrador denies wanting to extend his term, but he used the referendum to fire up supporters and test his strength ahead of gubernatorial elections in June.
Since taking office in December 2018, Lopez Obrador has fallen short of campaign pledges to reduce violent crime and lift the economy, unsettling investors by trying to renegotiate contracts and tightening state control of natural resources.
But his successful roll-out of welfare programs and relentless daily depiction of a political narrative in which he stars as a morally upright defender of the poor against a corrupt, wealthy elite has helped buttress his popularity. 
CONTENTIOUS
Many Mexicans regard the folksy Lopez Obrador as a welcome departure from previous leaders often seen as aloof from the broader population in a society that remains highly unequal.
""I want the president to continue in power,"" said one of them, Guillermina Gomez, after voting in the central state of Tlaxcala. 
The 60-year-old homemaker said his welfare programs had allowed her grandchildren to enroll in high school, which her meager household income had kept out of the reach of her children.
""Thanks to him we've received benefits that no one else has given us.""
Costing millions of dollars and heavily publicized in the capital, the referendum asked Mexicans if Lopez Obrador's mandate should be revoked ""due to loss of trust,"" or he should conclude his term as scheduled on Sept. 30, 2024.
Maribel Rosas, 36, who voted for Lopez Obrador to become president in 2018, said she had cast a vote for him to be removed from office, as he was failing to help the middle class and spurring social polarisation. 

""This division isn't going to get us anywhere,"" said Rosas, a resident of Mexico City who works in advertising.
The president had accused the National Electoral Institute of trying to stymie the referendum, which it denied. He quickly criticized it again after the results.

BRUSSELS/WASHINGTON - (Reuters) - Senior officials at the European Commission were targeted last year with spy software designed by an Israeli surveillance firm, according to two EU officials and documentation reviewed by Reuters.
Among them was Didier Reynders, a senior Belgian statesman who has served as the European Justice Commissioner since 2019, according to one of the documents. At least four other commission staffers were also targeted, according to the document and another person familiar with the matter. The two EU officials confirmed that staffers at the commission had been targeted but did not provide details.
The commission became aware of the targeting following messages issued by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to thousands of iPhone owners in November telling them they were ""targeted by state-sponsored attackers,"" the two EU officials said. It was the first time https://www.reuters.com/technology/how-saudi-womans-iphone-revealed-hacking-around-world-2022-02-17 Apple had sent a mass alert to users that they were in government hackers' crosshairs. 
The warnings triggered immediate concern at the commission, the two officials said. In a Nov. 26 email reviewed by Reuters, a senior tech staffer sent a message to colleagues with background about Israeli hacking tools and a request to be on the lookout for additional warnings from Apple. 
""Given the nature of your responsibilities, you are a potential target,"" the staffer said in the email, reviewed by Reuters.  
Reuters was unable to determine who used the Israeli spyware to target Reynders and his Brussels-based colleagues, whether the attempts were successful, and, if so, what the hackers might have obtained as a result. 
Reynders and his spokesman David Marechal did not return repeated messages. European Commission spokesman Johannes Bahrke declined comment. Apple declined comment.
Security researchers have said the recipients of the warnings were targeted between February and September 2021 using ForcedEntry, an advanced piece of software that was used by Israeli cyber surveillance vendor NSO Group to help foreign spy agencies remotely and invisibly take control of iPhones. A smaller Israeli spyware vendor named QuaDream also sold a nearly identical tool to government clients, Reuters previously reported https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-iphone-flaw-exploited-by-second-israeli-spy-firm-sources-2022-02-03. 
NSO said in a statement that it was not responsible for the hacking attempts, saying the targeting described by Reuters ""could not have happened with NSO's tools."" 
The company, which faces a number of overlapping lawsuits and was recently blacklisted by U.S. officials over alleged human rights abuses, said it supported an investigation into the targeting and called for the establishment of global rules to govern the spyware industry.
QuaDream, which keeps a lower profile, did not return repeated messages. 
IT experts examined at least some of the officials' smartphones for signs of compromise but the results were inconclusive, according to the two EU sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak to the press. 
Reuters has not been able to determine whether the commission is still investigating the matter. 
News of the targeting comes as the European Union is beginning to follow the United States in taking a harder look at spyware merchants like NSO.
The European Parliament is set to launch a committee of inquiry to investigate the use of surveillance software in European member states on April 19, according to Sophie in 't Veld, the EU lawmaker who championed the committee's creation.
In 't Veld told Reuters she had been unaware that European Commission officials were targeted, calling the news ""dynamite.""
""We really have to get to the bottom of this,"" she said.
The committee was formed in the wake of reports that senior opposition politicians in Poland had their phones hacked with Israeli spyware and that prominent critics and investigative journalists in Hungary had also been targeted.
Polish officials and a Hungarian ruling party lawmaker have acknowledged that their respective governments purchased NSO software, although both nations have denied wrongdoing in relation to allegations of domestic espionage.

It was important not to jump to conclusions about who might be responsible, said Kenneth Lasoen, a research fellow at the Clingendael Netherlands Institute of International Relations.
The EU “are a very high profile target for multiple actors,” Lasoen said. “Brussels is a true nest of espionage.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden said last month that the United States would accept up to 100,000 Ukrainians fleeing Russia's invasion, but lawmakers and advocates have urged the Democratic president to speed up refugee and visa processing. 
While several thousand Ukrainians have entered the United States via the border with Mexico and some on legal visas, only 12 Ukrainians came through the U.S. refugee program in March. 
WHY HASN'T THE U.S. TAKEN IN MORE UKRAINIAN REFUGEES?
More than 4 million people have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries since Russia invaded the country on Feb. 24, according to United Nations data https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine, touching off Europe's fastest-moving refugee crisis since the end of World War Two.
Top Biden officials said repeatedly last month that the vast majority of Ukrainian refugees would go to Europe during the conflict, which Russia calls a ""special military operation.""
But facing pressure from U.S. lawmakers and refugee advocates, the Biden administration said on March 24 that the United States would use ""the full range of legal pathways"" to accept up to 100,000 Ukrainians.
The pathways include the U.S. refugee resettlement program, which provides a road to citizenship, as well as existing visa avenues and a relief program known as ""humanitarian parole,"" which allows people into the country on a temporary emergency basis.
The effort could stretch beyond the current fiscal year ending on Sept. 30, the official said, signaling that it may not move quickly. Refugee resettlement can take years and there is a long backlog for U.S. visa processing. 
COULD THE U.S. ACCEPT MORE UKRAINIAN REFUGEES?
The United States admitted 514 Ukrainian refugees in January and February during Russia's build up to the war, according to State Department data, with only 12 resettled in March as the war intensified and the number of Ukrainians fleeing skyrocketed.
A State Department spokesperson said it had paused refugee operations in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv but continued to process cases through an office in Chisinau, Moldova.
Many Ukrainian refugee applicants cleared for travel to the United States in March were set to depart from inside Ukraine, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters last month. Those cases were stalled by flight cancellations related to the conflict, leading to the near-shutdown of admissions, the person said.
Lawmakers and advocates have urged the Biden administration to accelerate the processing of Ukrainian applications saying too little has been done so far. 
Biden set the overall refugee ceiling for this year at 125,000 after his predecessor Donald Trump, a Republican, slashed admissions to a record-low 15,000, which gutted the program and led to processing delays already worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic.
WHAT HAPPENS TO UKRAINIANS WHO TRY TO ENTER THE UNITED STATES FROM MEXICO?
Thousands of Ukrainians and Russians have been traveling to the U.S.-Mexico border to seek asylum, a trend that could accelerate as the humanitarian crisis worsens.
Last week, about 3,000 Ukrainians deemed by U.S. authorities to be particularly vulnerable were allowed to cross the border into the United States, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
The circuitous route may be the most accessible pathway into the United States for Ukrainians at the moment, even as it requires them to enter Mexico on tourist visas and approach the border without assurances they will be allowed to enter.
As of Thursday, about 2,400 Ukrainians were in Tijuana, Mexico, waiting to cross into the United States, according to Enrique Lucero, the city's migration affairs director.
HOW ELSE ARE UKRAINIANS ENTERING THE UNITED STATES?
The U.S. State Department declined to provide statistics on visas issued to Ukrainians in March and DHS did not say how many Ukrainians entered the United States during that period.
About 200 Ukrainians were issued immigrant visas in February while nearly 1,500 were issued temporary non-immigrant visas, according State Department data, though most of those visas were likely approved before Russia invaded Ukraine on late February. 
The State Department said that visa applicants in general may face longer wait times at some U.S. embassies and consulates due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Ukrainians, just like other applicants, can request faster processing if circumstances warrant it, the department said, stressing that refugees should not attempt to enter the United States on tourist visas or other temporary visas.
More than 350 Ukrainians have sought humanitarian parole to enter the United States from abroad since the start of the conflict, according to a person familiar with the matter. Separately, 28 applications were approved for entries related to medical care for children, the person said.
IF THE U.S. ISN'T ACCEPTING MANY UKRAINIAN REFUGEES, WHAT IS IT DOING?
The U.S. government is devoting significant economic aid to assist the European countries receiving refugees.
Biden pledged $1 billion in new humanitarian aid for those affected by the war during his visit to Europe in late March. 
Earlier that month, Biden signed into law a spending bill that provides $13.6 billion to help Ukraine and European allies, including about $4 billion to aid people fleeing. 

The U.S. government also announced in March that it will grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to an estimated 75,000 Ukrainians already in the United States but it would not apply to people who arrived after March 1.
In a bipartisan letter this week, 65 lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives called on Biden to make a technical change to the TPS designation that would include more recently arrived Ukrainians.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) -Opposition politician Shehbaz Sharif submitted his nomination to be Pakistan's next prime minister to the legislature on Sunday, his party said, after incumbent Imran Khan lost a no-confidence vote in parliament after nearly four years in power. 
The younger brother of three-times prime minister Nawaz Sharif, Shehbaz, 70, has led a bid by the opposition in parliament to topple former cricket star Khan, and he is widely expected to replace him following a vote on Monday.
But Khan's party also submitted papers nominating the former foreign minister as a candidate, saying their members of parliament would resign en masse should he lose, potentially creating the need for urgent by-elections for their seats.
Khan, the first Pakistani prime minister to be ousted by a no confidence vote, had clung on for almost a week after a united opposition first tried to remove him. 
On Sunday, he repeated allegations that a foreign conspiracy was behind the regime change. 
""The freedom struggle begins again today,"" he said via his Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account, which is followed by more than 15 million and still describes him as Prime Minister of Pakistan in his biography section.
Even before the vote Khan had called for protests, which were expected to take place late on Sunday.
""I tell all of my supporters across Pakistan, on Sunday, after Isha (evening) prayers, you all have to come out of your homes and protest peacefully against this imported government that is trying to come to power,"" he said in an address to the nation on Friday.
His government fell in the early hours of Sunday after a 13-hour session that included repeated delays and lengthy speeches by lawmakers from his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party.
Opposition parties were able to secure 174 votes in the 342-member house for the no-confidence motion, giving them the majority they needed to enable Monday's vote to elect a new premier.
Khan's former information minister Fawad Chaudhry told reporters of the plan for resignations if their nominee does not win.
The speaker would be obliged to accept those resignations that would necessitate by-elections in probably more than 100 seats. 
That could plunge the country into another crisis as the election commission has previously said it would not be ready to hold elections until October. 
ROLE OF MILITARY?
Two sources who declined to be identified said the vote that ousted Khan went ahead after the powerful army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, met Khan, as criticism mounted over the delay to the parliamentary process. The Supreme Court has also ordered parliament to convene and hold the vote.
The military has ruled the country of 220 million people for almost half its nearly 75-year history.
It viewed Khan and his conservative agenda favourably when he won election in 2018, but that support waned after a falling-out over the appointment of the influential military intelligence chief and economic troubles that led to the largest interest rate rise in decades this week.
Khan had antagonised the United States throughout his tenure, welcoming the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan last year and more recently accusing the United States of being behind the attempt to oust him. Washington dismissed the accusation.
Shehbaz Sharif said Khan's departure was a chance for a newbeginning.
""A new dawn has started ... This alliance will rebuildPakistan,"" he told parliament on Sunday. 
Sharif was for years chief minister of Punjab province and has a reputation as an effective administrator.
His first tasks would be to repair relations with the powerful military as well as ally the United States, and tend to a stuttering economy.
Some analysts say navigating major political and economic hurdles with a united front would be a challenge for the new coalition, which comprises several diverse political parties. 

""There are going to be divisions and divergences within the key coalition partners,"" said Mosharraf Zaidi, senior fellow at thinktank Tabadlab, adding the first likely hurdle would be the raising of fuel prices in coming days. 
""They are going to face both internal resistance within the coalition and possibly even criticism by coalition members and that will be in the first few days, not even weeks,"" he added.

KYIV/BUZOVA, Ukraine (Reuters) - Russian forces pounded targets in eastern Ukraine with missiles and artillery on Sunday as Austria's leader planned to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Washington pledged to give Ukraine ""the weapons it needs"" to defend itself against a new Russian offensive.
Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said he would meet with Putin on Monday in Moscow for the Russian leader's first face-to-face meeting with a European Union counterpart since Russia's invasion began on Feb. 24. 
""We are militarily neutral, but (have) a clear position on the Russian war of aggression against #Ukraine,"" Nehammer wrote of Austria on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) https://twitter.com/karlnehammer/status/1513193093784297476. ""It must stop! It needs humanitarian corridors, ceasefire & full investigation of war crimes.""
Nehammer met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Saturday - the same day as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who promised to give Ukraine 120 armoured vehicles and anti-ship missile systems.
Russia has failed to take any major cities, but Ukraine says it has been gathering its forces in the east for a major assault and has urged people to flee.
Russian forces fired rockets into Ukraine's Luhansk and Dnipropetrovsk regions on Sunday, officials said. Missiles completely destroyed the airport in the city of Dnipro, said Valentyn Reznichenko, governor of the central Dnipropetrovsk region. 
Russia's defence ministry said high-precision missiles had destroyed the headquarters of Ukraine's Dnipro battalion in the town of Zvonetsky.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the reports.
WEAPONS APPEALS
Since Russia invaded, Zelenskiy has appealed to Western powers to provide more defence help, and to punish Moscow with tougher sanctions, including embargoes on Russian energy exports. 
U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan told ABC News: ""We're going to get Ukraine the weapons it needs to beat back the Russians to stop them from taking more cities and towns.""
In an interview aired on CBS's ""60 Minutes,"" Zelenskiy said he had confidence in his own armed forces but ""unfortunately I don't have the confidence that we will be receiving everything we need"" from the United States. 
""They have to supply weapons to Ukraine as if they were defending themselves and their own people,"" Zelenskiy added. ""They need to understand this. If they don’t speed up, it will be very hard for us to hold on against this pressure.""
Zelenskiy said earlier on Twitter he had spoken on the phone with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz about additional sanctions, as well as more defence and financial support for his country. Zelenskiy also discussed with Ukrainian officials Kyiv's proposals for a new package of EU sanctions, his office said.
The EU on Friday banned Russian coal imports among other products, but has yet to touch oil and gas imports from Russia.
NEW SANCTIONS
Mounting civilian casualties have triggered widespread international condemnation and new sanctions.
A grave with at least two civilian bodies has been found in Buzova village near Kyiv, said Taras Didych, head of the Dmytrivka community that includes Buzova, the latest such reported discovery since Russian forces withdrew from areas north of the capital.
Sullivan said on Sunday he expected Russia's newly appointed general overseeing Ukraine, Aleksandr Dvornikov, to authorise more brutality against the Ukrainian civilian population. He did not cite any evidence.
Moscow has rejected accusations of war crimes by Ukraine and Western countries. 
Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians in what it calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" its southern neighbour. Ukraine and Western nations have dismissed this as a baseless pretext for war.
Russia's invasion has forced about a quarter of Ukraine's 44 million people from their homes, turned cities into rubble and killed or injured thousands.
The World Bank on Sunday forecast the war would cause Ukraine's economic output to collapse by a staggering 45% this year, with half of its businesses shuttered, grain exports mostly cut off by Russia's naval blockade and destruction rendering economic activity impossible in many areas.
The bank forecast Russia's GDP would contract by 11.2% this year due to punishing Western sanctions.
HEAVY SHELLING
Some cities in Ukraine's east were under heavy shelling, with tens of thousands of people unable to evacuate.
Calls by Ukrainian officials for civilians to flee gained more urgency after a missile strike hit a train station on Friday in the city of Kramatorsk, in the Donetsk region, that was full of people trying to leave.
Ukrainian officials said on Sunday the death toll from the strike rose to 57, while 109 were wounded. Russia has denied responsibility, saying the missiles used in the attack were only used by Ukraine's military. 
Reuters was unable to verify the details of the attack.

Ramzan Kadyrov, the powerful head of Russia's Chechnya region, said in a video message that Russia would unleash an offensive on the besieged port of Mariupol, but also Luhansk, and Donetsk and then target Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities.
Ukraine's deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said 2,824 people were evacuated on Sunday through humanitarian corridors, including 213 from Mariupol, which has been under siege for weeks.

PARIS (Reuters) -Supporters of France's far-right and hard-left parties celebrated as presidential candidates for traditional mainstream parties failed dismally in Sunday's first-round vote. 
As vote counting continued, President Emmanuel Macron was ahead of far-right party leader Marine Le Pen and polling firms estimated that far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon would win over 22% of the vote, compared to under 20% five years ago. 
In a hall at the edge of Paris, a few hundred Rassemblement National supporters erupted into cheers as TV stations announced Le Pen had again made it into the second round, and with a higher score than the 21.3% in 2017. 
They waved French flags and shouted ""Marine for president"" as Le Pen spoke to her supporters and called on voters for conservative Valerie Pecresse and rival hard-right candidate Eric Zemmour to rally behind her. 
Several militants said their party was no longer ostracised by the general public and that they had generally received a warm welcome when canvassing for Le Pen.
""We are greeted in a completely different manner when we distribute party leaflets, we see it when we go to markets, we see people who are much more receptive - something has changed,"" longtime Le Pen supporter Nathalie Vaccari, 57, said.
With crowds jumping on stage and singing ""on a gagne"" (we have won), Le Pen's deputy campaign manager Jean-Philippe Tanguy said he was confident Le Pen could win over voters who have voted for Zemmour and Melenchon in the first round.
At a packed Cirque d'Hiver theatre in central Paris, some Melenchon fans burst into tears when the first results were announced and hundreds of supporters sang for joy, chanting ""on ne lache rien"" (we won't give an inch) throughout the night.
Actor Xavier Mathieu, who led the singing, said he regretted that Melenchon had not qualified for the second round, but was happy about his candidate's strong showing.
""The race is not finished because change in society does not happen in elections, it happens in the street,"" he said. 
Jeroen Atputharajah, 18, blamed green candidate Yannick Jadot and socialist Anne Hidalgo for not backing Melenchon. 
""They preferred to divide the left,"" he said. 
Polling firms forecast Jadot at under 5% of the first-round vote, while Hidalgo was seen getting under 2%, a record low for the party that helped Francois Hollande win the 2012 election.
At the conservative party's venue, supporters had the blues, with Valerie Pecresse seen scoring less than 5%, compared to the 20.01% her predecessor Francois Fillon won five years ago.
Some 200 activists lingered after Precresse left, finishing the champagne, eating canapés, and pondering the outlook for their party, which dominated French politics for decades.

Kinata Kopi, wearing a T-shirt saying ""Valerie je t’aime"", said Republicans now had to stick together to prepare the 2027 election. 
""I hope General de Gaulle and (former president) Jacques Chirac will inspire us so that the Republicans's flame remains alight,"" she said.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Israeli forces killed two Palestinian women on Sunday after one ran towards troops and the other stabbed a soldier in separate incidents in the occupied West Bank, Israeli security officials said.
With violence surging after a string of deadly Arab attacks in Israel, a Palestinian man was killed by Israeli soldiers during what local residents said were confrontations with stone-throwers near the West Bank town of Bethlehem, the Palestinian health ministry announced.
The Israeli military said troops shot a Palestinian throwing petrol bombs towards an Israeli vehicle.
The bloodshed has coincided with the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, when Israeli-Palestinian violence has erupted in the past and, last May, spiralled into an 11-day war between Gaza militants and Israel.
In Bethlehem, no weapon was found on the body of a Palestinian woman who was shot and killed after she ignored soldiers' calls and warning fire to stop running towards them, the Israeli military said, adding it had begun an investigation.
Hours later, a Palestinian woman armed with a knife was shot dead after she slightly wounded a paramilitary border policeman in Hebron, outside the Tomb of the Patriarchs, which Muslims call al-Ibrahimi mosque, Israeli security officials said.
Israeli forces have been on high alert following attacks by three members of Israel's Arab minority and two Palestinians from the West Bank that have killed 14 people in Israel since late March.
More than 20 Palestinians, many of them armed militants, have been killed by Israeli forces since January, while Palestinians have reported a rise in violence by Israeli settlers in the West Bank.
Hussein al-Sheikh, a senior Palestinian official, said Israel's expansion of settlements on occupied land Palestinians want for a state and visits by far-right Israelis to the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem have led to escalation.

Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has said Arab assailants were ""trying to destroy us"" and were ""moved by hatred of Jews and of the State of Israel"".
Israeli forces have been mounting raids in and around the West Bank city of Jenin, a militant stronghold, to try to thwart what Bennett has called ""a new wave of terrorism"".

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Lu, 99, was a long-time resident at Shanghai's Donghai Elderly Care hospital, her loved ones secure that she was getting round-the-clock care at the city's largest such centre.
That was before COVID-19 struck China's biggest city last month, the country's worst outbreak since the virus emerged in Wuhan in late 2019, infecting multiple patients, doctors and care workers at the 1,800-bed facility. 
Orderlies posted cries for help on social media, saying they were overwhelmed. Relatives told Reuters that there had been several deaths. 
    Lu, whose relatives asked that she be identified only by her surname, had coronary heart disease and high blood pressure. She caught COVID and, though she had no symptoms, was being transferred to an isolation facility, her family was told on March 25. 
    She died there seven days later, the cause of death listed as her underlying medical conditions, her granddaughter said.
Among the questions she has about Lu's final days was why elderly patients had to be quarantined separately, away from the care workers most familiar with their conditions under China's quarantine rules. 
Her frustrations reflect those of many with China's no-tolerance COVID policy. Everyone testing positive must quarantine in specialised isolation sites, whether they show symptoms or not. 
Shanghai has become a test case for the country's strict policy. Home quarantine is not an option and, until public outrage prompted a change, Shanghai was separating COVID-positive children from their parents.
From March 1 to April 9, China's financial hub reported some 180,000 locally transmitted infections, 96% of which were asymptomatic. It reported no deaths for the period.
A Donghai staffer who answered the phone on Sunday declined to answer questions, directing Reuters to another department, which did not respond to repeated calls. 
Asked for comment, the Shanghai government sent a local media report with a first-person account of life at one of the quarantine centres. The unidentified author said he wanted to dispel fears that such sites were terrible, saying he received ample meals and medicine but recommending people bring earplugs and eye masks. 
The authorities did not offer further comment. 
The United States has raised concerns about China's COVID approach, advising its citizens on Friday to reconsider travel to China ""due to arbitrary enforcement of local laws and COVID-19 restrictions."" Beijing dismissed the U.S. concerns as ""groundless accusations"".
    'DIDN'T DARE BELIEVE IT'
When Lu was being quarantined, the family asked, ""Who is going to care for her? Will there be care workers, doctors?,"" her granddaughter said. ""My grandmother is not someone who can live independently.
""If the care worker had COVID and no symptoms, why couldn't they stay together?,"" she said. ""The chaos and tragedies happening in Shanghai this time really boil down to cruel policies.""
A relative of Donghai patient Shen Peiying, who gave his surname as Qiu, said he believes the quarantine policy contributed to the April 3 death of the bedridden 72-year-old.
She had not caught COVID, he said, citing test records he saw on China's health app. After weeks of little communication, staff rang to say Shen had died from a chest infection. 
Qiu has refused to consent to her cremation, citing such unanswered questions as what care she received after her regular care worker was quarantined.
""If they were all in quarantine, who was there to take care of the patients?,"" Qiu said. 
Shanghai is doubling down on the quarantine policy, converting schools, recently finished apartment blocks and vast exhibition halls into centres, the largest of which can hold 50,000 people. Authorities said last week they have set up over 60 such facilities.
    These steps, including sending patients to quarantine sites in neighbouring provinces, have been greeted by the public with a mixture of awe at their speed and horror over conditions, prompting some Shanghai residents to call for home quarantine to be allowed. 
    While Chinese state media has shown hospitals with just two or three patients per room, patients like those sent to Shanghai's giant exhibition centres say they live side by side with thousands of strangers, without walls or showers and with ceiling lights on at all hours. 
    Videos on Chinese social media have shown hastily converted quarantine sites, including a ramshackle vacant factory where a number of camping beds were placed, a site made out of shipping containers and a school with a poster saying blankets and hot water were not available. 
A source verified the first video. Reuters could not independently verify the others. 
    Management of such sites has been a concern.
    One viral video last week showed patients at a site called the Nanhui makeshift hospital fighting for supplies. Reuters could not reach the facility on Sunday for comment.

Among those posting on social media was Shanghai resident Li Tong, who asked for help after his wife was sent there. He said things got better when more staff arrived to organise the patients but that he was shocked by what the videos showed and what his wife told him.
""I didn't dare believe it, that Shanghai in 2022 could be like this,"" he said.

(Reuters) - A local prosecutor in Texas will dismiss criminal charges against a 26-year-old woman who was arrested for a self-induced abortion in a case that had drawn national scrutiny and led abortion rights activists to demonstrate on her behalf.
Following a grand jury indictment of her on March 30, Lizelle Herrera was arrested on Thursday by the Starr County Sheriff's Office, according to Valley Central.com, which cited a spokesperson who said she ""intentionally and knowingly caused the death of an individual by self-induced abortion.""
Starr County District Attorney Gocha Allen Ramirez said on Sunday his office would file a motion to dismiss charges against her on Monday.
""In reviewing applicable Texas law, it is clear that Ms. Herrera cannot and should not be prosecuted for the allegation against her,"" Ramirez said in a statement.
Neither the district attorney nor the sheriff's department responded to queries about when she would be released.
Starr County is on the Mexican border in the Rio Grande Valley region in the southern tip of Texas.
Ramirez said sheriff's deputies were right to arrest her as ""to ignore the incident would have been a dereliction of their duty."" But he also said district attorneys have prosecutorial discretion and that his oath is ""to do justice.""
""Following that oath, the only correct outcome to this matter is to immediately dismiss the indictment against Ms. Herrera,"" the prosecutor said.
The case also reignited controversy over Texas's strict abortion law that was largely upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in December. Known as Senate Bill 8, the law bans abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant, and does not exempt women who are impregnated by rape.
The Starr County prosecutor did not comment on what specific legal standard he applied and instead pointed to how the indictment has ""taken a toll"" on Herrera and her family.
""The issues surrounding this matter are clearly contentious, however based on Texas law and the facts presented, it is not a criminal matter,"" Ramirez said. 

A small group of protesters had gathered outside the sheriff's office on Saturday, led by La Frontera Fund, an abortion assistance group.
""She miscarried at a hospital and allegedly confided to hospital staff that she had attempted to induce her own abortion and she was reported to the authorities by hospital administration or staff,"" Rickie Gonzalez, the group's founder, said on Saturday.

PARIS (Reuters) - The French will decide on April 24 whether to re-elect pro-business centrist President Emmanuel Macron or blow up decades of mainstream consensus in favour of far-right Marine Le Pen.
Here's what to expect from them on major issues:
- THE ECONOMY:
LE PEN: The far-right heiress has transformed the former National Front, turning her father's free-market, small-government party into a big-spending, protectionist one. 
She wants to implement a ""Buy French"" policy for public tenders, cut the minimum retirement age to 60 for those who started work before 20, scrap income tax for those aged under 30, and cut VAT on energy to 5.5% from 20%.
She would also spend 2 billion euros ($2.18 billion) over 5 years raising hospital workers' salaries and recruiting an extra 10,000 of them. Teachers' salaries would rise 15% over 5 years. 
Gilles Ivaldi, political scientist at Sciences-Po, says her party's economic programme is further to the left than it has been for decades. 
MACRON : The French leader plans to double down on supply-side reforms he has implemented during his first mandate, with the main plank of his manifesto being an increase in the minimum pension age to 65 from 62.
Macron is also promising to make some welfare benefits conditional on 15-20 hours of training, similar to policies in countries such as the United States or Britain.
Unemployment insurance, which currently guarantees workers up to two thirds of their salary for two years if they lose their job, would be linked to the strength of the economy. 
In his attempt to stay true to his ""neither left nor right"" motto, he has also promised to make benefits automatic for those who qualify instead of requiring would-be recipients to apply.
- EUROPE : 
LE PEN : Although she has abandoned earlier plans to leave the euro and pay France's debt in newly created francs, Le Pen has nonetheless pledged to cut contributions to European Union coffers. Such a move would put Paris on a collision course with the European Commission and other EU members.
She insists French law should prevail over EU rules, in a challenge to the bloc's top court, and says she wants eventually to replace the EU with a ""Europe of nations"", though she has yet to spell out what that would look like. 
Le Pen would also employ thousands more customs agents to check goods entering France, including from other EU countries, purportedly to fight fraud. Analysts say that would undermine the single market.
MACRON : The ardent Europhile would continue his push to develop what he calls Europe's ""strategic autonomy"" in defence, technology, agriculture and energy and reduce the bloc's dependence on other powers.
Over the past five years, Macron has sought to re-orient the EU towards a more protectionist stance, blocking some free-trade deals with other blocs such as Mercosur and creating a mechanism that increases scrutiny of outside takeovers of strategic EU companies.
Macron is also likely to push for more regulation of U.S. tech giants and has said he wanted to create a ""European metaverse"" to compete with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s. 
- THE WESTERN ALLIANCE: 
LE PEN : Le Pen wants to pull France out of transatlantic military alliance NATO's integrated command, in a challenge to the West's post-Cold War security architecture. 
Opponents accuse her of being too close to Moscow. Her party received a bank loan from a Russian bank in 2014 and she was hosted by Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin shortly before the 2017 presidential election. 
She has condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but says Moscow could be an ally again post-war.
In an interview with Reuters, she called herself a ""Gaullist"", after wartime leader Charles de Gaulle, and said she would pursue a foreign policy at equal distance from Washington and Moscow.
Asked if she had a message to France's traditional allies, Britain and the United States, she said: ""Drop the preconceived ideas you have about me.""
MACRON : Although Macron ruffled feathers across the trans-Atlantic allieance, notably in in eastern Europe and Germany, when he called NATO ""brain-dead"" in 2019, he has since said the Russian invasion of Ukraine had ""jolted it back to life"". 
He would nonetheless seek to make Europeans less dependent on the U.S. military for security.
Macron has pushed the EU to focus more on the Indo-Pacific and China's rising influence in the region. However, he clashed with Washington, London and Canberra after Australia ditched a massive submarine deal with France. 

He has been guarded over whether he would seek to cooperate with the new U.S.-UK-Australia security alliance - dubbed AUKUS - against China or try and persuade the EU to pursue its own independent policy towards Beijing.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States is committed to providing Ukraine with “the weapons it needs” to defend itself against Russia, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Sunday as Ukraine seeks more military aid from the West. 
Sullivan said the Biden administration will send more weapons to Ukraine to prevent Russia from seizing more territory and targeting civilians, attacks that Washington has labeled war crimes. 
“We’re going to get Ukraine the weapons it needs to beat back the Russians to stop them from taking more cities and towns where they commit these crimes,” Sullivan said on ABC News’ “This Week”. 
Moscow has rejected accusations of war crimes by Ukraine and Western countries.
Speaking later on NBC News’ “Meet the Press"", Sullivan said the United States was “working around the clock to deliver our own weapons . . . and organizing and coordinating the delivery of weapons from many other countries.”
“Weapons are arriving every day,” Sullivan said, “including today.”
The United States has sent $1.7 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion on Feb. 24, the White House said last week. 
Weapons shipments have included defensive anti-aircraft Stinger and anti-tank Javelin missiles, as well as ammunition and body armor. But U.S. and European leaders are being pressed by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to provide heavier arms and equipment to engage Russia in the eastern region of the country, where Russia is expected to intensify its military efforts.
In excerpts of an interview with CBS News' ""60 Minutes"" that will air later on Sunday, Zelenskiy expressed skepticism that the United States would deliver the weapons he said are needed.
Whether Ukraine can beat back the Russian incursion ""depends on how fast we will be helped by the United States. To be honest, whether we will be able to survive depends on this,"" Zelenskiy said.
""I have 100% confidence in our people and in our armed forces, but unfortunately I don't have the confidence that we will be receiving everything we need.""
On Friday, Ukrainian officials said more than 50 people were killed in a missile strike on a train station in city of Kramatorsk in the Donetsk region, where thousands of people had gathered to evacuate.
Russia's invasion has forced around a quarter of the population of 44 million to leave their homes, turned cities into rubble and killed or injured thousands.
Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians in what it calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" its southern neighbour. Ukraine and Western nations have dismissed this as a baseless pretext for war.
Russia on Saturday appointed a new general to lead its forces in Ukraine, Aleksandr Dvornikov, who had significant military experience in Syria.
With that background, Sullivan said he expects Dvornikov to authorize more brutality against the Ukrainian civilian population. 
Republican U.S. Representative Liz Cheney, speaking on CNN’s “State of the Nation"", urged the Biden administration to provide Ukraine with both offensive weapons such as tanks and planes and defensive systems like anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles.
""I think we need to do everything that Zelenskiy says he needs at this point, given the just unbelievable battle that they have put up,"" she said. 

A CBS News poll released on Sunday showed widespread support among Americans for sending more weapons to Ukraine.
According to the poll, which was conducted last week as news of Russian attacks on civilians unfolded, 72% of those surveyed favor sending more weapons, while 78% support economic sanctions on Russia.

IDLIB, Syria/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Abdel Hamid al-Youssef said 25 members of his family, including his wife and infant twins, were killed when poison gas was dropped on their town in Syria in 2017, in an attack a U.N.-backed inquiry concluded was launched by the Syrian state.
    ""In seconds, everything was erased. Life was completely erased,"" Youssef, 33, said of the sarin attack that struck the town of Khan Sheikhoun, one of scores of times chemical weapons have reportedly been used in the country's 11-year-old war.
The bombardment, in Syria's rebel-held northwest, killed at least 90 people, 30 of them children, Human Rights Watch, a New York-based rights group, said. 
By the time of the strike, Syrian-allies Russia and China had already vetoed efforts at the United Nations to open an investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC) into war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria. 
As the Khan Sheikhoun attack marks it fifth anniversary, survivors and human rights campaigners say the failure to hold anyone accountable for chemical attacks in Syria could encourage further use of such banned weapons. 
    The United States and other countries have warned Russia could deploy chemical or biological munitions in its invasion of Ukraine, without providing concrete evidence. The Kremlin has dismissed the statements as ""diversion tactics"". 
""There is no deterrent for Russia,"" said Youssef, who wants Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to be held to account. ""Until this day, the criminal is free.""
Assad's government has denied using chemical weapons in the war, which started as an uprising against his rule and has killed at least 350,000 people. Syria signed international conventions outlawing the use of such weapons in 2013. 
The details of the Khan Sheikhoun attack are seared into Youssef's memory, starting with the noise of warplanes that launched several air strikes on the town beginning at 6:30 a.m.
    Trying to get his family to safety, Youssef headed towards his parents' home. His wife went ahead as he stopped to aid a neighbour who was was screaming for help. 
Youssef said he helped load casualties into a pickup truck. Some were foaming at the mouth. 
Youssef lost consciousness as he tried to help his neice. He awoke in hospital hours later, only realizing the scale of the calamity when he returned home that afternoon.
""There were rooms of martyrs. I didn't know which one to take: my brother, my nephew, my children, my wife,"" said Youssef. ""They put them in shrouds. We took them to the cemetery and buried them there."" 
    U.S. President Donald Trump's administration responded by firing 59 cruise missiles at the air strip from which it said the attack was launched.
    Six months later, a report by an investigative mechanism established by the United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) - which enforces treaties banning the use of such arms - said the victims' symptoms were consistent with large-scale poisoning by the nerve agent sarin.
    It said it was ""confident that the Syrian Arab Republic is responsible for the release of sarin at Khan Shaykhun on 4 April 2017"". The town fell to government forces in 2019. 
Five years later, Youssef says he still feels the effects and sometimes faints when he smells strong odours such as household chlorine. The biggest impact, however, has been psychological, he said, adding that he lives in fear. 
For survivors of sarin attacks, the effects can include persistent vision problems, gastro intestinal issues, and post-traumatic stress disorder, said Professor Alastair Hay, a chemical weapons expert.
    ""The main impact is usually catastrophic death, and very quickly,"" he said, adding that more data is needed on the long-term consequences of exposure to chemical weapons. 
    At the time of the attack, Russia - which threw its military support behind Assad in 2015 - said the chemicals belonged to Syrian rebels, not the government. President Vladimir Putin said he believed Washington planned more missile strikes, and that rebels planned to stage chemical weapons attacks to provoke them. 
    'FALSE FLAG'
    The United States has warned that Russia could attempt similar so-called ""false flag"" attacks following its invasion of Ukraine in late February. 
Washington and its allies have accused Putin's government of spreading an unproven claim that Ukraine had a biological weapons program as a prelude to potentially launching its own biological or chemical assault. 
    The White House has not provided evidence Russia has been planning such an attack. Nor has the Kremlin provided support for its claim that Ukraine is preparing to use chemical weapons.
    Russia says it is mounting ""a special military operation"" to demilitarize its western neighbor and has denied that its troops have targeted civilians. 
    Syria has seen some of the most extensive use of chemical weapons since the First World War.
Around 150 cases of alleged uses of chemical weapons in Syria are being investigated by the OPCW and there have been 20 confirmed uses of such weapons, a source familiar with the matter said. 
Investigations at the United Nations and by the OPCW special Investigation and Identification Team concluded that Syrian government forces used sarin and chlorine barrel bombs in attacks between 2015 and 2018. Investigators have also found the Islamic State group used chemical weapons in Syria.    
    The deadliest sarin attack of the war to date was in 2013 on rebel-held Ghouta near Damascus that killed hundreds of people but prompted no Western military response. The threat of a U.S. missile strike was averted when Moscow brokered a deal for Syria's chemical weapons to be destroyed by the following year. 
Many diplomats and weapons inspectors later concluded Syria's promise to give up its stockpile was a ruse https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-chemicalweapons-idUSKCN1AX107. 
    Critics said U.S. President Barack Obama failed to enforce his own ""red line"" against the use of chemical weapons by Assad. 
""In Syria, the fact the Obama 'red line' disappeared in a puff of smoke really gave license for every dictator, despot, rogue state and terror group to use chemical weapons,"" said Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a specialist in biological and chemical warfare.
""It also made the likes of Putin believe the West was weak and he could do what he likes with impunity.""
    A Kremlin spokesman did not immediately reply to emailed questions from Reuters. Neither did the Syrian information ministry.
    'THESE CRIMES DO NOT FADE'
    Assad's opponents have drawn parallels between the war in Syria and the military methods used by Russia in Ukraine, including besieging and bombarding cities.  
The ICC said last month it was opening an investigation into war crimes in Ukraine after a petition from an unprecedented 39 member states. 
    Russia and China's U.N. veto of an ICC inquiry on Syria has forced rights advocates to pursue other legal avenues.
    Civil society groups have filed complaints over chemical weapons attacks in Syria to judicial authorities in France https://www.reuters.com/article/syria-security-france-int-idUSKBN2AU0VL, Germany https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-syria-germany-chemicalweapons-idUSKBN26R10I and Sweden, where criminal investigations have been opened under laws giving universal jurisdiction for crimes against humanity. 
The cases have not yet been brought to prosecution, according to the Open Society Justice Initiative.
Hamid Ketteny, a civil defence rescue worker who says he carried the bodies of six children killed in Khan Sheikhoun, said he helped document the massacre.
""The silence of the international community towards the crimes previously committed here in Syria has allowed Russia and others to commit crimes in the rest of the world, and currently in Ukraine,"" he said. 
    Nidal Shikhani, director general of the Chemical Violations Documentation Centre of Syria, said he remained optimistic that perpetrators would be held to account, noting the large amounts of evidence gathered by his group and others.     

    His organisation had received requests for evidence from prosecutors on five cases in three European countries, most recently in September. 
""These crimes do not fade with the passing of time,"" he said.

Iran and the United States have engaged in indirect talks in Vienna over the past year to revive the 2015 nuclear agreement between Tehran and world powers which then-U.S. President Donald Trump left in 2018 and Iran subsequently violated by ramping up its nuclear programme.
Negotiations have now stalled as Tehran and Washington blame each other for failing to take the necessary political decisions to settle remaining issues.
Imposing such conditions at a crucial time could endanger a final agreement by restricting negotiators' room for manoeuvre in the talks. 
""The United States should give legal guarantees, approved by its ... Congress, that it will not exit the pact again,"" the semi-official Tasnim news agency quoted a statement signed by 250 lawmakers out of a total of 290. 
The letter also said that under a revived pact the United States should not be able to ""use pretexts to trigger the snapback mechanism"", under which sanctions on Iran would be immediately reinstated, the Tasnim news agency reported.

The lawmakers also said that ""sanctions lifted under the reinstated pact should not be reimposed and Iran should not be hit by new sanctions"". 
Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said on Sunday U.S. President Joe Biden should issue executive orders to lift some sanctions on Iran to show his goodwill towards reviving the nuclear pact.

LONDON (Reuters) - Dozens of international scientists have arrived each year since 2000 at Russia's remote Northeast Science Station on the Kolyma River in Siberia to study climate change in the Arctic environment. 
Not this year, though. 
Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Germany's Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry froze the funding used to pay personnel at the research station and to maintain instruments that measure how quickly climate change is thawing Arctic permafrost and how much methane - a potent planet-warming gas - is being released. 
The funding freeze will probably lead to an interruption of the continuous measurements at the station dating back to 2013, compromising scientists' understanding of the warming trend, said Peter Hergersberg, a spokesperson for the Max Planck Society, which is funded by the German state.
""(Russian) colleagues at the Northeast Science Station try to keep the station running,"" Hergersberg said. He declined to say how much funding was withheld. 
Reuters spoke with more than two dozen scientists about the impact of the Ukraine conflict on Russian science. Many expressed concern about its future after tens of millions of dollars in Western funding for Russian science has been suspended in the wake of European sanctions on Moscow. 
Hundreds of partnerships between Russian and Western institutions have been paused if not canceled altogether, the scientists said, as the invasion has unraveled years spent building international cooperation following the Soviet Union's 1991 collapse.
Many communication channels are closed and research trips have been postponed indefinitely. 
The projects affected by the suspension of Western assistance include the construction of high-tech research facilities in Russia, such as an ion collider and a neutron reactor for which Europe had pledged 25 million euros ($27.4 million). 
Such technology would unlock a generation of research that could contribute to everything from fundamental physics to the development of new materials, fuels and pharmaceuticals, scientists said. 
Another 15 million-euro ($16.7 million) contribution toward designing low-carbon materials and battery technologies needed in the energy transition to combat climate change has also been frozen, after the European Union halted all cooperation with Russian entities last month. 
""Emotionally, I can understand this suspension,"" said Dmitry Shchepashchenko, a Russian environmental scientist who studies global forest cover and has been affiliated with the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria since 2007. 
But for science overall, he said: ""This is a lose-lose solution. Global issues like climate change and biodiversity ... can hardly be solved without Russian territory (and) the expertise of Russian scientists."" 
FROZEN FINANCES 
When the Soviet Union broke apart, Russian spending on science plummeted, and thousands of scientists moved abroad or abandoned their fields altogether. 
""We felt as scientists that our work was not appreciated,"" said permafrost scientist Vladimir Romanovksy, who moved his work to Fairbanks, Alaska, in the 1990s. ""There was practically no funding, especially for field work.""
Russian funding has since improved, but remains far below that of the West. In 2019, Russia spent 1% of its GDP on research and development — or about $39 billion, adjusted for currency and price variation — according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). 
Most of that money has been spent in physical science fields, such as space technology and nuclear energy.
By comparison, Germany, Japan and the United States each spend around 3% of their respective GDPs. For the United States, that amounted to $612 billion in 2019. 
Russian science got a boost, though, from partnerships on projects with scientists abroad. Russia and the United States, for example, led the international consortium that launched the International Space Station in 1998. 
The head of Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, said this month it would suspend its participation in the space station until sanctions tied to the Ukraine invasion are lifted.
Russian scientists also helped build the Large Hadron Collider, the world's most powerful particle accelerator, at the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Switzerland, known as CERN. In 2012, the collider made the breakthrough discovery of the elusive Higgs boson, which until then had only been theorized. 
Scientific camaraderie with Europe continued uninterrupted after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. But CERN's governing council announced last month it was suspending any new collaboration with Russia. 
Germany alone has given some 110 million euros ($122 million) toward more than 300 German-Russian projects over the last three years. A further 12.6 million euros ($14 million) in EU funding was awarded to Russian organisations for another 18 projects focusing on everything from Arctic climate monitoring to infectious animal diseases.
Chemist Pavel Troshin recently won Russian state funding for his part in a Russian-German effort to develop next-generation solar cells to power communication satellites. But, with the German side now suspended, the project is up in the air.
Joint projects ""are supposed to be done for the benefit of all the world, and cutting out Russian scientists ... is really counter-productive,"" said Troshin, who works at Russia's Institute for Problems of Chemical Physics. 
""I would never expect something like this. It's shocking to me. I'm upset very much.""
ARCTIC BLACKOUT 
Among the more urgent research efforts on hold are projects to study climate change in the Russian Arctic. 
""Two-thirds of the permafrost region is in Russia, so data from there is critical,” said Northern Arizona University ecologist Ted Schuur of the Permafrost Carbon Network. 
""If you cut off your view of changing permafrost in Russia, you're really cutting off our understanding of global changes to permafrost."" 
That's alarming for scientists as global warming thaws the long-frozen ground that holds an estimated 1.5 trillion metric tons of organic carbon – twice the amount already in the atmosphere today. 
As permafrost thaws, organic material locked within the ice decays and releases more planet-warming gases like methane and carbon dioxide. Scientists fear that such emissions could cause climate change to spiral out of control. 
Scientists can use satellites to monitor landscape changes due to thaw, but can't pick up what's happening below ground, which requires on-site research, Schuur said. 
Russian scientists have collected and shared permafrost field data for years, but Western researchers aren't sure if those communication channels will remain open. Those datasets were also patchy, due to limited funding to cover the vast region.
Arctic ecologist Sue Natali, at U.S. Woodwell Climate Research Center, said her project's plans for boosting Russian monitoring capability is on hold. 
""Instrumentation that was supposed to go out this year has been halted,"" she said, as her colleagues' travel plans have been canceled. 
The U.S. government has issued no clear directive on interacting with Russian institutions, contrary to the European stance. 
A State Department spokesperson told Reuters: ""We do not hold the people of Russia responsible [for the conflict], and believe that continued direct engagement with the Russian people is essential – including in science and technology fields.""
SCIENCE AS COLLATERAL DAMAGE 
Projects under the Russian Science Foundation's state-funded 2021 budget of 22.9 billion rubles ($213 million) had relied on partnerships with India, China, Japan, France, Austria, and Germany, among others. 
A spokesperson did not answer Reuters questions about how the halt in European collaboration would affect its work, saying only that the foundation would ""continue to support leading teams of researchers and their research projects."" 
European scientists had been helping to build Russian research sites including the neutron reactor and the ion collider near St. Petersburg, said Martin Sandhop, a coordinator on this EU-funded effort called CremlinPlus. 
The facilities would help to drive research in fields like high-energy physics, biochemistry and materials science. 
But plans for a 25-million-euro project extension are now suspended and Sandhop's team is redirecting experts and equipment toward European institutions. 
Cremlin's neutron detectors needed for the planned reactor, for example, are now going to a facility in Lund, Sweden. 
Even if Russia manages to complete the expansion works, it's unclear how valuable the work will be without the suite of tools at Western institutions to analyse the data.
Physicist Efim Khazanov at the Institute of Applied Physics in Nizhny Novgorod, near Moscow, said not having access to European equipment would hurt his work using a high-energy laser to study topics such as the structure of spacetime in a vacuum, which could expand our understanding of the universe.
Khazanov was among thousands of Russian scientists who signed an open letter, posted on the independent online science publication Troitskiy Variant, saying Russia had ""doomed itself to international isolation"" with its invasion of Ukraine.
Many Russian scientists also fled the country https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Facademia.interfax.ru%2Fru%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F8241%2F&data=04%7C01%7CKaty.Daigle%40thomsonreuters.com%7C3496e75332214187562d08da166a1deb%7C62ccb8646a1a4b5d8e1c397dec1a8258%7C0%7C0%7C637846942271472634%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=%2FPsx1Vt6cZZmma1wkypEgajrN3PTax5p%2FZtecupKyo8%3D&reserved=0, said Alexander Sergeev, head of the Russian Academy of Sciences, according to Interfax state news agency.
The protest letter https://t-invariant.org/2022/02/we-are-against-war was temporarily removed from the site after Russia passed a law March 4 criminalizing ""fake news"" on the Ukraine campaign. 
That day, a letter was published on the state Russian Rectors' Union website in support https://www.rsr-online.ru/news/2022-god/obrashchenie-rossiyskogo-soyuza-rektorov1 of Russia's invasion and signed by more than 300 leading scientists, who have since been suspended from European University Association membership.

While foreign funding represents just a small part of Russia's scientific spending, its scientists relied on that money to keep projects and careers afloat.
""Those joint research grants were helping a lot of Russians,"" lamented Russian geographer Dmitry Streletskiy, at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. ""I'm just surprised the EU is targeting scientists, which is not the right crowd to target.""

MELBOURNE/SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia will hold a general election on May 21, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Sunday, triggering a campaign expected to be fought over cost-of-living pressures, climate change and questions of trust and competence of the major parties.
Morrison played up economic uncertainties and security threats in announcing the election, saying this was not the time to hand the reins to an untested opposition Labor leader, Anthony Albanese.
""Only by voting for the Liberals and Nationals at this election on May 21 can you ensure a strong economy for a stronger future,"" Morrison told reporters in the capital Canberra.
The opposition Labor party says it would offer a ""better future"" for the Australian people than the conservative coalition.
Morrison's coalition, with a one-seat majority in the lower house of parliament, trails Labor in opinion polls after nine years in power. But the conservatives similarly lagged before the previous election in May 2019, when they pulled off a win.
Both Morrison and Albanese on Sunday pointed to the range of challenges Australians have faced since the last election, from fires and floods, to the COVID-19 pandemic, recession and now surging food and fuel costs.
Morrison said his government had saved thousands of lives with its tough COVID-19 curbs and spurred a rapid pandemic recovery to bring unemployment down to 4%.
""Now is not the time to risk that,"" Morrison said, adding that Labor would weaken the economy with higher taxes and deficits.
In reply, Albanese said the government had no vision for the country, while his party had plans for cutting child care costs, improving aged care, boosting manufacturing and driving renewable energy growth.

""At the moment, we have an economy that isn't working for people. People know that. They are doing it really tough,"" Albanese told reporters in Sydney.
""We have had a difficult couple of years...As we emerge from this, Australians deserve better.""

The U.S. State Department said on Friday that non-emergency staff at its Shanghai consulate and families of U.S. employees could leave due to a surge in COVID cases and coronavirus restrictions in the city.
""We express strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to the groundless accusations against China's pandemic prevention policy from the U.S. in its statement, and have lodged solemn representations,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said in a statement.
Shanghai is fighting China's worst COVID-19 outbreak since the virus first emerged in Wuhan in late 2019, with almost 25,000 new local cases reported on Sunday for the previous day.
While those case numbers are small by global standards, Shanghai's curbs to battle the outbreak have squeezed supplies of food and other essential goods for the city of 26 million, with residents also raising concerns about access to medical care.
The most controversial of Shanghai's practices had been separating COVID-positive children from their parents. Authorities have since made some concessions.
""Ambassador (Nicholas) Burns and other Department and Mission officials have raised our concerns regarding the outbreak and the PRC's control measures directly with PRC officials,"" a U.S. Embassy spokesperson said in a statement on Saturday, referring to the People's Republic of China.
""We have informed them about the voluntary departure decision,"" the statement said.
Friday's advisory said that U.S. citizens should reconsider travel to China ""due to arbitrary enforcement of local laws and COVID-19 restrictions.""
The advisory also warned Americans from travelling to Hong Kong, Jilin province or Shanghai, citing a risk of parents and children being separated.  

China's foreign ministry said on Saturday that China's pandemic prevention and control is ""scientific and effective"", adding that the government had assisted foreign diplomatic personnel as much as possible.
Diplomats from more than 30 countries recently wrote to China's foreign ministry to express concern with the separations.

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine is ready for a tough battle with Russian forces amassing in the east of the country, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson offered fresh financial and military support during a surprise visit.
At a meeting in Kyiv, Johnson told Zelenskiy that Britain would provide armored vehicles and anti-ship missile systems, along with additional support for World Bank loans. 
Britain also will continue to ratchet up its sanctions on Russia and move away from using Russian hydrocarbons, he said. 
The support aims to ensure that ""Ukraine can never be bullied again, never will be blackmailed again, never will be threatened in the same way again,"" Johnson said.
Johnson was the latest foreign leader to visit Kyiv after Russian forces pulled back from areas around the capital just over a week ago.
Earlier in the day, the Ukrainian leader met Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer in Kyiv, warning in a joint news conference that while the threat to the capital had receded, it was rising in the east.
""This will be a hard battle, we believe in this fight and our victory. We are ready to simultaneously fight and look for diplomatic ways to put an end to this war,"" Zelenskiy said.
Ukranian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak said Zelenskiy and Russian President Vladimir Putin would not meet until after the country defeated Russia in the east, which would bolster its negotiating position. 
""We are paying a very high price. But Russia must get rid of its imperial illusions,"" he said, according to the Interfax Ukraine news agency.
Air-raid sirens sounded in cities across eastern Ukraine, which has become the focus of Russian military action after the withdrawal from around Kyiv.
Ukrainian officials have urged civilians in the east to flee. On Friday, officials said more than 50 people were killed in a missile strike on a train station in city of Kramatorsk in the Donetsk region, where thousands of people had gathered to evacuate.
Russia's invasion, which began on Feb. 24, has forced around a quarter of the population of 44 million to leave their homes, turned cities into rubble and killed or injured thousands.
The civilian casualties have triggered a wave of international condemnation, in particular over deaths in the town of Bucha, a town to the northwest of Kyiv that until last week was occupied by Russian forces.
""We will never forget everything we saw here, this will stay with us for our whole lives,"" said Bohdan Zubchuk, a community policeman in the town, describing his life before and after the war.
British military intelligence said that Russia's retreat from the region revealed ""disproportionate"" targeting of civilians.
Russia has denied targeting civilians in what it calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarize and ""denazify"" its southern neighbor. Ukraine and Western nations have dismissed this as a baseless pretext for war.
AT LEAST 52 DIE AT STATION
Friday's missile attack at the station in Kramatorsk, a hub for civilians fleeing the east, left shreds of blood-stained clothes, toys and damaged luggage strewn across the station's platform.
City Mayor Oleksander Honcharenko, who estimated 4,000 people were gathered there at the time, said on Saturday that the death toll had risen to least 52. 
He said he expected just 50,000 to 60,000 of Kramatorsk's population of 220,000 to remain as people flee the violence.
Ukraine said 4,532 people were evacuated from its cities on Saturday, down from 6,665 the day before.
Russia has denied responsibility, saying the missiles used in the attack were only used by Ukraine's military. The United States says it believes Russian forces were responsible. 
Reuters was unable to verify the details of attack.
The Ukrainian military says Moscow is preparing for a thrust to try to gain full control of the Donbas regions of Donetsk and Luhansk that have been partly held by Moscow-backed separatists since 2014.
The British Defence Ministry said air attacks are likely to increase in the south and east as Russia seeks to connect Crimea - which Moscow annexed in 2014 - and the Donbas, but Ukrainian forces are thwarting the advance.
Russia's military said on Saturday it had destroyed an ammunition depot at the Myrhorod Air Base in central-eastern Ukraine.
FOREIGN LEADERS VISIT
Johnson and Nehammer visited Ukraine a day after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. 
Video posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) showed Johnson and Zelenskiy, flanked by soldiers, walking through central Kiev to a memorial marking the 2014 Maidan Revolution.
The EU on Friday adopted new sanctions against Russia, including bans on the import of coal, wood, chemicals and other products. Oil and gas imports from Russia so far remain untouched.
Zelenskiy urged the West to adopt a complete embargo on Russian energy products and supply more weapons to Ukraine.

""Russia can still afford to live in illusions and bring new military forces and new equipment to our land. And that means we need even more sanctions and even more weapons for our state,"" he said in a late-night address.
The visits by foreign leaders were a sign that Kyiv was returning to some degree of normality after the Russian retreat. Some residents have begun to return to the capital, with cafes and restaurants reopening, and Italy said it plans to re-open its embassy in the city later this month.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) -Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan was ousted on Sunday when he lost a vote of confidence in parliament, after being deserted by coalition partners who blame him for a crumbling economy and failure to deliver on his campaign promises.
The result of the vote, which was the culmination of a 13-hour session that included repeated delays, was announced just before 0100 (2000 GMT on Saturday) by the presiding speaker of parliament's lower house, Ayaz Sadiq.
Khan, 69 was ousted after 3-1/2 years as leader of the nuclear-armed country of 220 million, where the military has ruled for nearly half its nearly 75-year history.
Parliament will meet on Monday to elect a new prime minister.
Sunday's vote followed multiple adjournments in the chamber, called due to lengthy speeches by members of Khan's party, who said there was a U.S. conspiracy to oust the cricket star-turned-politician. 
Opposition parties were able to secure 174 votes in the 342-member house in support of the no-confidence motion, Sadiq said, making it a majority vote. 
""Consequently the motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan has been passed,"" he said to the thumping of desks in the chamber. Khan, who was not present for the vote, had no immediate comment.
Just a few legislators of Khan's ruling party -- Tehreek-i-Insaf, or Pakistan Movement for Justice -- were present for the vote.
The house voted after the country's powerful army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa met Khan, said two sources who spoke on condition of anonymity, as criticism mounted over the delay in the parliamentary process.
The front-runner to become Pakistan's next prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, said Khan's ouster was a chance for a new beginning.
""A new dawn has started... This alliance will rebuild Pakistan,"" Sharif, 70, said in parliament. 
Sharif, the younger brother of three-time Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, has a reputation as an effective administrator.
Parliamentary elections are not due until August 2023. However, the opposition has said it wants early elections, but only after it delivered a political defeat to Khan and passes legislation it says is required to ensure the next polls are free and fair.
Khan's ouster extends Pakistan's unenviable record for political instability: no prime minister has completed their full term since independence from Britain in 1947, although Khan is the first to be removed through a no-confidence vote. (GRAPHIC: https://tmsnrt.rs/3JsJaU2)
He surged to power in 2018 with the military's support, but recently lost his parliamentary majority when allies quit Khan's coalition government. There were also signs he had lost the military's support, analysts said.
MILITARY SOURED ON KHAN
The military viewed Khan and his conservative agenda favourably when he won the election, but that support waned after a falling-out over the appointment of the country's next spy chief and the economic troubles. 
""They (the military) don't want to be seen as supporting him and be blamed for his failures,"" opposition leader and former Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi told Reuters earlier. ""They've pulled their support.""
Opposition parties say he has failed to revive an economy battered by COVID-19 or fulfil promises to make Pakistan a corruption-free, prosperous nation respected on the world stage.
Reema Omar, South Asia legal adviser to the International Commission of Jurists, said it was an ignominious end to Khan's tenure. On Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), she posted, ""3.5 years marked by incompetence; extreme censorship; assault on independent judges; political persecution; bitter polarisation and division; and finally, brazen subversion of the Constitution.""
Khan's allies blocked the no-confidence motion last week and dissolved parliament's lower house, prompting the country's Supreme Court to intervene and allow the vote to go through.
Khan earlier accused the United States of backing moves to oust him because he had visited Moscow for talks with President Vladimir Putin just after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. Washington rejected the charge.

Muhammad Ali Khan, a legislator from Khan's party, said the prime minister had fought till the end and would return to lead parliament in the future.
Prime Minister Khan had been antagonistic towards the United States throughout his tenure, welcoming the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan last year and urging the international community to work with them.

Lizelle Herrera was arrested on Thursday by the Starr County Sheriff's Office with bond set at $500,000, according to Valley Central.com.
According to a sheriff's office spokesperson, Herrera was arrested after it was learned she ""intentionally and knowingly caused the death of an individual by self-induced abortion,"" the news outlet reported.
The sheriff's office would not confirm the report or return a request for comment.
About 20 people gathered outside the Starr County Jail on Saturday morning in a protest organized by La Frontera Fund, an abortion assistance group in the Rio Grande Valley.
""She miscarried at a hospital and allegedly confided to hospital staff that she had attempted to induce her own abortion and she was reported to the authorities by hospital administration or staff,"" Rickie Gonzalez, the group's founder, said on Saturday. 
The group has not been able to confirm details, she said, but said it is believed to be the first arrest in Texas since a new state law took effect last year.
The law bans abortions at around six weeks, a point when many women do not yet realize they are pregnant, with no exception for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest..

The Texas law enables private citizens to sue anyone who performs or assists a woman in getting an abortion after embryo cardiac activity is detected. Individual citizens can be awarded a minimum of $10,000 for successful lawsuits.
The U.S. Supreme Court in December left the ban in place but additional legal challenges are pending.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Shehbaz Sharif, the person most likely to be Pakistan's next prime minister, is little known outside his home country but has a reputation domestically as an effective administrator more than as a politician.
The younger brother of three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif, Shehbaz, 70, led a successful bid by the opposition in parliament to topple Imran Khan in a no-confidence vote early on Sunday that Khan's supporters tried for hours to block.
Analysts say Shehbaz, unlike Nawaz, enjoys amicable relations with Pakistan's military, which traditionally controls foreign and defence policy in the nuclear-armed nation of 220 million people.
Pakistan's generals have directly intervened to topple civilian governments three times, and no prime minister has finished a full five-year term since the South Asian state's independence from Britain in 1947.
Khan's ouster was a chance to make a fresh star, Shehbaz, the joint opposition candidate to replace Khan told parliament, soon after the vote. ""A new dawn has started... this alliance will rebuild Pakistan,"" he said. 
Shehbaz, part of the wealthy Sharif dynasty, is best known for his direct, ""can-do"" administrative style, which was on display when, as chief minister of Punjab province, he worked closely with China on Beijing-funded projects.
He also said in an interview last week that good relations with the United States were critical for Pakistan for better or for worse, in stark contrast to Khan's recently antagonistic relationship with Washington.
There are still several procedural steps before Sharif can become Pakistan's 23rd prime minister, not including caretaker administrations, although the opposition has consistently identified him as its sole candidate.
If he does take on the role, he faces immediate challenges, not least Pakistan's crumbling economy, which has been hit by high inflation, a tumbling local currency and rapidly declining foreign exchange reserves.
Analysts also say Sharif will not act with complete independence as he will have to work on a collective agenda with the others opposition parties and his brother.
Nawaz has lived for the last two years in London since being let out of jail, where he was serving a sentence for corruption, for medical treatment.
'PUNJAB SPEED'
As chief minister of Punjab, Pakistan's most populous province, Shehbaz Sharif planned and executed a number of ambitious infrastructure mega-projects, including Pakistan's first modern mass transport system in his hometown, the eastern city of Lahore.
According to local media, the outgoing Chinese consul general wrote to Sharif last year praising his ""Punjab Speed"" execution of projects under the huge China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative.
The diplomat also said Sharif and his party would be friends of China in government or in opposition.
On Afghanistan, Islamabad is under international pressure to prod the Taliban to meet its human rights commitments while trying to limit instability there.
Unlike Khan, who has regularly denounced India's Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Sharif political dynasty has been more dovish towards the fellow nuclear-armed neighbour, with which Pakistan has fought three wars.
In terms of his relationship with the powerful military, Sharif has long played the public ""good cop"" to Nawaz's ""bad cop"" - the latter has had several public spats with the army.
Shehbaz was born in Lahore into a wealthy industrial family and was educated locally. After that he entered the family business and jointly owns a Pakistani steel company.
He entered politics in Punjab, becoming its chief minister for the first time in 1997 before he was caught up in national political upheaval and imprisoned following a military coup. He was then sent into exile in Saudi Arabia in 2000.
Shehbaz returned from exile in 2007 to resume his political career, again in Punjab.
He entered the national political scene when he became the chief of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party after Nawaz was found guilty in 2017 on charges of concealing assets related to the Panama Papers revelations.

The Sharif family and supporters say the cases were politically motivated.
Both brothers have faced numerous corruption cases in the National Accountability Bureau, including under Khan's premiership, but Shehbaz has not been found guilty on any charges.

(Reuters) -The first all-private team of astronauts ever launched to the International Space Station (ISS) were welcomed aboard the orbiting research platform on Saturday to begin a weeklong science mission hailed as a milestone in commercial spaceflight.
Their arrival came about 21 hours after the four-man team representing Houston-based startup company Axiom Space Inc lifted off on Friday from NASA's Kennedy Space Center, riding atop a SpaceX-launched Falcon 9 rocket. 
The Crew Dragon capsule lofted into orbit by the rocket docked with the ISS at about 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230 GMT) on Saturday as the two space vehicles were flying roughly 250 miles (420 km) above the central Atlantic Ocean, a live webcast of the coupling from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration showed.
The final approach was delayed for about 45 minutes by a technical glitch with a video feed used to monitor the capsule's rendezvous with the ISS, but it otherwise proceeded smoothly.
The multinational Axiom team, planning to spend eight days in orbit, was led by retired Spanish-born NASA astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria, 63, the company's vice president for business development.
His second-in-command was Larry Connor, a real estate and technology entrepreneur and aerobatics aviator from Ohio designated as the mission pilot. Connor is in his 70s, but the company did not provide his precise age.
Rounding out the Ax-1 crew were investor-philanthropist and former Israeli fighter pilot Eytan Stibbe, 64, and Canadian businessman and philanthropist Mark Pathy, 52, both serving as mission specialists. 
With docking achieved, it took nearly two hours for the sealed passageway between the space station and crew capsule to be pressurized and checked for leaks before hatches were opened to allow the newly arrived astronauts to come aboard the ISS.
The Ax-1 team was welcomed by all seven of the regular, government-paid crew members already occupying the space station: three American astronauts, a German astronaut from the European Space Agency and three Russian cosmonauts.
The NASA webcast showed the four smiling Axiom astronauts, dressed in navy blue flight suits, floating headfirst, one by one, through the portal into the space station, warmly greeted with hugs and handshakes by the ISS crew.
Lopez-Alegria later pinned astronaut wings onto the uniforms of the three spaceflight rookies of his Axiom team -- Connor, Stibbe and Pathy -- during a brief welcome ceremony.
Stibbe is now the second Israeli to fly to space, after Ilan Ramon, who perished with six NASA crewmates in the 2003 space shuttle Columbia disaster. 
SCIENCE FOCUSED
The new arrivals brought with them two dozen science and biomedical experiments to conduct aboard ISS, including research on brain health, cardiac stem cells, cancer and aging, as well as a technology demonstration to produce optics using the surface tension of fluids in microgravity.
The mission, a collaboration among Axiom, Elon Musk's rocket company SpaceX and NASA, has been touted by all three as a major step in the expansion of space-based commercial activities collectively referred to by insiders as the low-Earth orbit economy, or ""LEO economy"" for short.
NASA officials say the trend will help the U.S. space agency focus more of its resources on big-science exploration, including its Artemis program to send humans back to the moon and ultimately to Mars.
While the space station has hosted civilian visitors from time to time, the Ax-1 mission marks the first all-commercial team of astronauts sent to ISS for its intended purpose as an orbiting research laboratory.

The Axiom mission also stands as SpaceX's sixth human spaceflight in nearly two years, following four NASA astronaut missions to the space station and the Inspiration 4 launch in September that sent an all-civilian crew into orbit for the first time. That flight did not dock with the ISS.
Axiom executives say their astronaut ventures and plans to build a private space station in Earth orbit go far beyond the astro-tourism services offered to wealthy thrill-seekers by such companies as Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic, owned respectively by billionaire entrepreneurs Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson.

ISLAMABAD -Imran Khan was ousted as Pakistan's prime minister on Sunday after a no-confidence vote in parliament, bringing to a premature end a tenure marked by a deteriorating economy and signs that he had lost the trust of the powerful military.
Defections from his coalition reflected growing disillusionment among many Pakistanis over high inflation, rising deficits and the perception that Khan had failed to realise his campaign promises of stamping out corruption.
He is unlikely to disappear from the political scene altogether, however.
After the Supreme Court overturned his decision to dissolve parliament and ordered lawmakers to return to the lower chamber, one ally called the move a judicial coup and Khan said he would continue to fight ""till the last ball"".
The 69-year-old joins a lengthening list of elected Pakistani premiers who have failed to see out their full terms; none has done so since independence in 1947.
In 2018, the cricket legend who led Pakistan to its only World Cup win in 1992, rallied the country behind his vision of a corruption-free, prosperous country respected on the world stage.
But the firebrand nationalist's fame and charisma were not enough to keep him in power.
Ironically for a politician once criticised for being under the thumb of the powerful military establishment, his ouster comes amid signs of worsening relations between him and army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa.
The military, which has an outsized role in Pakistan having ruled the country for nearly half of its history and won control over some of its biggest economic institutions, has said it remains neutral towards politics.
At a rally last month, as he was fighting for his political survival, Khan was widely seen to be referring to that position when he said: ""Only animals remain neutral.""
""They (the military) don't want to be seen as supporting him and be blamed for his failures,"" said opposition leader and former Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi. ""They've pulled their support.""
LOFTY PROMISES
Handsome and charismatic, Khan first grabbed the world's attention in the early 1970s as an aggressive fast-paced bowler with a distinctive leaping action. 
He went on to become one of the world's best all-rounders and a hero in cricket-mad Pakistan, and he captained a team of wayward stars from bleak prospects to victory in 1992, urging his players on with the famed battle cry to fight ""like cornered tigers"".
After retiring from cricket that year, he became known for his philanthropy, raising $25 million to open a cancer hospital in memory of his mother, before entering politics with the establishment of his Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), or Pakistan Movement for Justice party, in 1996.
Despite his fame, the PTI languished in Pakistan's political wilderness, not winning a seat other than Khan's for 17 years.
This period had its dramatic moments, however. In 2007, Khan escaped house arrest by leaping over a wall amid a crackdown on opposition figures by then-military ruler General Pervez Musharraf.
In 2011, Khan began drawing huge crowds of young Pakistanis disillusioned with endemic corruption, chronic electricity shortages and crises in education and unemployment.
He drew even greater backing in the ensuing years, with educated Pakistani expatriates leaving their jobs to work for his party and pop musicians and actors joining him on the campaign trail.
His goal, Khan told a gathering of hundreds of thousands of supporters in 2018, was to turn Pakistan from a country with a ""small group of wealthy and a sea of poor"" into an ""example for a humane system, a just system, for the world, of what an Islamic welfare state is"".
That year he was at long last victorious, marking a rare ascension by a sporting hero to the pinnacle of politics. Observers cautioned, however, that his biggest enemy was his own rhetoric, having raised supporters' hopes sky high.
PLAYBOY TO REFORMER
Born in 1952, the son of a civil engineer, Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi described himself as a shy child who grew up with four sisters in an affluent urban Pashtun family in Lahore, Pakistan's second-biggest city.
After a privileged education in Lahore, during which his cricketing skills became evident, he went on to the University of Oxford where he graduated with a degree in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics.
As his cricket career flourished, he developed a playboy reputation in London in the late 1970s.
In 1995, he married Jemima Goldsmith, daughter of business tycoon James Goldsmith. The couple, who had two sons together, divorced in 2004. A second brief marriage to TV journalist Reham Nayyar Khan also ended in divorce.
His third marriage to Bushra Bibi, a spiritual leader whom Khan had come to know during his visits to a 13th century shrine in Pakistan, reflected his deepening interest in Sufism - a form of Islamic practice that emphasises spiritual closeness to God.
Once in power, Khan embarked on his plan of building a ""welfare"" state modelled on what he said was an ideal system dating back to the Islamic world some 14 centuries earlier.
His government made a number of key appointments based on qualifications and not political favours and sought to reform hiring in the bureaucracy and civil service.
Other measures included making it easier for citizens to lodge complaints and the introduction of universal healthcare for the poor in one province with plans to expand the programme nationally. The government also began a project to plant 10 billion trees to reverse decades of deforestation.
To bolster a crippled economy, Khan made a significant U-turn in policy and secured an IMF bailout for Pakistan and set lofty, albeit unmet goals, to expand tax collection.

But his anti-corruption drive was heavily criticised as a tool for sidelining political opponents - many of whom were imprisoned on charges of graft.
Pakistan's generals also remained powerful and military officers, retired and serving, were placed in charge of more than a dozen civilian institutions.

JENIN, West Bank (Reuters) -Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian militant in the occupied West Bank on Saturday during a raid in the hometown of a gunman who had carried out a deadly shooting attack in Tel Aviv, Israeli and Palestinian sources said.
Israeli-Palestinian tensions have soared in the run-up to the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, with both sides warning against escalation. Deadly incidents have since surged. 
The Palestinian Health Ministry said 13 people were wounded in Saturday's exchange of fire in the city of Jenin. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad claimed the man killed as a member of the militant group. 
The Israeli military said its soldiers were conducting a counter-terrorism operation in the area and had opened fire at Palestinian gunmen who shot at them. 
Residents said the troops had surrounded the home of a man who on Thursday night opened fire in a Tel Aviv bar and killed three Israelis. He was shot dead a few hours later in a firefight with Israeli security forces.
Israel's Defence Ministry announced a series of restrictions on the Jenin area on Saturday, prohibiting passage through its main crossing into Israel. Jenin is considered a stronghold of Palestinian militants.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Friday condemned the Tel Aviv attack. 
But he also warned of the dangers of Israeli provocations at Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, a perennial point of tension, days after a far-right Israeli lawmaker visited the compound, holy to both Muslims and Jews. 
Friday's Ramadan prayers ended peacefully despite the tension. 

Thursday's shooting brought the number of people killed in a string of Arab and Palestinian attacks in Israel over the past month to 14, the sharpest rise in such violence in years, which Israeli leaders have described as ""a new wave of terrorism"".
More than 20 Palestinians, many of whom were militants, have been killed by Israeli forces since January and Palestinians in the West Bank have reported a rise in violence by Israeli settlers there.

PARIS (Reuters) -French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday appealed to younger, progressive-leaning voters in his last scheduled interview before Sunday's first-round presidential vote while his forecast lead over far-right candidate Marine Le Pen further evaporated. 
""When it comes to correcting social inequalities at their root, we have begun the work, but we are very far from having succeeded,"" he told online news outlet Brut in a long interview, pledging also to do more to fight climate change. 
Less than 48 hours before the first-round vote, the race for the top job in the euro zone's second-largest economy appeared to be coming down again to the two finalists of the 2017 election. 
But while Macron was still slightly ahead in opinion polls, his re-election no longer appeared to be a foregone conclusion on Friday with Le Pen climbing in surveys, some of them putting her within the margin of error.
A poll on Friday showed the tightest gap ever, with Le Pen seen winning 49% of votes in a likely runoff against the president, her best polling score on record.
The poll, published on BFM TV's website https://www.bfmtv.com/politique/elections/presidentielle/sondage-bfmtv-presidentielle-emmanuel-macron-et-marine-le-pen-desormais-au-coude-a-coude-aux-deux-tours_AN-202204080463.html, showed that Macron had lost a further two points at 26% support and Le Pen had gained two points to 25%.
Hours before candidates and their aides are required by French election law to refrain from making any political statements until election offices close on Sunday evening, there was a growing sense of discomfort among Macron supporters. 
""I think we’ll be OK, but it’s going to be a hard one,"" one minister, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told Reuters.
Campaign insiders say Macron urgently needs to appeal to the broadest possible voter base before the first round, because coming second behind Le Pen on Sunday would give her strong momentum ahead of the runoff.
Le Pen has centered her bid on purchasing power, softening her image and tapping into promising to cut taxes and hike some social benefits, worrying financial markets as she gains momentum in the polls.
Rival far-right candidate Eric Zemmour's radical, outspoken views have helped her look more mainstream and many left-leaning voters have told pollsters that, unlike in 2017, they would not vote in the second round to keep Le Pen out of power.
""They won't necessarily vote for Marine Le Pen, but they don't want to vote for Emmanuel Macron,"" said Jean-David Levy, the deputy director of polling institute Harris Interactive.
""Marine Le Pen has never been so capable of winning a presidential election.""
FEAR 
As some in the president's camp complained about a lack of preparation, his team having spent the bulk of the last months dealing with the war in Ukraine, Macron on Friday voiced regrets about having joined the race much later than his competitors. 
""So it is a fact that I entered (the campaign) even later than I wished,"" Macron said, adding that he retained a ""spirit of conquest rather than of defeat.""
""Who could have understood six weeks ago that all of a sudden I would start political rallies, that I would focus on domestic issues when the war started in Ukraine,"" Macron told RTL radio earlier on Friday. 
Macron, who has spent the past five years wooing the centre-right, suddenly changed course, telling voters he would further shield them from rising living costs and the dangers of Le Pen, whom he labelled a racist.
""Her fundamentals have not changed: It's a racist programme that aims to divide society and is very brutal"", said Macron. 
Le Pen told broadcaster Franceinfo that she was ""shocked"" at the accusation, which she rejected, branding the president ""febrile"" and ""aggressive"".
She said her programme, which includes adding a ""national priority"" principle to the French constitution, would not discriminate against people on grounds of their origin - as long as they held a French passport.
STRATEGIC VOTE 
In his last scheduled interview before Sunday's vote, Macron reiterated his warning against the rising far-right. 
""They play with the fear,"" Macron told online news outlet Brut on Friday in a last-minute appeal to progressive-leaning, younger voters. ""They make short-term minded proposals, the financing of which sometimes is completely unclear."" 
According to opinion polls, around a third of voters have yet to make up their minds, which analysts say often favours candidates with realistic chances to enter the second round as undecided voters tend to go for what the French call a ""useful vote"", meaning voting strategically. 
Other than Macron and Le Pen, this trend is set to favour far-left veteran Jean-Luc Melenchon who - also on an upward trend - ranks third with around 17% of forecast votes. 

Left-wing figure Christiane Taubira, a former minister who dropped out of the race after she failed in her attempt to rally the left behind her, on Friday endorsed Melenchon, saying he was now the left's best hope.

195,"<span>Apr 09, 2022 11:50AM ET</span>","DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran said on Saturday it had imposed sanctions on 24 more Americans, including former Army Chief of Staff George Casey and former President Donald Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani, as months of talks to revive a 2015 nuclear deal have stalled.
Almost all the people named were officials who served during Trump's administration, which imposed sanctions on Iranian officials, politicians and companies and withdrew the United States from Iran's nuclear agreement with world powers.
In a statement carried by local media, the Iranian Foreign Ministry accused the sanctioned Americans - who also included several business figures and politicians - of supporting ""terrorist groups and terrorist acts"" against Iran, and Israel's ""repressive acts"" in the region and against Palestinians.
Eleven months of indirect talks between Iran and the United States in Vienna on salvaging the 2015 deal have stalled as both sides say political decisions are required by Tehran and Washington to settle the remaining issues.
The sanctions let Iranian authorities seize any assets held by the individuals in Iran, but the apparent absence of such assets means the move will likely be symbolic.
Gen. Austin Scott Miller, former commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, former U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and several former ambassadors are among the officials targeted by the new Iranian sanctions.

In a similar move announced in January, Iran imposed sanctions on 51 Americans, many of them from the U.S. military, over the 2020 killing of General Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike in Iraq.
Last year, it imposed sanctions on Trump and several senior U.S. officials.

BUCHA, Ukraine (Reuters) - Before the war in Ukraine, Bohdan Zubchuk's job as a community police officer involved patrolling the quiet streets of Bucha outside Kyiv and dealing with petty crime, while handling minor complaints from residents.
Walking down a street where the bodies of multiple victims were found after Russian troops retreated late last month, the 29-year-old said his hometown and his job would never be the same. 
""We will never forget everything we saw here, this will stay with us for our whole lives,"" he said.
The town became known around the world after images emerged of dead civilians in the streets last week, triggering an international outcry. 
Since the Russians left, Zubchuk said he and his fellow community police officers have been tasked with assisting traumatised survivors with everything from receiving humanitarian aid to checking for unexploded ordnance around town. 
Ukrainian officials say hundreds of civilians have been found dead since the Russians' withdrawal. The deputy mayor of Bucha has said 360 civilians were killed during the Russian occupation. Reuters could not independently verify those figures.
Russia, which has repeatedly denied targetting civilians since the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, has called the allegations that Russian forces executed civilians in Bucha while they occupied the town a ""monstrous forgery"" aimed at denigrating the Russian army.
Reuters has witnessed the remains of five victims in Bucha who were shot through the head. One had his hands tied behind his back. Another his feet tied. Reuters has not been able to independently determine who was responsible.
By Saturday, local workers and residents had already removed the bodies from the street, but there were still patches of ash and charred cement left behind from shelling.
""Every time I patrol this street I'll be thinking back about what happened here,"" Zubchuk said. 
On Friday, forensic investigators began the exhumation of remains from a mass grave in Bucha, carefully lifting bodies out of a muddy trench to examine and identify them. 
In the weeks following the arrival of Russian forces in Bucha, Zubchuk said he and his fellow officers hid in basements and continued working until they fled the city with their families. 
Zubchuk said Russian soldiers were scouring the town for local police officers and men with military experience during the occupation.
AN 'ISLAND' OF CALM 
Elsewhere in Bucha on Saturday, volunteers in bright vests swept up debris and workers in hard hats removed what remained of destroyed Russian tanks with heavy cranes.
Moscow calls the war a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" its neighbour. Ukraine and its allies say this is a baseless pretext for war.
Valerie Lysenko was one of many residents who returned to Bucha to see the damage first hand. Lysenko said she fled her hometown a little over a week after Russian troops rolled into Bucha. 
Before the war Lysenko said she was always inviting her friends to visit Bucha, telling them it was an ""island"" of calm outside of Kyiv with beautiful parks and great infrastructure. 
Now, the name of her town had become synonymous with war and the suffering of civilians.

""The only thing they know (of Bucha) is people dead, people with their hands tied, people tortured, murdered and this just breaks my heart,"" she said.
""If I say I'm in pain it's only one percent of what I'm feeling,"" she said.

(Reuters) - Idaho's top court on Friday temporarily blocked a recently enacted six-week abortion ban from taking effect which is modeled on a Texas law that allows private citizens to sue abortion providers.
The Idaho Supreme Court in a two-page order https://tmsnrt.rs/3upiqzO prevented the law from being implemented until the court could hear a challenge by Planned Parenthood seeking to invalidate the measure, which was to take effect on April 22.
Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, which operates three abortion clinics in the state, last week asked the court to declare it unconstitutional after Republican Governor Brad Little signed it into law.
Idaho was the first state to adopt a law that mirrored the one in Texas which took effect in September. That law allows citizens to sue anyone who performs or assists a woman in obtaining an abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy.
The Idaho law is narrower than Texas's, allowing only relatives of a fetus, not any citizen, to sue medical professionals who provide abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected, usually around six weeks of pregnancy.
The law, SB 1309, provides a minimum award of $20,000 and legal fees for litigants. 
Like the Texas law, it bars state officials from enforcing it, a novel feature that has frustrated opponents trying to challenge the Texas measure in federal court by suing state officials to bar enforcement.
Planned Parenthood argues the Idaho law is unconstitutional under Roe v. Wade, the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal nationwide.

The U.S. Supreme Court now has a 6-3 conservative majority and appeared open during arguments in December to rolling back or overturning Roe v. Wade by allowing a 15-week abortion ban to stand in Mississippi.
Planned Parenthood and Little's office did not respond to requests for comment.

MERSING, Malaysia (Reuters) -A Dutch teenager who disappeared after going diving off the coast of Malaysia is dead, according to his father who was found drifting at sea on Saturday, officials said.
Fourteen-year-old Nathan Renze Chesters and his British father Adrian Peter Chesters, 46, were in a group of four who went missing on Wednesday afternoon on a training dive near Tokong Sanggol, a small island off the southeastern town of Mersing.
The elder Chesters and Alexia Alexandra Molina, 18, from France were rescued by fishermen at around 1 a.m. (1700 GMT on Friday) off Indonesia's Bintan island, southeast of Singapore, and some 100 km (60 miles) south of where they went missing, officials said.
The group's instructor, Kristine Grodem, 35, from Norway, was rescued on Thursday.
Nathan, whose body has not been recovered, was confirmed to have died by his father, ""as he was too weak and could not survive,"" the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency said in a statement. 
Police had said Indonesian authorities would take over the search for the teenager as he had likely drifted into their waters.
""We believe there is a high likelihood that he is no longer in Malaysian waters based on the movement of sea currents, as well as the time and location where the other victims were found,"" Mersing district police chief Cyril Edward Nuing told reporters.
Malaysian assets would be on standby to help, he said.
Grodem earlier told officials the group surfaced about an hour into their dive on Wednesday but could not find their boat.

She was later separated from the others after being caught in strong currents.
The boat operator who took them to the dive site was detained after testing positive for drugs, police said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A judge said on Friday that he needs more information before he can determine whether to jail two men who are accused of impersonating U.S. law enforcement agents and supplying Secret Service personnel with gifts, including rent-free apartments.
""This is a complicated case. I've never seen one quite like it,"" said Magistrate Judge Michael Harvey in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
At issue is whether to detain Washington men Arian Taherzadeh, 40, and Haider Ali, 35, who were arrested this week for impersonating special agents for the Department of Homeland Security.
They are also accused of supplying U.S. Secret Service agents with a variety of gifts - one of whom was assigned to protect President Joe Biden's wife, college professor Jill Biden.
The case has already led to the suspension of four Secret Service agents, who were placed on leave on Monday pending further investigation. 
Two agents were provided apartments that cost more than $4,000 a month, prosecutors said. One agent who was in charge of protecting Jill Biden was offered an assault rifle, according to a sworn statement by an FBI agent.
But at Friday's hearing, the judge expressed frustration over the lack of answers to many of his questions about the defendants' actions, such as how or even whether in fact they paid for the apartments and other gifts, and if they sought anything in return.
""I have not seen any evidence of any demands, extortion, and you're not proffering any,"" Harvey said.
In a search of five Washington apartments associated with the men, prosecutor Joshua Rothstein told the judge that the FBI found a variety of firearms, scopes, brass knuckles, surveillance equipment, hard drives, tools used to manufacture identities and tactical gear, which included vests, gas masks, police lights and other items with law enforcement insignia. 
He said investigators had to use a moving truck to haul away the evidence they collected at the apartment complex, and that the FBI also found documents containing profiles on a variety of people - some of which were shredded and need to be taped back together.
""This is not just two people dressing up for Halloween, your honor. This is very serious,"" Rothstein said.
He argued that both defendants pose a danger to the community. 
Ali, he said, also poses a flight risk because he is apparently a dual citizen of Pakistan and the United States, has bragged about having ties to Pakistan's intelligence agency, and has traveled or sought authorization to travel in recent years to Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, and Egypt.
Taherzadeh, meanwhile, is accused of being in possession of firearms even though he has a prior conviction for domestic violence, and he was denied a concealed carry permit by Washington, D.C. authorities. 
Rothstein added he should also be detained because he had tried to conceal evidence of his crimes by deleting certain social media posts.
Harvey, meanwhile, questioned whether it was reasonable for Taherzadeh to have some tactical gear on hand because he apparently ran a company called U.S. Special Police LLC.
Rothstein acknowledged that Taherzadeh at one point did in fact serve as a special police officer recognized by the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) of Washington but the company no longer had that status.
""They don't have any firearms registered to them, and their license is gone,"" he said.

A spokesperson for the MPD did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The detention hearing is set to resume on Monday when attorneys for both men are expected to argue for their release.

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine and its allies blamed Russia for a missile attack that killed at least 52 people at a train station packed with women, children and the elderly fleeing the threat of a Russian offensive in the east. 
As regional authorities scrambled to continue evacuating the vulnerable, European Union leaders visited Kyiv to offer President Volodymyr Zelenskiy support and expedite Ukraine's path toward EU membership. 
Zelenskiy called the strike in Kramatorsk in the eastern region of Donetsk a deliberate attack on civilians. The town's mayor estimated about 4,000 people were gathered there at the time.
Regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said the station was hit by a Tochka U short-range ballistic missile containing cluster munitions, which explode in mid-air, spraying small lethal bomblets over a wider area. 
Reuters was unable to verify what happened in Kramatorsk. 
Cluster munitions are banned under a 2008 convention. Russia has not signed it but has previously denied using such armaments in Ukraine. 
In Washington, a senior defense official said the United States was ""not buying the denial by the Russians that they weren't responsible"", and believed Kyrylenko correctly identified the type of missile used in the attack.
The Russian defence ministry was quoted by RIA news agency as saying the missiles said to have struck the station were used only by Ukraine's military and that Russia's armed forces had no targets assigned in Kramatorsk on Friday.
Zelenskiy told Finland's parliament in a video address that no Ukrainian troops were at the station. 
""We expect a firm global response to this war crime,"" he said later in a speech posted online.
Moscow has denied targeting civilians since President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what Russia calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" its neighbour. 
Kyiv and Western supporters call that a pretext for an unprovoked invasion that has displaced a quarter of the population and killed or injured thousands.
Ukrainian officials now expect an attempt by Russian forces to gain full control of Donetsk and neighbouring Luhansk, both partly held by Moscow-backed separatists since 2014.
The Kremlin said on Friday the ""special operation"" could end in the ""foreseeable future"" with its aims being achieved through work by the Russian military and peace negotiators..
The White House said it would support attempts to investigate the attack in Kramatorsk. 
Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it showed ""the depths to which Putin's vaunted army has sunk.""
At least 52 people have now died in the incident, Pavlo Kirilenko, head of the Donetsk regional military administration, said in an online post. 
OIL AND GAS 
The wreckage of the missile bore the words ""(this is) for the children"" on its side. Russia has for years accused Ukraine of killing civilians including children with strikes in separatist-held eastern Ukraine.
As Russia concentrates on the east, Ukrainian forces there said late on Friday that they had repelled seven Russian attacks, destroying nine tanks, seven other armored vehicles and two helicopters. Reuters could not independently verify that.
Following a partial Russian pullback near Kyiv, a forensics team on Friday began exhuming a mass grave in the town of Bucha. Authorities say hundreds of dead civilians have been found there.
Visiting the town on Friday, von der Leyen said it had witnessed the ""unthinkable"". 
She later handed Zelenskiy a questionnaire forming a starting point for the EU to decide on membership, telling him: ""It will not as usual be a matter of years to form this opinion but I think a matter of weeks.""
The bloc also overcame some divisions to adopt new sanctions, including bans on the import of coal, wood, chemicals and other products alongside the freezing of EU assets belonging to Putin's daughters and more oligarchs.
Zelenskiy has for weeks urged Brussels to be tougher on Moscow. 
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said a potential oil ban would be discussed on Monday, but called oil sanctions ""a big elephant in the room"" as the continent is heavily reliant on Russian energy. 
Von der Leyen said the EU needed to monitor Russian attempts to circumvent existing sanctions and impose stricter ones if necessary.
Russia has called allegations that its forces executed civilians in Bucha a ""monstrous forgery"" aimed at denigrating its army and justifying more sanctions. 
Russian forces have failed to take any major cities so far, confronted by unexpectedly strong resistance and dogged by what Western intelligence officials say have been logistical, supply and morale problems.
RECOVERING FROM OCCUPATION
Kyiv wants deliveries of heavier armaments and on Thursday secured a new commitment from the NATO alliance to supply a wide range of weapons. 
Slovakia has donated its S-300 air defence system to Ukraine, while Britain will send a further 100 million pounds ($130 million) of military support. 
In Prague, defence sources said the Czech Republic had delivered tanks, rocket launchers, howitzers and infantry fighting vehicles and would ship more.
Residents of areas north of Kyiv were meanwhile still coming to terms with a month-long occupation.

In the village of Yahidne, residents recounted how more than 300 people were trapped for weeks in a school basement, with names of those who did not survive or were killed by soldiers scrawled on the wall. 
Reuters was not able to verify independently the accounts. Reporters saw one freshly dug grave and two bodies wrapped in white plastic sheets.

BOSTON (Reuters) -A former University of Southern California water polo coach was convicted on Friday on charges he accepted more than $200,000 in bribes to help children get into the school as fake athletic recruits in the latest trial to result from the U.S. college admissions scandal.
A federal jury in Boston found Jovan Vavic, 60, guilty on all three charges he faced following an investigation into a nationwide fraud and bribery scheme that ensnared celebrities, corporate executives and coaches at elite universities.
U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani set sentencing for July 20. She at times questioned the government's case, and after the verdict, Koren Bell, a lawyer for Vavic, asked her to schedule a hearing to consider throwing out the verdict.
""We are disappointed but respect the jury's decision and look forward to litigating what we believe are significant legal issues, which we believe should end the case,"" Bell told reporters.
Vavic denied wrongdoing, and his lawyers argued he had simply sought to legitimately raise money for his championship water polo program.
The trial was the second to result from the ""Operation Varsity Blues"" investigation into a scheme in which wealthy parents conspired with California college admissions consultant William ""Rick"" Singer to fraudulently secure placement for their children at elite schools like Stanford and Yale.
Singer pleaded guilty in 2019 to facilitating cheating on college entrance exams and bribing coaches to secure the admission of his clients' children as phony athletes. 
Of 57 people charged, 54 have pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial, including actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman, both client of Singer's.
Prosecutors said that in exchange for bribes, Vavic misled USC admissions officials into believing that unqualified high school students belonged on his championship water polo team.
The money included $100,000 for his water polo program to designate the son of private equity financier John Wilson as a recruit and nearly $120,000 that Singer paid to cover the private school tuition of Vavics' sons, prosecutors said.

Wilson was sentenced to 15 months in prison after being convicted in October with another parent in the first trial to stem from the scandal. He is appealing.
The verdict came as a key figure, former Florida private school counselor Mark Riddell, was sentenced to four months in prison for heling inflate SAT and ACT exam scores for 24 children by secretly taking their tests or correcting their answers while posing as an exam proctor.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Donald Trump's company on Friday won a lawsuit against New York City over its cancellation of a golf course contract after his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. 
The lawsuit filed last June said the contract was improperly terminated by then-New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio's administration. The Trump Organization has managed the Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point in the Bronx borough since it opened in 2015.
In canceling the contract, the city said Trump had a role in inciting the riot and that those actions compromised the golf course's ability to attract ""first-class professional championship golf tournaments."" 
In a decision filed on Friday in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Justice Debra James wrote that the contract had no requirement that the golf course's operator attract professional golf tournaments. James vacated a city ruling upholding the contract's cancellation.
A spokesperson for the New York City Law Department said, ""We are disappointed in the Court's decision, and we are reviewing our legal options.""
The Trump Organization - which operates residences, hotels and golf courses across the world - thanked the court for its ""well-reasoned decision based on law and facts"" and said it was ""thrilled"" to continue to operate and manage Ferry Point. 
Hundreds of Trump supporters attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, interrupting the formal congressional certification of President Joe Biden's election victory. The rampage came after Trump gave an incendiary speech to his followers, repeating false claims of a stolen election.

The case is separate from the New York state attorney general's civil probe and a parallel criminal probe by the Manhattan District Attorney's office into Trump's business practices. Both investigations focus on whether the company misstated the values of its real estate properties to obtain favorable loans and tax deductions.
Trump has denied any wrongdoing and called the investigations politically motivated.

Russia sent tens of thousands of soldiers into Ukraine on Feb. 24 on what it calls a ""special operation"". Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that the losses were ""a huge tragedy for us.""
In the southern garrison town of Vladikavkaz, near the Caucasus mountains, relatives gathered for the funeral of Vitaly Dyadyushko, one of two soldiers buried on Friday in the town's Vostochnoe cemetery.
One weeping woman dressed in black kissed the face of the soldier, who lay in an open casket, flanked by soldiers in dress uniform holding rifles. A Russian Orthodox priest waved incense over the coffin.
Dyadyushko, from the nearby settlement of Arkhonskaya, left behind four sisters and a mother, said local leader Alexander Kusey.
""He was from a large family, and he was the only one who provided for it. I don't know how the girls will do without him now, he helped a lot,"" he said. ""He was not married, he did not have a chance, he was young, very young. It's a shame when the young pass away before their time.""
As the coffin was lowered into the ground, a military brass band played the national anthem and an honour guard fired a salute using automatic weapons.

Shortly afterwards, mourners gathered for another funeral, that of 41-year-old Ruslan Kozayev. One elderly woman, in tears, gently touched his face.
Elsewhere in the cemetery, more than 20 fresh graves for soldiers who died in Ukraine were visible.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) -A SpaceX rocket ship blasted off on Friday carrying the first all-private astronaut team ever launched to the International Space Station (ISS), a flight hailed by industry executives and NASA as a milestone in the commercialization of spaceflight.
The four-man team selected by Houston-based startup Axiom Space Inc for its landmark debut spaceflight and orbital science mission lifted off at 11:17 a.m. EDT (1517 GMT) from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.
Live video webcast by Axiom showed the 25-story-tall SpaceX launch vehicle - consisting of a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket topped by its Crew Dragon capsule - streaking into the blue skies over Florida's Atlantic coast atop a fiery, yellowish tail of exhaust.
Cameras inside the crew compartment beamed footage of the four men strapped into the pressurized cabin, seated calmly in their helmeted white-and-black flight suits as the rocket soared toward space.
Nine minutes after launch, the rocket's upper stage delivered the crew capsule into its preliminary orbit, according to launch commentators. Meanwhile, the rocket's reusable lower stage, having detached from the rest of the spacecraft, flew itself back to Earth and safely touched down on a landing platform floating on a drone vessel in the Atlantic.
Launch webcast commentator Kate Tice described the liftoff as ""absolutely picture-perfect."" One crew member could be heard telling mission control in a radio transmission, ""That was a hell of a ride."" 
If all goes as planned, the quartet led by retired NASA astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria will arrive at the space station on Saturday, after a 20-hour-plus flight, and the autonomously operated Crew Dragon will dock with the orbiting outpost some 250 miles (400 km) above the Earth.
SpaceX, the rocket company founded in 2002 by billionaire Elon Musk, was directing mission control for the flight from its headquarters near Los Angeles.
NASA, besides furnishing the launch site, will assume responsibility for the astronauts once they rendezvous with the space station to undertake eight days of science and biomedical research while in orbit. 
COMMERCIAL SPACEFLIGHT MILESTONE
The mission, representing a partnership among Axiom, SpaceX and NASA, has been touted by all three as a major step in the expansion of commercial space ventures collectively referred to by insiders as the low-Earth orbit economy, or ""LEO economy"" for short.
""We're taking commercial business off the face of the Earth and putting it up in space,"" NASA chief Bill Nelson said before the flight, adding the shift enables his agency to focus more on sending humans back to the moon, to Mars and on other deep space exploration.
Friday's launch also stands as SpaceX's sixth human space flight in nearly two years, following four NASA astronaut missions to the space station and the ""Inspiration 4"" launch in September that sent an all-civilian crew to orbit for the first time. That flight did not dock with ISS.
While the space station has hosted civilian visitors from time to time, the Ax-1 mission will mark the first all-commercial team of astronauts to use ISS for its intended purpose as an orbiting research laboratory.
The four-man Axiom team will be sharing the weightless work environment with seven regular, government-paid ISS crew members - three American astronauts, a German astronaut and three Russian cosmonauts.
Lopez-Alegria, 63, the Spanish-born Axiom mission commander, is also company's vice president for business development. His second-in-command is Larry Connor, a real estate and technology entrepreneur and aerobatics aviator from Ohio designated as the mission pilot. Connor is in his 70s but the company did not provide his precise age.
Rounding out the Ax-1 team are investor-philanthropist and former Israeli fighter pilot Eytan Stibbe, 64, and Canadian businessman and philanthropist Mark Pathy, 52, both serving as mission specialists. The flight makes Stibbe the second Israeli in space, after Ilan Ramon, who perished with six NASA crewmates in the 2003 space shuttle Columbia disaster.
The Axiom crew members may appear to have a lot in common with many of the wealthy passengers taking suborbital rides in recent months aboard the Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic services offered by billionaires Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson, respectively. 
But Axiom said its mission goes far beyond space tourism, with each crew member undergoing hundreds of hours of astronaut training with both NASA and SpaceX.
The Ax-1 team also will be conducting about two dozen science experiments aboard ISS, including research on brain health, cardiac stem cells, cancer and aging, as well as a technology demonstration to produce optics using the surface tension of fluids in microgravity, company executives said. 
Launched to orbit in 1998, the space station has been continuously occupied since 2000 under a U.S.-Russian-led partnership including Canada, Japan and 11 European countries.
NASA has no plans to invest in a new space station once ISS is retired, sometime around 2030. But NASA selected Axiom in 2020 to build a new commercial wing to the orbiting laboratory, currently spanning the length of a football field. 

Plans call for eventually detaching the Axiom modules from the rest of the station when it is ready to be decommissioned. Other private operators are expected to place their own stations in orbit once ISS is out of service.
In the meantime, Axiom said it has contracted with SpaceX to fly three more private astronaut missions to the space station over the next two years.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States believes Russia used a short range ballistic missile to strike a railway station in east Ukraine on Friday, a senior U.S. defense official said. 
Ukraine said at least 50 people were killed and many more wounded in a strike on a station in the city of Kramatorsk that was packed with civilians hoping to flee the threat of a major Russian offensive.
The U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Pentagon believes Russian forces used an SS-21 Scarab missile in the strike but that the motivation for the attack was not clear. 
The SS-21 is the name used by the NATO military alliance for a type of missile known as the Tochka in former Soviet states.
The United States was still analyzing the strike and it was unclear whether cluster munitions were used, the U.S. official said. 
""We are not buying the denial by the Russians that they weren't responsible,"" the official said.
The Russian defense ministry was quoted by RIA news agency as saying the missiles said to have struck the station were used only by Ukraine's military and that Russia's armed forces had no targets assigned in Kramatorsk on Friday. 
Videos posted on social media in recent weeks, which Reuters could not independently verify, appear to show Russian forces in or near Ukraine transporting Tochka missile launchers. 
REDUCED COMBAT POWER
The U.S. defense official said Russia's combat power in Ukraine continued to decline and was somewhere between 80% and 85% of its pre-invasion levels. 
The United States has estimated Russia assembled more than 150,000 troops around Ukraine before its invasion on Feb. 24.
The official said the United States now had indications Moscow has started mobilizing some reservists and could be looking to recruit more than 60,000 personnel. 
Russian forces who had been in the Kyiv region were heading to Belarus and parts of western Russia, such as Belgorod, to be refitted and resupplied, the official said. 

But the Pentagon believes Moscow has yet to solve the logistics problems that have hampered their invasion since its start, the official said. 
""We've seen indications of some units that are literally, for all intents and purposes, eradicated.""

LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) -At least 39 people were killed and 87 wounded in a missile strike on Friday on a railway station in east Ukraine that was packed with women, children and elderly trying to flee fighting, Ukrainian authorities said.
Officials said many of the wounded had lost limbs and were being operated on after the strike in the city of Kramatorsk, which President Volodymr Zelenskiy said was a deliberate attack on civilians using a Tochka U short-range ballistic missile.
""Lacking the strength and courage to stand up to us on the battlefield, they are cynically destroying the civilian population,"" Zelenskiy said in a statement. ""This is an evil that has no limits. And if it is not punished, it will never stop.""
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), and British defence minister Ben Wallace, during a visit to Romania, both denounced the attack.
White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield said there was ""mounting evidence that Russian forces are committing war crimes in Ukraine"" and the U.S. embassy in Ukraine denounced it as ""one more atrocity committed by Russia in Ukraine.""
Zelenskiy later said in a video address to Finland's parliament that no Ukrainian troops had been at the station at the time of the attack. 
Reuters could not verify what happened at the station.
The Russian defence ministry was quoted by RIA news agency as saying the missile said to have struck the station was used only by Ukraine's military and that Russia's armed forces did not have any targets assigned in Kramatorsk on Friday.
Donetsk region governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said Russian forces had fired a Tochka missile containing cluster munitions, but did not share what evidence he had of this. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the allegation.
Russia has previously denied using cluster munitions in Ukraine. 
Banned by the United Nations under a 2008 international convention that Russia is not a party to, cluster munitions are made up of a hollow shell that explodes in mid-air, dispersing dozens or even hundreds of smaller ""bomblets"" over a wide area.
4,000 AT THE STATION, MAYOR SAYS
Kramatorsk Mayor Oleksander Honcharenko estimated that about 4,000 people were at the station at the time of the attack. At least four of those killed were children, he said.
""Some people have lost a leg, others an arm. They are now receiving medical assistance. The hospitals are carrying out about 40 operations simultaneously,"" the mayor said in an online briefing.
MSF said a service of east-to-west medical evacuations of Ukrainian patients by train set up this month was now under threat. 
""It is a big question whether we will be able to go back to evacuate more people,"" the medical charity's emergency coordinator, Christopher Stokes, said.
Governor Kyrylenko published a photograph online showing several bodies on the ground beside piles of suitcases and other luggage. At least one man lay in a pool of blood. Armed police wearing flak jackets walked beside the corpses.
Another photo showed rescue services tackling what appeared to be a fire, with a pall of grey smoke rising into the air.
""The 'Rashists' ('Russian fascists') knew very well where they were aiming and what they wanted: they wanted to sow panic and fear, they wanted to take as many civilians as possible,"" he wrote in an online post.
Reuters could not immediately verify the photos.
CROWDED STATION 
""They (Russian forces) wanted to hit the station,"" Mayor Honcharenko said, a view shared by presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych. 
""It must be understood that such strikes are preceded by a thorough reconnaissance of the target, at least by drones, gunners on the ground - it's too expensive a missile and too difficult and risky to organise such strikes,"" Arestovych said.
""They (Russian forces) could clearly see that they were striking civilians early in the morning, that there were thousands of people trying to evacuate at the station at that time - families, children, the elderly.""
Three trains carrying evacuees were blocked in the same region of Ukraine on Thursday after an air strike on the line, according to the head of Ukrainian Railways. 
Ukrainian officials say Russian forces have been regrouping for a new offensive, and that Moscow plans to seize as much territory as it can in the eastern part of Ukraine known as Donbas bordering Russia.

Local authorities in some areas have been urging civilians to leave while it is still possible, and relatively safe, to do so.
Russia denies targeting civilians in what it calls its ""special military operation"" aimed at demilitarizing and ""denazifying"" Ukraine. The Kremlin's position is rejected by Ukraine and the West as a pretext for an unprovoked invasion.

KYIV (Reuters) -European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said the civilian deaths in the Ukrainian town of Bucha showed the ""cruel face"" of Russia's army and pledged to try to speed Ukraine's bid to become a member of the European Union.
During a visit to Bucha, where forensic investigators started to exhume bodies from a mass grave, von der Leyen looked visibly moved by what she saw in the town northwest of Kyiv where Ukrainian officials say hundreds of civilians were killed by Russian forces.
Russia denies targeting civilians and has called the allegations that Russian forces executed civilians in Bucha while they occupied the town a ""monstrous forgery"" aimed at denigrating the Russian army.
As EU officials were about to arrive in Kyiv, at least 50 people were killed and many more wounded in a missile strike at a railway station packed with civilians fleeing the threat of a major Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine.
At a news conference, von der Leyen condemned what she called ""the cynical behaviour"" of those who wrote ""for our children"" on the weapons found near the scene.
The mayor of the town of Kramatorsk in the eastern region of Donetsk estimated that about 4,000 people were gathered at the station at the time. Reuters was unable to verify what happened in Kramatorsk.
Saying the EU could never match the sacrifice of Ukraine, von der Leyen offered it a speedier start to its bid for bloc membership.
Handing President Volodymyr Zelenskiy a questionnaire which will form a starting point for a decision on membership, she said: ""It will not as usual be a matter of years to form this opinion but I think a matter of weeks.""
Zelenskiy told the same news conference he would come back with answers in a week.
""Russia will descend into economic, financial and technological decay, while Ukraine is marching towards the European future, this is what I see,"" von der Leyen said.
Earlier in Bucha, she told reporters that ""the unthinkable has happened here"".
""We have seen the cruel face of Putin's army. We have seen the recklessness and the cold-heartedness with which they have been occupying the city,"" she said.
The images from Bucha, which was retaken along with other towns north of the capital as Russian forces withdrew to focus efforts on the east of the country, have prompted a renewed effort by Western nations to punish Moscow for the Feb. 24 invasion.
MORAL SUPPORT
Von der Leyen's trip to Kyiv was aimed at offering Zelenskiy moral and some financial support.
She pledged her support for Ukraine to ""emerge from the war as a democratic country"", something, she said, the European Union and other donors would help with. 
Josep Borrell, the EU's chief diplomat, said he hoped the EU could allocate a further 500 million euros ($543 million) to Ukraine for arms purchases in a couple of days.
Zelenskiy says the war is a direct attack on not only Ukraine's existence, but the security of Europe as a whole.
Russia calls its action a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" its neighbour. Before the invasion, Putin had presented Ukraine's tilt in recent years to the West - including its aspiration to join NATO - as a threat to Russia's security.

Zelenskiy has urged Brussels to do more to punish Russia, including banning purchases of Russian oil and gas, and has called on the EU to accept Ukraine as a full member.
Earlier, Borrell said oil sanctions were ""a big elephant in the room"", with some concerns that a move to cut out Russian crude could cause a spike in prices that would be painful to European economies. He said a decision on exports would be raised on Monday in Brussels.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) -Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Friday he would not recognise an opposition government if it succeeded in an attempt to oust him, the latest twist in a political crisis engulfing the nuclear-armed nation. 
The country's parliament will convene on Saturday to vote on Khan as prime minister, an official notice said on Friday, potentially cutting short his term as leader. 
The country's top court ruled late on Thursday that Khan must face the no-confidence vote, which he is widely expected to lose, meaning he would be ousted from office.
A session of the lower house of parliament has been called for 10:30 a.m. (0530 GMT) on Saturday, the speaker's office said in an order paper. The vote, brought by the opposition leader Shehbaz Sharif, is the fourth point on the agenda. 
A former cricket star who took office in 2018, Khan said he was disappointed but accepted the Supreme Court ruling that he had acted unconstitutionally in blocking the no-confidence vote when it was due to take place last Sunday, after which he dissolved parliament and called an election.
He said he would not recognise any opposition government that replaced him. 
""I will not accept an imported government,"" he said in a late-night address, suggesting the move to oust him was part of a foreign conspiracy and calling for peaceful protests on Sunday. 
""I'm ready for a struggle.""
The crisis has threatened political and economic stability in the country of 220 million people, where the military has ruled for half its history. 
Khan, who opposed the U.S.-led intervention in Afghanistan and has developed relations with Russia since becoming prime minister, has accused the United States of supporting a plot to oust him. Washington has dismissed the accusation.
If he loses the no-confidence vote, the opposition will put forward a candidate for prime minister.
Shehbaz Sharif, the younger brother of three-time former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, said after the court ruling that the opposition had nominated him to take over should Khan be ousted.
ENDING UNCERTAINTY?
The rupee currency hit all-time lows on Thursday and foreign exchange reserves tumbled.
Pakistan's central bank hiked its benchmark interest rate by 250 basis points on Thursday, the largest such move since 1996.
Pakistan's sovereign dollar bonds stumbled again on Friday. 
But markets opened higher on Friday on investor hopes the crisis might be easing. The Pakistan Stock Exchange was up 680 points, or 1.5%, and the rupee had rebounded from historic lows.
""The court decision will end political uncertainty and constitutional crisis to a large extent. This will help restore some confidence in the markets,"" Muhammad Sohail of Karachi-based Topline Securities told Reuters. 
""However economic challenges remain and it will be interesting to see how a new set-up takes bold steps to put things in order,"" he added.
The 2029 issue dropped more than 1 cent to 88.6 cents on the dollar while shorter-dated issues traded around the mid-70s cents, Tradeweb data showed. The country's bonds had traded close to par of 100 cents at the start of the year.

The opposition has said it wants early elections but only after delivering Khan a political defeat and passing legislation that it says is needed to ensure the next polls are free and fair.
The election commission has said the earliest it can hold elections is in October, which means any new government will have to deal with pressing economic issues before that.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A leader of the far-right Proud Boys pleaded guilty on Friday to charges related to the attack on the U.S. Capitol, a victory for prosecutors that could bolster their cases against members of the group.
Charles Donohoe, the leader of the group's North Carolina chapter at the time of the Capitol attack, entered the guilty plea during court hearing on Friday in the District of Columbia.
Donohoe admitted to conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, and assaulting and impeding police officers. 
Under U.S. sentencing guidelines, Donohoe faces a likely sentence of around six years in prison, with credit for time already served. He will be sentenced at a later court hearing.
Donohoe agreed to cooperate with prosecutors as they prepare for trial against other Proud Boys defendants. Donohoe, 34, was arrested in March 2021. He has been in custody since last year.
Former President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the seat of Congress that day in a bid to overturn his 2020 election defeat.
Donohoe and other Proud Boys were videotaped leading a crowd toward the Capitol during the riot.
""Mr. Donohoe is charged with interfering in the nation's peaceful transfer of power,"" U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly said during a court hearing in June, adding that the charges are ""gravely serious matters that favor detention.""
An indictment unsealed last month alleged that Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio was deeply involved in recruiting members of the group and directing their actions in the days prior to the Jan. 6 attack.
Tarrio's attorney entered a not guilty plea on his behalf during a hearing on Tuesday.
In a separate hearing on Friday, a different judge declined to postpone a trial scheduled for some members of the Oath Keepers militia group who joined in the Capitol breach. Those defendants are charged with seditious conspiracy, a rarely used law prohibiting attempts to overthrow the government.

Defense lawyers had requested the delay, saying they needed more time to review evidence. But U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta cited his own scheduling conflicts and the need to bring cases to trial.
Lawyers also suggested that all 11 Oath Keepers defendants go on trial at the same time. Mehta said that proposal was logistically impossible in the federal courthouse in the District of Columbia.

YAHIDNE, Ukraine (Reuters) - The names of the dead are scrawled on the peeling wall of a school basement where residents say more than 300 people were trapped for weeks by Russian occupiers in Yahidne, a village north of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. 
Halyna Tolochina, a member of the village council, struggled to compose herself as she went through the list, scribbled in black on the plaster either side of a green door, in the gloomy warren where she said she and hundreds of others were confined. 
To the left of the door were scrawled the seven names of people killed by Russian soldiers. To the right were the 10 names of people who died because of the harsh conditions in the basement, she said. 
""This old man died first,"" Tolochina said, pointing at the name of Muzyka D., for Dmytro Muzyka, whose death was recorded on March 9. ""He died in the big room, in this one.""
She said Muzyka's body lay for a few days in a boiler room until, during a break in shelling, some people were allowed to take the dead to be buried in hastily dug graves in the village cemetery.
(Open https://reut.rs/3rddyMa to see a picture package)
Reuters spoke to seven residents of Yahidne who said that, in total, at least 20 people died or were killed during the Russian occupation. No official death toll has been released by Ukrainian authorities.
Reuters was not able to verify independently the villagers' accounts. Reporters saw one freshly dug grave in a field by the village and two bodies wrapped in white plastic sheets.
The Kremlin did not respond to requests for comment on the events in Yahidne.
The accounts of what happened in the village add to growing testimony from Ukrainian civilians of suffering in the towns around Kyiv during the weeks of occupation by Russian forces following the invasion launched on Feb. 24.
The last victim recorded on the walls of the basement, Nadiya Budchenko, died on March 28, Tolochina said, two days before Russian troops withdrew from the village when their drive toward the Ukrainian capital stalled.
As well as those, mostly elderly, who died of exhaustion in the stifling, cramped conditions, Tolochina named others she said were killed by Russian soldiers, including Viktor Shevchenko and his brother Anatolii, known as Tolya.
""This one was buried in the yard,"" she said, pointing to the name Shevchenko V. ""And this one, they said he is there (buried in the village), somewhere,"" she said, pointing to the name Shevchenko T, whose body has not been recovered. 
Reuters interviewed six other residents, who corroborated Tolochina's account and described being held in the bare concrete rooms of the basement, with around 60 children, little food or water, no electricity and no toilets. 
Ukrainian authorities have accused Russia of war crimes, following the unearthing of mass graves in towns around Kyiv, such as Bucha and Motyzhyn, and the discovery of bodies whose hands had been tied and shot in the head. 
Russia has denied allegations of extra-judicial killings, torture and abuse of civilians. 
The Kremlin has said its forces are not targeting civilians, and accused Ukrainian authorities and the West of fabricating evidence. 
LOOTING
Two of the villagers interviewed by Reuters said that at first some Russian troops, who arrived in early March, behaved well, offering to share their rations and expressing surprise at the village's prosperous appearance. But others began to loot immediately. 
""They started looting, took everything they could grab,"" said 71-year old Petro Hlystun, who witnessed the scene. ""There was a light torch, a tablet computer my son brought from Poland. They took it all."" 
On March 5, the villagers said they were ordered into the school basement where they were to spend the next 25 days, with only brief breaks to relieve themselves or stretch their legs. 
The Russian soldiers told them the confinement was for their own protection, the villagers said.
They described sharing buckets for a toilet and taking turns to sleep in the small, crowded rooms as there was not enough space for everyone to lie down. 
""It was almost impossible to breathe,"" said Olha Meniaylo, an agronomist who said she was in the basement with her 32-year-old son, his wife and their children - a 4-month-old baby boy and an 11-year-old girl. 
She said the Russian soldiers demanded a list of the people in the basement to organise food, and she had tallied 360. Two other villagers said there were more than 300 people.
""For the elderly, it was difficult to stay there in the dark without fresh air, so it was mostly the old who died.""
She said that the first burial - a man killed by the soldiers and four elderly people who died in the basement - took place on March 12. Russian soldiers allowed out some youths to dig shallow graves. 
""As soon as they started digging, there was shelling,"" Meniaylo said. ""The people who were doing the digging had to lie on the dead bodies in the graves to protect themselves from the shelling. My husband was there."" 
A woman who had a cow was led under escort one morning to get some milk for the children. Others were let out occasionally according to the whims of the Russian soldiers. When they returned to their homes, villagers found everything from television sets to women's underwear had been taken. 
BODIES EXHUMED 
    It was not until the Russians started their withdrawal on March 30 that those trapped in the basement ventured out permanently, said 64 year-old Tamara Klymchuk. 
""We opened the door. We were getting out as though we had been born again.""
Yahidne, a small farming village of just five streets, had been a popular place for city people from nearby Chernihiv to take a holiday cottage. It is now a desolate ruin of burned-out houses scattered with cast-off military gear. 
An abandoned tank stands concealed across the road from the school. Ukrainian military, police and explosive disposal technicians sift through the wreckage, exhuming bodies and recovering unexploded ammunition.
    ""We had a very good life,"" said Klymchuk, whose son-in-law was 50-year-old Viktor Shevchenko, one of the two brothers that villagers say were killed by Russian soldiers. ""We never thought such grief would come upon us.""
Viktor, she said, was shot on March 3. He had stayed behind to guard his house after sending his wife and two children to the school basement. 
Russian soldiers had told the villagers that Viktor had been wearing a military uniform and was armed with a shotgun. 

Klymchuk did not witness the killing herself but said she saw Viktor's body after sappers exhumed his body from a mass grave at her request once the town was retaken by Ukrainian forces. He was dressed in blue jeans and a black jacket, she said.
""They just shot him in the head.""

PARIS (Reuters) - In the final days of campaigning before Sunday's first round of the French election, President Emmanuel Macron is making a sudden swerve to the left to mobilise voters who used to vote for the Socialists and who he fears could stay home on voting day. 
Macron, who has spent the past five years wooing the centre-right after demolishing the Socialist party and attracting most of its voters in 2017, is suddenly correcting course, as opinion polls show record abstention could help far-right candidate Marine Le Pen win.
In a meeting on Thursday with readers of Le Parisien newspaper, Macron promised to extend costly measures to shield voters from rising electricity and petrol prices, and said that when companies pay dividends, they should be forced to share some of the profits with employees.
On Friday, he also denied he had veered too much to the right during his first mandate, which saw him cut taxes on the rich, reduce housing allowances and order a police crackdown on ""yellow vest"" protests.
""With what we've done for education and hospitals, I don't have the feeling it's a right-wing platform,"" Macron said on RTL radio, stressing that although he was promising to raise the retirement age, he was also planning to increase the minimum monthly pension to 1,100 euros ($1,196).
Opinion polls show Le Pen, Macron's main rival, closing in on the president with just two days to go before the first round, boosted by her strategy to focus on the cost of living just as record-high prices at the petrol pump and food inflation is making it voters' top concern.
Macron, meanwhile, has been losing ground since mid-March, weighed down by a manifesto that features unpopular conservative measures such as pushing the retirement age to 65 and making some welfare benefits conditional on training. 
""Today, left-wing voters think he is too right-wing,"" Jean-Daniel Levy from polling institute Harris Interractive told Reuters. ""So reassuring the left is an important challenge for the president.""
At a rally last Saturday, Macron made a clear appeal to left-wing voters, urging a round of applause for teachers and nurses, promising to create jobs in hospitals and nursing homes and saying welfare benefits would be conditional on training and not community work as previously suggested.
LE PEN WOOING THE LEFT TOO
Polls show Le Pen has gained ground among poorer left-leaning voters by promising to cut VAT on petrol to 5.5% from 20% and to allow people to retire two years earlier than the current minimum age of 62 if they have started working before 20.
Meanwhile, better-off centre-left voters say they could abstain this time if Macron faces Le Pen in the April 24 runoff vote, depriving him of what is known as the ""republican front"", whereby mainstream voters end up rallying behind any candidate facing the far-right.
The most recent Ifop poll shows a tight race between Macron at 52% and Le Pen's 48% if those two face each other in the runoff.
Campaign insiders also say Macron needs to appeal to the left before the first round, because coming second behind Le Pen on Sunday would give her strong momentum ahead of the runoff.
In opinion polls on the first round, support for Macron has dropped from a peak of 31.5% in March in the first days of the war in Ukraine to 26.5% now, while backing for Le Pen has surged from 16% to 24%.
""Macron needs votes from the left as soon as the first round,"" Juliette Meadel, a former Socialist minister who has joined his camp, told Reuters. ""He needs these voters more than ever this year because there's momentum behind Le Pen and doubts about his programme."" 
Macron has started to attack Le Pen on the sincerity of her social policies.

""I think Marine Le Pen's social programme is a lie. Because she can't fund it,"" he told readers of Le Parisien. ""Marine Le Pen's social policies are funded with mock currency.""

As regional authorities sought to rush civilians out of harm's way, European Union leaders arrived in Kyiv to offer Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy support and reassurance that there will be a path to EU membership for Ukraine.
FIGHTING
* British military intelligence said Russian forces were shelling cities in the east and south and had advanced further south from the city of Izyum, which is under their control. Reuters could not immediately verify the report.
* Capturing Mariupol remains the main focus of Russian troops and Russian battalions are blockading and bombarding the northeastern city of Kharkiv, the Ukrainian military said.
* The United States will send new weapon systems to Ukraine, after NATO foreign ministers agreed to accelerate arms deliveries. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned of a war that could last months or even years.
* The Kremlin said on Friday that Russian operations in Ukraine could end in the ""foreseeable future"" since its aims were being achieved and work was being carried out by both the Russian military and Russian peace negotiators. 
HUMAN IMPACT
* Forensic investigators began exhuming a mass grave in the town of Bucha on Friday, laying out the bodies of civilians who Ukrainian officials say were killed during a Russian invasion in what amounted to war crimes. [
* The names of the dead are scrawled on the peeling wall of a school basement where residents say more than 300 people were trapped for weeks by Russian occupiers in Yahidne, a village north of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.
* Ukraine said it aimed to establish up to 10 humanitarian corridors on Friday to evacuate at least 160,000 trapped civilians, but civilians trying to flee besieged Mariupol will have to use private vehicles. 
DIPLOMACY, ECONOMY
* The United Nations General Assembly voted to suspend Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council and voiced grave concern at the continuing human rights and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. Russia called the move illegal.
* The European Union on Friday formally adopted its fifth package of sanctions against Russia, including bans on the import of coal, wood, chemicals and other products.
* Britain added Vladimir Putin's daughters to its sanctions list on Friday, mirroring moves by the United States, in what it said was an effort to target the lifestyles of those in the Russian president's inner circle.

(Reuters) -News of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk taking a board seat at Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) has some Twitter employees panicking over the future of the social media firm's ability to moderate content, company insiders told Reuters. 
Within hours of the surprise disclosure this week that Musk, a self-described ""free speech absolutist,"" acquired enough shares to become the top Twitter shareholder, political conservatives began flooding social media with calls for the return of Donald Trump. The former U.S. president was banned from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter after the Jan 6. Capitol riot over concerns around incitement of violence. 
""Now that @ElonMusk is Twitter's largest shareholder, it's time to lift the political censorship. Oh… and BRING BACK TRUMP!,"" tweeted Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebert on Monday. 
Despite Twitter's reiteration this week that the board does not make policy decisions, four Twitter employees who spoke with Reuters said they were concerned about Musk's ability to influence the company's policies on abusive users and harmful content. 
With Musk on the board, the employees said his views on moderation could weaken years-long efforts to make Twitter a place of healthy discourse, and might allow trolling and mob attacks to flourish. 
In the wake of Trump's ban from Facebook and Twitter, the billionaire tweeted that many people would be unhappy with U.S. tech companies acting ""as the de facto arbiter of free speech.""
MUSK'S INTENTIONS
Musk has not articulated what he wants to do as a new board member but he has telegraphed his intentions with his Twitter activity. A week before Musk disclosed a 9.1% stake in Twitter, he polled his 80 million followers on whether the site adhered to the principle of free speech, and the majority voted 'no.'
The employees, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, point to Musk's history of using Twitter to attack critics. In 2018, Musk came under fire for accusing a British diver who had helped rescue children trapped in a cave in Thailand of being a pedophile. 
Musk won a defamation case https://www.reuters.com/article/us-musk-lawsuit-idINKBN1YA13U brought by the diver in 2019. 
When asked for comment, a Twitter spokesperson repeated a statement from Tuesday that the board ""plays an important advisory and feedback role across the entirety of our service,"" but daily operations and decisions are made by Twitter's management and employees. 
""Twitter is committed to impartiality in the development and enforcement of its policies and rules,"" the spokesperson said.
Some employees that Reuters spoke to were not so sure about the company's commitment to this. 
""I find it hard to believe (the board) doesn't have influence,"" said one employee. ""If that's the case, why would Elon want a board seat?"" 
But other employees Reuters spoke to said that Musk's involvement could help quicken the pace of new feature and product launches, and provide a fresh perspective as an active user of Twitter.
Neither Tesla nor Musk responded to requests for comment.
Twitter's board figures prominently in discussions within Twitter, more so than at other tech companies, one employee said. That is because unlike Meta Platforms Inc, where founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg controls the company through a dual class share structure, Twitter only has a single class of shares, making it more vulnerable to activists like Musk. Teams within Twitter often consider how to communicate a strategy or decision to the board, for instance, the employee said.
On Thursday, Musk tweeted https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1511982702819520512?s=20&t=icqGAAlqCZdXjrowWZk0zw an image from 2018 of him smoking weed on the Joe Rogan podcast on Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), with the text: ""Twitter's next board meeting is going to be lit.""
TRUMP'S RETURN?
One employee familiar with the company's operations said there were no current plans to reinstate Trump. A Twitter spokesperson said there were no plans to reverse any policy decisions. 
But a veteran auto analyst who covers Musk's operating style at Tesla said such a decision may only be a matter of time. 
""If Donald Trump was actually rich, he would have liked to have done the same thing but he couldn't afford it. So Elon is doing what Trump would have liked to have done,"" said Guidehouse Insights analyst Sam Abuelsamid. 
""I wouldn't be surprised"" if Twitter restores Trump's account now that Elon owns nearly 10% of the company,"" he said.
Longer term, employees said Musk's involvement may change Twitter's corporate culture, which they say currently values inclusivity. Musk has faced widespread criticism for posting memes that mocked transgender people and efforts to stem the spread of COVID-19, and for comparing some world leaders to Hitler.

Several employees were alarmed by the warm welcome Musk received from Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal and cofounder Jack Dorsey, which prompted them to hit the job market this week.
""Some people are dusting off their resumes,"" one person said. ""I don’t want to work for somebody (like Musk).""

Some 500,000 of the 1.4 million homes and businesses in the U.S. territory were without power, according to a PowerOutage.US tally.
The outage forced public schools to cancel classes for the second day and some courts to suspend work on Friday. Some 162,000 customers, out of a total of 1.3 million, were without drinking water service due to the blackout, media reported on the island.
""7 am on Friday and we are still without power in Laguna Gardens. I officially lost all my food, couldn't work, and what little hope I had turned to courage,"" said a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) user who goes by the name of Nicole Shantei, referring to a neighborhood in San Juan.
Puerto Rico's LUMA Energy reported late on Thursday that work to restore power for 380,000 customers was expected well into Friday, given the massive size and scope of the outage.
""We continue to work hard to restart generation units and high voltage lines,"" it said.
The exact cause of the island-wide power outage was unknown, LUMA said, but a failed circuit breaker at Costa Sur power plant may be to blame.
The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority posted a video on Twitter of a fire at the plant in Guayanilla, a town in southwest Puerto Rico, on Wednesday night.
Hurricane Maria, which wiped out power to all of Puerto Rico in 2018, exposed the fragile state of the electrical grid on the island of 3.3 million people.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Dozens of Chinese firms have built software that uses artificial intelligence to sort data collected on residents, amid high demand from authorities seeking to upgrade their surveillance tools, a Reuters review of government documents shows.
According to more than 50 publicly available documents examined by Reuters, dozens of entities in China have over the past four years bought such software, known as ""one person, one file"". The technology improves on existing software, which simply collects data but leaves it to people to organise.
“The system has the ability to learn independently and can optimize the accuracy of file creation as the amount of data increases. (Faces that are) partially blocked, masked, or wearing glasses, and low-resolution portraits can also be archived relatively accurately,” according to a tender published in July by the public security department of Henan, China’s third-largest province by population.
Henan's department of public security did not respond to requests for comment about the system and its uses.
The new software improves on Beijing's current approach to surveillance. Although China's existing systems can collect data on individuals, law enforcement and other users have been left to organise it.
Another limitation of current surveillance software is its inability to connect an individual’s personal details to a real-time location except at security checkpoints such as those in airports, according to Jeffrey Ding, a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford's Center for International Security and Cooperation.
One person, one file ""is a way of sorting information that makes it easier to track individuals,"" said Mareike Ohlberg, a Berlin-based senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund.
China's Department of Public Security, which oversees regional police authorities, did not respond to a request for comment about one person, one file and its surveillance uses. Besides the police units, 10 bids were opened by Chinese Communist Party bodies responsible for political and legal affairs. China's Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission declined to comment.
The tenders examined by Reuters represent a fraction of such efforts by Chinese police units and Party bodies to upgrade surveillance networks by tapping into the power of big data and AI, according to three industry experts interviewed for this story.
According to government documents, some of the software's users, such as schools, wanted to monitor unfamiliar faces outside their compounds.
The majority, such as police units in southwestern Sichuan province's Ngawa prefecture, mainly populated by Tibetans, ordered it for more explicit security purposes. The Ngawa tender describes the software as being for ""maintaining political security, social stability and peace among the people.""
Ngawa's department of public security did not respond to requests for comment.
Beijing says its monitoring is crucial to combating crime and has been key to its efforts to fight the spread of COVID-19. Human rights activists such as Human Rights Watch say that the country is building a surveillance state that infringes on privacy and unfairly targets certain groups, such the Uyghur Muslim minority.
The Reuters review shows that local authorities across the country, including in highly populated districts of Beijing and underdeveloped provinces like Gansu, have opened at least 50 tenders in the four years since the first patent application, 32 of which were opened for bidding in 2021. Twenty-two tech companies, including Sensetime, Huawei, Megvii, Cloudwalk, Dahua, and the cloud division of Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), now offer such software, according to a Reuters review.
Sensetime declined to comment. Megvii, Cloudwalk, Dahua, and the cloud division of Baidu did not respond to requests for comment.
Huawei said in a statement that a partner had developed the one person, one file application in its smart city platform. The company declined to comment on the patent applications.
""Huawei does not develop or sell applications that target any specific group of people,"" the company said.
The documents Reuters reviewed span 22 of China's 31 main administrative divisions, and all levels of provincial government, from regional public security departments to Party offices for a single neighbourhood.
The new systems aim to make sense of the giant troves of data such entities collect, using complex algorithms and machine learning to create customised files for individuals, according to the government tenders. The files update themselves automatically as the software sorts data.
A wide range of challenges can complicate implementation, however. Bureaucracy and even cost can create a fragmented and disjointed nationwide network, three AI and surveillance experts told Reuters.
Reuters found announcements for successful bids for more than half of the 50 procurement documents analysed, with values between a few million yuan and close to 200 million yuan. 
SYSTEM UPGRADE
China blanketed its cities with surveillance cameras in a 2015-2020 campaign it described as ""sharp eyes"" and is striving to do the same across rural areas. The development and adoption of the ""one person, one file"" software began around the same time.
Ohlberg, the researcher, said the earliest mention she had seen of one person, one file was from 2016, in a 200-page surveillance feasibility study by Shawan county in Xinjiang, for acquiring a computer system that could “automatically identify and investigate key persons involved in terrorism and (threatening social) stability.” A Shawan county official declined to comment.
In 2016, China's domestic security chief at the time, Meng Jianzhu, wrote in a state-run journal that big data was the key to finding crime patterns and trends. Two years later, the system was referenced in a speech to industry executives given by Li Ziqing, then-director of the Research Center for Biometrics and Security Technology of the state-run Chinese Academy of Sciences. Li also was chief scientist at AuthenMetric, a Beijing-based facial recognition company. Neither the research centre nor AuthenMetric responded to requests for comment.
""The ultimate core technology of big data’s (application to) security is one person, one file,"" Li said in the 2018 speech at an AI forum in Shenzhen, according to a transcript of the speech published by local media and shared on AuthenMetric’s WeChat public account. 
The Party's Political and Legal Affairs Commission, which Meng led in 2016, declined to comment. Meng could not be reached for comment. Li did not respond to a request for comment.
The industry developed quickly. By 2021, Huawei, Sensetime, and 26 other Chinese tech companies had filed patent applications with the World Intellectual Property Organization for file archiving and image clustering algorithms.
A 2021 Huawei patent application for a ""person database partitioning method and device"" that mentioned one person, one file said that ""as smart cameras become more popular in the future, the number of captured facial images in a city will grow to trillions per year”. 
    SAFE CITIES 
The 50 tenders Reuters analysed give varying amounts of detail on how the software would be used.
Some mentioned ""one person, one file"" as a single entry on a list of needed items for surveillance systems. Others gave detailed descriptions. 
Nine of the tenders indicated the software would be used with facial recognition technology that could, the documents specified, identify whether a passerby was Uyghur, connecting to early warning systems for the police and creating archives of Uyghur faces.
One tender published in February 2020 by a Party organ responsible for an area in the southeastern island province of Hainan, for instance, sought a database of Uyghur and Tibetan residents to facilitate “finding the information of persons involved in terrorism.”
The Hainan authorities did not respond to a request for comment.

More than a dozen tenders mention the need to combat terrorism and “maintain stability”, a catch-all term that human rights activists say is often used to mean repressing dissent. 
At least four of the tenders said the software should be able to pull information from the individual's social media accounts. Half of the tenders said the software would be used to compile and analyse personal details such as relatives, social circles, vehicle records, marriage status, and shopping habits.

(Reuters) - Alabama lawmakers passed a bill on Thursday that would criminalize gender-affirming healthcare for transgender youth, with a threat of 10 years in prison for medical providers.
The legislation, passed 66-28 by the state's House of Representatives on the last day of the legislative session, is the latest in a flurry of measures in Republican-led states dealing with transgender youth.
The American Civil Liberties Union called it the first bill of its kind to make healthcare for transgender youth a felony and said it would challenge the bill in court if Republican Governor Kay Ivey signed it into law. 
The bill http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/ALISON/SearchableInstruments/2022RS/PrintFiles/SB184-eng.pdf would make it a felony punishable with up to 10 years in prison to provide medical care including hormone treatment, puberty blockers and gender reassignment surgery to minors.
Democrats in the minority tried to fight the bill in part by arguing it contradicted Republican principles on the role of government.
""This is not small government; this is not a conservative bill,"" Democratic Representative Neil Rafferty told the chamber.
But Republican Representative Wes Allen likened the initiative to laws that prevent minors from getting tattoos or buying nicotine products. 
""We make decisions in this body all the time that are to protect children from making decisions that could permanently harm them,"" Allen said.
Ivey has not said whether she would sign the bill, but last year she signed one banning transgender athletes from school sports. Ivey's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The bill would also compel school personnel to disclose to the parent or legal guardian that a ""minor's perception of his or her gender or sex is inconsistent with the minor's sex.""
Last week, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey signed a bill banning irreversible gender reassignment surgery for minors. 
Mainstream medical and mental health professionals say gender-affirming care saves lives by reducing the risk of depression and suicide. Gender-reassignment surgery for people under 18 is extremely rare and would take place only after years of treatment in cases where the patient's wishes are unwavering, according to medical experts. 
The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly opposed the bill and urged Ivey to veto it.
""This legislation targets vulnerable young people and puts them at great risk of physical and mental harm,"" Mark Del Monte, the academy's chief executive, said in a statement. ""Criminalizing evidence-based, medically necessary services is dangerous.""
The Alabama Senate has also passed a bill that would require students in public schools to use bathrooms or changing rooms that match the gender on their original birth certificates. An amendment was attached to the bill, which now has to go back to the House for a vote, prohibiting classroom discussion on sexual orientation or gender identity in certain grades. 

Transgender rights have emerged as one of the issues at the forefront in the culture wars ahead of the November mid-term congressional elections. Lawmakers have introduced hundreds of bills across state legislatures, the majority of them dealing with trans youth.
Many Republicans and conservative activists promote the laws as safeguards for children and parental rights. Opponents, including Democrats and LGBTQ+ organizations, say the legislation is harmful, unnecessary and unfairly targeting vulnerable and underrepresented communities.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Ketanji Brown Jackson was confirmed by the Senate on Thursday as the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court in a milestone for the United States and a victory for President Joe Biden, who made good on a campaign promise as he seeks to infuse the federal judiciary with a broader range of backgrounds.
The vote to confirm the 51-year-old federal appellate judge to a lifetime job on the nation's top judicial body was 53-47, with three Republicans - Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney - joining Biden's fellow Democrats. A simple majority was needed, as Jackson overcame Republican opposition in a Supreme Court confirmation process that remains fiercely partisan.
Jackson will take the 83-year-old Breyer's place on the liberal bloc of a court with an increasingly assertive 6-3 conservative majority. Breyer is due to serve until the court's current term ends - usually in late June - and Jackson would be formally sworn in after that. Jackson served early in her career as a Supreme Court clerk for Breyer.
Biden hosted Jackson at the White House to watch the vote on television, posting on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) a selfie he took of them smiling after Senate acted. 
""Judge Jackson's confirmation was a historic moment for our nation. We've taken another step toward making our highest court reflect the diversity of America. She will be an incredible Justice, and I was honored to share this moment with her,"" Biden wrote on Twitter.
The two will make remarks on Friday at an event celebrating her confirmation.
Of the 115 people who have served on the Supreme Court since its 1789 founding, all but three have been white. It has had two Black justices, both men: Clarence Thomas, appointed in 1991 and still serving, and Thurgood Marshall, who retired in 1991 and died in 1993. Current Justice Sonia Sotomayor is the only Hispanic ever to serve. 
Jackson will become the sixth woman justice ever. For the first time, four women will serve on the court together.
Presidential nominations to the Supreme Court have become a flashpoint in American politics. The court wields great influence in shaping American policy on hot-button issues including abortion, guns, voting laws, LGBT rights, religious liberty, the death penalty and race-based practices. 
Before Jackson joins it, the Supreme Court is due to rule in major cases including one that could overturn the landmark 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide and another that could expand gun rights.
Democrat Raphael Warnock, one of the Senate's three Black members, said in the debate before the vote: ""I'm the father of a young Black girl. I know how much it means for Judge Jackson to have navigated the double jeopardy of racism and sexism to now stand in the glory of this moment. ... Seeing Judge Jackson ascend to the Supreme Court reflects the promise of progress on which our democracy rests. What a great day it is in America.""
REPUBLICAN CRITICISM
Mitch McConnell, the Senate's top Republican, criticized Jackson in the debate, calling her the choice of the ""radical left"" and saying her ""disturbing"" judicial record included injecting personal policy biases in rulings and treating convicted criminals as gently as possible in sentencing.
Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the first Black woman to hold that post after Biden selected her as his 2020 election running mate, presided over the vote.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer noted the country's legacy of slavery and past struggles to bring rights to women and Black Americans, adding: ""Today we are taking a giant, bold and important step on the well-trodden path toward fulfilling our country's founding promise.""
During March confirmation hearings, Jackson said she would bring to the Supreme Court her life experiences and perspectives including time as a judge, a court-appointed lawyer for criminal defendants who could not afford an attorney, a member of a federal commission on criminal sentencing and ""being a Black woman, lucky inheritor of the civil rights dream.""
Biden has aimed to bring more women and minorities and a wider range of backgrounds to the federal judiciary. Jackson's appointment fulfilled a pledge Biden made during the 2020 presidential campaign to name a Black woman to the Supreme Court.

The other women to have served on the Supreme Court include current Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Elena Kagan and Sotomayor, the retired Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died in 2020. 
Biden appointed Jackson last year to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit after she spent eight years as a federal district judge. Like the three conservative justices appointed by Biden's Republican predecessor Donald Trump, Jackson is young enough to serve for decades in the lifetime job.

WASHINGTON/UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) -China's abstentions on U.N. votes to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine are a ""win"", said the U.S. envoy to the United Nations, underscoring how Beijing's balancing act between its partner Russia and the West may be the best outcome for Washington.
Beijing has refused to call Russia's actions in Ukraine an invasion and has repeatedly criticized what it says are illegal Western sanctions to punish Moscow. 
But U.S.-led pressure on China, including the specter of secondary sanctions should it provide material support for Russia's war, appears to be helping keep Beijing on the fence over the conflict.  
China abstained from two non-binding U.N. General Assembly votes last month that criticized Russia for the ongoing war and its humanitarian costs. 
""That is a win when China abstains. We'd love them to vote yes, but an abstention is better than them voting no,"" U.N. ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told Reuters. 
""I'm not sure they expected that Russia would go this far. They continue to support Russia publicly, but I do get a sense of discomfort,"" she said.
China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun, responding to Thomas-Greenfield's remarks, said: ""The whole world is not comfortable. Do you think that anyone should be comfortable with this crisis?""
China and Russia declared a ""no-limits"" strategic partnership several weeks before the Feb. 24 invasion and have been forging closer energy and security ties in recent years to push back on the United States and the West.
In a tilt toward Moscow, China's leader Xi Jinping has discussed the conflict in Ukraine during calls with leaders of many major countries, but has yet to offer such diplomatic validation to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
While Beijing has given some humanitarian aid to Ukraine – about $2.37 million worth of items such as blankets and baby formula – those contributions are outmatched by much smaller donors.
Analysts say they have yet to see any major indication that China is violating strict Western sanctions on Russia, but there are strong signs that China is hedging its bets, particularly on the economic front. 
China's state oil refiners are avoiding new oil contracts with Russia despite steep discounts, sources told Reuters.
State-run Sinopec (NYSE:SHI), Asia's biggest oil refiner, also suspended talks for a major petrochemical investment and a gas marketing venture in Russia.
Sanctions on Russia should give China a ""good understanding"" of the consequences it could face if it provides material support to Moscow, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman warned on Wednesday.
China appears unlikely to back away from its tacit diplomatic support for Russia – even in light of graphic images showing widespread civilian killings in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, north of the capital Kyiv. Moscow rejects Western charges of war crimes.
Zhang said China did not want to be dragged into the crisis.
""The focus is really for the parties concerned to find a solution as quick as possible, instead of trying to look at some indirect party, and to drag those indirect parties into this crisis,"" Zhang told Reuters.
'PLAY BOTH SIDES'
China, which itself has been accused by Washington of committing genocide towards its Uyghur population, voted no on Thursday on a resolution that suspended Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council.
Before the vote, Zhang called it a ""hasty move"" that forced countries to choose sides.
U.S. officials appear to be expecting that China's support for Russia won't violate major red lines set by the United States and the European Union, which together represent a quarter of China's global trade, compared to just 2.4% for Russia, according to the EU. 
""We are likely to continue to see some amount of Chinese support for the Russian economy, but a dance that Beijing tries to do to keep up its economic ties to the European Union in particular, but also to the United States,"" Mira Rapp-Hooper, director for the Indo-Pacific at the White House National Security Council, said in March. 
U.S. President Joe Biden has leaned heavily on allies to help make the case - as he did in a call with Xi last month - that there would be consequences for supporting Russia.
Following a virtual summit between EU and Chinese leaders last week, China's foreign ministry said it was not deliberately circumventing sanctions.  
It has also denied being asked for, or supplying, any military support for Russia. 
Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told a recent online forum there was little indication that Chinese banks were supporting sanctioned Russian financial institutions, and that some Chinese firms were selling less to Russia, from cell phones to car parts.
Experts say the United States' ability to monitor and track small-scale Chinese sanctions violations is limited, as shipments could be driven over land borders where U.S. monitoring does not occur. They say preventing Chinese firms from large sanctioned trade with Russia should be the goal.

""The realists are going to win this one and understand that the Chinese are going to play both sides toward the middle and they'll take what few victories they can get,"" said Donald Pearce, a former export control attaché at the U.S. embassy in Moscow who works with Torres Trade Advisory. 
""If you've got at least a tacit admission that China respects the idea that the U.S. could start imposing secondary sanctions, that may be enough,"" Pearce said.

ADEN (Reuters) -Yemen's president delegated power to a presidential council and dismissed his deputy on Thursday as Saudi Arabia moved to strengthen an anti-Houthi alliance amid U.N.-led efforts to revive negotiations to end the seven-year war.
Riyadh announced $3 billion in financial aid to the Saudi-backed government after the announcement by President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. It called for talks with the Houthis who control the north and have been battling the Saudi-led coalition. 
Yemen's warring sides, in a major breakthrough, had agreed on a two-month truce that began on Saturday. The deal eased a coalition blockade on areas held by the Houthis, who ousted Hadi's government from the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014.
The ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council met on Thursday and expressed their support for the presidential council and starting negotiations with Iran-aligned Houthis under U.N. supervision ""to reach a final and comprehensive political solution."" 
""I irreversibly delegate to the Presidential Leadership Council my full powers in accordance with the constitution and the Gulf Initiative and its executive mechanism,"" Hadi, who is based in Riyadh, said on state television.
Hadi took the helm of a crumbling state a decade ago in a Gulf-backed transition plan after protests that brought down President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was later killed.
Analysts say the new council aims to unify anti-Houthi ranks by giving more parties a seat at the table. With Hadi effectively out of the equation and his controversial deputy dismissed, the hope is the Houthis may also be more amenable.
Houthi chief negotiator Mohammed Abdulsalam criticised the move as a farce and a ""desperate attempt to restructure the ranks of mercenaries to push them towards further escalation.""
Riyadh, which has struggled to exit the war in Yemen, urged the council to negotiate with the Iran-aligned Houthis under U.N. auspices ""for a final and comprehensive solution"".
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed the council's formation and said Washington ""remains committed to helping advance a durable, inclusive resolution to the conflict in Yemen.""
The United Arab Emirates also welcomed the council formation saying it hopes the step contributes to achieving a political solution in Yemen.
CLOSING RANKS
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was shown in a video on state media meeting with the eight-member council, led by Rashad Al-Alimi, who has close ties with both Riyadh and major Yemeni bloc the Islamist Islah party.
The new body includes several leaders of United Arab Emirates-backed factions, including Aidarous al-Zubaidi of the separatist Southern Transitional Council, which distrusts Islah and vied with Hadi's government for control of Aden.
""This is an attempt, perhaps a last ditch effort, to reconstitute something resembling unity within the anti-Houthi alliance. The problem is that it is unclear how these various individuals, many of whom have diametrically opposing views, can work together,"" Gregory Johnsen, a former member of the U.N. Panel of Experts on Yemen, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Dismissed Vice President Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, an Islamist-leaning general, is resented by the Houthis for military campaigns in their northern stronghold and by some southerners for his role in the 1994 north-south civil war.
Sanaa resident Maamr Kabody told Reuters he hoped the new council would ""seek peace and cooperation ... but we will wait and see.""
ECONOMIC AID
The war has killed tens of thousands, devastated the economy and pushed Yemen to the brink of famine. The central bank split into rival authorities and the riyal's depreciation in the government-held south has sparked protests.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE will each inject $1 billion into Yemen's central bank and the kingdom will grant an additional $1 billion for oil derivatives and development.
Riyadh, which last deposited funds into the central bank in 2018, also said it would give $300 million to the U.N. aid response, which in March raised less than a third of the $4.27 billion sought.

The United Nations is pushing for measures to stabilise the economy and launch inclusive political negotiations. 
The conflict is widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system and foreign aggression.

Some 400,000 of the 1.4 million homes and businesses in the U.S. territory were without power on Thursday morning, according to a Reuters tally.
Puerto Rico's LUMA Energy may take until well into Thursday or even Friday to restore power to some areas, given the massive size and scope of the outage, the power company said. 
""LUMA teams are responding and working to restore service as quickly as possible,"" it said. 
The exact cause of the island-wide power outage was unknown, LUMA said, but a failed circuit breaker at Costa Sur power plant may be to blame. 
The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority posted a video on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) of a fire at the plant in Guayanilla, a town in southwest Puerto Rico, on Wednesday night. 
Hurricane Maria, which wiped out power to all of Puerto Rico in 2018, exposed the fragile state of the electrical grid on the island of 3.3 million people. 
""I urge all our people to remain calm,"" Puerto Rico Governor Pedro Pierluisi said in a Tweet on Thursday.

LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Russia on Thursday appeared to give the most damning assessment so far of its invasion, describing the ""tragedy"" of mounting troop losses and the economic hit as Ukrainians were evacuated from eastern cities before an anticipated major offensive.
Moscow's six-week long incursion has seen more than 4 million people flee abroad, killed or injured thousands, left a quarter of the population homeless, turned cities into rubble and led to Russia's near total isolation on the world stage.
In a symbolic move, the United Nations General Assembly suspended it from the U.N. Human Rights Council, expressing ""grave concern at the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis."" Russia then quit the council. 
Russia has previously acknowledged its attack has not progressed as quickly as it wanted, but on Thursday Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov lamented the rising death toll.
""We have significant losses of troops,"" he told Sky News. ""It's a huge tragedy for us.""
Russia is facing its most difficult economic situation for three decades due to unprecedented Western sanctions, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said earlier. 
Russia says it launched what it calls a ""special military operation"" on Feb. 24 to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Kyiv and its Western allies reject that as a false pretext.
Following new measures announced this week in response to the killing of civilians in the town of Bucha that were widely condemned by the West as war crimes, Ukraine wants allies to stop buying Russian oil and gas amid divisions in Europe over how far to go on energy restrictions.
""Once and for all, we can teach Russia and any other potential aggressors that those who choose war always lose,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the Greek parliament.
Moscow has denied targeting civilians and says images of bodies in Bucha were staged to justify more sanctions against Moscow and derail peace negotiations.
An EU ban on purchases of Russian coal is set to be pushed back to mid-August following pressure from Germany, two sources told Reuters. 
And Ukraine accused Hungary of undermining EU unity after Budapest broke ranks with the bloc by saying it was prepared to pay roubles for Russian gas, a Kremlin demand that most in the West had resisted. 
On the battlefield, Ukraine says following a withdrawal from Kyiv's outskirts, Russia is regrouping to try to gain full control over the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which have been partly held by Russian-backed separatists since 2014.
The besieged southern port of Mariupol, where the mayor said over 100,000 people were still trapped, was also a target. 
""Evacuate! The chances of saving yourself and your family from Russian death are dwindling every day,"" Luhansk governor Serhiy Gaidai said.
Authorities in Dnipro, a city in central-eastern Ukraine, also urged women, children and the elderly to leave.
TRADING ACCUSATIONS 
Both sides continued to trade accusations, with Moscow opening a criminal investigation into allegations by a Russian soldier that he was beaten and received death threats while being held in Ukraine as a prisoner of war. 
Separately, a social media video verified by Reuters and geolocated to an area west of Kyiv appears to show Ukrainian forces shooting and killing a captured and badly wounded Russian soldier.
In the city of Kharkiv, at least one person was killed and 14 wounded in shelling on Thursday, the regional governor said, while Ukraine's prosecutor general reported 26 bodies had been found under two ruined buildings in the town of Borodianka. 
Reuters could not immediately verify the accounts.
NATO members have agreed to strengthen support to Ukraine and the United States is looking into what new weapons it could send as Zelenskiy's government says starving Moscow's war machine is the only way to bring it to a settlement at on-and-off peace talks.
On Thursday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Kyiv had presented Moscow with a draft peace deal that contained ""unacceptable"" elements and deviated from previously agreed proposals.
Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak told Reuters Lavrov was not directly involved in negotiations and his statements were ""of purely propagandistic significance"" aimed at diverting attention from the killings in Bucha. 
On Wednesday, Reuters reporters saw the body of a man in Bucha with a rope tied around his feet and a charred hole in his forehead, one of at least five victims shot through the head documented by the news organization.
Since Russian troops pulled back last week, Ukrainian officials have said hundreds of civilians have been found dead.
Bucha's mayor has said dozens were the victims of extra-judicial killings carried out by Russian troops. Reuters could not independently verify those figures.
Media outlets including Reuters have seen satellite images released by a private security company that appear to show bodies in the streets while Bucha was still occupied by Russia, contradicting Moscow's assertion that Ukraine staged the bodies after retaking the town.

Accounts by at least a dozen residents of one apartment complex in Bucha painted a picture of violence and intimidation by Russian soldiers. 
The mutilated bodies of one resident of the complex and another local were discovered in a stairwell.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. Congress on Thursday pushed back against President Joe Biden's lifting of a pandemic-related rule expelling immigrants seeking asylum, with others supportive of the policy saying the administration needed to do more work to prepare for a surge in migrants.
""I want to see the plan that the administration has to address this, as a lot of my colleagues do,"" said Representative Pete Aguilar, the vice chairman of the 221-member House Democratic Caucus. ""There's a lot more that needs to be done."" 
Biden has until May 23 to ensure federal agencies are prepared for a spike in immigrants trying to enter the United States from Mexico, where many have been forced to stay while awaiting action on their asylum claims.
Republicans, who aim to recapture control of one if not both chambers of Congress in the Nov. 8 elections, seized on the move, which Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said amounted to Democrats ""supercharging their border crisis.""
Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Wednesday said he would transport some of the migrants directly to Washington.
Former President Donald Trump imposed the ban, called the ""Title 42"" rule, in early 2020, which led to more than a million migrants and asylum-seekers being expelled. The Trump administration said at the time it would reduce coronavirus infections in the United States.
With apprehensions at the border already at high levels, there are estimates of those numbers more than doubling to around 18,000 per day, prompting a Republican outcry.
A handful of Democratic senators, most of them facing challenging re-election bids, proposed legislation delaying Biden's move.
Senators Maggie Hassan, Raphael Warnock, Mark Kelly and Catherine Cortez Masto want to stop the rule from being lifted. They are in re-election campaigns in New Hampshire, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, respectively.
Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, who represents the Trump-loving state of West Virginia and who has challenged several Biden initiatives since last year, also has joined in.

Their stance, alongside solid Republican opposition, has jeopardized a $10 billion COVID-19 aid bill Biden urgently is seeking.
Representative Ruben Gallego said he and his fellow Democrats must shift constituents' attention to the need for comprehensive immigration reform, which Republicans in Congress repeatedly have stymied.

(Reuters) -The city of Denver said it will appeal a federal jury's verdict from March that awarded $14 million to a dozen activists who sued Denver police, claiming excessive force was used against peaceful protesters during racial injustice demonstrations following the death of George Floyd in 2020.
""There hasn't been a final judgment entered, but Denver City Attorney's Office has decided to pursue post-trial relief, including an appeal,"" the Denver City Attorney's Office said in an emailed statement on Thursday.
Floyd's death, after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for about nine minutes, sparked months of anti-racism protests and demonstrations against police brutality across the United States and other parts of the world in 2020.
""While we were not perfect in our administration and dealing with the protests, we believe that we certainly have some reasons to go back and look at a different type of decision with regards to that situation,"" Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, a Democrat, told Axios earlier on Thursday.
Denver had settled several civil complaints stemming from the police response to the Floyd protests, but the lawsuit from the activists was the first such case in the United States to go to trial, according to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which represented several of the plaintiffs.
""Instead of wasting time and money challenging the jury's verdict, Denver should focus on fixing its police force,"" an ACLU spokesperson said on Thursday after Denver's decision to appeal the verdict.

The lawsuit, filed in June 2020, led a federal judge to issue a temporary injunction barring police in Denver from using tear gas, plastic bullets, flash-bang grenades and other ""less-than-lethal"" force unless approved by a senior officer in response to specific acts of violence.
The lawsuit brought by Denver activists acknowledged that some protesters engaged in lawless behavior, but it said the vast majority were peaceful and accused police of engaging in heavy-handed riot-control tactics without issuing clear warnings and orders to disperse.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) -The United Nations General Assembly on Thursday suspended Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council over reports of ""gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights"" in Ukraine, prompting Moscow to announce it was quitting the body.
The U.S.-led push garnered 93 votes in favor, while 24 countries voted no and 58 countries abstained. A two-thirds majority of voting members in the 193-member General Assembly in New York - abstentions do not count - was needed to suspend Russia from the 47-member Geneva-based Human Rights Council.
Speaking after the vote, Russia's deputy U.N. Ambassador Gennady Kuzmin described the move as an ""illegitimate and politically motivated step"" and then announced that Russia had decided to quit the Human Rights Council altogether.
""You do not submit your resignation after you are fired,"" Ukraine's U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya told reporters. 
Russia was in its second year of a three-year term. Under Thursday's resolution, the General Assembly could have later agreed to end the suspension. But that cannot happen now Russia has quit the council, just as the United States did in 2018 over what it called chronic bias against Israel and a lack of reform. 
The United States was last year re-elected to the council. Suspensions are rare. Libya was suspended in 2011 because of violence against protesters by forces loyal to then-leader Muammar Gaddafi.
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the United Nations ""sent a clear message that the suffering of victims and survivors will not be ignored.""
""We ensured a persistent and egregious human rights violator will not be allowed to occupy a position of leadership on human rights at the U.N.,"" she said in remarks to be delivered to the General Assembly later on Thursday. 
The Human Rights Council cannot make legally binding decisions. Its decisions send important political messages, however, and it can authorize investigations. Last month the council opened an investigation into allegations of rights violations, including possible war crimes, in Ukraine.
The resolution on Thursday was the third adopted by the 193-member General Assembly since Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24. The two previous General Assembly resolutions denouncing Russia were adopted with 141 and 140 votes in favor. 
After abstaining on the previous two General Assembly votes, Russia's partner China opposed the resolution on Thursday.
""Such a hasty move at the General Assembly, which forces countries to choose sides, will aggravate the division among member states and intensify the confrontation between the parties concerned - it is like adding fuel to the fire,"" China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun said before the vote.
The General Assembly text on Thursday expresses ""grave concern at the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine,"" particularly at reports of rights abuses by Russia.

Russia says it is carrying out a ""special military operation"" that aims to destroy Ukraine's military infrastructure and denies attacking civilians. Ukraine and allies say Moscow invaded without provocation.
Russia had warned countries that a yes vote or abstention will be viewed as an ""unfriendly gesture"" with consequences for bilateral ties, according to a note seen by Reuters.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) -Pakistan's Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that Prime Minister Imran Khan's move to dissolve parliament was unconstitutional and ordered lawmakers to return, a decision that could spell the end of his premiership as soon as Friday.
The former cricket star had moved to break up the lower chamber ahead of a no-confidence vote against him that he had looked destined to lose. The court said in its judgment that the vote should now go ahead.
""The advice tendered by the Prime Minister on or about 03.04.2022 to the President to dissolve the Assembly was contrary to the Constitution and of no legal effect,"" Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial said, as he read out a 13-point order to a packed courtroom.
Dozens of opposition members outside the imposing white stone building shouted in jubilation when the unanimous ruling was announced. Angry Khan supporters chanted anti-American slogans in reply as police in riot gear separated the sides.
The constitutional crisis has threatened economic and social stability in the nuclear-armed nation of 220 million people, with the rupee currency hitting all-time lows earlier on Thursday and foreign exchange reserves tumbling.
When opposition parties united against Khan last week to push for the no-confidence motion, the deputy speaker of parliament, a member of Khan's party, threw out the motion, ruling it was part of a foreign conspiracy and unconstitutional.
Khan then dissolved parliament.
Thursday's ruling in the capital Islamabad could spell the premature end of Khan's tenure in a country where no elected leader has finished their full term in office.
The 69-year-old, who steered Pakistan to cricket World Cup victory in 1992, came to power in 2018 after rallying the country behind his vision of a corruption-free, prosperous nation respected on the world stage.
But the firebrand nationalist's fame and charisma may not be enough to keep him in power. He could not deliver on all of his lofty promises and failed to avert an economic decline partly sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Khan called a cabinet meeting for Friday when he also planned to address the nation.
""My message to our nation is I have always & will continue to fight for Pak till the last ball,"" he tweeted.
'ECONOMIC MELTDOWN'
If Khan were to lose the no-confidence vote, the opposition could nominate its own prime minister and hold power until August 2023, by which date fresh elections have to be held.
Shehbaz Sharif, a member of the powerful Sharif political dynasty, said after the court ruling that allies in the opposition had nominated him to take over should Khan be ousted.
The opposition has said it wants early elections, but only after delivering a political defeat to Khan and passing legislation it says is required to ensure the next polls are free and fair.
Pakistan's election commission said on Thursday the earliest it could hold the ballot was October.
Economic policymakers will want to see the crisis resolved as quickly as possible. Pakistan is in the middle of an International Monetary Fund bailout which it desperately needs to shore up hard currency reserves.
The Pakistan rupee took a battering on Thursday as the country awaited the court's judgment, hitting record lows.
In its biggest hike in years, the central bank raised its policy rate by 250 basis points to 12.25% in an emergency meeting.
""As (the) dollar continues to soar, a massive economic meltdown is staring the country in the face,"" Sharif said in a tweet.
The crisis also threatens Pakistan's relationship with long-time ally the United States, who Khan has blamed for being behind a conspiracy to overthrow him. Washington denies this.
Some political analysts said the country's powerful military viewed Khan and his conservative agenda favourably when he won a general election, but that its support has waned. Khan has denied enjoying their backing.

The military has stepped in to remove civilian governments and take over on three occasions since Pakistan's independence in 1947, citing the need to end political uncertainty.
The current military leadership says it is not involved in politics, including the current situation.

BUCHA, Ukraine (Reuters) - Set in a quiet, tree-lined neighbourhood of the Ukrainian town of Bucha, an apartment complex on Vodoprovidna street has neatly trimmed verges with pedestrian walkways. Number 34a Vodoprovidna is one of a clutch of modern apartment buildings that back on to a kindergarten. Residents are largely middle class: Vasyl Nedashkivskiy, who fitted PVC windows, lived on the fifth floor with his wife, Tetyana, and their dog, Nika. Another resident is a child psychologist and a third, Oleksii Tarasevich, a nanotechnology engineer.
Russian soldiers arrived at the address just after midday on March 5, according to Tarasevich, who kept a diary and a video and photo record of what he saw from his apartment window. He shared the images and footage with Reuters, which verified they were taken during the relevant time period.
A month later, 47-year old Nedashkivskiy and another local were dead - their mutilated bodies discovered on a basement stairwell of a building in the complex - and many of the complex’s residents had fled. In a residents' parking lot, a  Renault  (PA:RENA) Captur SUV and an Audi saloon lay flipped over.
The accounts by at least a dozen of the complex's residents paint a picture of violence and intimidation by the soldiers while they were in the neighbourhood. Nedashkivskiy had been badly beaten while unarmed, according to his wife and Tarasevich. 
Nedashkivskiy’s wife, Tetyana, told Reuters that Russian soldiers found an automatic rifle hidden in their apartment following his beating in mid March. She said a soldier told her the Russian troops then took her husband to an undisclosed location for questioning. Two weeks later, after Russian troops withdrew, neighbours found Nedashkivskiy’s dead body, Tetyana said.
A photograph of Nedashkivskiy’s body reviewed by Reuters showed his face and hands had been smashed with what appeared to be a blunt instrument.
The second man was found dead on April 1 at the same spot where Nedashkivskiy’s body was discovered, according to Tetyana. Marks on the second man's body, which was seen by Reuters two days later, indicated he had been beaten and shot through the mouth at very close range.
The witness accounts and video gathered by Reuters also indicate the Russian soldiers were concerned that even though there was no visible Ukrainian military presence inside Bucha from early March, they could still be targeted by drones or by combatants concealed among the residents. Video shows soldiers in full combat gear with weapons cocked and Tarasevich said they took blankets from the apartments to camouflage their vehicles, and appeared scared and on edge.
The accounts also reveal acts of defiance by residents who resented the invaders occupying their city and their apartment complex.
The Kremlin and the Russian defence ministry did not respond to detailed requests for comment on the deaths of the two men, events at the apartment complex portrayed by residents and Ukrainian allegations of Russian killings of civilians in Bucha. 
Russia has denied deliberately targeting civilians following its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Moscow launched what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, aiming to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and the West say the invasion was illegal and unjustified.
Since Russian troops pulled back from Bucha last week, Ukrainian officials have said hundreds of civilians have been found dead. Bucha’s mayor has said dozens were the victims of extra-judicial killings carried out by Russian troops. Reuters could not independently verify those figures.
Reuters has witnessed the remains of five victims in Bucha who were shot through the head. One had his hands tied behind his back. Another his feet tied. Reuters has not been able to independently determine who was responsible.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said at a news briefing on Wednesday that images purporting to show dead civilians in Bucha were fake and published in order to justify further sanctions by the West against Moscow and “to complicate, if not completely disrupt, (peace) talks.""
RUSSIANS TAKE OVER 
Bucha is some 30 kilometres northwest of the centre of Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Tarasevich said that before Russian soldiers reached town, he and Vasyl Nedashkivskiy had helped members of the Ukrainian territorial defence forces, made up of civilian volunteers, build barricades near the Kyiv satellite town of Irpin.
Tarasevich said he’s not a member of the territorial defence forces. Nor was Nedashkivskiy, according to his wife. Territorial defence officers in Bucha referred questions to the deputy mayor, who didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Local numbers for the defence forces also went unanswered.
Even if Nedashkivskiy belonged to Ukrainian territorial defence forces, execution-style killings would still be considered potential war crimes under the Geneva Conventions of 1949, which defined legal standards for humanitarian treatment in conflict. An individual act rises to the level of a war crime if it has been carried out as part of a wider plan or policy and be committed on a large scale during a conflict. A violent attack on civilians, for example, could constitute a war crime if it can be shown to have been intentional or indiscriminate.
Russian soldiers started reaching Bucha on Feb. 27, locals said, a week before their arrival at the complex on Vodoprovidna street. There, they commandeered three apartments in one of the buildings, which they used as a command post, and also used a basement, Tarasevich said. Troops parked armoured personnel carriers and military trucks in the courtyard of the apartment complex, images recorded by Tarasevich showed.
About 3,700 civilians stayed in Bucha after the Russians arrived, the town’s mayor has said, or about a tenth of the town’s population.
The troops ordered residents to wear white bands around their arms to identify them as civilians, eight residents told Reuters. The soldiers implemented a curfew every night, according to Tarasevich and Tetyana.
Soldiers searched apartments, leaving hand-written signs on the door saying in Russian: ""Inspected,"" Tarasevich said. When they encountered empty apartments, they sometimes took contents, he added. One photo he shared with Reuters showed an armoured truck parked outside with what appeared to be civilian sports bags lashed to the roof.
The soldiers also ordered locals to hand over their mobile telephones, at least 20 Bucha residents told Reuters.
Tarasevich said he gave the soldiers an old, broken phone. His actual phone was hidden under his elderly mother, who he lives with. He said he told soldiers she was too infirm to get up, so they did not search her bed.
Tarasevich said he hid in his apartment munitions that he pulled out of a damaged Russian military vehicle on Feb. 27 after it was attacked by Ukrainian troops. He said he had planned to hand them over to Ukrainian forces, but did not manage to before the Russians arrived at the complex.
A BODY ON THE STAIRS
On the evening of March 17, Vasyl Nedashkivskiy arrived at the entrance to his building a few minutes after the 5 p.m. curfew, according to his wife and Tarasevich, whose apartment is on the same landing as the couple’s. They said Nedashkivskiy was not wearing the white arm band required by the Russian soldiers. 
Both told Reuters they heard the sound of raised voices from the ground floor. A soldier came to Tarasevich's apartment and, pointing his weapon at him, ordered him to go downstairs, according to Tarasevich.
Tarasevich said he saw Nedashkivskiy lying motionless on the ground in a pool of blood, with at least three soldiers standing over him. Nedashkivskiy's face was bloodied, and several teeth lay on the ground. One soldier ordered Tarasevich to get Nedashkivskiy up.
When he protested, the soldier brandished his weapon at him and threatened him verbally, according to Tarasevich, who detailed his account in a signed testimony reviewed by Reuters that he said he gave to the local prosecutor’s office. Neither the prosecutor’s office in Kyiv or the local branch immediately responded to requests for comment.
Tarasevich said he helped Nedashkivskiy onto a bench by the building entrance. The soldiers then sent Tarasevich back to his apartment.
About two hours later, according to Tarasevich, he heard a noise on the landing and through the spyglass in his door saw Nedashkivskiy, with some soldiers, going into the couple’s apartment.
According to Nedashkivskiy's wife, the soldiers then found the automatic weapon, which was hidden under a television. She said her husband obtained it when, before Russian troops arrived, acquaintances serving in the Ukrainian territorial defences had left if there for safekeeping.
The soldiers took the couple to the command post, in building 33b, Tetyana said. There, a soldier struck her husband with the butt of his gun, she added.
Tetyana said she was taken into a room, a children's bedroom, where she fell asleep. When she woke, her husband was gone.
A soldier told her he had been taken for questioning at the unit's headquarters, without identifying the location, according to Tetyana. Reuters, during a visit to the building Thursday, observed drips of dried blood on the floor and walls leading out from the command post where she said they had been taken, and down the stairs.

After four days held in the command post, Tetyana said soldiers allowed her to return home. Her husband's body was found around a week later, on April 1, on the steps leading down to the basement of the building that housed the command post. 
She said her husband had refused to bend to the will of the Russian soldiers. ""Vasya did not put on the white arm band,"" she said, using an affectionate version of his first name. ""He said: 'I'm on Ukrainian soil. I'm Ukrainian'.""

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka must urgently seek funds from multilateral lenders and aim to restructure a debt payment due in July, its outgoing finance minister said on Thursday, pleading for political stability amid the country's worst economic crisis in decades.
The opposition and some partners of the ruling coalition rejected calls this week for a unity government from President Gotabaya Rajapaksa after he disbanded his cabinet, hoping to quell weeks-long street protests over shortages of fuel, power, food and medicine.
With its foreign exchange reserves shrinking quickly, massive debt payments due and the rupee currency slumping, analysts say the government - controlled by Rajapaksa and his elder brother Mahinda, the prime minister - is running out of options.
Reserves dropped 16% to $1.93 billion in March, central bank data showed on Thursday.
""We must look at how to structure the $1 billion international sovereign bond payment maturing in July,"" said Ali Sabry, who submitted his resignation to Rajapaksa on Tuesday. ""We must go to the IMF, there is no other solution that I can see.""
Sabry was moved to finance from the justice ministry on Monday to replace President Rajapaksa's younger brother Basil Rajapaksa.
It was not immediately clear if Rajapaksa had accepted Sabry's resignation, submitted days ahead of scheduled talks with the IMF for emergency loans.
As the island nation attempts to fast-track the formulation of proposals to present to the IMF President Rajapaksa on Thursday appointed K.M.M Siriwardana, a deputy governor at the central bank who previously worked with the Fund, as treasury secretary.
The $1 billion bond maturing on July 25 was trading at 54 cents in the dollar, its lowest level since spring 2020 when the COVID-19 rout hit global financial markets, data from MarketAxess showed.
Other Sri Lankan dollar-denominated sovereign bonds traded at even more stressed levels, with most changing hands around 40 cents in the dollar.
""We must have political stability to find solutions to the financial crisis,"" Sabry said.
""We must discuss with the World Bank and we must have a bridge-financing plan with the ADB. If we don't have stability, who will conduct these talks?,"" he said, referring to the Philippines-based Asian Development Bank.
Opposition lawmakers continued to call for the president to step down. At least 41 parliamentarians withdrew from the ruling coalition this week, though they could still support the government in the house and the opposition has not called for a no-confidence vote.
Foreign Minister G. L. Peiris told diplomats in a briefing that the government still held a majority in parliament and that ""despite the agitation"", there was no consensus on who could replace the president, prime minister and parliament.
DEEP IN DEBT
Critics have accused the government of mismanagement, but the tourism-reliant economy has also been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Help from the IMF would likely come with some tough political choices - policy reforms that could add to the pain in the short term in hopes of getting the economy back on more solid footing in a few years.
J.P. Morgan analysts estimated this week that Sri Lanka's gross debt servicing would amount to $7 billion this year, with the current account deficit coming in around $3 billion.
As the search for a replacement for Sabry at the finance ministry continues, P. Nandalal Weerasinghe took over as the central bank governor, succeeding Ajith Nivard Cabraal, who quit on Monday.
A court in the commercial capital Colombo on Thursday barred Cabraal from leaving the country until March 18, Rajith Keerthi Tennakoon, a well-known anti-corruption activist who accused Cabraal of misusing public funds during his tenure, told Reuters. Tennakoon had petitioned the court.
Reuters could not immediately contact Cabraal and his lawyer did not answer calls.
Weerasinghe, a former senior central bank deputy governor who has also worked with the IMF, will hold a monetary policy meeting on Friday. It was originally scheduled to be held on Monday.

An analyst said the central bank was expected to hike key interest rates by 300-400 basis points - following a 100 bps increase in early March - to tame inflation that hit 18.7% in March.
""We also expect the newly appointed governor to outline potential measures to be included in the IMF reform plan, views on potential debt restructuring, and currency management,"" said Lakshini Fernando of Asia Securities.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The United States will send new weapon systems to Ukraine, Washington's top diplomat said on Thursday after NATO foreign ministers agreed to accelerate arms deliveries in response to Russia's invasion.
Urged by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba to end bureaucracy-driven delays, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States and 30 other countries were sending weapons to Ukraine and that that process would intensify. 
""We're not going to let anything stand in the way of getting Ukrainians what they need, and what we believe, to be effective,"" Blinken said.
He spoke of ""new systems"" that have so far not been provided by NATO allies, but declined to go into details.
NATO diplomats said that meant, in part, helping Ukraine transition from its Soviet-era arsenal to more modern weapons.
Blinken said the United States had already agreed to send Kyiv anti-aircraft systems, shoulder-held anti-tank weapons and armoured vehicles.
Asking for planes, land-based anti-ship missiles, armoured vehicles and air defence systems, Kuleba made his plea to a special session at NATO headquarters.
He addressed his counterparts from NATO's 30 members plus the European Union, Finland, Sweden, Japan, New Zealand and Australia, urging Germany in particular to speed up deliveries, saying procedures were taking too long in Berlin.
""I think the deal that Ukraine is offering is fair. You give us weapons, we sacrifice our lives, and the war is contained in Ukraine,"" Kuleba said.
After six weeks of a war that Moscow describes as a ""special military operation"", Ukraine says Russia continues to shell eastern cities following its forces' withdrawal from around Kyiv.
Kuleba also reiterated a demand that the EU stop buying Russian oil and gas, as the bloc promised a fifth round of sanctions against Moscow by Friday. 
""We will continue to insist on a full oil and gas embargo,"" Kuleba said. 
'PUTIN'S CALCULUS'
Outrage over killings of civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha near Kyiv - where Russia denies any wrongdoing and says evidence was fabricated - appears to have galvanised Western support.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said a fifth package of sanctions, including a ban on coal, would be agreed on Thursday or Friday, while EU lawmakers voted in a non-binding resolution for ""an immediate full embargo"" on Russian energy imports. 
But Blinken, while saying he had a strong sense that Europeans were committed to ending their dependency on Russian energy, also conceded that that could not be as quick as ""flipping a light switch.""
The bloc's high level of dependency on Russian oil and particularly gas makes a broader energy embargo - which would cut off a significant source of revenue for Moscow's war - unlikely for the time being.

Blinken said reports of rape and executions in Bucha would not impact peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia as much as whether Moscow thought peace was worth pursuing.
""I don't think in a sense, Bucha has anything to do with that. It has everything to do with what President (Vladimir) Putin's calculus is, what he decides,"" Blinken said.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A lawyer for a former University of Southern California water polo coach accused of playing a key role in the U.S. college admissions scandal by accepting bribes to help admit students argued Thursday that he never lied and had sought legitimate donations from wealthy parents.
Defense lawyer Stephen Larson told a Boston federal jury at the end of a four-week trial that it was part of Jovan Vavic's job to raise money for his championship team at USC and recruiting wealthy parents' children to do that was ""proper.""
Prosecutors allege that in exchange for more than $200,000, Vavic for years misled USC admissions officials into believing that unqualified high school students belonged on his championship water polo team, regardless of their abilities.
They said that money came via William ""Rick"" Singer, a ""corrupt"" college admissions consultant who pleaded guilty in 2019 to facilitating the admission of his clients' children at schools like USC, Yale and Stanford through fraud and bribery.
Fifty-seven people have been charged in the wide-ranging ""Operation Varsity Blues"" investigation and 51 have pleaded guilty, including actors Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman, who were some of Singer's many wealthy clients.
But Larson said much of the money in Vavic's case was used to support his team at USC, where there was a ""constant refrain and chorus"" for coaches to raise money.
While he at times recruited children from families that could donate to the school, Larson said he only picked ones who could be ""legitimately"" admitted.
""There’s no law that says a university can’t sell slots to the highest bidder,"" he said in his closing argument. ""There’s no law.""
Assistant U.S. Attorney Leslie Wright, though, said Vavic lied about their athletic abilities to secure $100,000 for his team that would benefit him professionally and also $120,000 to cover Vavic's sons' private school tuition.

""It was money that caused this defendant to cross the line,"" she said. 
She said the students Vavic recruited included the son of private equity financier John Wilson, who was sentenced to 15 months in prison after being convicted in October with another parent in the scandal's first trial. He is appealing.

(Reuters) -The Boy Scouts of America's use of the word ""Scouting"" to advertise co-ed programs does not violate the Girl Scouts' trademark rights, a Manhattan federal court ruled https://tmsnrt.rs/3x5O3QC on Thursday.
U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein said a lawsuit by the Girl Scouts over the term was based on fear of competition from the Boy Scouts, and the Boy Scouts has the right to use ""Scouts"" and ""Scouting"" without reference to gender.
The Girl Scouts said in a statement that the group was ""deeply disappointed"" by the ruling and planned to appeal. 
The Boy Scouts said in a statement it was pleased the court had ""vindicated"" the group and looked forward to welcoming more girls into its programs.
Hellerstein had said at a September hearing that he planned to rule for the Boy Scouts.
The Boy Scouts announced in 2017 that it would allow girls to join and later launched an ad campaign for co-ed scouting called ""Scout Me In."" It changed the name of its main scouting program to ""Scouts BSA"" and officially started welcoming girls in 2019.
The Girl Scouts sued in 2018, alleging the Boy Scouts' use of ""Scouts"" and ""Scouting"" to market to girls violates its trademarks. It said the rebrand created confusion and threatened to marginalize the group.
The Boy Scouts has called the lawsuit part of a Girl Scouts ""ground war"" to counter its entry into girls' scouting.

Both organizations have lost significant membership in recent years, and the Boy Scouts is trying to finalize a proposed $2.7 billion settlement of thousands of sex abuse claims in bankruptcy court. 
Hellerstein said in his ruling that there was no trademark confusion, and that the Girl Scouts' lawsuit was not based on trademark concerns but out of ""fear for their competitive position in a market with gender-neutral options for scouting.""

KRAMOLIN, Czech Republic (Reuters) - Alisa Artiukh and Yuliia Boiko sheltered underground for two weeks in the decimated, besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol before braving the fighting to flee on foot when both food and hope for their young children's future ran out.
Carrying only water, cookies, clothes and a ukulele, the single mothers walked with their two boys out of the city, past landmines and dead bodies, to start an eight-day journey that took them to safety in a small Czech village.
""We decided if we die we were going to meet it in the face instead of hiding,"" said Artiukh, 31, a social worker and music teacher who described navigating military checkpoints and burnt out tanks and cars littering the city.
""We wanted to walk out of Mariupol because of the shelling,"" said Artiukh, who spoke in English. ""Everything was exploding."" 
She said walking was safer than driving ""because you could see the mines.""
Tens of thousands of civilians have been trapped for weeks in the Black Sea port city, many in basements with diminishing supplies of food, water and medicine. Once home to 400,000 people, Mariupol has been encircled and devastated by bombardment since the early days of Russia's invasion more than a month ago.
Local authorities say thousands have been killed. The United Nations says thousands of civilians may have died in the city, which has emerged as a key objective of what Moscow calls its special military operation in Ukraine
Bombs destroyed Artiukh's apartment, which she finished paying off in December, she said. Boiko said her home was hit in a military strike and her documents burned in the resulting fire. 
Since Russia's invasion on Feb. 24, more than 4.2 million refugees have fled Ukraine, with most crossing into the European Union at border points in Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary.
Russia says it aims to demilitarize and ""denazify"" Ukraine with a ""special military operation."" Ukraine and the West say the Feb. 24 invasion was illegal and unjustified.
'LOST EVERYTHING'
Boik and Artiukh fled on March 17, describing a journey in which they walked nearly 100 kilometres (62 miles) before travelling by bus and train to the western city of Lviv. From there they escaped to Poland.
""We lost everything when we left,"" Boiko, 34, said at a cottage on the edge of a forest some 122 kilometres (76 miles)from Prague. ""My mind and heart stay in Mariupol because of my family. I don't know what happened to them.""
While some refugees have moved further west, many have stayed in central European countries like the Czech Republic and Poland, which boast large pre-war Ukrainian communities.

The priority of the two friends is now finding schools for their 8- and 11-year old sons and learning Czech so they can begin to work. They plan to move closer to Prague but hold out little hope of ever returning home.
""There is nothing to go back to,"" Artiukh said.

236,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 06:38AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -In one drawing, dozens of men sit crammed into a single room, hunched with their knees together, every inch of space occupied. In another, they lie back to back on the floor, their faces straining with discomfort.
Fourteen sketches smuggled out of Myanmar's Insein Prison and interviews with eight former prisoners offer a rare glimpse inside the country's most notorious jail, where thousands of political prisoners have been sent since last year's military coup and communication with the outside world is sharply limited.
    The rough, blue-ink sketches show daily life for groups of male prisoners in their dormitories, queuing for water from a trough to wash, talking or lying on the floor in the tropical heat.
    Beyond those depictions, the eight recently released inmates told Reuters the colonial-era facility in Yangon is infested with rats, a place where bribes are common, prisoners pay for sleeping space on the floor and widespread illness goes untreated.
    ""We're no longer humans behind bars,"" said Nyi Nyi Htwe, 24, who smuggled the sketches out of the prison when he was released in October, after spending several months for a defamation conviction, on charges he denies, in connection with joining protests against the coup.
    Reuters could not independently verify the accounts provided by the former inmates.
    Myanmar's junta, which seized power from the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, and prison administration did not respond to multiple requests for comment on conditions shown in the sketches and described by the former inmates.
    Humanitarian groups including the International Committee of the Red Cross told Reuters they have been denied access to the jail.
    Built by the British in 1871, Insein is Myanmar's largest prison, housing many people arrested for opposing the junta.
    Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, convicted of breaking Myanmar's Official Secrets Act in 2017, spent most of their 511 days behind bars in Insein. They were released in a 2019 amnesty, before the latest coup.
    PRISON POPULATION SWELLS
    The artist drew the prison sketches between April and July of last year. Later released, he declined to be interviewed or identified, telling Nyi Nyi Htwe he feared rearrest.    
    Nyi Nyi Htwe, who met the artist in prison, said he sketched prisoners if asked and drew prison scenes wherever he went, saying he felt more relaxed while drawing. He gave Nyi Nyi Htwe the sketches as a birthday present.
    Nyi Nyi Htwe said he smuggled them out on his release to show friends, family and others the conditions inside.    
    Since the coup, 10,072 people have been detained in the Southeast Asian country, including Suu Kyi and most of her cabinet, and over 1,730 people have been killed, according to the nonprofit Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, whose tallies are widely cited. The junta has said AAPP's figures are exaggerated.
    Many of those detained have been sent to Insein.
    Built to incarcerate around 5,000 people, the prison has seen inmate numbers swell to over 10,000 since the coup, said a spokesperson for the AAPP. Reuters could not confirm the figures.
The sketches reflect the increase in the months after the coup, said Nyi Nyi Htwe.
    In one from late April, a few prisoners sit apart in their dorm, some reading books. A picture from June shows about 60 people in the same room - many lying in tight rows down the centre, the rest hunched against the walls.
    Nyi Nyi Htwe said he and as many as 100 others were packed well beyond capacity into a room where they ""slept a finger-width apart,"" and that he watched prison officers beat inmates with batons and had to pay bribes to send messages to family that they told him often did not arrive.
    'LUCKY NOT TO DIE'
    With the overcrowding came water shortages, disease, fatigue, fighting between prisoners and flourishing bribery, said people released in recent months.
    ""Rats ran around in the room. The toilets were filthy. The food was mixed with flies. Those who couldn't pay a bribe had to sleep next to the toilet bucket,"" said Sandar Win, a 42-year-old social worker jailed at Insein for several months for defamation after protesting against the junta.
She was released under an amnesty while awaiting sentencing for the charges, which she denies. She has since fled Myanmar.
    Access to outdoor latrines was limited, forcing prisoners to defecate in buckets in their rooms, three women former inmates said. These unsanitary conditions allowed skin and bowel diseases to spread, and there was little medical help, they said.
    A handwritten note by a group of anonymous Insein inmates, smuggled out to a prominent human rights activist in February, alleges several instances of medical negligence, including failure to treat people beaten unconscious and a person who had suffered a stroke and was paralysed.
    ""These cases are happening right in front of us,"" said the note, which was shown to Reuters by the activist, Nan Lin. ""We request urgent help from international organisations and local organisations.""
    Reuters could not independently verify the note's authenticity, but several former inmates said they had witnessed or suffered beatings by guards and there was little medical support.
    Despite a COVID-19 vaccination drive at Insein last summer that was publicised on state media, former inmates said the coronavirus thrived in the crowded prison. At least 10 prisoners are suspected to have died from the disease, according to the AAPP.
    Nyi Nyi Htwe, who has joined an armed rebel group, said nearly two-thirds of his dormitory were sick with COVID symptoms last summer. 
    ""They put all the sick people in our room — high fever, coughing and ill,"" he said. ""I was lucky enough not to die.""
A set of smuggled notes shown to Reuters by an aid group show an exchange between a father, held on defamation charges, and his young son.

""Behaving well, Papa. I miss you. I'd like to have a toy boat,"" wrote the boy.
""My little son,"" came the reply, including a tiny boat the father fashioned from instant coffee wrappers. ""I love you so much, my sweetheart. Please listen to your grandma.""

(Reuters) - South Korea's president-elect Yoon Suk-yeol said on Thursday strong deterrence was crucial in the face of nuclear and missile threats from North Korea amid a renewed warning by a top U.S. envoy of a potential nuclear test as early as next week.
Yoon, who has pledged to boost defence capability to counter the North's threats, spoke to U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) Commander Gen. Paul LaCamera during a rare visit to Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek, the command centre of the 28,500-strong U.S. military stationed in South Korea. 
“We can never stress enough the importance of strong deterrence based on the South Korea-U.S. military alliance and the combined defence posture,” Yoon said, citing the alarm raised by the North’s test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) last month.
Officials in Seoul and Washington have indicated Pyongyang may resume testing nuclear weapons for the first time since 2017, possibly around the birth annivesary of state founder Kim Il Sung, which the North celebrates on April 15.
""I don’t want to speculate too much, but I think it could be another missile launch, it could be a nuclear test,"" Sung Kim, the U.S. special representative for North Korea, told reporters on a teleconference on Wednesday in Washington when asked about the holiday next week.
Signs of preparations for a nuclear test included activity near the North's Punggye-ri nuclear site, U.S. officials said. 
North Korea launched a new ICBM last month after leader Kim Jong Un threatened to break his self-imposed moratorium on ICBM and nuclear testing.
Kim's powerful sister, Kim Yo Jong, has warned Pyongyang could use nuclear weapons if the South attacked, with South Korea and the United States expected to stage regular springtime exercises that Pyongyang has long denounced as a war rehearsal.

Yoon's visit to Camp Humphreys, the largest U.S. overseas military base, also comes as his foreign policy and security aides discussed possible redeployment of U.S. strategic assets to the peninsula with U.S. officials in Washington.
Yoon is set to be sworn in on May 10.

238,"<span>Apr 07, 2022 05:15AM ET</span>",,,,,,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Yemen's President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who ceded his powers to a presidential council on Thursday, fell foul of foes and allies in his efforts to cling to power from exile in Saudi Arabia, while often blocked from visiting his war-torn nation.
He also dismissed his deputy, following Yemeni talks in Riyadh aimed at bolstering U.N.-led efforts to revive political negotiations to end the bitter seven-year war. Saudi Arabia announced $3 billion in financial support after the news.
Hadi's ambitions were first foiled by the Iran-aligned Houthis who ousted him from Yemen's capital, Sanaa, in late 2014, and again by southern separatists, nominal allies backed by the United Arab Emirates, who twice seized control of Aden, interim seat of his government.
Riyadh kept him at the helm to preserve the recognised government, on whose behalf a Saudi-led coalition intervened against the Houthis in March 2015. But the UAE disapproved of his alliance with the Islamist Islah Party.
Hadi, 76, was kept largely secluded from the outside world, relying on a small group of family members and political allies to be his eyes and ears, analysts have said.
""Broader support for Hadi is predicated on his symbolic value more than his popular appeal,"" the International Crisis Group has said.
""For many Yemenis, the president has become a holding vehicle for the ideals of the 2011 uprising and the subsequent transitional period.""
A former army general from Yemen's south, Hadi moved to the north amid political turmoil at home in 1986. He rose through the ranks to become vice president under then-President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who united north and south Yemen in 1990.
Hadi took the helm of a crumbling state after Arab Spring protests in 2011 brought down Saleh, later killed in 2017 while trying to switch allegiances.
Hadi was the only name on the ballot for 2012 elections meant to guide predominantly Sunni Yemen through a transition to democracy shepherded by Western and regional powers led by neighbouring Saudi Arabia.
But, inheriting a nation in chaos, he faced long odds in what was meant to be a two-year term overseeing the transition.
The economy was collapsing, al Qaeda struck at the army and state, while secessionism festered in the north in the form of the Shi'ite Houthis and in the south by separatists.
Hadi suggested his former boss Saleh made no attempt to help him face a kaleidoscope of feuding politicians and militants.
""There's a planned conspiracy, and alliances among the former stakeholders itching for revenge,"" Hadi said after Sanaa fell to the Houthis in 2014.
The ensuing war between the Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition killed tens of thousands and pushed Yemen to the brink of famine.
Hadi's government has faced the same accusations of corruption and mismanagement as his autocratic predecessor, from both the Houthis and nominal allies under the coalition.
ESCAPE FROM SANAA
Hadi failed to build a power base of his own during decades in uniform. After assuming power, he launched a ""National Dialogue"" to hash out a new constitution, but matters quickly unravelled.
Saleh's army and government allies undermined the transition as al Qaeda militants carved out a mini-state and hit Sanaa with ever bloodier bombings.
The Houthis seized Sanaa with help from army units loyal to Saleh, forcing Hadi to share power. When the National Dialogue proposed a federal constitution, both Houthis and southern separatists rejected it for blunting their new-found sway.
The Houthis arrested Hadi in early 2015, but he escaped and fled to the southern port of Aden. The Houthis pursued him.
In March 2015, the Saudi-led coalition entered the war to prevent Iran gaining influence via the Houthis on its border and to preserve the Gulf-brokered transition.
They took Hadi to Riyadh and wrested control of Aden, where Hadi's government later faced a power struggle for the south with UAE-backed separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC).

Riyadh brokered a fragile power-sharing deal in 2019, leading to a new cabinet including the STC the next year.
In a televised speech on Thursday, Hadi said he was ceding his powers ""to allow effective leaders a role in running the country"" and to help end the bloodshed and ""build a new Yemen"".

BUCHA, Ukraine (Reuters) - A rope tied around his feet and a charred hole in his forehead, a dead man lies in scrub by a railroad track on the outskirts of the Ukrainian town of Bucha.
The haunting figure, his flesh a sallow yellow as if a waxwork, lies surrounded by brown fallen leaves. Just meters (yards) away, the corpse of another victim lies in the undergrowth.
""Don't touch the body. It may be mined,"" said a policeman, who pointed out the spot where the corpse lay but asked not to be identified by name.
Bucha, 37 km (23 miles) northwest of Kyiv, was occupied by Russian troops for more than a month following the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. 
When the Russian forces pulled back last week, they left behind civilian dead on Bucha's streets, inside buildings and buried in shallow graves. 
Local officials say more than 300 people were killed by Russian forces in Bucha alone, and around 50 of them were executed. 
The policeman said residents of Bucha had buried another five corpses under an unmarked earth mound that Reuters passed nearby. Reuters could not immediately verify his account.
Since reaching Bucha on Sunday, Reuters has witnessed the remains of at least five victims who were shot through the head. One had his hands tied behind his back.
The slain man Reuters saw on Wednesday, wearing blue jeans and a black winter jacket, lay 100 meters from a small cemetery. Reuters was unable to identify the man or determine who had killed him.
Witnesses in the town - which has been badly shelled; its facades gouged and blackened - have recounted details of what they said were several other extra-judicial killings at the hands of Russians. Reuters has been unable to verify their accounts independently.
Ukraine's government has accused Russia of genocide and war crimes. The Kremlin dismisses the allegations as propaganda and says its forces are not targeting civilians. 
Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council on Tuesday that accusations of abuse were lies. He said that while Bucha was under Russian control ""not a single civilian suffered from any kind of violence."" 
On Sunday, Russia's defence ministry issued a statement saying that all photographs and videos published by the Ukrainian authorities alleging ""crimes"" by Russian troops in Bucha were a ""provocation.""
CHECHEN SOLDIER
In another incident nearby, through a small wood, builder Eduard Karpenko recounted how he saw one of his neighbours marched off to be shot by a Russian soldier.
He said the victim, Oleksandr Yeremich, was a 43-year-old member of the Territorial Defense Forces, the military reserves of the Ukrainian armed forces. Karpenko showed Reuters a copy of the man's passport but the news agency was unable to verify independently other details of his account.
Karpenko said the man was marched away from near his home by a soldier that two watching Russian troops said came from Chechnya, a region in southern Russia that has deployed forces to Ukraine to support Russia. 
   The soldier marched the man out of sight, to the end of a wooden fence flanking the wood, and then four shots rang out, Karpenko said.
  ""They led him to the end of the gate and shot him, with the last shot to the head,"" Karpenko said, holding his arms aloft as if being marched away.
Two men alongside Karpenko, who declined to be identified, confirmed they also saw Yeremich led away and heard the shots.
Karpenko said he and the two men had waited as ordered by the Russian soldiers until nightfall before venturing out to recover the body.
""We covered him in a blanket, then with another, and dragged him to the grave. There was so much blood,"" said Karpenko.
He said the body was buried nearby in a garden, the spot marked with a long wooden stake and a metal frame shaped like a coffin, which was seen by Reuters. 

Karpenko and the two other men dangled a baseball cap on a branch at the site where they said the shooting took place.
Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a Putin ally, said in a statement on Feb. 26 that Chechen forces would be fighting in Ukraine as part of Russia's ""special military operation"" to demilitarize the country. Reuters was unable to determine if they operated in Bucha.

241,"<span>Apr 06, 2022 09:35PM ET</span>","(Reuters) -A federal jury ended a third day of deliberations on Wednesday in the trial of four men charged with a plot to kidnap Michigan's governor, a case that highlights the political rift surrounding the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Prosecutors said Adam Fox, Brandon Caserta, Barry Croft Jr. and Daniel Harris planned to snatch Governor Gretchen Whitmer from her vacation home in northern Michigan in the hope of ending what they perceived to be draconian restrictions championed by the Democrat to control the spread of coronavirus.
The defendants had hoped the kidnapping would spark a second American civil war ahead of the 2020 presidential election as the pandemic exacerbated the country's intense polarization, prosecutors said. 
During a trial that has lasted nearly a month, defense attorneys argued that FBI informants coerced their clients into discussing the plot. The men never made concrete plans on their own and were victims of entrapment and overreach by the prosecution, their attorneys argued. 
On Tuesday during their second day of deliberation in a Grand Rapids court, the 12-person jury asked U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker for transcripts of testimony from the trial. He declined their request, saying the 3,400 pages of transcripts were not yet available and that jurors must rely on their memories, the Detroit Free Press reported. 
The case has cast a spotlight on two of the militant right-wing organizations that have emerged in the years since former President Donald Trump's election in 2016. It also suggests the extent to which the pandemic and government efforts to control it have become a wedge issue in U.S. politics, pushing some people to extremes.
All four of the defendants have been charged with kidnapping conspiracy. Fox, Croft and Harris were also charged with conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction. If convicted the men could spend the rest of their lives in prison. 
Two other men who were initially charged - Ty Garbin and Kalen Franks - struck plea deals and served as star witnesses for the prosecution during the trial. Garbin is currently serving a six-year sentence, while Franks awaits sentencing.
The four men on trial, plus Garbin and Franks, are among 13 who were arrested in October 2020 and charged with state or federal crimes in the alleged kidnapping conspiracy. Seven of them are facing charges in state court.
The FBI said it had begun tracking the group's movements after seeing online discussions that included posts about the violent overthrow of some state governments. The group's goal was to end curbs on social and business activities imposed during the coronavirus pandemic. 

Prosecutors have also accused them of wanting to start a second American civil war, while defense attorneys have said their clients were often high on drugs and prone to ""crazy"" talk rather than concrete action.
Harris, Caserta and an undercover informant who testified at the trial were members of the Wolverine Watchmen, a militia group, prosecutors say. Croft and Fox were members of the ""Three Percenters,"" a similar far-right organization.

(Reuters) - One person was shot on the road in the United States every 17 hours in 2021, according to a new tally of road rage violence.
In all, 131 people were killed and 391 wounded by gunfire for a total of 522 road rage casualties in 2021, the gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety said in a report released this week.
That represents a significant jump from 73 dead and 166 wounded in 2016, a spike that the report's authors suspect was linked to stresses caused by the coronavirus pandemic. 
The number of shootings for 2021 works out to one person shot in a road rage confrontation every 17 hours, more than twice the rate of one person every 37 hours in 2016.
Everytown, which is funded largely by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, cited its database, compiled from 7,500 sources, mostly law enforcement agencies.
The gun control group said more research was needed to determine the reasons for the surge in shootings, but that increased road rage gun casualties correlated with other trends seen during the pandemic, such as rising gun sales and shootings. 
The gun rights group Gun Owners of America (GOA) accused Everytown of highlighting the actions of criminals to infringe on the rights of responsible gun owners.
""Plain and simple - it's illegal to threaten someone or use deadly force with a firearm to settle a road rage dispute. This story is merely a distraction and an excuse for gun grabbers to once again claim that if we remove guns from the hands of good people, criminals will stop breaking the law,"" Erich Pratt, senior vice president of GOA, said in a statement.
Other groups, including the Automobile Association of America, have documented rising road rage. The American Psychological Association says young males are the most likely to display aggressive or angry behavior toward other drivers.
""From 2016 to 2019, roughly one-third of road rage incidents involving a gun resulted in injury or death. By 2021, nearly two-thirds did,"" Everytown said.

The bill is one of several passed in conservative states in recent weeks by lawmakers who say that those born male would have an unfair advantage on the playing field against those born female.
Beshear, a Democrat, said in his veto message that the Kentucky High School Athletic Association had policies in place that would prevent any unfair advantage, including requiring that athletes be formally gender-reassigned in order to participate in sports in a gender other than the one they were assigned at birth.
The ban passed by the legislature, he said, offers no example of unfair advantage by a transgender student, and ""most likely violates the equal protection rights afforded by the United States Constitution because it discriminates against transgender children.""

Beshear also pointed to vetoes of similar bills by Republican governors in Utah and Indiana. However, the Republican-dominated Utah legislature overrode its governor's veto, and the Indiana legislature will hold a similar vote next month.
Kentucky's legislature could also decide to override Beshear's veto.

(Reuters) -Top U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials on Wednesday said the agency is aiming to decide by June whether to change the design of COVID-19 vaccines in order to combat future variants, even if it does not have all the necessary information to measure their effectiveness.
""We're going to have to think about this in a way that is less than optimal because we're not going to have all the data that we'd like to have,"" Peter Marks, director of FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said at a meeting of the agency's scientific advisers to discuss the issue.
Marks also conceded that future COVID booster campaigns likely need to be less frequent. The FDA recently approved a fourth round of shots for older Americans.
""We simply can't be boosting people as frequently as we are and I'm the first to acknowledge that this additional fourth booster dose that was authorized was a stopgap measure,"" he said.
The panel of outside experts was convened to discuss how and whether to use additional vaccine boosters after data from Israel showed a fourth dose lowered rates of severe COVID among older people. 
The FDA said it was hoping next generation vaccines would be to tackle multiple variants.
""Pivoting toward a monovalent vaccine directed at something like Omicron runs the risk of really narrowing the breadth of coverage for people who might be getting that modified vaccine as their primary series,"" FDA scientist Doran Fink said.
The advisory panel did not vote on any specific vaccines, but the agency said their discussions could help forge a strategy for future use of booster doses.
Many of the outside scientists raised concerns that the agency's preferred time line would not allow manufacturers to run full trials to generate clinical data on a new vaccines' effectiveness. They may instead have to rely on comparing immune responses generated by new vaccines to the old ones.
""I think the effectiveness of current vaccines will be a key driver in determining when that threshold, whatever it is, is reached,"" Dr. Jerry Weir, director of FDA's Division of Viral Products, said about when the regulator would consider additional boosters.
Data presented to the panel showed that current vaccines lose much of their effectiveness in preventing infections from the Omicron variant of the virus, but were better at preventing severe disease. 

Those concerns, and data that showed waning protection from vaccines over time, drove U.S. health officials to authorize a second booster dose of the  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and Pfizer/BioNTech shots for people aged 50 and older and the immunocompromised.
A fourth dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine lowered rates of severe COVID-19 among those 60 and older but offered only short-lived additional protection against infection, the study from Israel released on Tuesday found.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation has wrested control of thousands of routers and firewall appliances away from Russian military hackers by hijacking the same infrastructure Moscow’s spies were using to communicate with the devices, U.S. officials said on Wednesday.
An unsealed redacted affidavit described the unusual operation as a pre-emptive move to stop Russian hackers from mobilizing the compromised devices into a “botnet” - a network of hacked computers that can bombard other servers with rogue traffic.
""Fortunately, we were able to disrupt this botnet before it could be used,” U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said.
The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately return an email seeking comment.
The targeted botnet was controlled through malware called Cyclops Blink, which U.S. and UK cyberdefense agencies had publicly attributed in late February to “Sandworm,” allegedly one of the Russian military intelligence service’s hacking teams that has repeatedly been accused of carrying out cyberattacks.
Cyclops Blink was designed to hijack devices made by WatchGuard Technologies Inc and ASUSTeK Computer Inc, according to research by private cybersecurity firms. It provides Russian services with access to those compromised systems, offering the ability to remotely exfiltrate or delete data or turn the devices against a third party. 
Watchguard issued a statement confirming it worked with the U.S. Justice Department to disrupt the botnet but did not disclose the number of devices affected - saying only that they represented ""less than 1 percent of WatchGuard appliances.""
AsusTek, better known as Asus, did not immediately return messages seeking comment.
FBI Director Chris Wray told reporters the FBI, with court approval, secretly reached into thousands of routers and firewall appliances to delete the malware and reconfigure the devices.
""We removed malware from devices used by thousands of mostly small businesses for network security all over the world,"" Wray said. ""We shut the door the Russians had used to get into them.""
The affidavit noted that U.S. officials launched an awareness campaign “to inform owners of WatchGuard devices of the steps they should take to remediate infections or vulnerabilities” and yet less than half the devices had been fixed to expel the hackers.
The affidavit noted that the FBI had carried out its work in cooperation with WatchGuard.

The announcement came amid a flurry of new sanctions announced against Russian banks and elites, days after grim images emerged of the bodies of civilians shot at close range in the town of Bucha.
Russia says its ""special military operation"" is aimed at demilitarizing and ""denazifying"" Ukraine, and it has denied targeting civilians.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. man was convicted of sex trafficking and other crimes on Wednesday for coercing a group of students at Sarah Lawrence College in New York state to perform unpaid work for him including engaging in prostitution.
Prosecutors accused Lawrence Ray, 62, of using physical violence and threats of criminal legal action to extort payments from students between 2010 and 2020 at Sarah Lawrence, a private college located north of New York City. Ray moved into his daughter's dormitory room at the college in 2010, prosecutors said.
Ray was arrested in 2020 and pleaded not guilty to charges including extortion, forced labor, sex trafficking and money laundering. His conviction came after a monthlong trial in Manhattan federal court in which several victims testified.
Prosecutors said Ray forced one female victim to engage in commercial sex acts and pay him more than $500,000 of her proceeds from prostitution. Ray collected sexually explicit photographs of her and once nearly suffocated her in order to coerce her into performing the acts, prosecutors said. 

He also used psychological and physical abuse to coerce three other female victims to perform unpaid labor, prosecutors said.
""Larry Ray is a predator. An evil man who did evil things. Today's verdict finally brings him to justice,"" Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement.

LVIV, Ukraine/DUBLIN (Reuters) - Russian forces bombarded cities in Ukraine as the United States imposed more sanctions on Wednesday after civilian killings widely condemned as war crimes and Ukraine's President urged a decisive Western response amid divisions in Europe.
Russia's 42-day-long invasion has forced more than 4 million people to flee abroad, killed or injured thousands, left a quarter of the population homeless, turned entire cities into rubble and prompted a slew of Western restrictions on Russian elites and the economy.
The new measures announced by Washington included sanctions on President Vladimir Putin's two adult daughters, days after the grim discovery of civilians shot dead at close range in Bucha, north of Kyiv, when it was retaken from Russian forces.
""We're going to keep raising the economic costs and ratchet up the pain for Putin, and further increase Russia's economic isolation,"" U.S. President Joe Biden said.
The United States wants Russia expelled from the Group of 20 major economies forum, and will boycott a number of meetings at the G20 in Indonesia if Russian officials show up, according to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. 
But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was critical of some in the West and said he could not tolerate ""any indecisiveness.""
""The only thing that we are lacking is the principled approach of some leaders - political leaders, business leaders - who still think that war and war crimes are not something as horrific as financial losses,"" he told Irish lawmakers. 
European Union diplomats failed to approve on Wednesday new sanctions, as technical issues needed to be addressed, including on whether a ban on coal would affect existing contracts, sources said.
EU member Hungary said it was prepared to meet a Russian request to pay roubles for its gas, breaking ranks with the rest of the bloc and highlighting the continent's reliance on imports that have held it back from a tougher response on the Kremlin.
Western policymakers have denounced the killings in Bucha as war crimes, and Ukrainian officials say a mass grave by a church there contained between 150 and 300 bodies.
Moscow denied targeting civilians there or elsewhere. Russia's foreign ministry said that images of bodies in Bucha were staged to justify more sanctions against Moscow and derail peace talks with Kyiv. 
Russia says it is engaged in a ""special military operation"" designed to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and Western governments reject that as a false pretext for its invasion.
Reflecting such fears, the EU executive said it had begun a stockpiling operation to boost its defences against chemical, nuclear and biological threats. 
BESIEGED CITY
Ukrainian authorities said late on Wednesday they cannot help people evacuate from the eastern front line town of Izyum or send humanitarian aid because it is completely under Russian control as the east sees the worst fighting.
A siege of the southern port of Mariupol has trapped tens of thousands of residents without food, water or power.
State-owned Ukrainian Railways said there were a number of casualties after three rockets hit a station in eastern Ukraine. It did not give a precise location.
Many in the eastern town of Derhachi, just north of Kharkiv and near the border with Russia, have decided to leave while they can.
Buildings have been badly damaged by Russian artillery. Kharkiv itself has been hammered by air and rocket strikes from the start.
Mykola, a father of two in Derhachi who declined to give his surname, said he could hear the thud of bombardments every night, and had been hunkering down with his family in the corridor of their home.
""(We'll go) wherever there are no explosions, where the children won't have to hear them,"" he said, hugging his young son and struggling to hold back the tears.
Ukraine's military said Russian forces were continuing preparations for an eastern offensive in order to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. It said the main focus of current hostilities was Donetsk, where Russian troops were still trying to seize all of Mariupol.
Ten high-rise buildings were on fire in the eastern town of Sievierodonetsk after Russian shelling on Wednesday, the region's governor said in an online post. 
NEW SANCTIONS
The new U.S. sanctions include a ban on Americans from investing in Russia.
The sanctions hit Russia's Sberbank, which holds one-third of Russia's total banking assets, and Alfabank, the country's fourth-largest financial institution, but energy transactions were exempted, U.S. officials said.
Britain also froze Sberbank's assets, and said it would ban imports of Russian coal by the end of the year.
But Europe is walking a tightrope as Russia supplies around 40% of the EU's natural gas consumption and the bloc also gets a third of its oil imports from Russia, about $700 million per day.

Germany, Europe's largest economy which relies on Russian gas for much of its energy needs, warned that while it supported ending Russian energy imports as soon as possible it could not do it overnight. 
Despite the sanctions, the Russian rouble extended recovery gains on Wednesday, returning to levels seen before the invasion, shrugging off fears of a potential default on international debt as it paid dollar bondholders in roubles.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sanctions imposed on Russia over its war in Ukraine should give China a ""good understanding"" of the consequences it could face if it provides material support to Moscow, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said on Wednesday.
Sherman said the ""range of sanctions"" and export controls coordinated among U.S. allies and partners against Russian President Vladimir Putin, the country's economy, and oligarchs, should serve as an example for China's leader Xi Jinping. 
""It gives President Xi, I think, a pretty good understanding of what might come his way should he, in fact, support Putin in any material fashion,"" Sherman told a House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee hearing. 
She said Beijing should ""take away the right lessons"" from the coordinated Western response over Ukraine that any moves by China to take the democratically governed island of Taiwan by force would not be acceptable.
""We hope that the PRC understands that any such action would see a response from the international community, not just from the United States,"" she said, referring to the People's Republic of China.
China has refused to condemn Russia's action in Ukraine or call it an invasion and has criticized Western sanctions on Moscow, although a senior Chinese diplomat said last week that Beijing is not deliberately circumventing those sanctions.
Beijing and Moscow have developed increasingly close ties in recent years, including the announcement of a ""no limits"" partnership in February.
Sherman said Beijing was showing signs of being ""conflicted"" about being so closely linked to Russia, including following the emergence of grim images of bodies of civilians shot at close range in the northern Ukrainian town of Bucha when it was retaken from Russian forces.
""That's not to say they don't see Russia as a partner. I'm not naive. They do. But they have also been public to say it is not an alliance,"" Sherman said. 

U.S. President Joe Biden warned Xi during a video call in March of ""consequences"" for any material support to help Russia counter Western sanctions or to provide military assistance.
Biden later said that China knows its economic future is tied to the West, not Russia.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Russia is likely to launch a new offensive in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region in the next few weeks, NATO Secretary-General Jensen Stolen said on Tuesday, adding that allies had time to help prepare the Ukrainian military.
Speaking a day before NATO foreign ministers gather in Brussels to discuss more financial, military and humanitarian support for Ukraine, Stoltenberg said Russia was planning a ""very concentrated"" offensive. 
""We now see a significant movement of (Russian) troops away from Kyiv to regroup, re-arm and re-supply and shift their focus to the east,"" Stoltenberg told a news conference. 
""In the coming weeks, we expect a further Russian push in eastern and southern Ukraine to try to take the entire Donbas and to create a land bridge to occupied Crimea,"" he said before Wednesday's meeting of NATO foreign ministers. 
Stoltenberg's comments appeared to confirm Moscow's announcement in late March that it was refocusing on ""the complete liberation of the Donbas"", an industrial region partly under Russian-backed separatist control since 2014.
Stoltenberg said it would be a new, crucial phase of Russia's Feb. 24 invasion, which the Kremlin calls a ""special military operation"". 
""Repositioning of the Russian troops will take some time, some weeks,"" he said.
He said that: ""In that window, it is extremely important that NATO allies provide support"".

Foreign ministers on Wednesday and Thursday are set to discuss how to send more anti-tank weapons, ammunition and medical supplies to Ukraine, Stoltenberg said. 
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba is expect to attend part of the two-day meeting in Brussels.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The parents of Trevor Reed, a former U.S. Marine jailed in Russia, said on Wednesday they were worried ""something terrible"" has happened to him and have not received any updates on his ""rapidly declining health"" in the past five days.
Joe and Paula Reed, who met last week with U.S. President Joe Biden, said in a statement that a prisoner trade seemed to be the only way to bring Reed home in the short term. They urged the White House to take all possible steps to bring home their son. Tensions between Washington and Moscow are high in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine launched in February.
Reed, 30, from Texas, is serving a nine-year term after being convicted of endangering the lives of two police officers while drunk on a visit to Moscow in 2019. Reed denied the charges. The United States has called his trial a ""theater of the absurd.""
""It has now been 5 days without any updates at all on Trevor's rapidly declining health and with each passing hour, we are more and more worried that something terrible has happened,"" the parents said in their statement.
""We believe there is a rapidly closing window for the Biden administration to bring our son home,"" they added.
Russian news agencies reported on Monday that Reed ended a hunger strike and was being treated in his prison's medical center. 
Reed went on hunger strike to protest being put in solitary confinement and not receiving proper medical care despite fears that he had tuberculosis, his parents said last week.
They said on Wednesday they were unable to confirm whether Reed was ever transferred to a prison hospital or if he ended his hunger strike. They also said they had no confirmation on whether their son was receiving ""any real medical care as Russian officials have claimed.""
The Russian prison service did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.

Reed also went on a hunger strike for almost a week last year to protest his incarceration as well as violations of his rights, allegations the prison service denied.
White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said last week after Biden's meeting with the parents that the president reiterated his commitment to continue to work to secure the release of Reed and other Americans ""wrongfully held in Russia and elsewhere.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A decorated U.S. Air Force veteran accused of defrauding donors in a fundraising campaign to help former President Donald Trump build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border has agreed to plead guilty to wire fraud conspiracy and three tax charges.
The U.S. Department of Justice revealed their plea agreement with Brian Kolfage, who led the ""We Build the Wall"" campaign, in a filing on Wednesday with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
Kolfage is expected to formally enter his plea on April 21 before U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres. His lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The government had in August 2020 charged Kolfage, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon and two other defendants over We Build the Wall.
Kolfage, of Miramar Beach, Florida, created the private campaign in December 2018, 14 years after losing his legs and his right hand in a rocket attack in Iraq. He became steeped in conservative politics after returning from that country.
Prosecutors said Kolfage told prospective donors he would ""not take a penny"" as he raised more than $25 million, yet took more than $350,000 and spent money on a boat, a luxury SUV, a golf cart, jewelry and cosmetic surgery, among other expenses.
The wire fraud conspiracy charge carries a maximum 20-year prison term. The tax charges, originally filed in Florida, include filing false tax returns and wire fraud.
A separate money laundering conspiracy charge is not part of Kolfage's plea agreement, according to Wednesday's letter.
Torres dismissed the indictment against Bannon last May, after Bannon received a presidential pardon in the final hours of Trump's presidency.
Kolfage's co-defendant Andrew Badolato is also expected to enter a guilty plea on April 21, court records show.
The final defendant, Timothy Shea, had agreed in principle to also plead guilty but changed his mind, prosecutors said last week.

""Mr. Shea is exercising his constitutional right to a fair trial,"" his lawyer John Meringolo said in an email on Wednesday.
The cases are U.S. v Kolfage et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-cr-00412; and U.S. v Kolfage in the same court, No. 22-cr-00201.

COLOMBO (Reuters) -Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa will not resign, a minister said on Wednesday, despite demonstrations against his handling of the country's worst economic crisis in decades and as doctors held street protests over a shortage of medicine.
Rajapaksa, governing the South Asian island nation since 2019 with other family members in top positions, revoked a state of emergency late on Tuesday after five days as dozens of lawmakers walked out of the ruling coalition, leaving his government in a minority.
Debt-laden Sri Lanka has been struggling to pay for imports due to a shortage of foreign exchange, and is due to start talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) later this month for a loan programme.
Late on Wednesday, Rajapaksa announced a three-member advisory group to help the government in the negotiations with the IMF. The group includes a former central bank governor, a former World Bank and a former IMF official.
""Among the responsibilities that the Presidential Advisory Group will undertake are to engage in discussions with relevant Sri Lankan institutions and officials engaging with the IMF,"" the president's media division said in a statement.
Sri Lankans have been suffering from shortages of fuel, power, food, drugs and other items for weeks, and doctors say the entire health system could collapse. 
Street protests began a month ago and have intensified in recent days, with people openly defying the emergency and a weekend curfew to demand the ouster of Rajapaksa.
""May I remind you that 6.9 million people voted for the president,"" Highways Minister Johnston Fernando said in parliament in response to criticism from the opposition and cries of ""Go home Gota"".
""As a government, we are clearly saying the president will not resign under any circumstances. We will face this.""
After Fernando's speech, nearly 200 doctors, some in their blue scrubs, marched down a road by a national hospital in the commercial capital Colombo, chanting slogans against the government.
Some held a banner saying: ""Strengthen people's right to live. Declare a health emergency."" 
Malaka Samararathna, who works at the state-run Apeksha Hospital that treats tens of thousands of cancer patients from across the country every year, said cancer drugs such as Filgrastim and Cytarabine, as well as some antibiotics, were in short supply.
Vasan Ratnasingam, a doctor at Colombo's Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children, the largest such free-of-charge facility in Sri Lanka with some 2,000 beds, said they had run out of at least one vital drug, Digoxin, given for heart conditions.
""And other than that, 102 essential drugs are in shortage. Some of those drugs are frequently used, such as for respiratory tract infections, for urinary tract infections,"" he said, warning doctors would have to stop routine treatments and surgeries if immediate action was not taken.
""COUNTRY IN SHAMBLES""
Medicines under a $1 billion credit line that India signed with Sri Lanka last month still have not arrived, according to a source aware of discussions between India and Sri Lanka.
""But there is definitely a sense of urgency on both sides,"" the source said, declining to be named since the discussions were not public.
Sri Lankan and Indian officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
India has supplied 36,000 tonnes of petrol and 40,000 tonnes of diesel to Sri Lanka in the last 24 hours, its high commission in Colombo said, taking total Indian fuel supplies to the crisis-hit country to 270,000 tonnes.
Rajapaksa's various moves - including securing financial support from India and China - have failed to end the shortages or the spontaneous street protests across the country.
His finance minister resigned on Tuesday, a day after his appointment.
Rajapaksa dissolved his cabinet on Monday and sought to form a unity government, a proposal rejected by ruling and opposition parties. His brother Mahinda Rajapaksa is the prime minister.
There is such a paucity of funds that the country is temporarily closing some of its embassies.
Sri Lanka's sovereign dollar bonds dropped more than 3 cents on Wednesday to trade at deeply distressed levels of less than 40 cents in the dollar. The stock market fell around 2%.

Chandrima Swarnamali, a patient outside the National Hospital where the doctors held their protest, said it was becoming very difficult to care for her family with three children.
""Things are very expensive, there is no cooking gas, and everything in the country is in shambles,"" she said. ""We need solutions. That's why the people are on the streets. We need a country for our children.""

BUCHA, Ukraine (Reuters) - Sobbing uncontrollably, Serhii Lahovskyi nuzzles against the shrouded corpse of his closest childhood friend, who disappeared when Russian troops occupied the Ukrainian town of Bucha near Kyiv and was found shot through the head and dumped in a stairwell.
   The labourer's eyes cloudy and half open, black and crimson streaks of blood caked on his face and snaking down to his lips from an exit wound that cracked his skull, Igor Litvinenko had been shot through the mouth at very close range. He was found by local residents just days before his 30th birthday.
   Dried clots of blood filled his nostrils. And his torso was covered with bright red welts, which Lahovskyi believes resulted from a beating. He was dumped together with another man who was found mutilated. His wife and other residents said the man who was mutilated had been taken prisoner by Russian troops who invaded Ukraine.
Reuters cannot independently verify the details of their accounts. 
Litvinenko had been visiting his mother to bring her food when he disappeared. 
   ""Why did these animals shoot him so?"" Lahovskyi said on Tuesday, his eyes wide and reddened, gesturing with his hand to say they had been best friends since they were knee-high. ""This is not Russia, this is a monster."" 
   ""Just point-blank. Why is it needed? Tell me please.""
   He and fellow residents in a housing complex in the ravaged town of Bucha, where Reuters has found a trail of what officials say are extra-judicial killings since Russian troops pulled back last week, grabbed shovels and dug a shallow grave on a grass verge by one housing block.
   Then they used a carpet to carry the remains, placing him in the ditch, folding it over him and covering him with wooden boards, before shoveling earth on top.
   Panting heavily after digging the grave, shaking his head in dismay, local locksmith and odd-job man Urii Churachenko bent down and placed two cigarettes in the earth as a token for his friend.
   ""I have known him since childhood,"" he said. ""We have lived through everything together. He is our colleague, our brother-in-arms. Let them burn in hell. That’s it.""
   Reuters has seen at least four victims shot through the head in Bucha, one with their hands tied behind their back. 
Residents have recounted cases of several others slain, some shot through their eyes and one apparently beaten to death and mutilated. 
   Officials say they have found more than 300 dead so far.
   Ukrainian officials say Russia has committed genocide and have called for an investigation by the International Criminal Court. 
The Kremlin dismisses the allegations as propaganda. Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council on Tuesday that Russian troops are not targeting civilians, dismissing accusations of abuse as lies. He said that while Bucha was under Russian control ""not a single civilian suffered from any kind of violence.""

In Bucha, Liudmyla Verhinska cried as she recounted how she found her 32-year-old son was slain, shot through the eye. He worked in anti-terrorism unit and is now buried on another small patch of grass near the housing complex.
   ""He went just to take out the trash and he was shot. After seven days, I found him,” she said. “And today I found his friend… What else to tell you?""

VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran has moved all its machines that make centrifuge parts from its mothballed workshop at Karaj to its sprawling Natanz site just six weeks after it set up another site at Isfahan to make the same parts, the U.N. nuclear watchdog said on Wednesday.
Iran granted International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors access to Karaj in December to re-instal surveillance cameras there after a months-long standoff that followed what Tehran said was Israeli sabotage that destroyed one camera and badly damaged another, prompting Iran to remove all four cameras.
A month later, Iran told the IAEA it was moving production of the parts for advanced centrifuges, machines that enrich uranium, to a new location in Isfahan, and the IAEA set up cameras there to monitor that work.
Little is known about the Isfahan workshop. Diplomats have said it is slightly larger than the Karaj one. On Wednesday, the IAEA said Iran had moved all the equipment from Karaj to an unspecified location at Natanz, raising the question of whether it will increase output by using both Natanz and Isfahan.
""On the same date (April 4), agency inspectors verified that these machines remained under agency seal at this location in Natanz and, therefore, were not operating,"" the IAEA said in a statement summarizing a confidential report to member states seen by Reuters.
Neither the statement nor the report described the location at Natanz, a site that includes a large underground enrichment plant and various buildings above ground.

Under an arrangement that is more than a year old, the IAEA does not have access for the time being to the data collected by some of its cameras, such as those at the new Isfahan workshop.
""Without access to the data and recordings collected by these cameras, the agency is unable to confirm whether the production of centrifuge components at the workshop in Esfahan has begun,"" the report to IAEA member states said.

(Reuters) - Last month, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds surrounded herself with members of the conservative parents-rights group Moms for Liberty when she signed a bill that outlawed transgender students from playing girls’ sports.
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis invited a member of the group to stand alongside him weeks later as he signed a bill that allows parents more say in public school teaching materials.
Just over a year ago, Moms for Liberty formed with a few parents upset over their school districts' COVID-19 mask mandates and raced-based equity initiatives. The group has since grown in size and influence, capturing the attention of Republican officials who recognize it has become a fulcrum for culture war issues that dovetail with education.
Moms for Liberty says it now has 80,000 members in 34 states, figures Reuters could not independently verify. Its leaders are looking to move beyond local school-board tussles and become a force in bigger political battles.
At the same time, Republicans appear to be trying to harness the energy of the grassroots group and others like it to stoke voter enthusiasm in the coming November elections, when key governorships and control of Congress are at stake.
A CNN poll in February found that 46% of voters, including about half of parents with children younger than age 18, said education will be extremely important to their vote for Congress in this year's midterms. About one-fourth of those voters listed curriculum and content in school lessons as a concern.
Former Trump administration official Ian Prior, who has launched a separate parents' rights group in Virginia, says the movement could form the “biggest single-issue bloc of voters” in the country and potentially attract Democrats and independents.
“We see this as the highest energy (among Republicans) since the Tea Party,” said Noah Weinrich, a spokesperson for Heritage Action, the political arm of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.
The Tea Party, a grassroots movement born of the financial crisis of 2007-08 and opposition to Obamacare, helped steer Republican politics in a more populist direction in the 2010 midterms and beyond. 
The Republicans embracing Moms for Liberty's activism are following the lead of Glenn Youngkin, who used education and cultural issues to propel himself to a stunning victory in the Virginia governor’s race last year. 
DeSantis and others are taking Youngkin’s approach a step further by partnering with Moms for Liberty on policy and affiliating themselves with the movement’s goals. In March, DeSantis named a member of the group, Esther Byrd, to Florida's Board of Education.
As the group’s profile has grown, so has the backlash. Teachers’ unions, school board organizations and Democrats say the movement promotes disruptive public behavior, anti-gay and trans ideologies, and book bans.
The National Education Association, a top teacher’s union, says the group is ""working to impose a dangerous agenda."" 
But some Democrats warn their party cannot afford to take the Republican push on education lightly, saying parents remain deeply frustrated in the wake of the pandemic and will support candidates they feel are listening to them.
“Our party has lost significant support as the party that focuses on students,” said Shavar Jeffries, president of Democrats for Education Reform, an advocacy group that works with state and federal candidates on education issues.
LOBBYING AND CANDIDATE FORUMS
In February, more than 100 Moms for Liberty activists descended upon the Florida legislature in Tallahassee.
They were advocating for the measure giving parents greater input in school curriculum, as well as what critics nicknamed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, which prohibits classroom instruction for young children on gender and sexuality issues.
Both bills passed, and DeSantis signed them into law.
The latter bill's sponsor, Representative Joe Harding, said Moms for Liberty members effectively warned lawmakers who opposed it that they would be ""held accountable” in their districts.
""They were a huge encouragement to me,” said Harding, a Republican who spoke at a dinner organized by the group. 
Across the aisle, however, Democratic Representative Carlos Guillermo Smith said the group preyed on unsubstantiated fears of teachers “grooming” young children for sexual abuse and promoted conspiracy theories that were once only on the party’s fringe.
“Every single day, I am bombarded by baseless accusations of pedophilia by Moms of Liberty-type advocates that say I need to stay away from children,” said Smith, who is gay. “It’s unhinged.”
In response, Tina Descovich, a co-founder of the group, said ""Moms for Liberty is concerned about anyone that is opposed to a bill protecting children . . . from sexual content.""
Moms for Liberty members also lobbied lawmakers in states including South Carolina, Tennessee, Wisconsin, New York and Ohio. The group says it plans to hire a series of paid state coordinators, who will organize local chapters into a more cohesive political force and engage with legislators, as well as a Hispanic outreach expert.
Descovich said the group will endorse candidates for local school boards this year, not in state and federal races. But it will press candidates at every level to embrace its priorities ahead of the midterms, she said.
Local chapters recently hosted events for Republican candidates such as Mike Gibbons in Ohio's Senate race and Garrett Soldano in Michigan's governor's contest to speak to its members.
""Mama Bears and Papa Bears are engaged like never before to reclaim our schools from power-hungry bureaucrats and the radical left,"" Soldano tweeted after the March 21 meeting.

Moms for Liberty has formed three federal PACs and one Florida state PAC to eventually support candidates and causes. According to federal and state records, the committees have received no contributions and made no expenditures. Ultimately, the PACs ""can be a tool in our toolbox,"" Descovich said.
""We are making a difference. I don’t see an end in sight,” said Alexis Spiegelman, who helped organize the group's legislative efforts in Florida. “You can’t manufacture what’s going on here.”

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Hong Kong Chief Secretary John Lee, a security official during the global financial hub's prolonged and often violent 2019 pro-democracy protests, said on Wednesday he had resigned in a bid to run in an election in May to become the city's new leader.
Lee, 64, a former deputy commissioner of police, was promoted to the global financial hub's No. 2 role in 2021 in a move that some political analysts said signalled Beijing's priorities for Hong Kong were security rather than the economy.
""I indicate in the letter the reason for my resignation is that if my resignation is approved by the Central People's Government, I shall plan to prepare to stand for the upcoming chief executive election,"" Lee said at a news conference.
He is the first government official to announce a bid for the Chinese-ruled city's top job, with media reporting that he will be the only candidate in the chief executive election due to take place on May 8.
Lee was among other senior Hong Kong and Chinese officials sanctioned by the United States in 2020 for what Washington described as their role in curbing Hong Kong's freedoms under a sweeping national security law imposed on the city by Beijing.
Hong Kong and Chinese authorities deny individual rights are being eroded and say the security legislation was needed to restore stability after prolonged unrest in 2019. 
Previous chief executives had extensive economic and social policy-making expertise and Lee was the first security official to lead the city in his role as chief secretary. Lee's promotion to the city's No. 2 position saw police chief Chris Tang take the security secretary post previously occupied by Lee.
Last year, as Hong Kong's security chief, Lee sent letters to media tycoon Jimmy Lai and branches of HSBC and Citibank threatening up to seven years' jail for any dealings with the billionaire's accounts in the city, according to documents seen by Reuters.
RISE OF SECURITY OFFICIALS
His bid for the city's top political post is a sign of the growing power security officials are gaining in the former British colony after faithfully implementing Beijing's new laws. If successful, Lee would be the first person with a security background to lead Hong Kong since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. 
Lee's announcement comes two days after incumbent Chief Executive Carrie Lam said she would not seek a second five-year term, saying ""it's time for me to go home"", after presiding over one of the most tumultuous periods in Hong Kong's history.
Previous chief secretaries had extensive economic and social policy-making expertise and Lee is the first security official to lead the city in his role as chief secretary. Lee's promotion to the city's No. 2 position saw police chief Chris Tang take the security secretary post previously occupied by Lee.
Last year, Lee led the vetting of candidates for the first ""patriots-only"" election for a new-look Legislative Council, where only those loyal to Beijing were allowed to run.
Lee holds a degree from Charles Sturt University in Australia, and joined the Hong Kong Police in 1977. 
He played a key role in trying to implement a contentious proposed extradition law in 2019 that divided Hong Kong society and triggered the mass protests. That legislation was eventually scrapped amid widespread public calls for Lee to quit.
Some observers of Hong Kong politics describe him as resolute, earnest and efficient, but lacking a natural feel for politics.

Known for his hawkish stance, Lee had spearheaded the city's disciplinary forces, including the police, in the national security crackdown, which saw mass arrests of democratic activists, politicians, students and journalists.
In one high-profile action this year, Lee sent a letter to the Wall Street Journal, demanding the newspaper support, rather than criticise a raid by 200 police on a liberal media outlet, Stand News, that led to the arrest of senior editors and the online news portal's closure.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - In 2020, Mahinda Rajapaksa won elections to become Sri Lanka's prime minister, serving under his brother and president Gotabaya. In 2021, another sibling, Basil, was named finance minister, tightening the family's hold on power.
Less than a year later, the country's pre-eminent political dynasty is in trouble, as protesters take to the streets making demands that would have been unthinkable before the economic crisis struck: that the president steps down.
""Gota go home!"" hundreds of people chanted along a leafy boulevard in Sri Lanka's commercial capital Colombo this week as cars drove past, honking their horns in support.
From beachside towns in the south to the Tamil-speaking north, more than 100 demonstrations have broken out across the island nation since last week, according to the WatchDog research collective.
The unprecedented wave of spontaneous protests reflects people's anger at spiralling inflation, fuel shortages, power cuts and what they see as rulers' mismanagement of the crisis that has made it worse.
""Sri Lankans are very, very patient. You've really got to push them into a corner before they react,"" said Chantal Cooke, a protester, holding a banner demanding that the Rajapaksas resign.
Within parliament, too, the family is losing ground.
Basil resigned on Sunday along with other members of the cabinet, and on Tuesday at least 41 lawmakers walked out of the ruling coalition, leaving the government with a minority in the 225-member house and opening up the possibility of a no-confidence motion.
""The more it (the crisis) gets dragged on, the worse it will be for the Rajapaksa family,"" said political analyst Kusal Perera, who has written a book on Mahinda, himself a former president.
The president's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the crisis and on calls for him to resign.
But chief government whip and Highways Minister Johnston Fernando said Gotabaya, now 72, had been given a mandate to govern by 6.9 million voters, the number who supported him in presidential elections in 2019.
""As a government, we are clearly saying the president will not resign under any circumstances,"" Fernando told parliament on Wednesday. ""We will face this.""

NINE SIBLINGS
The fifth of nine siblings born to a political family in Sri Lanka's Buddhist-dominated south, Nandasena Gotabaya Rajapaksa joined the Sri Lankan military in 1971 and took part in operations against the Tamil insurgency during the country's 26-year civil war.
In 2005, years after he retired and emigrated to the United States, Gotabaya returned to Sri Lanka and joined Mahinda's government as defence secretary, overseeing the brutal end of a civil war that killed between 80,000-100,000 people overall.
The United Nations has accused both sides of war crimes during the conflict, and Gotabaya faced civil prosecution for alleged wartime atrocities. He has maintained his innocence, and the case was dismissed due to political immunity.
Riding a nationalist wave in the wake of deadly attacks by Islamist militants earlier that year, Gotabaya swept to power in 2019 with a landslide mandate.
Months later, the Rajapaksa-led Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna party crushed the opposition in parliamentary elections, helping his brother Mahinda become prime minister.
""We will ensure (Sri Lanka) will not stand disappointed during our tenure,"" Mahinda said after his victory in 2020. The island nation was already on the path to crisis by then.
DEBT AND DEMONSTRATIONS
Historically Sri Lanka has had weak finances where expenditure has exceeded income.
Some critics say that frailty was compounded when Gotabaya enacted deep tax cuts soon after taking office, only for the COVID-19 pandemic to further decimate the tourism-reliant economy.
Despite vocal appeals from some experts and opposition leaders, the government declined help from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for months, even as the financial crisis worsened, leaving foreign exchange reserves perilously low.
They stood at around $2.31 billion as of February, while Sri Lanka faces debt payments of around $4 billion during the rest of this year.
After a shift in stance, Sri Lanka is due to start talks with the IMF this month.
In a televised address in mid-March, Gotabaya said he understood the pain that ordinary Sri Lankans were facing, as imports stalled because of the lack of foreign exchange and as inflation rocketed.
""I am well aware of the shortages of essential items and increase in prices,"" he said. ""I am also aware of issues such as gas shortages, fuel shortage and power cuts.""
But he distanced himself from the problems, saying: ""This crisis was not created by me.""
For some protesters and opposition politicians, that changes little.
""The red line has been crossed. Public confidence in this government has dropped to absolute zero,"" said Udaya Gammanpila, a former cabinet minister in the Rajapaksa administration.

Back on Colombo's streets, outside a theatre that bears Mahinda Rajapaksa's name, protester Cooke said the Rajapaksas had to go.
""People are not going to settle for anything other than them all leaving,"" she said. ""They want all of them out.""

LAS VEGAS (Reuters) -Multi-genre artist Jon Batiste won album of the year and R&B duo Silk Sonic took two of the top honors on Sunday at a Grammy awards ceremony that featured a surprise appeal for support from wartime President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine.
Batiste, who leads the band on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" landed five awards overall, including the night's biggest prize for ""We Are,"" a jazz album inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement.
""I believe this to my core - there is no best musician, best artist, best dancer, best actor. The creative arts are subjective,"" Batiste said. ""I just put my head down and I work on the craft every day."" 
Batiste's other wins included best music video for ""Freedom,"" a vibrantly colored tribute to New Orleans, and an award for composing and arranging of songs for animated Pixar movie ""Soul."" 
Silk Sonic, featuring Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak, claimed the song and record of the year awards for their 1970s inspired hit ""Leave the Door Open."" The pair rose from their seats and danced slowly before making their way to the stage.
""We are really trying our hardest to remain humble at this point,"" joked Paak as the pair accepted the second honor.
Olivia Rodrigo, the 19-year-old singer of heartbreak ballad ""drivers license"" on her album ""Sour,"" scored three awards, including best new artist.
""This is my biggest dream come true. Thank you so much!"" Rodrigo said as she held her trophy. 
Midway through the ceremony, host Trevor Noah introduced a video message from Zelenskiy, who contrasted the joy found through music to the devastation caused by Russia's invasion of his country more than a month ago. 
""What is more opposite to music? The silence of ruined cities and killed people,"" Zelenskiy, wearing a green t-shirt, said in a hoarse voice. 
""Fill the silence with your music,"" he added. ""Support us in any way you can. Any, but not silence."" [L2N2W10HZ]
The remarks preceded a John Legend performance that featured two Ukrainian musicians and a Ukrainian poet.
The highest honors in music were postponed from January during a spike in COVID-19 cases and moved from Los Angeles to the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. Stars walked a red carpet and thousands of spectators packed the venue, a contrast to last year's scaled-down outdoor event.
Noah urged the audience to think of the evening as ""a concert where we are handing out awards.""
""We are going to be keeping people's names out of our mouths,"" Noah added, a jab about actor Will Smith, who a week ago slapped comedian Chris Rock at the Oscars and told him not to mention his wife's name. 
Korean pop band BTS, a global phenomenon that has never won a Grammy, left empty-handed again. But the group delivered a high-octane performance of their hit ""Butter,"" dodging laser beams in what looked like a scene out of a heist movie.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Advisers to South Korea's president-elect sought redeployment of U.S. strategic assets, such as nuclear bombers and submarines, to the Korean peninsula during talks held on a visit to Washington, one of the advisers said on Wednesday.
The team of foreign policy and security aides to incoming president Yoon Suk-yeol met U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan as Yoon seeks a more constant security presence to deter threats from North Korea as it steps up weapons tests. 
""Deploying the strategic assets is an important element of reinforcing the extended deterrence, and the issue naturally came up during the discussions,"" Park Jin, a four-term lawmaker who led the delegation, told reporters. 
He added that both sides explored ways to bolster U.S. extended nuclear deterrence at the talks on coordinating efforts against the North Korean threat held on a trip that also aimed to secure an early summit with President Joe Biden. 
A White House official asked about such talks, and whether Washington supported the deployments to South Korea, responded that both sides had ""discussed generally"" the U.S. defence commitments, but did not elaborate. 
Yoon, set to be sworn in on May 10, is mapping out his foreign policy agenda after winning the March 9 election, just as tension flares after neighbouring North Korea launched a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) last month.
The deployment of U.S. bombers, aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines is part of Yoon's election plank promising to ""respond firmly"" to the North's threats.
JOINT DRILLS
Yoon has also vowed to ""normalise"" joint military drills with the United States that were scaled back under outgoing liberal President Moon Jae-in, in a bid to placate Pyongyang and resume stalled talks to rid the peninsula of nuclear weapons. 
North Korea has long denounced the exercises as a rehearsal for war, and the allies have reduced field training and shunned use of major weapons such as bombers and air carriers, focusing instead on computer simulations. 
But Park did not elaborate when asked about plans for regular spring exercises, which domestic media have said could include nuclear bombers for the first time in nearly five years.
""We agreed that what's most important is to maintain deterrence so that we can strongly respond to any possible North Korean provocations,"" he said, whether ICBM launches or psychological warfare in the form of verbal attacks. 
The delegation invited Biden to visit Seoul when he travels to Asia to meet the Quad grouping of nations, which also includes Japan, Australia and India, Park added. 

He also delivered a letter to Biden from Yoon highlighting his ""solid willingness and vision"" to advance ties not only on North Korea but also economic security and other issues, he said. 
Park's name is being floated as a strong candidate to be foreign minister, along with that of Cho Tae-yong, a lawmaker of Yoon's conservative People Power Party (PPP) who was also in the delegation.

Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) last month agreed a three-month plan to try to resolve a long-stalled issue over uranium particles found at old but undeclared sites in the country. Resolving the issue would remove an obstacle to the revival of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. 
""We have handed over the documents on March 20 to the agency. They are reviewing those documents and probably the agency's representatives will travel to Iran for further talks and then the IAEA will present its conclusion,"" Eslami told a televised news conference.
The agency has long said Iran had not given satisfactory answers on those issues, but in early March they announced a plan for a series of exchanges.
IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said last month he will aim to report his conclusion by the June 2022 (IAEA) Board of Governors' meeting, which begins on June 6.

The joint plan will help to secure the nuclear deal, which Washington exited in 2018 and reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran.
Eleven months of indirect talks between Iran and the United States in Vienna on salvaging the 2015 deal have stalled as both sides say political decisions are required by Tehran and Washington to settle the remaining issues.

(Reuters) -The International Space Station (ISS) is set to become busier than usual this week when its crew welcomes aboard four new colleagues from Houston-based startup Axiom Space, the first all-private astronaut team ever flown to the orbiting outpost.
The launch is being hailed by the company, NASA and other industry players as a turning point in the latest expansion of commercial space ventures collectively referred to by insiders as the low-Earth orbit economy, or ""LEO economy"" for short.
Weather permitting, Axiom's four-man team will lift off on Friday at the earliest from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, riding atop a Falcon 9 rocket furnished and flown by Elon Musk's commercial space launch venture SpaceX.
The launch was initially scheduled for Wednesday. An Axiom spokesperson said on Monday the delay would give SpaceX more time to complete pre-launch processing work.
If all goes smoothly, the quartet led by retired NASA astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria would arrive at the space station about 28 hours later as their SpaceX-supplied Crew Dragon capsule docks at ISS some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.
Lopez-Alegria, 63, is the Spanish-born mission commander and Axiom's vice president of business development. He is set to be joined by Larry Connor, a real estate and technology entrepreneur and aerobatics aviator from Ohio designated as the mission pilot. Connor is in his 70s but the company did not provide his precise age.
Rounding out the Ax-1 team are investor-philanthropist and former Israeli fighter pilot Eytan Stibbe, 64, and Canadian businessman and philanthropist Mark Pathy, 52, both serving as mission specialists. Stibbe is set to become the second Israeli in space, after Ilan Ramon, who perished with six NASA crewmates in the 2003 space shuttle Columbia disaster.
The Ax-1 crew may appear to have a lot in common with many of the wealthy passengers taking suborbital rides lately aboard the Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic services offered by billionaires Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson, respectively. But Axiom executives said their mission is more substantive.
""We are not space tourists,"" Lopez-Alegria said during a recent news briefing, adding that the Axiom team has undergone extensive astronaut training with both NASA and SpaceX and will be performing meaningful biomedical research.
'MANY BEGINNINGS'
""It is the beginning of many beginnings for commercializing low-Earth orbit,"" Axiom's co-founder and executive chairman, Kam Ghaffarian, told Reuters in an interview. ""We're like in the early days of the internet, and we haven't even imagined all the possibilities, all the capabilities, that we're going to be providing in space.""
The so-called Ax-1 team will be carrying equipment and supplies for 26 science and technology experiments to be conducted before they are slated to leave orbit and return to Earth 10 days after launch. These include research on brain health, cardiac stem cells, cancer and aging as well as a technology demonstration to produce optics using the surface tension of fluids in microgravity, company executives said. 
Launched to orbit in 1998, ISS has been continuously occupied since 2000 under a U.S.-Russian-led partnership including Canada, Japan and 11 European countries. 
While the space station has hosted visits by civilian visitors from time to time, the Ax-1 mission will mark the first all-commercial team of astronauts to use ISS for its intended purpose as an orbiting laboratory.
They will be sharing the weightless work space alongside seven regular crew members of the ISS - three U.S. astronauts, a German astronaut and three Russian cosmonauts.
Axiom said it has contracted with SpaceX to fly three more missions to orbit over the next two years. NASA selected Axiom in 2020 to design and develop a new commercial wing to the space station, which currently spans the approximate size of a football field. Flight hardware for the first Axiom module is currently undergoing fabrication, the company said. 
Plans call for eventually detaching the Axiom modules from the rest of the outpost when ISS is ready for retirement, around 2030, leaving the smaller Axiom station in orbit as a commercial-only platform, Ghaffarian said. 

Other private operators are expected to place their own stations in orbit once ISS is decommissioned. 
As Kathy Lueders, associate NASA administrator for space operations, described Axiom's role on a recent teleconference with reporters, ""This is going to be an important partnership going forward.""

UNITED NATIONS/LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskiy told the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday that Russia must be held accountable for what he and many Western leaders have called war crimes, as the United States and its allies prepared to expand sanctions.
Six weeks into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Western countries will move to isolate the Russian economy further on Wednesday by adding sanctions targeting Russian financial institutions, state-owned companies and government officials, as well as banning new investment in Russia, the White House said.
The West's punishment of Moscow over its actions in Ukraine has been given new impetus this week following the discovery of civilians shot dead at close range in the Ukrainian town of Bucha seized from Russian forces.
Between 150 and 300 bodies might be in a mass grave by a church in Bucha, north of the capital Kyiv, Ukrainian human rights ombudswoman Lyudmyla Denisova said on Tuesday.
In a live video address from Kyiv, Zelenskiy questioned the value of the 15-member Security Council, which has been unable to take any action over Russia's Feb. 24 invasion because permanent member Moscow is a veto power.
""We are dealing with a state that turns its veto at the U.N. Security Council into the right to (cause) death,"" Zelenskiy said. ""Russia wants to turn Ukraine into silent slaves.""
Responding to Zelenskiy, Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the Council that Russian troops were not targeting civilians.
The Kremlin said allegations that Russian forces had executed civilians in Bucha were a ""monstrous forgery"" staged by the West to discredit it.
Russia says it launched a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine to demilitarize and ""denazify"" a country that President Vladimir Putin regards as an illegitimate state. 
The Kremlin's position is rejected by Ukraine, a parliamentary democracy, and the West as a pretext for an unprovoked invasion that has uprooted a quarter of the country's population. 
The ambassador for Russia's strategic partner China told the Security Council the reports and images showing civilian deaths in Bucha were ""very disturbing"" but said the circumstances should be verified and any accusations should be based on facts.
Ambassador Zhang Jun urged the United States, NATO and the EU to pursue dialogue with Russia rather than further sanctions he said were not effective in solving the crisis. 
SOUTH AND EAST
The tense Security Council meeting came amid heavy fighting in Ukraine's south and east as Russia shifts its offensive away from Kyiv after failing to capture any major cities. 
In the besieged southern port of Mariupol, where tens of thousands are trapped with scant access to food or water, a Dominica-flagged cargo ship sank on Tuesday after being targeted by Russian missile strikes, the vessel's flag registry said. 
One of the 12 crew members required medical treatment while the others were evacuated onto nearby vessels, the registry said. The ship was believed to have been without cargo.
Russia did not respond to a request for comment. Its armed forces said on Tuesday they had shot down two Ukrainian military transport helicopters that were trying to leave the city. Ukraine's armed forces general staff said attacks in Mariupol were continuing, but did not give any details. 
In the east, where Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv has been among Russia's main targets, the general staff said Ukrainian forces had destroyed three Russian tanks and around 20 other armoured vehicles. 
BURYING THE DEAD
Reuters has seen at least four victims shot through the head in Bucha, one with their hands tied behind their back. Residents have recounted cases of several others slain, some shot through their eyes and one apparently beaten to death and mutilated.
On Tuesday, Ukrainian Serhii Lahovskyi buried the corpse of a childhood friend who had been shot through the mouth at very close range after disappearing when Russian troops occupied the town.
Lahovskyi and others grabbed shovels and dug a shallow grave on a grass verge. They used a carpet to carry the remains, placing him in a ditch before covering him with wooden boards and shovelling earth on top. 
""Why did these animals shoot him so?"" Lahovskyi said, sobbing. ""This is not Russia, this is a monster.""
Reuters could not independently verify the details of Lahovskyi's account or who was responsible for the killings in Bucha. 
CASTING SANCTIONS NET WIDER
U.S. officials said new economic restrictions on Russia following Bucha would be taken in ""lockstep"" with other Group of Seven advanced economies and the EU. 
Proposed EU sanctions, which the bloc's 27 member states must approve, would bar Russian imports worth 9 billion euros ($9.8 billion) and exports to Russia worth 10 billion euros, including semiconductors and computers, and stop Russian ships entering EU ports. 
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said it was working on banning oil imports, too. 
Europe, which obtains about a third of its natural gas from Russia, has been wary of the economic impact a total ban on Russian energy - which Ukraine maintains is vital to securing a peace deal - would bring.
A proposed EU ban on Russian coal would be worth around 4 billion euros a year, von der Leyen said - tiny in comparison with last year's 100 billion euros in oil and gas imports from Russia.

But signalling strengthening EU resolve, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the coal ban was the first step towards an embargo on all fossil fuel imports from Russia.

264,"<span>Apr 05, 2022 05:50PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - A federal jury ended a second day of deliberations on Tuesday in the trial of four men charged with plotting to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, weighing whether they are guilty of domestic terrorism or victims of entrapment and prosecutorial overreach.
In closing arguments on Friday, a government prosecutor described the defendants as ""paranoid"" and bent on sparking a civil war by abducting Whitmer and holding her accountable for placing restrictions on social and business activities due to COVID-19.
Defense attorneys said their clients were coerced into discussing the plot by FBI informants and never made concrete plans on their own. 
The case has cast a spotlight on two of the militant right-wing organizations that have emerged in the years since former President Donald Trump's election in 2016. It also highlights the extent to which the pandemic and government efforts to control it have become a wedge issue in U.S. politics, pushing some people to extremes.
All four of the defendants - Adam Fox, Brandon Caserta, Barry Croft Jr. and Daniel Harris - have been charged with kidnapping conspiracy. Fox, Croft and Harris were also charged with conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction. 
If convicted the men could spend the rest of their lives in prison. 
On Monday, the 12-person jury ended the first day of deliberations without reaching a verdict. 
At about 3 p.m., jurors asked U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker, ""What's a weapon?"" - an apparent reference to the weapon of mass destruction charge. 
Jonker answered that a weapon is anything that can be used to ""destroy, injure or kill someone or something, as opposed to something you would use for fun,"" the Detroit Free Press newspaper reported.
Fox allegedly ordered $4,000 worth of explosives from an undercover FBI agent posing as a co-conspirator, according to the indictment. The document also accused Fox and Harris of making payments for the explosives.
Two other men who were initially charged - Ty Garbin and Kalen Franks - struck plea deals and served as star witnesses for the prosecution during the trial. Garbin is currently serving a six-year sentence, while Franks awaits sentencing.
The four men on trial, plus Garbin and Franks, are among 13 who were arrested in October 2020 and charged with state or federal crimes in the alleged kidnapping conspiracy. Seven of them are facing charges in state court.
The FBI said it had begun tracking the group's movements after seeing online discussions that included posts about the violent overthrow of some state governments. The group's goal was to end curbs on social and business activities imposed during the coronavirus pandemic. 

Prosecutors have also accused them of wanting to start a second American civil war, while defense attorneys have said their clients were often high on drugs and prone in ""crazy"" talk rather than concrete action.
Harris, Caserta and an undercover informant who testified at the trial were members of the Wolverine Watchmen, a militia group, prosecutors say. Croft and Fox were members of the ""Three Percenters,"" a similar far-right organization.

BUCHAREST (Reuters) -The United States will ask the U.N. General Assembly to suspend Russia from the Human Rights Council, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said on Monday, after Ukraine accused Russian troops of killing dozens of civilians in the town of Bucha.
A two-thirds majority vote by the 193-member assembly in New York can suspend a state for persistently committing gross and systematic violations of human rights.
""Russia's participation on the Human Rights Council is a farce,"" U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said on a visit to Romania.
""And it is wrong, which is why we believe it is time the UN General Assembly vote to remove them."" 
Ukraine said that it will use all ""available UN mechanisms"" to collect evidence on Russia's crimes in the country.
""No place for Russia on the UN Human Rights Council,"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said.
Thomas-Greenfield said she wants to have the vote this week.
Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, the Assembly has adopted two resolutions denouncing Russia with 140 votes in favour. Moscow says it is carrying out a ""special operation"" to demilitarise Ukraine.
""My message to those 140 countries who have courageously stood together is: the images out of Bucha and devastation across Ukraine require us to now match our words with action,"" Thomas-Greenfield told reporters on a visit to Romania.
In New York, a visibly irritated Vassily Nebenzia, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, called the attempt to exclude Russia from the council as ""unbelievable"", adding that it was not going to be helpful for peace talks.
""This is again unprecedented and this will not facilitate or encourage or be helpful to what is happening between Russia and the Ukrainian peace talks,"" Nebenzia said at a press conference.
He repeated Russian denials of the accusations of atrocities in Bucha, saying the footage presented was ""staged."" He said Russia was going to present more evidence on the issue at Tuesday's planned U.N. Security Council meeting. 
Bucha's deputy mayor said around 50 bodies found after Russian forces withdrew were the victims of extra-judicial killings by Russian troops.
Reuters was not able to independently verify who was responsible for killing those Bucha residents.
Ukrainian authorities said they were investigating possible war crimes there. The Kremlin denied accusations related to the murder of civilians in the town. 
Russia is in its second year of a three-year term on the 47-member council, which cannot make legally binding decisions but its decisions send important political messages and it can authorise investigations.
Last month it opened an investigation into allegations of rights violations, including possible war crimes, in Ukraine since Russia's invasion. Thirty-two members voted in favour of the resolution, brought by Ukraine. Russia and Eritrea voted against while 13, including China, abstained.

The United States has said war crimes have been committed in Ukraine and U.S. experts were gathering evidence to prove it.
The General Assembly has previously suspended a country from the council. In March 2011, it unanimously suspended Libya because of violence against protesters by forces loyal to then leader Muammar Gaddafi.

LIMA, Argentina (Reuters) - Argentina is pushing China to fully finance a new $8.3 billion nuclear power plant in the country, as the government grapples with high debt levels and looks to bring down its fiscal deficit as part of a recent deal with the International Monetary Fund.
The South American nation signed an agreement with the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) for construction of a nuclear power plant in February. CNNC at the time said it would finance 85% of the cost, with Argentina shouldering the rest.
The country, however, now faces a tighter fiscal outlook. It needs to hit a fiscal balance by 2025 from a 3% deficit last year under terms of a recent $44 billion IMF program, including cutting billions of dollars in energy subsidies.
""We're aiming for 100% in terms of financing from China to guarantee no delays given the problems we have with funding,"" said Jorge Sidelnik, executive director of Argentina's state operator Nucleoelectrica Argentina, the local partner.
The Argentina firm operates the three existing nuclear power plants in the country. The new plant, Atucha III, will be built on the same 50-hectare (123.5 acres) site as the existing Atucha I and Atucha II plants near the city of Lima in Buenos Aires province.
The new plant will require 99 months of construction work, Sidelnik said during a tour of the facilities, and will help the country raise the nuclear share of Argentina's installed power to 8% in coming years, from around 4% currently.
Atucha I, the first nuclear power plant in Latin America, has an electrical output of 362 megawatts; Atucha II 745 megawatts; and Embalse in Cordoba province 656 megawatts.
The new plant would add another 1,200 megawatts, employ some 7,000 people in its construction and require about 700 employees to run it.

Sidelnik said the aim was to sign the final agreement by the end of 2022, once nine pre-existing conditions established in February were met, including financing, an environmental impact study, which has already been carried out, and a public hearing.
""This input reactor is going to last 60 years, the projections are 80 years, so it is an important long-term business,"" Sidelnik said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Tuesday that Western allegations Russian forces committed war crimes by executing civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha were a ""monstrous forgery"" aimed at denigrating the Russian army.
Since Russian troops withdrew from towns and villages around the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, Ukrainian troops have been showing journalists corpses of what they say are civilians killed by Russian forces, destroyed houses and burnt-out cars.
The West says the dead civilians are evidence of war crimes. Reuters saw dead bodies in the town of Bucha but could not independently verify who was responsible for the killings.
""It is a simply a well-directed - but tragic - show,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. ""It is a forgery aimed at denigrating the Russian army - and it will not work.""
""We once again urge the international community: detach yourself from such emotional perceptions and think with your head,"" Peskov said. ""Compare the facts and understand what a monstrous forgery we are dealing with.""
Ukraine says Russia is guilty of genocide and U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of war crimes and called for a trial.
The Kremlin said Biden's remarks were unacceptable and unworthy of a leader of the United States.
The outcry over the discovery of so many dead civilians, some shot in the head, after Russia's withdrawal from areas around Kyiv, has prompted Western promises to impose even tougher sanctions on Russia.
The European Commission is to propose sweeping new sanctions against Russia, including a ban on imports of coal, rubber, chemicals and other products, an EU source told Reuters.
Russia's economy is already heading for its biggest economic contraction since the years following the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union after the West largely cut Russia out of the Western financial system and sanctioned its richest businessmen.
RUSSIA SAYS FAKES 
Russia casts the evidence of civilian executions in Bucha as a cynical ploy by Ukraine and its Western backers, who Moscow says are gripped by discriminatory anti-Russian paranoia.
""These are fakes that matured in the cynical imagination of Ukrainian propaganda,"" Dmitry Medvedev, who served as president from 2008 to 2012 and is now deputy secretary of Russia's Security Council, said of Bucha.
Medvedev said the fakes had been concocted for vast amounts of money by Western public relations companies and ""tame"" non-governmental organisations. He did not provide specific evidence.
He suggested that Ukrainian forces had been prepared to kill their own citizens in a bid to discredit Russia.
Russia's defence ministry said it had evidence that the 72nd Ukrainian Main Center for Psychological Operations had helped stage such propaganda in a village 23 km (14 miles) northwest of Kyiv as well as in Sumy, Konotop, and other towns.
Russia has not published evidence for its claims but it says Western media have provided an excessively partial narrative of the war in Ukraine that largely ignores Russia's concerns about the enlargement of NATO and the persecution of Russian speakers.
""The collective West has blinkered its eyes and ears and doesn't want to listen to anything,"" Peskov said.
Moscow has questioned why, if its forces withdrew from Bucha on March 30 and the mayor of Bucha declared the area free of Russian forces on March 31, that the bodies of dead civilians were only shown for the first time on April 3.
Russia also says the bodies shown in some footage did not show characteristic signs of degradation that would be expected after a number of days.
Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Moscow had to defend Russian-speaking people in Ukraine from persecution.

Ukraine has dismissed Putin's claims of persecution and says Russia is fighting an unprovoked war of aggression.

(Reuters) -The world's cities are a big driver of planet-warming emissions, but can play a major role in addressing climate change in the near future. 
U.N. scientists on Monday laid out ways to rein in emissions and curb climate change, including a chapter on actions that city planners can follow.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report found urban infrastructure and activities caused about two-thirds of today's emissions.
That means that cities can potentially ""solve two-thirds of the problem. So that's pretty exciting,"" said Yale University geographer Karen Seto, a lead author of the chapter. 
Many cities are already acting. London has introduced fees on highly polluting vehicles in the city center, and Paris has outlawed diesel cars. 
Other actions cities can take include improving energy efficiency in buildings, designing streets to avoid traffic congestion, planting ""green roofs"" and incorporating more parks and trees that help remove some carbon dioxide emissions and also help to keep cities cooler, the report says. 
Planning for and encouraging population density is recommended to prevent rural and suburban sprawl, which is less energy efficient and destroys natural habitats.
""The 21st-century will be the urban century, defined by a massive increase in global urban populations,"" the report said. About 55% of the world's population lived in cities in 2018, a figure expected to jump to 68% by 2050 - with Asian and African cities seeing the biggest increases.
Climate-friendly urban policies would also improve public health by reducing air pollution, the report said.

For the world to have a chance of limiting global warming to within 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of pre-industrial levels, cities need to act fast - and financing would need to be boosted significantly, the report says. 
Cities in 2020 were responsible for up to 72% of global greenhouse gas emissions, up from 62% in 2015. Aggressive climate action could bring city emissions to net-zero by 2050. But failing to act could instead see urban emissions double in that time, the report said.

(Reuters) -Drastic cuts to fossil fuel use. Growing forests and eating less meat. These are just some of the actions needed in this decade to contain global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial temperatures, a major report by the U.N. climate science agency said Monday. 
Despite climate change warnings issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6wg3/pdf/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FinalDraft_FullReport.pdf since 1990, global emissions have continued to rise in the last decade, reaching their highest point in history.
The result: global emissions are on track to blow past the 1.5 degrees C warming limit envisioned in the 2015 Paris Agreement and reach some 3.2 degrees C by century's end. 
""We left COP26 in Glasgow with a naive optimism, based on new promises and commitments,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said with the report's release. ""But current climate pledges would (still) mean a 14% increase in emissions. And most major emitters are not taking the steps needed to fulfill even these inadequate promises."" 
At this point, only severe emissions cuts in this decade across all sectors, from agriculture and transport to energy and buildings, can turn things around, the report says. Even then, governments would also need to bolster efforts to plant more trees and develop technologies that could remove some of the carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere after more than a century of industrial activity.
""It's now or never,"" IPCC report co-chair Jim Skea said in a statement with the report – the last in a three-part series by the IPCC, with the next review cycle not expected for at least another five years.
DRAMA AND DELAY 
While other recent IPCC reports addressed the latest findings in climate change science as well as ways for the world to adapt to a warmer world, Monday’s tackled ways of curbing emissions – making it one of the more contentious reports of the pack for governments. 
Some scientists described the process as ""excruciating,"" and the IPCC was forced to delay the report's public release by six hours on Monday. 
Final approval of the report's key summary for policymakers - which requires sign-off from all countries - followed a marathon weekend overtime session as government officials quibbled over the wording.
""Different countries have different interests,"" IPCC co-author and climate scientist Jan Minx. ""Everyone wants to make sure that their concerns are addressed ... but scientists have the last word."" 
Upon the report’s release, EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans urged European policymakers to redouble efforts to end reliance on Russian coal, gas and oil. 
""The war in Ukraine has only increased our sense of urgency because now nobody can find an excuse, in my view, to not speed up the end of the overuse of fossil fuels,"" Timmermans told the European Parliament. ""We cannot continue to import massive amounts of fossil fuels.""
CUTTING DEMAND
While past IPCC reports on mitigating carbon emissions tended to focus on the promise of sustainable fuel alternatives, such as solar and wind power, the new report uniquely highlights a need to cut consumer demand. 
""Most people assumed that demand reduction could be accomplished through efficiency improvements,"" said economic anthropologist Jason Hickel at the London School of Economics. ""But the evidence we have now suggests that will not be enough in and of itself.""
Without shrinking energy demand, the report notes, reducing emissions rapidly by the end of this decade to keep warming below 1.5 degrees C will be almost impossible. 
""Accepting a lower consumption lifestyle is almost the only fast-acting policy move we have left to prevent the disastrous impacts of climate change,"" said Daniel Quiggin, an environmental researcher at the UK policy institute Chatham House. 
This ""demand-side mitigation,"" as the report puts it, places the onus on governments to pass policies that incentivize sustainable choices. One example would be investing in bike lanes and public transport while blocking cars from city centres to sway public choice. 

Such action may slow economic growth by a few percentage points in the short term, the report said, but those losses would be outweighed by economic benefits from preventing extreme climate change. 
A decade ago, demand reduction was ""politically unpalatable,"" Quiggin said. ""But now, with both the pandemic and Russia-Ukraine crisis, we’re seeing ... the beginning of political willingness. When people truly appreciate the scale of a crisis and the problems it can create, they are willing to reduce consumption.""

(Reuters) - America’s most prominent conservative gathering, founded on ideals of personal liberty and limited government, convenes in Budapest next month to celebrate a European leader accused of undermining democracy and individual rights.
The May meeting of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) is seen by some Republicans as a test of how closely American conservatives are willing align themselves with a global movement of far-right, Russia-friendly strongmen embraced by former U.S. President Donald Trump.
The event’s keynote speaker is Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a longtime supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The European Union has accused Orban, who won re-election by a large margin on Sunday, of curbing media and judicial independence, enriching associates with public funds and recasting election laws to entrench his power.
Hungary joined in the EU sanctions imposed on Moscow in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But Orban has stopped short of criticizing Putin directly, barred weapons shipments through Hungary to neighboring Ukraine and opposed proposals for EU sanctions on Russian natural gas.
The Hungary meeting reflects a years-long push by CPAC’s organizers, the American Conservative Union (ACU), to promote Trump’s divisive brand of nationalist populism to foreign audiences. Last fall, a similar CPAC-branded meeting was held in Brazil, spotlighting Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right leader and Putin admirer.
A Trump spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. An Orban spokesperson called the EU's criticism of him “politically-ideologically based” and part of a long-running “provocation campaign and witch hunt” by liberal elites.
The Hungary gathering spotlights an emerging split among Republicans. While some have grown more tolerant of Putin and other foreign leaders with authoritarian tendencies, others are alarmed at the association.
Al Cardenas, who served as ACU’s chairman from 2011 to 2014, called CPAC’s embrace of Orban troubling, noting the Hungarian leader’s close ties to Putin, “the most dangerous adversary of the free world.”
“Orban is no friend of democratic nations, and any gestures or cooperation with USA nonprofits sends the wrong signal to the rest of the world, especially in the midst of the Russia-Ukraine war,” said Cardenas, who was also once head of Florida’s Republican Party.
On one side of the Republican split are traditional anti-authoritarian conservatives, who value personal freedoms, limited government and free markets, says Gregg Keller, who was ACU’s executive director from 2011 to 2014, working alongside Cardenas, and now heads the Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) Strategy Group, a political consulting firm. Keller describes this typically older group as “Reagan internationalist-type folks.”
Their ideology increasingly clashes with Trump’s strongest supporters, who Keller describes as “more populist, younger, isolationist folks,” who view Putin’s attack on Ukraine as “none of our concern.” Many Trump backers admire Orban for using his political dominance to push a conservative cultural agenda, from immigration crackdowns to restrictions on LGBTQ rights.
With CPAC Hungary, Keller said, ""you’re seeing those two opposing views very much go head-to-head.”
The ACU, which has condemned Putin’s war, has received requests to host similar CPAC gatherings in dozens of other countries where like-minded groups have offered to co-sponsor events, said ACU Executive Director Daniel Schneider. He said the organization has heard from potential sponsors in Slovakia, Kenya, Mongolia, Guatemala and other locales.
The foreign co-hosts of CPAC events cover the cost of the offshore meetings, Schneider said. The Budapest conference is co-hosted by a Hungarian think tank that receives funding from Orban’s government; the Brazil meeting was co-hosted by a Brazilian think tank owned by Eduardo Bolsonaro, the president’s son and a far-right Brazilian lawmaker.
CPAC Hungary, scheduled for May 18-20, marks its first meeting in Europe and its fifth foreign gathering since the ACU first took the conference abroad to Japan in 2017.
Some U.S. conservatives are concerned about CPAC’s reliance on foreign sponsors and the exposure those groups get to influential conservative officials and leaders.
In February, a Republican strategist filed an anonymous complaint to the U.S. Justice Department, alleging that the ACU and its leaders have violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) by failing to report money they accept from foreign organizations while promoting those groups’ interests to U.S. audiences. The written complaint, reviewed by Reuters, essentially serves as a formal request for a federal investigation. The Justice Department declined to confirm or deny whether it was investigating.
The complaint charges that foreign hosts of at least three overseas CPAC meetings, including CPAC Hungary, provided more than $150,000 in sponsorships for CPAC’s marquee U.S. meeting in February in Orlando, Florida. The complainant, a longtime CPAC attendee, expressed disappointment in an interview with Reuters over “how ACU has monetized CPAC to foreign actors” and given them a platform in the United States.
The ACU’s Schneider called the allegations “ludicrous.” CPAC’s international outreach, he said, aims to forge bonds with fellow conservatives around its “freedom and liberty” philosophy and has nothing to do with promoting foreign interests.
RIGHT-WING ‘REALIGNMENT’
Launched in 1974, the annual CPAC conference has grown from a confab of conservative thinkers and politicians to a jamboree of right-wing celebrities and activists. With Trump’s rise to power, the conferences morphed from a bastion of traditional conservatism into a promotional vehicle for the populist president. The ACU has continued touting Trumpism since he lost the 2020 election and launched his campaign to overturn the results based on false voting-fraud claims.
“We're almost seeing a political realignment in real time"" on the American right, said Erick Erickson, a prominent conservative commentator, “and so much of it is in Donald Trump's shadow.”
While old-school conservatives are deeply skeptical of government power, Erickson said, Trump has inspired national populists ""who want a strong central government that can impose their will on the country.” Many of them believe traditional conservatism has failed to stop the advancement of left-wing culture, Erickson said, and “they want to move on to something new.”
Orban was the first European leader to endorse Trump’s 2016 presidential bid. He is among an array of hardline leaders, including Putin, whom Trump has publicly admired. Trump recently endorsed Orban in the April 3 Hungarian election, which Orban won with 53% of the vote against a six-party coalition. 
The Ukraine war initially was seen to have harmed Orban's campaign because of his cozy relationship with Putin. Orban prevailed after arguing that the opposition’s promises to mend ties with the EU could lead Hungary into war with Russia. 
Orban’s politics and policies appear to clash with CPAC’s principles, detailed in a founding charter that celebrates the “inherent rights of the individual through strictly limiting the power of government.” The Hungarian leader has pushed to replace independent news outlets with state-aligned media and installed loyalists to oversee institutions such as the judiciary and chief prosecutor's office.
Orban’s opponents depict him as an authoritarian who exploits power to weaken democracy and reward cronies, accusations Orban denies. The European Union recently froze 7.2 billion euros ($7.9 billion) in subsidies to Hungary and has threatened to halt billions more unless it institutes reforms such as strengthening judicial independence.
Orban’s spokesperson called the withholding of EU funds “outrageous and unjustifiable,” particularly as Hungary confronts the effects of a war just over its border.
Many U.S. conservatives have come to envy Orban’s use of government power to impose a conservative cultural agenda, said Kim Lane Scheppele, a Princeton University professor of sociology and international affairs who studies Hungarian politics. ""Hungary has become, for the Trumpist Republicans, what Sweden used to be for the social democrats – it's proof of concept,"" Scheppele said.
Orban touts what he calls ""illiberal democracy"" and depicts himself as a Christian defender of European heritage. He uses anti-immigration policies to repel Muslim migrants and rejects liberal European positions on social issues, such as adoption by gay couples.
Rod Dreher, a columnist at The American Conservative, sees Orban’s Hungary as a model for post-Trump conservatism. Dreher, whose latest book, “Live Not By Lies,” was translated into Hungarian, took a selfie with Orban on a recent visit to Budapest and tweeted it with the message, ""Hey haters!""
“Orban, unlike so many of our own conservative politicians, understands that we are in a battle to defend our civilization – and he fights like it,” Dreher said, adding that CPAC Hungary will show American conservatives ""what nationalist, populist conservative governance can be.”
FUNDING FROM ORBAN’S OFFICE
Miklos Szantho heads the Center for Fundamental Rights, the Orban-backed think tank hosting the conference. In an interview with Reuters, Szantho ticked off shared interests of conservatives internationally: “our Judeo-Christian heritage, national identity, state sovereignty, the family, the created nature of Man and Woman.”
The Budapest-based center said it first approached the ACU about three years ago to discuss hosting CPAC. The center, which describes itself as a research institute, focuses largely on promoting Orban’s policies. Its website decries ""overgrown human rights-fundamentalism and political correctness,” and its director, Szantho, appears regularly on Hungarian TV as a pro-Orban pundit.
The center received large donations from Orban’s government, according to public records reviewed by Reuters. It is run by a company called Jogallam es Igazsag Nonprofit Kft (JIN Kft). JIN Kft is owned by Szantho, who set it up in 2013 with the help of funding from a foundation linked to Orban's ruling party, Fidesz. In 2020, the Prime Minister's Office gave the company 2.3 billion forints ($7.2 million), according to the office's annual report. The same year, JIN Kft received 720 million forints ($2.3 million) from a foundation also funded by Orban's government, according to the documents.
Neither the center nor the Prime Minister’s Office responded to requests for comment on the organization's funding or its relationship to Orban’s government. 
Some U.S. conservatives are wary of CPAC’s association with foreign groups underwriting its conferences. 
“There are downsides to going international,’’ David Keene, the ACU’s chair from 1984 to 2011, said in an interview. Citing controversies surrounding Orban’s policies and his ties to Putin, Keene said such partnerships risk aligning CPAC with groups and agendas that run counter to its principles.
Schneider, the current ACU executive director, said foreign co-hosts are assessed for “philosophical alignment.”

Szantho said CPAC Hungary will attract ""preeminent conservative politicians and intellectuals” worldwide. The center has revealed only a few speakers, including Orban, Eduardo Bolsonaro, the Brazilian president’s son, and Santiago Abascal, leader of Spain's far-right Vox party. Reuters could not confirm whether the announced speakers would attend or whether they would be joined by any prominent U.S. conservatives.
Orban remains the biggest draw. ""In my eyes,"" said Szantho, ""if a prime minister attends a conference, that shows (the) conference is important.""

272,"<span>Apr 05, 2022 04:52AM ET</span>","ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey and the United States announced the culmination of months of talks to set up a procedure for improving their strained ties, eyeing cooperation in the areas of economy and defence.
Ministerial discussions will follow, the two sides said in a joint statement on Monday. That confirmed the progress, since talks at ministerial level have been the intended format for the attempt at repairing relations.
Ties between Ankara and Washington have been strained over such issues as Turkey's acquisition of S-400 missile defence systems from Russia, policy differences in Syria, Libya and the eastern Mediterranean, and judicial matters.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and U.S. President Joe Biden agreed in October to undertake the ""Strategic Mechanism"" talks for which officials have now cleared the way. 
On Monday, U.S. Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland met Turkish officials ""to review topics of mutual interest"", such as economic and defence cooperation, counter-terrorism, and regional and global developments, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the joint statement said.
""The United States and Turkey look forward to a Ministerial-level meeting within the framework of the Strategic Mechanism later in 2022,"" it added, without elaborating.
Before that, U.S. Department of Commerce Under Secretary Marisa Lago would visit Ankara on Tuesday ""to advance the economic and trade cooperation goals of the Strategic Mechanism.""
The United States sanctioned the Turkish defence industry in December 2020 over the S-400s and has expelled its ally from its F-35 fighter jet programme. Ankara has called the moves unjust, but the allies have since been working to set aside differences and focus on cooperation, including on Ukraine.
Turkey, which shares a border with Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea and has good ties with both, has been mediating to end the conflict between them. It has supported Kyiv but also opposed sanctions on Moscow. 

""The United States welcomed Turkey's efforts to facilitate a just, negotiated diplomatic solution to end the war,"" the joint statement said
As part of her talks in Ankara, Nuland also met with Ibrahim Kalin, Erdogan's chief foreign policy advisor, his office said.

BUCHA, Ukraine (Reuters) - A man lay sprawled by the roadside in the Ukrainian city of Bucha on Sunday, his hands tied behind his back and a bullet wound to his head, one of hundreds of local residents that officials say have been found dead in the wake of five weeks of Russian occupation.
Bucha's deputy mayor, Taras Shapravskyi, said 50 of the dead residents, found after Russian forces withdrew from the city late last week, were the victims of extra-judicial killings carried out by Russian troops, and the officials have accused Moscow of war crimes.
Russia's defence ministry said in a statement issued on Sunday that all photographs and videos published by the Ukrainian authorities alleging 'crimes' by Russian troops in Bucha were a ""provocation,"" and no resident of Bucha suffered violence at the hands of Russian troops.
Reuters was not able to independently verify who was responsible for killing the dead residents. 
But three bodies seen by Reuters reporters on Sunday -- the corpse with the hands bound and two others which did not have bound hands -- bore bullet shots to the head consistent with what Bucha mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk and his deputy described as executions.
In all three cases, there were no signs of any other significant injuries elsewhere in the body. All three people shot in the head were male, and all three were dressed in civilian clothing.
On the body of the person whose hands were bound, there were powder burn marks on his lips and face. Such marks can mean a person was shot at close range.
The cloth used to bind the man's hands appeared to be a white armband. Russian troops, while they were in Bucha, required that local residents wear the armbands to identify themselves, according to one woman who was still wearing hers.
Reuters sent questions to the Kremlin and the Russian defence ministry about the corpses that its reporters had witnessed, but received no immediate reply.
Russia's defence ministry, in its statement on Sunday said: ""During the time that Russian armed forces were in control of this settlement, not a single local resident suffered from any violent actions."" It added that before Russian troops withdrew on March 30 they delivered 452 tons of humanitarian aid to civilians around the Kyiv region.
Shapravskyi, the deputy mayor, said some 300 people were found dead after the Russian withdrawal. Of these, he said officials so far have logged 50 as executions carried out by Russian forces. Reuters could not independently verify those figures. 
The others were either killed in crossfire, or their deaths are so far unexplained.
""Any war has some rules of engagement for civilians. The Russians have demonstrated that they were consciously killing civilians,"" Fedoruk, the mayor, said as he showed Reuters reporters one of the bodies.
SHALLOW GRAVE
Reuters also spoke to one local resident who described a person being found dead after Russian troops detained them, and another resident who described two people found dead with single gunshot wounds to the head.
Reuters was not able to independently verify the descriptions provided by the residents.
Sobbing as she gestured at her husband's shallow grave, a shot of vodka topped with a cracker resting on freshly dug earth, Tetyana Volodymyrivna recounted an ordeal at the hands of Russian troops in this city 37 km (23 miles) northwest of Kyiv.
She and her husband, a former Ukrainian marine, were dragged from their apartment when Russian troops set up their command centre in their building. The soldiers held them prisoner in the apartment building where they lived.
She said the Russians, when they arrived in the city, asked people who they were, and demanded to see documents. 
She said a fighter with the Russian forces who she believed was from Russia's semi-autonomous Chechnya region warned he would ""cut us up."" She did not say how she knew he was Chechen.
Reuters sent a request for comment to the office of the leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, a Kremlin loyalist, but received no reply.
Tetyana, who identified herself by her first name and patronymic but did not give her family name, was released after being held for four days. Her husband was nowhere to be seen for several days, until she was told about some bodies in a basement stairwell of the building where she and her husband lived.
""I recognised him by his sneakers, his trousers. He looked mutilated, his body was cold,"" she said. ""My neighbor still has a picture of his face. He had been shot in the head, mutilated, tortured."" 
Reuters reviewed the photograph, which showed that the face and body were badly mutilated. The news agency could not determine if there was a bullet wound.
After recovering her husband's body, she and some neighbours buried it in a garden plot near their building, just deep enough ""so dogs wouldn't eat him,"" she said.
Another corpse still lay in the stairwell where her husband was found, a Reuters reporter saw. Local residents covered the body with a bedsheet as a mark of dignity.
""SHOT IN LEFT EYE""
Around the corner, another grave contained the remains of two men, a woman resident told Reuters. She said the men had been taken away by Russian troops. She did not witness them being killed. When the bodies were found, both had been shot through the left eye, she said. Six other residents gathered near the grave said her account was correct.
One of the residents said she recognised one of the dead men as a tenant in the apartment complex, who she said was a retired member of the Ukrainian military. 
Bucha was captured in the days immediately after the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces who swept south, capturing the defunct nuclear reactor at Chernobyl and moving southwards toward the capital.
Bucha and the northern outskirts of nearby Irpin were the point at which the Russian advance from the northwest was halted after they met with unexpectedly fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces.
The area witnessed some of the bloodiest fighting of the battle for the capital, until Russian forces pulled back from north of Kyiv. Moscow said in late March it was regrouping to focus on battles in eastern Ukraine. 
On Saturday, Ukraine said its forces had retaken all areas around Kyiv and that it now had complete control of the capital region for the first time since the invasion.
On Sunday, roads in Bucha were littered with unexploded ordnance. Rockets poked out of the tarmac near burned-out wrecks of tanks. Some residents scrawled ""Beware, mines"" on their walls in chalk after finding booby traps or missiles on their premises.
Resident Volodomir Kopachov said Russians troops had set up a rocket system in a vacant lot next to his garden. When a Reuters reporter visited, boxes of ammunition and spent shell casings littered the ground.
Kopachov, a Ukrainian dog breeder, was in mourning.
He said his 33-year-old daughter, her boyfriend and a friend were shot dead by Russian troops after firing a party streamer towards them just days before the pullback. Kopachov's wife said they fired the streamer as a gesture of defiance, not with the intent of harming the soldiers.
""It is so hard to go through it all,"" said the 69-year-old,"" as 10 Alabai, a breed of prized Central Asian Shepherd dog, barked in his backyard.
Kopachov said he had not ventured beyond the gates of his house for a month. ""They were killing [people] on the spot. No one asked: 'who you are, why you are out?'. The men were simply shot.""
The Kremlin denies that it has invaded Ukraine, saying it is carrying out a ""special military operation"" to degrade the Ukrainian armed forces and is targeting military installations rather than carrying out strikes on civilian areas.

Speaking in Hostomel, near Bucha, on Sunday, Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said: ""This is not a special operation, these are not police actions... These are inhumans who simply committed crimes against civilians.""

ALLONNES, France (Reuters) - For three years, Karim Daoud ran the mosque in this small town in northwest France. He also coached kids’ soccer teams and for more than two decades has worked for the local council's youth services.
Daoud was among those who visited a nearby Catholic church to express solidarity following a deadly Islamist extremist attack at a church in southern France in 2020.
Last October, the interior ministry’s local office gave the 46-year old a medal to recognise his long service as a public employee.
Days later, the local interior ministry office closed the mosque for six months, saying it was promoting “a radical practice of Islam” and “cultivating a feeling of hate towards France,” according to the closure order.
But the mosque’s representatives - who deny the allegations - say the government has provided scant public evidence about the grounds for that decision.
It’s one of a growing number of mosques closed by authorities using an array of powers that rights activists, international organisations - including the United Nations - and members of the Muslim community say give authorities carte blanche to close down places of worship without proper scrutiny and with procedures so opaque the case can’t be overturned.
“It’s Kafkaesque,"" said Fionnuala Ni Aolain, a UN special rapporteur on the protection of human rights while countering terrorism, of the legal procedures used in such cases, which can include evidence where the source isn’t identified. “The flirtation with secretive evidence is in itself worrying, but it also breaches provisions in international treaties” relating to the right to a fair trial and equality before the law, she said.
The Elysee Palace declined to comment for this story. The interior ministry told Reuters that the government has strengthened the ability of authorities to prevent and combat Islamist terrorism over the past five years and that all the legal measures adopted were “done in full respect of the rule of law.” The local interior ministry office declined to comment.
French President Emmanuel Macron, who came to power five years ago on a centrist platform, has toughened his stance on law and order – a hot-button issue in a country that has seen a series of deadly extremist attacks in recent years. Macron is running for re-election this week in a contest where he faces stiff competition from the right.
The 44-year old president has implemented a raft of laws and measures aimed, he says, at tackling violent extremism and Islamist radicals who challenge France’s secular values. But critics say Macron has given outsize powers to security forces and chipped away at democratic protections, leaving Muslims vulnerable to abuse.
Many Muslims now feel France - home to one of the largest Muslim populations in Europe - has become a more hostile place. Interior ministry data shows a sharp increase in anti-Muslim discriminatory and other acts in 2021, even as other faiths saw a decline.
Macron’s government has touted the Allonnes mosque closure as a prime example of its crackdown on what it calls Islamism. French authorities have closed 22 mosques over the past 18 months, according to the interior ministry - which, according to a ministry official, was a marked increase from the combined total over the previous three years. It added authorities have investigated some 90 out France’s total of roughly 2,500 Muslim places of worship on suspicions of spreading “separatist” ideology, which the government says challenges France’s secularism.
On the Allonnes mosque, the interior ministry said authorities provided detailed evidence to the court to support the allegations and that the mosque’s lawyers had the opportunity to challenge it, but were ultimately unsuccessful. 
The prosecutor’s office told Reuters that there was an ongoing judicial investigation into whether leaders or members of the Allonnes mosque association were “advocating terrorism and inciting terrorism,” without naming individuals. No charges have been filed, the prosecutor’s office said.
Daoud, who had been the mosque association’s president, says he has no links to violent extremism, either direct or indirect. Of the mosque’s closure, he said “for me it’s an injustice. It’s a big disappointment with respect to our involvement” with the town.
Nabila Asmane, a lawyer representing the mosque’s leaders, told Reuters that the interior ministry didn’t provide sufficient evidence to substantiate the serious accusations it made as part of its case to close the mosque, that the government’s case was based on false allegations and that the investigation hadn’t been thorough. Asmane added: “It's not the lawyers that failed, but justice.""
France's highest administrative court in November upheld the government’s decision to close the mosque. In January, the government announced the mosque association’s dissolution; an appeal by the mosque leaders in the same court - the Conseil d’Etat - is still pending.
Under the administrative procedures, such as those used with the Allonnes mosque, the closures are temporary. But some mosques don’t re-open, according to rights activists and the interior ministry. The ministry didn’t specify how many of the 22 mosques had reopened.
Macron faces the first round of the presidential election on Sunday, with a run-off scheduled for April 24 if no one wins a simple majority. The president is currently the favourite in opinion polls, but it could be a close race.
‘WHITE MEMO’
In October 2017 - five months after Macron became president - the French parliament adopted a new anti-terrorism law that bolstered police surveillance powers and made it easier to close mosques suspected of preaching hatred, with limited judicial oversight. It replaced the state of emergency that had been imposed in late 2015 after militants killed 130 people in coordinated attacks across Paris.
Macron said at the time that “jihadist terrorism” remained the biggest security threat to France.
Under the 2017 law, the interior ministry has the power to close places of worship for up to six months if there are suspicions that they are being used to propagate hate speech or incite violence, provoke acts of extremist violence or justify terrorist acts. Religious sites can appeal closures via France’s administrative court system, which handles disputes between citizens and public bodies. Administrative proceedings typically don’t involve witnesses being called.
In Allonnes, in the suburbs of Le Mans, the mosque has for the last decade or so been based in a low-rise, nondescript, modern building. Some 250 people used to pray at the mosque, according to Daoud.
On October 11, 2021, the local interior ministry’s office notified the leaders of its plans to close the mosque, which it did two weeks later.
Interior minister Gerald Darmanin highlighted the government’s move on social media. “The sermons preached in this mosque legitimized in particular the use of armed jihad while cultivating a feeling of hatred towards France,” he said in an October 26 Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post.
The mosque leaders sought to appeal the move. The French government's case is laid out in a 20-page document called a “note blanche,” or white memo, which was submitted to the administrative court in Nantes the evening before the October 29 hearing, a time stamp on it shows.
A white memo is a document composed by French intelligence services and serves as the basis for the closure of the Allonnes mosque. The document, which isn’t publicly available but which Reuters reviewed, doesn’t identify when it was compiled, who by, or where the information came from - as is typically the case with white memos.
It alleges that four people associated with the mosque, including Daoud and another mosque leader, expressed sympathy between September 2020 and April 2021 for two different violent extremist attacks in France.
The white memo also lists five books found at the mosque that it identifies as ""radical."" According to Daoud Riffi, who teaches Islam studies at the Lille Institute of Political Studies, four of them are widely available in specialist bookstores and online. The other one, 'Riyad as-Salihin' or The Gardens of the Righteous, is a 13th century book which is held at the French national library.
The government also alleged in the white memo that preachers told worshippers France was a depraved country that would be punished by Allah, that they glorified armed jihad, and that some worshippers were heard calling for violent combat - without identifying who heard the worshippers say that.
Daoud told Reuters the government’s case misinterprets the term ""jihad,"" which can mean armed combat but is often used to refer to the jihad al-akbar, meaning a non-violent struggle for self-improvement.
Daoud filed a complaint with the prosecutor’s office in December alleging that whoever provided the information to authorities was guilty of slander for falsely accusing him of promoting radical Islam and armed jihad. In the complaint, which was reviewed by Reuters, Daoud denied all links to terrorism. 
Father Gregoire Cador, who had for four years served as the priest at the Catholic church a 10-minute walk from the mosque, said he could not reconcile the allegations with the mosque leaders he knew. “These accusations are a complete surprise to me,"" said Father Cador, who moved to another parish last year.
Reuters spoke to more than a dozen mosque goers and other locals who said mosque leaders and imams appeared to express tolerant views and that they hadn’t heard them use hate speech.
COURT APPEAL
At the October 29 court hearing, Asmane, the lawyer representing the mosque’s leaders, said the allegations were baseless and the closure infringed on rights to freely practice their religion, according to the judge’s ruling dated the same day.
The hearing lasted less than an hour, no witnesses were called and no additional evidence beyond the white memo was presented, Asmane told Reuters.
The judge rejected the appeal on the grounds that the white memo justified the closure, according to the ruling. The document doesn’t identify the judge.
The mosque leaders then brought the case to France's highest administrative court, the Conseil d'Etat in Paris. During a Nov. 26 hearing, which lasted less than two hours and Reuters attended, the interior ministry’s legal representative Pascale Leglise said the white memo represented the “word of the state” and so was sufficient evidence. No witnesses were called.
William Bourdon, another lawyer representing the mosque’s leaders, told the hearing: “We’re in a state of the most complete powerlessness. Because the white memos at times contain real falsifications of the truth, which we cannot contest.” He cited a 2016 case in which the Conseil d’Etat ruled the white memo didn’t constitute sufficient evidence.
The court rejected the mosque’s appeal on the grounds that the white memo did provide sufficient evidence for the authorities’ decision and that the closure doesn’t infringe on religious freedoms, according to the ruling. A spokesperson for the Conseil d’Etat didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Leglise also didn’t respond to requests for comment.
The Allonnes mosque now stands empty, a copy of the closure order posted on the door.
Maryam Gasnier, 63, said she used to share prayers and meals with other women every Friday at the mosque, a three minute walk from her apartment. Now that it's shut, she said she and her friends have been deprived of a social hub.
Najia Zeroual said her daughters - age 14 and 12 - took Arabic classes twice a week at the mosque, but the lessons have now stopped. “If there are people professing jihadist ideas, then they should be dealt with,” she said. “But you should not penalise the youngsters.”
The six-month closure order expires on April 25. In the meantime, some Muslims in Allonnes are trying to form a new association but Daoud says he won’t get involved.

Daoud’s personal assets have been frozen since October under an administrative order issued by the government, on the same grounds as the mosque closure. He still holds the same job at the city's youth service, but doesn't have direct access to his bank account. Household bills are paid automatically from his account and for all other expenses, he said, he has to get by with a 500-euros monthly allowance in cash.
""Everything is done to humiliate us,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of war crimes and called for a trial, adding to the global outcry over civilian killings in the Ukrainian town of Bucha as more graphic images of their deaths emerged.
""You saw what happened in Bucha,"" Biden told reporters after landing in Washington from Delaware, where he had spent the weekend. ""This warrants him - he is a war criminal.""
The discovery of a mass grave and tied bodies shot at close range in Bucha, outside Kyiv, a town Ukrainian forces reclaimed from Russian troops, looked set to galvanize the United States and Europe into imposing additional sanctions against Moscow.
""We have to gather the information. We have to continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons they need to continue the fight. And we have to get all the detail so this can be an actual, have a war crimes trial,"" Biden said. 
The Kremlin categorically denied any accusations related to the murder of civilians, including in Bucha, where it said the graves and corpses had been staged by Ukraine to tarnish Russia.
Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters that the United States will seek information from four sources to build a case for war crimes: the U.S. and its allies, including intelligence services; Ukrainian observations on the ground; international organizations including the United Nations; and interviews from global independent media.
He said the United States would build a case at the International Criminal Court or another venue. The United States is not a party to the ICC.
Russia's permanent membership in the United Nations Security Council means any war crimes accountability could be blocked by Moscow in that body, Sullivan said.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called the killings ""genocide"" in a speech from Bucha on Monday as journalists entered the city and documented its destruction.
U.S. defense officials said the Pentagon could not independently confirm the atrocities.
Sullivan said the United States has yet to see evidence that killings reached the level of genocide. 
It is not the first time Biden has called Putin a war criminal since he invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what Moscow calls a ""special operation."" That designation has damaged U.S.-Russian ties, the Kremlin has said.
Citing what he called ""horrifying"" images, Jim Risch, the leading Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said in a statement: ""The international community must also take concrete steps to hold Putin and his cronies accountable for their war crimes.""

Democrat Bob Menendez, committee chairman, said: ""Putin must be held accountable for this tragic and barbaric assault on innocent civilians.""
Biden's U.N. envoy announced that Washington would also seek Russia's suspension from the U.N. Human Rights Council.

Signed by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on March 28, the Republican-backed law takes effect in July and prohibits classroom discussion on sexual orientation or gender identity for children in kindergarten through third grade, or from about ages 5-9, in public schools. 
Adams, a Democrat, called the Parental Rights in Education law - dubbed the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill by opponents - ""the latest shameful, extremist culture war targeting the LGBTQ+ community."" He assured Floridians that New York City welcomed the LGBTQ+ community.
“Come to a city where you can say and be whoever you want,” Adams said in a statement.
""Today, we say to the families living in fear of this state-sponsored discrimination that you will always have a home in New York City.”
Adams made the announcement at New York's City Hall while standing beside an example of one of the billboards, which he said have been donated and will not cost taxpayers.
""People say a lot of ridiculous things in New York. 'Don't say gay' isn't one of them,"" reads a black and white billboard with ""Don't say gay"" in the rainbow colors of the LGBTQ Pride Flag. 
DeSantis press secretary Christina Pushaw said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that the law was ""defending parental rights"" and if those opposed leave for New York City, which she called ""a crime-ridden dystopia,"" that would only benefit Florida.
DeSantis and other Republican politicians across the United States say they want to give parents more control over what young children learn in school.
The outdoor digital billboards will run for eight weeks starting April 4 in Fort Lauderdale, Jacksonville, Orlando, Tampa and West Palm Beach, Adams said.

Florida parents filed a lawsuit to block the measure, saying it will have the effect of discriminating against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) students. 
They claim it not only violates students' First Amendment right to receive information and ideas, but also is unconstitutionally vague and fails to define what discussion is and is not allowed in schools.

BUCHA, Ukraine (Reuters) - The United States and European countries pledged on Monday to punish Moscow over civilian killings in northern Ukraine, where a mass grave and tied bodies of people shot at close range were found in a town seized back from Russian forces. 
The deaths in Bucha, outside Kyiv, drew pledges of further sanctions against Moscow from the West, possibly including some restrictions on the billions of dollars in energy that Europe still imports from Russia.
The discoveries came against a backdrop of artillery barrages in Ukraine's south and east, where Russia says it is now focusing after it fell short in attempts to take major cities in the heart of the country. 
In a visit to Bucha, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said ""these are war crimes and will be recognised by the world as genocide.""
Russia denied any accusations related to the murder of civilians, including in Bucha. Its envoy to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzya, said Russia will present ""empirical evidence"" to the Security Council on Tuesday showing its forces were not involved in atrocities.
Zelenskiy said the killings had made it harder for Ukraine to negotiate with Russia. Neither side offered updates on peace talks that had been set to resume on Monday. 
Taras Shapravskyi, Bucha's deputy mayor, said around 50 victims of extra-judicial killings by Russian troops had been found there after Kremlin forces withdrew late last week. 
Reuters saw one man sprawled by the roadside, his hands bound behind his back and a bullet wound to his head. Hands and feet poked through red clay at a mass grave by a church where satellite images showed a 45-foot-long trench.
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the evidence of civilian killings was just the ""tip of the iceberg"", with Ukrainian forces yet to reach all areas vacated by Russian troops, and showed the need for tougher sanctions on Moscow.
U.S. President Joe Biden called for a war crimes trial against Russia's President Vladimir Putin, calling him ""brutal"". 
MAKESHIFT BURIALS
Ukrainian authorities said they had found 421 civilian casualties near Kyiv by Sunday and were investigating possible war crimes in Bucha, a description also used by French President Emmanuel Macron and, in reference to Russia's broader offensive, by the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights.
Reuters saw more makeshift burials elsewhere but could not independently verify the number of dead or who was responsible.
In the village of Motyzhyn, west of Kyiv, Reuters reporters saw three bodies in a forest grave. An adviser to Ukraine's interior ministry said the victims were the village's leader, Olha Sukhenko, and her husband and son.
Ihor, a local resident who said he was a relative of the family and did not give his surname, told Reuters: ""I don't know what they were killed for. They were peaceful, kind people.""
Zelenskiy has used the term genocide at various times during the war, decrying what he calls an intent to eliminate the nation by Putin, who has questioned Ukraine's legitimate, independent history from Russia. 
Washington, at Kyiv's request, was backing a multinational team of prosecutors who would help collect and analyse evidence of atrocities with a view towards pursuing accountability, the U.S. State Department said.
Russia rejects allegations of war crimes in what it calls a ""special military operation"" aimed at demilitarising and ""denazifying"" Ukraine. Ukraine says it was invaded without provocation.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Putin and his supporters would ""feel the consequences"" of events in Bucha and that Western allies would agree further sanctions against Moscow in the coming days. The Biden administration said new U.S. sanctions would be announced this week. 
German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht said the European Union must discuss banning Russian gas, though other officials urged caution around measures that could touch off a European energy crisis. 
FLATTENED BY SHELLING
On the other side of the country in Mariupol, a southeastern port that has been under siege for weeks, Reuters images showed three bodies in civilian clothes lying in the street, one against a wall sprayed with blood. 
Outside a damaged apartment building, residents buried other dead in a shell crater. ""It is easier to dig here,"" a resident said, saying four bodies were in the improvised grave. 
Ukraine says it has evacuated thousands of civilians in the past few days from Mariupol, which is surrounded by areas held by Russian-backed separatists in the eastern Donbas region.
A team from the International Committee of the Red Cross was stopped during an attempt to reach Mariupol to evacuate civilians, and is now being held in a nearby town, a spokesperson said. Several previous ICRC attempts to reach the city were unsuccessful.
West of Mariupol, in the town of Mykolaiv, shelling killed ten people, including a child, and injured 46 others, regional administration head Oleksandr Senkevich said. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the report. 
RUSSIAN REDEPLOYMENTS
Ukraine is preparing for what its general staff said were about 60,000 Russian reservists called in to reinforce Moscow's offensive in the east, after Russian forces became bogged down elsewhere in the face of unexpectedly lethal and mobile Ukrainian resistance using Western anti-tank weaponry. 
Officials in Ukraine's northern regions, nearest Russia, said Russian troops there had fully withdrawn or significantly scaled back in number. 
Over the weekend Ukraine said its forces had wrested back all areas around Kyiv, claiming complete control of the capital region for the first time since Russia launched its onslaught. It has since warned of attacks on Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, which abuts the Russian border. 
A senior U.S. defence official said Russia had repositioned about two-thirds of its forces from around Kyiv, with many consolidating in close ally Belarus where they were expected to be resupplied.
Reuters could not independently confirm the statements about Russian troop movements. 

Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said Russia would likely to try to surround and overwhelm Ukrainian troops in eastern Ukraine.
""Russia could then use any tactical success it achieves to propagate a narrative of progress and mask... prior military failure,"" Sullivan said.

279,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 05:16PM ET</span>","WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Russia probably plans to deploy tens of thousands of soldiers in eastern Ukraine as it shifts its focus to the country's south and east, U.S. President Joe Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Monday.
“At this juncture we believe Russia is revising its war aims” to focus on “eastern and parts of southern Ukraine rather than target most of the territory,"" Sullivan told reporters at the White House. 
The goal was likely to ""surround and overwhelm"" Ukrainian forces in the region, he said. “Russia could then use any tactical success it achieves to propagate a narrative of progress and mask ... prior military failure.”
Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion, which began on Feb. 24, is Europe's bloodiest since World War Two. Russia calls it a ""special military operation"" aimed at protecting civilians. 
Sullivan said the Biden administration would announce fresh military assistance for Ukraine in coming days. He said further sanctions against Russian energy are on the table in talks with European allies. 
Sullivan said the next phase may be protracted with Russian troops outnumbering Ukraine's. Moscow would likely seek to control a far broader swath of eastern Ukraine than separatists controlled prior to the invasion, he said.
In the south, Russia will likely seek to hold the city of Kherson to control the flow of water to Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. He said the Kremlin was expected to launch further air and missile strikes across the rest of the country. 

Biden on Monday accused Putin of war crimes and called for a trial, adding to the global outcry over civilian killings in Bucha, a town recaptured by Ukrainian troops as Russian forces regrouped. 
Russia categorically denied murdering civilians, including in Bucha. U.N. envoy Vasily Nebenzya promised Russia would present ""empirical evidence"" to the Security Council that its forces had not been killing civilians.

(Reuters) - A 26-year-old man has been arrested in connection with a shooting in Sacramento, California over the weekend that killed six people and injured 12 others a few blocks from the state capitol.
Dandre Martin was taken into custody on Sunday as a ""related suspect"" in the case, Sacramento police said in a written statement. Martin was booked on suspicion of assault and illegal possession of a firearm.
Police did not elaborate on Martin's alleged role in the shooting or say if they were still searching for additional suspects. Police Chief Kathy Lester has said that ""multiple"" shooters were involved.
The gunfire erupted at about 2 a.m. PT (0900 GMT) on Sunday near the Golden 1 Center, home of the NBA's Sacramento Kings. The Kings held a moment of silence before its Sunday night game against the Golden State Warriors.
Police have said the massacre followed an altercation and asked for the public's help in obtaining videos of that incident that had been posted on social media. The Sacramento Bee newspaper reported that the suspects had been at a nearby nightclub earlier in the evening.
Of the 12 victims who survived, police said the were ""suffering from gunshot wounds ranging from minor to critical but stable.""
Investigators said they found more than 100 spent shell casings at the scene and that one handgun had been recovered following the execution of search warrants.

The violence took place in an area recently revitalized as an entertainment center and just hours after rapper Tyler the Creator had performed at the Golden 1 Center.
The shooting shattered a welcoming atmosphere in California's state capitol as political leaders ease strict COVID-19 orders and bars and restaurants began filling with people long isolated by the pandemic.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Hundreds of Ukrainian refugees who fled to Mexico were transferred to a sports center that was converted into a government shelter in the northern city of Tijuana, authorities said on Monday, as they wait to be allowed to cross the border and enter the United States.
Some 400 Ukrainians, about 30% of whom are children, arrived to Tijuana on Saturday and Sunday after entering the country through airports in Cancun and Mexico City, said Enrique Lucero, Tijuana's migration affairs director.
They joined a growing number of Ukrainians who have escaped war in their home country and have crammed into improvised camps near the international port of entry, which connects Tijuana with California. As of Sunday night, Lucero said an estimated 1,700 Ukrainians have arrived in Tijuana in recent weeks.
""They will continue to arrive,"" Lucero said.
The increase in Ukrainians in Tijuana comes as U.S. officials are ramping up efforts to process migrants and asylum seekers, regardless of nationality, amid an expected increase in arrivals as the United States lifts a pandemic-era policy that effectively shut down asylum at the border.
On Monday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Chris Magnus said in a statement that the agency is ramping up personnel and resources at the southwest border, without providing details about the number of agents being deployed or specific locations for deployments.
Alejandro Mayorkas, secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees CBP, said on Friday that his department has already sent 600 law enforcement officers to the border and would add more as needed.
Lucero said he was hopeful that the U.S. officials would speed up processing of Ukrainian migrants, and that the shelter should ease housing issues until then. 

""This week is key, but the number of those who need a place to stay will decrease"" as U.S. agents increase processing capacity, he said.
U.S. President Joe Biden said in late March that the United States would accept up to 100,000 Ukrainians to resettle in the country this year.

(Reuters) -The International Space Station (ISS) is set to become busier than usual this week when its crew welcomes aboard four new colleagues from Houston-based startup Axiom Space, the first all-private astronaut team ever flown to the orbiting outpost.
The launch is being hailed by the company, NASA and other industry players as a turning point in the latest expansion of commercial space ventures collectively referred to by insiders as the low-Earth orbit economy, or ""LEO economy"" for short.
Weather permitting, Axiom's four-man team will lift off on Friday at the earliest from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, riding atop a Falcon 9 rocket furnished and flown by Elon Musk's commercial space launch venture SpaceX.
The launch was initially scheduled for Wednesday. An Axiom spokesperson said on Monday the delay would give SpaceX more time to complete pre-launch processing work.
If all goes smoothly, the quartet led by retired NASA astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria would arrive at the space station about 28 hours later as their SpaceX-supplied Crew Dragon capsule docks at ISS some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.
Lopez-Alegria, 63, is the Spanish-born mission commander and Axiom's vice president of business development. He is set to be joined by Larry Connor, a real estate and technology entrepreneur and aerobatics aviator from Ohio designated as the mission pilot. Connor is in his 70s but the company did not provide his precise age.
Rounding out the Ax-1 team are investor-philanthropist and former Israeli fighter pilot Eytan Stibbe, 64, and Canadian businessman and philanthropist Mark Pathy, 52, both serving as mission specialists. Stibbe is set to become the second Israeli in space, after Ilan Ramon, who perished with six NASA crewmates in the 2003 space shuttle Columbia disaster.
The Ax-1 crew may appear to have a lot in common with many of the wealthy passengers taking suborbital rides lately aboard the Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic services offered by billionaires Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson, respectively. But Axiom executives said their mission is more substantive.
""We are not space tourists,"" Lopez-Alegria said during a recent news briefing, adding that the Axiom team has undergone extensive astronaut training with both NASA and SpaceX and will be performing meaningful biomedical research.
'MANY BEGINNINGS'
""It is the beginning of many beginnings for commercializing low-Earth orbit,"" Axiom's co-founder and executive chairman, Kam Ghaffarian, told Reuters in an interview. ""We're like in the early days of the internet, and we haven't even imagined all the possibilities, all the capabilities, that we're going to be providing in space.""
The so-called Ax-1 team will be carrying equipment and supplies for 26 science and technology experiments to be conducted before they are slated to leave orbit and return to Earth 10 days after launch. These include research on brain health, cardiac stem cells, cancer and aging as well as a technology demonstration to produce optics using the surface tension of fluids in microgravity, company executives said. 
Launched to orbit in 1998, ISS has been continuously occupied since 2000 under a U.S.-Russian-led partnership including Canada, Japan and 11 European countries. 
While the space station has hosted visits by civilian visitors from time to time, the Ax-1 mission will mark the first all-commercial team of astronauts to use ISS for its intended purpose as an orbiting laboratory.
They will be sharing the weightless work space alongside seven regular crew members of the ISS - three U.S. astronauts, a German astronaut and three Russian cosmonauts.
Axiom said it has contracted with SpaceX to fly three more missions to orbit over the next two years. NASA selected Axiom in 2020 to design and develop a new commercial wing to the space station, which currently spans the approximate size of a football field. Flight hardware for the first Axiom module is currently undergoing fabrication, the company said. 
Plans call for eventually detaching the Axiom modules from the rest of the outpost when ISS is ready for retirement, around 2030, leaving the smaller Axiom station in orbit as a commercial-only platform, Ghaffarian said. 

Other private operators are expected to place their own stations in orbit once ISS is decommissioned. 
As Kathy Lueders, associate NASA administrator for space operations, described Axiom's role on a recent teleconference with reporters, ""This is going to be an important partnership going forward.""

Speaking to reporters at the White House, Sullivan said he had yet to see evidence that Russian atrocities had risen to the level of genocide. He said consultations might take place at the International Criminal Court or another venue. 
The discovery of a mass grave and bodies shot at close range in Bucha, outside Kyiv, a town Ukrainian forces reclaimed from Russian troops, looked set to galvanize the United States and Europe into imposing additional sanctions against Moscow.
Sullivan said Russia's permanent membership in the United Nations Security Council means any war crimes accountability could be blocked by Moscow there, he said. 
Asked whether the killings in Bucha could be on Putin's orders or by Russian forces acting alone, Sullivan said that even before the invasion Washington had warned that Russia was intending “as a matter of policy in this war to kill dissidents” and to “impose a reign of terror across occupied territories in Ukraine.” 

“So, no we do not believe this is a random accident,” he said. ""We believe this was part of the plan.""

Price said images and reports suggest atrocities are not the act of a rogue soldier, but rather part of a ""broader, troubling campaign.""

(Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday called for the prosecution of Russian President Vladimir Putin for war crimes over the discovery in Bucha, Ukraine, of mass graves and bodies of bound civilians shot at close range, but various challenges stand in the way.
IS TARGETING CIVILIANS A WAR CRIME?
Yes. The International Criminal Court in The Hague defines war crimes as ""grave breaches"" of the post-World War Two Geneva Conventions, which lay out humanitarian laws to be followed in war time. Attacking legitimate military targets where civilian casualties would be “excessive” also violates the conventions, legal experts say.
Bucha's deputy mayor said on Sunday that 50 residents had been victims of extra-judicial killings carried out by Russian troops.
The execution of civilians, as alleged in Bucha, is a “quintessential war crime,” said Jonathan Hafetz, an international criminal law and national security scholar at Seton Hall University School of Law.
Russia's defense ministry denies targeting civilians in what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine and says footage and photographs showing bodies in Bucha are ""yet another provocation"" by the Ukrainian government.
HOW WILL INVESTIGATORS COLLECT EVIDENCE?
Investigators will visit scenes such as Bucha and interview witnesses to build a case, experts said.
James Goldston in New York, executive director of the human rights advocacy organization Open Society Justice Initiative, said images and news reports from Bucha will allow investigators in Ukraine to follow up swiftly with survivors of some of the alleged atrocities.
Ukrainian forces have captured Russian soldiers, another avenue for obtaining evidence. 
Some experts said, however, that prosecutors might have a tough time obtaining evidence from an active war zone due to safety concerns and witnesses who could be intimidated or otherwise reluctant to speak.
BUILDING A CASE AGAINST PUTIN AND OTHER HIGHER-UPS
For most war crime charges, investigators must prove intent, and a defendant's guilt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, experts said.
Alex Whiting, a visiting professor at Harvard Law School, said the latest images will make the case easier to prosecute. 
“The question then becomes, who’s responsible and how high up does it go?” he said.
Cases will be easier to build against soldiers and commanders but they can also pursue heads of state, experts said.
A prosecutor could present evidence that Putin or another state leader committed a war crime by directly ordering an illegal attack or knew crimes were being committed and failed to prevent them. 
Experts say it is too soon to say whether the actions in Bucha were directed from the highest levels of the Russian government, but that if similar atrocities are committed elsewhere in Ukraine it could point to a policy or direction from top officials. 
CAN THERE BE A TRIAL 'IN ABSENTIA'?
The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, said on Feb. 28 he had opened a war crimes investigation following the invasion. Although Ukraine and Russia are not members of the court, Ukraine previously approved of an investigation dating back to 2013, which includes Russia's annexation of Crimea.
The ICC will issue arrest warrants if prosecutors can show ""reasonable grounds"" to believe war crimes were committed. 
However, neither Russia nor Ukraine is a member of the ICC, Moscow does not recognize the tribunal and is almost certain to refuse to cooperate.
Any trial would be delayed until a defendant is arrested as the ICC cannot try someone ""in absentia,"" or not physically in custody. 
The ICC can still investigate and issue arrest warrants.
""The mere fact of a public indictment can act to stigmatize the accused and can generate pressure which, over time, may lead to arrest,"" Goldston said.
Aside from the ICC, a separate tribunal could be established like ones set up to prosecute war crimes committed during the Balkan wars in the early 1990s and the 1994 Rwanda genocide. 
Philippe Sands, a professor at University College London, said he is in touch with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba about setting up a tribunal to take up the international charge of a “crime of aggression” by Russia. The ICC cannot take up that charge because it has to involve at least one of the court's member states.
It is unlikely that a tribunal will hold any trials without defendants in custody, as ""in absentia"" trials are frowned upon in international law, said Rebecca Hamilton, a law professor at American University.
HOW LONG COULD A PROSECUTION TAKE?

Legal experts said war crime indictments may come in as few as three to six months, but prosecuting a case can take years.
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia took two years to get a conviction on its first indictment, according to its website. That tribunal indicted its first head of state, then-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, in 1999 and took him into custody in 2001. His trial began in 2002 and was under way when he died at The Hague in 2006.

Reed, 30, from Texas, is serving a nine-year term after being convicted of endangering the lives of two police officers while drunk on a visit to Moscow in 2019. He denied the charges and the United States called his trial a ""theatre of the absurd.""
Reed's (NASDAQ:REED) parents said last week that Reed had gone on hunger strike to protest at being put in solitary confinement and not receiving proper medical care despite fears that he had tuberculosis.
""On Friday, April 1, the convict Reed ended his hunger strike and began to receive food. On the same day, at his request, he was sent to the medical facility,"" the Federal Penitentiary Service was quoted saying by Interfax and RIA.
Reed's health is ""satisfactory"", the prison service was quoted as saying.

""We continue to call on Russian officials to provide adequate medical care immediately or otherwise to release him to the United States to receive the care that he needs,"" Price said.
Reed's lawyers said he had ended the hunger strike after being seen by doctors, and that he required medical treatment, Interfax reported. 
Reed's parents said he had been exposed to an inmate with active tuberculosis in December, but their son had not been tested for the illness despite a rapid deterioration in his health.

The prison service said Reed had gone on hunger strike on March 28 to protest disciplinary action against him. It said he had repeatedly tested negative for tuberculosis and had not come into contact with anyone infected.
Reed also went on hunger strike for almost a week last year to protest his incarceration and violations of his rights, which the prison service denied.

Nikolas Cruz pleaded guilty in November to the premeditated murder of 14 students and three members of the staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, about 30 miles north of Fort Lauderdale. A jury will now determine whether the judge should sentence him to life in prison or the death penalty.
Broward County Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer, who is presiding over the proceedings, said on Monday that jury selection should take until about May 31, according to local media. The penalty phase could last several months, legal experts have said. 
Cruz was a 19-year-old expelled student with a history of mental health and behavioral issues at the time of the killings, prosecutors said last year. 
Under Florida law, a jury must be unanimous in its decision to recommend that a judge sentence Cruz to be executed. If any of the 12 jurors objects, Cruz will be sentenced to life in prison without parole.
Among the mitigating factors the defense will ask the jury to consider are Cruz's brain damage from his mother's drug and alcohol abuse during pregnancy, his long history of mental-health disorders, and allegations he was sexually abused and bullied.

Some of the teenagers who survived Cruz's deadly rampage formed ""March for Our Lives,"" an organization that called for gun control legislation such as a ban on assault-style rifles. 
In March 2018, the group held a nationally televised march in Washington that sparked hundreds of similar rallies worldwide. Cruz was 18 when he legally purchased from a licensed gun dealer the AR-15-style rifle used in the shooting.

Nationalist Orban, who held on to his sweeping majority on Sunday, crushing the opposition despite efforts to unite against him, will likely continue to reject any EU sanctions on Russian oil and gas, arguing they would wreck an economy already slowing due to the impacts of the Ukraine war.
Using his strong mandate, Orban will also entrench his conservative policies at home and could attempt to squeeze out foreign companies in some sectors like retail where Hungarian ownership is still not dominant, as his Fidesz party aims to form its own class of loyal industrialists.
But Orban faces some tough challenges: he needs to mend relations with his eastern allies like Poland, strained by his cautious stance on the Ukraine war after a decade of close business ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
He also has to rein in a swelling budget deficit at a time when the Hungarian economy is set to slow due to supply chain disruptions in the car sector.
Unlocking recovery funds withheld by Brussels could play a key role in fixing the budget, so Orban is expected to fight for that, but it could be a lengthy process.
The EU has suspended payments to both Poland and Hungary from its pandemic recovery funds over perceived democratic shortcomings, which economists say could begin exerting pressure on Budapest and Warsaw from the second half of the year, barring a compromise.
""The expectation that there could be a relatively quick agreement with the European Commission (on EU funds) is questionable now after in his speech last night Viktor Orban took a repeated swipe at Brussels,"" said Peter Virovacz at ING in Budapest.
""We can hardly expect that his government, with two-thirds majority now, will be as ready for a compromise as it would have been with a simple majority win in elections.""
Pre-election surveys had pointed to a much closer race. 
Surrounded by leading party members, a triumphant Orban, 58, said Sunday's victory came even with Brussels bureaucrats and the international mainstream media all teaming up against him.
""We have scored a victory so big, that it can be seen even from the Moon, but definitely from Brussels,"" he said.
SUPER-MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT
Based on preliminary results, Fidesz will have 135 seats, a two-thirds majority in parliament, with 56 seats going to the opposition alliance. 
His critics say the victory could embolden Orban in what they say is an erosion of democratic norms, media freedom and the rights of LGBTQ people.
""Without wanting to sound overly dramatic, it’s a tragedy. Looks like the end of whatever dreams one might have had of democracy in Hungary,"" an EU official said. 
""We'd have to cut money transfers so that he doesn't build his own oligarchy with our money.""
In Poland, Orban's re-election was welcome with mixed feelings among the ruling nationalists.
""Putin is a long-term threat also for Hungary and whoever doesn't see that is making a big mistake,"" Polish deputy foreign minister Marcin Przydacz said on Monday.
In bright sunshine after Sunday's snowfall, some residents in Budapest, which remains an opposition stronghold with the alliance winning in 16 of 18 constituencies, remained hopeful.
""We are not happy. I would like to stay in Europe but I hope we will stay in Europe somehow this way too,"" said Janos Varadi.
Others said Orban's positioning on Ukraine, accusing the opposition of risking Hungary being dragged into the war by seeking to allow arms shipments through its territory, played into their choice. 
""I did not hope for such a big victory but I was sure that the present government party would win,"" said Veronika Nagy, a language teacher. ""I think it is due to how the parties reacted to the war, perhaps the ... opposition made people uncertain.""

One of Europe's longest-serving leaders, Orban has emerged as a vocal supporter of anti-immigration policies and was especially popular with voters in rural areas who espouse his traditional Christian values and with families who benefit from a host of tax breaks and price caps on fuel and some foodstuffs. 
With inflation running at an almost 15-year high of 8.3% in February, Orban will have a tough task in unwinding some of his measures that had helped tame price growth in the run-up to the vote.

BARDUFOSS, Norway (Reuters) - The sound of gunfire echoed around the Norwegian fjords as a row of Swedish and Finnish soldiers, positioned prone behind banks of snow, trained rifles and missile launchers on nearby hills ready for an enemy attack.
The drill, in March, was the first time forces from Finland and Sweden have formed a combined brigade in a scheduled NATO exercise in Arctic Norway known as ""Cold Response."" Neither country is a member of the NATO alliance. The exercise was long planned, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 added intensity to the war game.
""We would be rather naive not to recognise that there is a threat,"" Swedish Major Stefan Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) told Reuters. ""The security situation in the whole of Europe has changed and we have to accept that, and we have to adapt.""
That sense of threat means President Vladimir Putin, who embarked on what he calls a ""special operation"" in Ukraine partly to counter the expansion of the NATO alliance, may soon have a new NATO neighbour.
Finland has a 1,300 km (810 mile) border with Russia. In a March 28 phone call, the country's President Sauli Niinisto asked NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg for details on principles and steps for accepting new members, he wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Finland's leaders have discussed possible membership with ""almost all"" NATO's 30 members, and will submit a review to parliament by mid-April, Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto told Reuters. 
Sweden – home of the founder of the Nobel Peace Prize and a country which has not fought in a war since 1814 – is more hesitant. But a recent opinion poll for a major Swedish TV station found 59% of Swedes wanted to join NATO, if Finland does.
For some in the alliance, the two countries sandwiched between Russia and NATO-member Norway are already partners. U.S. General David Berger, who is the commandant of the U.S. Marines Corps, told reporters at the drill that – putting the politics of membership aside – they were brothers-in-arms during training.
""For marines, at the tactical level ... there's no difference,"" Berger said. ""I just have to know that the unit over there, they have my back. They've got me covered.""
Stoltenberg announced in early March that NATO was now sharing all information on the war in Ukraine with Sweden and Finland. Both countries regularly attend NATO meetings. At the exercises in Norway, Stoltenberg said ""no other countries in the world"" are closer partners.
But he noted an important difference: ""The absolute security guarantees that we provide for NATO allies, are only for NATO allies.""
As non-members, Finland and Sweden's combined population of 16 million don't have the protection of NATO's guarantee that an attack on one ally is an attack on all.
Moscow did not respond to a request for comment for this story. It has repeatedly warned both countries against joining NATO. On March 12, the Russian foreign ministry said ""there will be serious military and political consequences"" if they do, according to Russian news agency Interfax.
Stoltenberg has said it would be possible to allow Finland and Sweden in ""quite quickly."" NATO has not commented on what a fast-track process would be; a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Defense said any decision would be taken by the countries themselves but their accession would need to be agreed by all 30 allies.
""President Putin wants less NATO on Russia's borders,"" Stoltenberg said in January, also referring to more allied troops in southeastern Europe, Poland and the Baltics. ""But he is getting more NATO.""
MEMORIES OF WAR
More than 1,000 km to the southeast of the NATO drill, 80-year-old Markku Kuusela knows real war. The pensioner, who lives in Imatra, a town on Finland's border with Russia, was evacuated to Sweden with his brother as an infant after his father was killed fighting a Russian invasion.
They returned to Finland only after the war was over.
""It is always in the back of my mind,"" said Kuusela, visiting the cemetery where his father is buried. Tears welled in his eyes. ""How it would have been to have a father.""
Some 96,000 Finns, or 2.5% of the population, died fighting the Russian invasion, in two wars between 1939 and 1944. A total of 55,000 children lost fathers and over 400,000 people lost homes as territory was conceded.
But the Finns, fighting under cover of dense forest, repelled the Russians and ever since, Finland has had a clear goal: strong defence and friendly relations with Russia. 
The country built a conscript army – it has about 900,000 men and women in reserves – and according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, one of the largest artilleries in Europe.
For years, Finns and Russians have interacted extensively. This year, Imatra was planning to celebrate a 250-year history of Finnish tourism since a visit by Catherine the Great, the Russian empress, in 1772. 
Now the Imatra border station is deserted, its stalls unused. Finland's security service, known as Supo, says Russia's military resources are currently focused on Ukraine and its own domestic operations, but warns the situation may change quickly.
The Ukraine invasion triggered almost 3,000 applications from Finns to join local associations of reservists as well as almost 1,000 to women's emergency preparedness groups, the groups said. 
One applicant was Pia Lumme, a 48-year-old coordinator for the Finnish National Agency for Education who lives near Imatra. She recalled her grandmother's war memories.
""I think we Finns all share ... the will to uphold this country,"" Lumme said.
Finland is one of few European countries to maintain a national emergency supply of fuel, food and medicine. Building emergency shelters beneath every major building has been mandatory since World War Two. The country says its 54,000 shelters have room for 4.4 million of the 5.5 million population.
Finns' backing for joining NATO has risen to record numbers over the past month, with the latest poll by public broadcaster Yle showing 62% of respondents in favour and only 16% against.
Supo, the security service, said on March 29 Finland must guard against potential Russian retaliation to Helsinki's discussions on joining NATO, or interference in the public debate.
""We don't need to make any quick decisions on our own defence, but certainly a possible membership application could lead to making us a target of interference or hybrid actions,"" Haavisto told Reuters in an interview. ""Finland needs to prepare for that and also listen to how NATO countries would react.""
CRISIS KITS
Sweden, which has argued that non-alignment has served its people well, has been slower to see Russia as a threat – for example, it allowed defence spending to slip and emergency shelters to fall into disrepair after the Cold War. But the mood there is also changing.
After Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, the government speeded up rearmament and boosted military strength on the island of Gotland, near the headquarters of Russia's Baltic Fleet. It also reintroduced limited conscription that year. 
Stockholm said earlier this month it would almost double defence spending to around 2% of GDP and is refurbishing a network of emergency bunkers, to shelter up to seven million people. It says there are currently around 65,000 shelters, mostly in private homes. 
Around 71% of Swedes are worried about an increased military threat from Russia – up from 46% in January – according to a survey by pollsters Demoskop for daily Aftonbladet on March 2. 
Three retail chains told Reuters sales of products to prepare for emergencies had accelerated again after picking up at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Sales of crisis kits, wind-up radios, water filters and water containers - pretty much everything - have increased,"" said Fredrik Stockhaus, founder of Criseq, a Swedish online store. Sweden's statistics office does not measure sales at this level of detail.
If either country does go for NATO membership, Finland looks set to move first, diplomats and politicians say. Foreign Minister Haavisto said he is in ""almost daily"" talks with his Swedish counterpart on the topic. 
""It wouldn't be ideal for Finland to go alone, because then all the risks in the application process would be on Finland,"" said Matti Pesu, a foreign policy analyst at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. 
In Sweden, the government and opposition are conducting an analysis of security policy which is expected in May. Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson stressed on national TV on March 30 it was important to wait and see what conclusions that reaches. The ruling Social Democrats oppose joining, but four opposition parties support it. 
Even so, Sweden's non-aligned status is increasingly blurred, said Anna Wieslander, Northern Europe Director at the Atlantic Council think-tank.

""If you look at it, we are preparing to meet the adversary together and I think there is no doubt in which camp we are,"" she said. ""You can see the warnings Russia has given so there is no doubt on their side as well.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's embattled leader Carrie Lam, who has governed the global financial hub through the unprecedented upheaval of anti-government protests and COVID-19, said on Monday she will not seek a second five-year term of office.
Lam's announcement came as media said Chief Secretary John Lee, Hong Kong's second most senior official, was set to resign to join the race to replace Lam in May as the Chinese-ruled city's next leader. 
""There’s only one consideration and that is family. I have told everyone before that family is my first priority,"" Lam told a regular press briefing.
""They think it’s time for me to go home.""
She declined to comment on possible candidates to replace her and said she had not decided on her future plans.
Lam, born in British-ruled Hong Kong in 1957 and a life-long civil servant who describes herself as a devout Catholic, took office in 2017 with a pledge to unite a city that was growing increasingly resentful of Beijing's tightening grip.
Two years later, millions of democracy supporters took to the streets in sometimes violent anti-government protests. The unrest led to Beijing imposing a sweeping national security law in June 2020, giving it more power than ever to shape life in Hong Kong. 
An exasperated Lam said at the height of the unrest in 2019 that if she had the choice she would quit, adding in remarks to a group of business people that the chief executive ""has to serve two masters by constitution, that is the central people's government and the people of Hong Kong"".
""Political room for manoeuvring is very, very, very limited,"" she added, according to an audio recording of her comments obtained by Reuters.
Lam said on Monday she had proposed a government restructuring to mainland authorities that would include new policy departments but it would be up to the city's next leader to decide whether to go ahead with the plan.
City leaders are selected by a small election committee stacked with Beijing loyalists so whoever becomes the next leader of the former British colony will do so with Beijing's tacit approval.
Lee, 64, a security official during the prolonged and often violent 2019 pro-democracy protests, was promoted in 2021 in a move some analysts said signalled Beijing's renewed focus on security rather than the economy.
A spokesman for Lee's office said he would not comment on media reports that the chief secretary was planning to run for leader. 
Other possible contenders mentioned in media include the city's financial secretary, Paul Chan, as well as former leader Leung Chun-ying. None has announced a bid. 
Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 with the guarantee of wide-ranging freedoms, including an independent judiciary and right to public assembly, for at least 50 years.
The United States sanctioned both Lam and Lee, among other officials, in 2020, saying they had undermined Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy from Beijing and curtailed political freedoms with the national security law that punishes offences like subversion and secession with up to life imprisonment.
Chinese and Hong Kong authorities deny individual rights are being eroded and say the security law was needed to restore the stability necessary for economic success after the prolonged unrest.

The leadership election was pushed back from March to May 8 to give the government time to battle a COVID outbreak that has infected more than a million of the 7.4 million people in the city. Lam's term ends on June 30.
Since Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule it has had four chief executives, who all struggled to balance the democratic and liberal aspirations of many residents with the vision of China's Communist Party leadership.

LAS VEGAS (Reuters) -Multi-genre artist Jon Batiste won album of the year and R&B duo Silk Sonic took two of the top honors on Sunday at a Grammy awards ceremony that featured a surprise appeal for support from wartime President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine.
Batiste, who leads the band on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" landed five awards overall, including the night's biggest prize for ""We Are,"" a jazz album inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement.
""I believe this to my core - there is no best musician, best artist, best dancer, best actor. The creative arts are subjective,"" Batiste said. ""I just put my head down and I work on the craft every day."" 
Batiste's other wins included best music video for ""Freedom,"" a vibrantly colored tribute to New Orleans, and an award for composing and arranging of songs for animated Pixar movie ""Soul."" 
Silk Sonic, featuring Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak, claimed the song and record of the year awards for their 1970s inspired hit ""Leave the Door Open."" The pair rose from their seats and danced slowly before making their way to the stage.
""We are really trying our hardest to remain humble at this point,"" joked Paak as the pair accepted the second honor.
Olivia Rodrigo, the 19-year-old singer of heartbreak ballad ""drivers license"" on her album ""Sour,"" scored three awards, including best new artist.
""This is my biggest dream come true. Thank you so much!"" Rodrigo said as she held her trophy. 
Midway through the ceremony, host Trevor Noah introduced a video message from Zelenskiy, who contrasted the joy found through music to the devastation caused by Russia's invasion of his country more than a month ago. 
""What is more opposite to music? The silence of ruined cities and killed people,"" Zelenskiy, wearing a green t-shirt, said in a hoarse voice. 
""Fill the silence with your music,"" he added. ""Support us in any way you can. Any, but not silence."" [L2N2W10HZ]
The remarks preceded a John Legend performance that featured two Ukrainian musicians and a Ukrainian poet.
The highest honors in music were postponed from January during a spike in COVID-19 cases and moved from Los Angeles to the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. Stars walked a red carpet and thousands of spectators packed the venue, a contrast to last year's scaled-down outdoor event.
Noah urged the audience to think of the evening as ""a concert where we are handing out awards.""
""We are going to be keeping people's names out of our mouths,"" Noah added, a jab about actor Will Smith, who a week ago slapped comedian Chris Rock at the Oscars and told him not to mention his wife's name. 
Korean pop band BTS, a global phenomenon that has never won a Grammy, left empty-handed again. But the group delivered a high-octane performance of their hit ""Butter,"" dodging laser beams in what looked like a scene out of a heist movie. 
Rock band Foo Fighters, whose drummer Taylor  Hawkins  (NASDAQ:HWKN) died a little over a week ago, won three awards, including best rock album for ""Medicine at Midnight."" No one from the band appeared to accept the trophies.

Winners were chosen by some 11,000 voting members of the Recording Academy.
In comedy categories, comedian Louis C.K. won best album for ""Sincerely Louis C.K.,"" his first comedy special since he admitted to sexual misconduct in 2017.

294,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 06:11AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - A jury will begin deliberations on Monday in the trial of four men charged with conspiring to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, in a case that pits domestic terrorism allegations against accusations of entrapment and prosecutorial overreach.
In closing arguments on Friday, a government prosecutor described the men as ""paranoid"" and bent on sparking a civil war by abducting Whitmer and holding her accountable for placing restrictions on social and business activities due to COVID-19.
Defense attorneys, on the other hand, said their clients were coerced into discussing the plot by FBI informants and never made concrete plans on their own. 
The case stands as one of the most high-profile prosecutions of alleged members of right-wing organizations that have risen in prominence in the years since former President Donald Trump's election in 2016. It also highlights the extent to which the pandemic and government efforts to control it have become a wedge issue in U.S. politics, pushing some people to extremes.
All four of the defendants - Adam Fox, Brandon Caserta, Barry Croft Jr. and Daniel Harris - have been charged with kidnapping conspiracy. Fox, Croft and Harris were also charged with conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction. If convicted the men could spend the rest of their lives in prison. 
""They trained to kidnap the governor, they cased her house in the middle of the night, they mapped it out, they planned it, they gathered weapons and bombs,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Nils Kessler said on Friday in federal court in Grand Rapids, Michigan. ""That is the conspiracy that they are charged with and in America it's a crime.""
Defense attorneys accused the FBI of entrapping their clients.
""Somebody rattles the keys, somebody beats the drum and gets 'em all worked up,"" Christopher Gibbons, an attorney for Fox, said on Friday. ""That’s unacceptable in America. That’s not how it works. You don’t make terrorists so we can arrest them."" 
Two other men initially charged in the alleged plot struck plea deals. The pair, Ty Garbin and Kalen Franks, served as star witnesses for the prosecution. Garbin is currently serving a six-year sentence, while Franks is awaiting sentencing.
The four men on trial are among 13 men who were arrested in October 2020 and charged with state or federal crimes in the alleged kidnapping conspiracy. Seven of them are facing charges in state court.

The FBI said it had begun tracking the group's movements after seeing online discussions that included posts about the violent overthrow of some state governments. The group's goal was to end curbs on social and business activities imposed during the coronavirus pandemic. Prosecutors have also accused them of wanting to start a second American civil war. 
Harris, Caserta and an undercover informant who testified at the trial were members of the Wolverine Watchmen, a militia group, prosecutors say. Croft and Fox were members of the ""Three Percenters,"" a similar far-right organization.

""America is responsible for the halt of these talks ... a deal is very much within reach,"" Saeed Khatibzadeh told a weekly news conference.
""Washington should make political decision for the deal's revival,"" he said, adding that Tehran would ""not wait forever"".
The U.S. State Department said on Thursday that a small number of outstanding issues remain in the nuclear talks, adding that the onus was on Tehran to make those decisions.
Iran has said that there are still outstanding issues, including Washington removing a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO) designation against Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).
Also Tehran has been pushing for guarantees that any future U.S. president would not withdraw from the agreement. The extent to which sanctions would be rolled back is another unresolved issue.

Khatibzadeh also said Tehran was ready to resume talks with its key regional rival, Saudi Arabia, if Riyadh showed willingness to resolve outstanding bilateral issues.
A Russian demand forced world powers to pause nuclear negotiations in early March, But Moscow later said it had written guarantees that its trade with Iran would not be affected by Ukraine-related sanctions, suggesting Moscow could allow a revival of the tattered pact to go forward.

297,"<span>Apr 04, 2022 02:06AM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) - Military conscripts in the Russian-backed Donbas region have been sent into front-line combat against Ukrainian troops with no training, little food and water, and inadequate weapons, six people in the separatist province told Reuters.
The new accounts of untrained and ill-equipped conscripts being deployed are a fresh indication of how stretched the military resources at the Kremlin's disposal are, over a month into a war that has seen Moscow's forces hobbled by logistical problems and held up by fierce Ukrainian resistance.
One of the people, a student conscripted in late February, said a fellow fighter told him to prepare to repel a close-quarter attack by Ukrainian forces in southwest Donbas but ""I don't even know how to fire an automatic weapon."" 
The student and his unit fired back and evaded capture, but he was injured in a later battle. He did not say when the fighting took place.
While some information indicating poor conditions and morale among Donbas conscripts has emerged in social media and some local media outlets, Reuters was able to assemble one of the most comprehensive pictures to date.
Besides the student draftee, Reuters spoke to three wives of conscripts who have mobile phone contact with their partners, one acquaintance of a draftee, and one source close to the pro-Russian separatist leadership who is helping to organize supplies for the Donbas armed forces.
Reuters verified the identity of the student, as well as the other sources and the draftees they are associated with. The news agency was unable to confirm independently the accounts of what happened to the men once they were drafted.
The six sources all asked that their full names not be published, saying that they feared reprisals for speaking to foreign media.
The Donbas armed forces are fighting alongside Russian soldiers but are not part of the Russian armed forces, which have different rules about which troops they send into combat.
Several Donbas draftees have been issued with a rifle called a Mosin, which was developed in the late 19th century and went out of production decades ago, according to three people who saw conscripts from the separatist region using the weapon. Images shared on social media, that Reuters has not been able to verify independently, also showed Donbas fighters with Mosin rifles.
The student said he was forced to drink water from a fetid pond because of lack of supplies. Two other sources in contact with draftees also told Reuters the men had to drink untreated water.
Some Donbas conscripts were given the highly dangerous mission of drawing enemy fire onto themselves so other units could identify the Ukrainian positions and bomb them, according to one of the sources and video testimony from a prisoner of war published by Ukrainian forces.
Asked to comment about the treatment and low morale of the Donbass draftees, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was a question for the Donetsk People's Republic (DNR), the self-proclaimed separatist entity in Donbas. The Russian defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
A spokeswoman for the DNR administration, after viewing Reuters questions, said there would be no response on Friday. She did not say when the administration would reply. Messages left with a spokesman for the separatist military went unanswered. 
After being pushed to the front line near the port of Mariupol -- scene of the heaviest fighting in the war -- a group of about 135 Donbas conscripts laid down their arms and refused to fight on, according to Veronika, the partner of a conscript, who said her husband was among them. Marina, partner of another conscript, said she had been in contact with a friend who was part of the same group.
""We're refusing (to fight),"" the friend wrote in a text message to Marina, seen by Reuters.
The men were kept in a basement by military commanders as punishment, Veronika and Marina said. Commanders verbally threatened them with reprisals but subsequently allowed the group out of the basement, pulled them back from the front line and billeted them in abandoned homes, Veronika said. 
Neither the Kremlin nor separatist authorities answered Reuters questions about the incident.
    CALL-UP
All sides in the Ukraine war have systems of conscription, where young men are required by law to do military service.
Ukraine's government has declared a general mobilisation, meaning that conscripts and reservists have been deployed to fight.
Russia says it is not deploying conscripts in Ukraine, though it has acknowledged a small number were mistakenly sent to fight.
The Donetsk separatist authorities announced in late February they were drafting all fighting age men for immediate deployment. 
Military recruitment officers appeared at workplaces around the Donetsk region and told employees to report for duty, while police ordered people in the streets to report to their local draft office, according to a Reuters reporter who was there in late February. Anyone not complying risks prosecution. 
    Reuters could not determine how many people have been called up, nor what proportion of Donbas forces is comprised of draftees.
None of the five draftees had prior military experience or training, and four of the five were given no training before they were sent into combat, according to the injured draftee, the three wives of conscripted men, and the acquaintance.
    ""He never served in the army,"" said one of the partners, who gave her name as Olga and lives in the town of Makeevka. ""He doesn't even really know how to hold an automatic weapon.""
    Two of the wives said their partners were deployed to the front line, where they saw heavy fighting.
    ""I'm in the war,"" read a text message, seen by Reuters, that Marina, also from Makeevka, said came from her drafted husband.
    Marina said she learned from messages from her husband that his unit, fighting in the Donbas region, was ordered to draw enemy fire on to themselves. 
    Ukrainian forces on March 12 published a video showing a prisoner of war. He said his name was Ruslan Khalilov, that he was a civil servant from Donbas and that he was sent with zero training to Mariupol where his role was to draw enemy fire to facilitate the bombing of Ukrainian targets. 
    A person in Donbas who knows Khalilov confirmed to Reuters his identity, that he was drafted and has no military training. Reuters established that the person knows Khalilov.
    ""SLAUGHTERHOUSE""
    The student draftee who spoke to Reuters said that a day after reporting for duty he was put in a mortar unit then sent towards the fighting. ""We were taught nothing,"" he wrote to Reuters via messenger app. 
    ""Up to that point I had only seen mortars in movies. Obviously, I didn't know how to do anything with them.""
    He said that before he left, his unit had been under repeated attack by Ukrainian troops. ""There were lots of casualties,"" he wrote. ""I hate the war. I don't want it, curse it. Why are they sending me into a slaughterhouse?""
    All the accounts gathered by Reuters mentioned an acute shortage of supplies. The sources described little or no safe drinking water, field rations for one man being shared among several, and units having to scavenge food.
    ""We drank water with dead frogs in it,"" said the student conscript. 
    ""Supplies for the soldiers right now are a disaster,"" said the source close to the Donetsk separatist leadership, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
    Neither the Kremlin nor the separatist authorities replied to Reuters’ questions about supplies and equipment for the draftees from Donbas.
    WORLD WAR TWO RIFLE
    The same source said some conscripts were issued with the Mosin rifle from reserve stocks that date back to the Second World War. 
    The student conscript said he has seen fellow fighters using the rifle: ""It's like we're fighting with World War Two muskets."" 
    A soldier in the Russian armed forces who is fighting near Mariupol told Reuters he had seen soldiers from the Donetsk separatist military carrying Mosin rifles.
   A video posted on social media on Tuesday by Russian military journalist Semyon Pegov showed a man who said he was a Donbas draftee brandishing a Mosin rifle.
    Soon after the men were drafted in late February, many of their wives, mothers, and sisters started writing petitions to the separatist leadership, to Donbas draft offices, and to the Kremlin, describing their treatment and seeking help.
    ""Bring us back our men,"" said one petition addressed to Russian President Vladimir Putin, seen by Reuters.
    The three wives of draftees who spoke to Reuters said they received no definitive answers. 
    On March 11, about 100 women gathered outside the separatist administration’s offices in Donetsk to demand answers, in a rare public show of dissent.

    Two women who took part in the gathering said Alexander Malkovsky, the head of the DNR draft office, came out and told them that men aged 18 to 27 would be exempted from the draft. Reuters couldn't determine if this has been implemented, and was unable to reach Malkovsky.
    Two of the conscripts' wives said that since the gathering they learned from their partners that conditions had improved: some units were pulled back from the front line and allowed to sleep in abandoned homes, instead of in trenches.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) -Pakistan's political turmoil deepened on Sunday, when Prime Minister Imran Khan avoided an attempt to oust him and sought fresh elections after dissolving parliament, a move the opposition called treasonous and vowed to fight.
The deputy speaker of parliament, a member of Khan's party, blocked an opposition no-confidence motion that Khan had widely been expected to lose, ruling it was part of a foreign conspiracy and unconstitutional.
That stymied the opposition's attempt to come to power, and set up a potential legal showdown over the Constitution in the country of 220 million people.
Opposition leader Shehbaz Sharif called the blocking of the vote ""nothing short of high treason"" and said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) there would be consequences for ""blatant & brazen violation of the Constitution."" He added he hoped the Supreme Court would uphold the Constitution. 
Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, head of the opposition Pakistan People's Party, promised a sit-in at parliament and told reporters, ""We are also moving to the Supreme Court today.""
The Supreme Court's chief justice said on Sunday evening the court would hear the matter on Monday and that any directions given by the president and prime minister would be subject to the court's orders. 
The opposition blames Khan for failing to revive the economy and crack down on corruption. Khan has said, without showing evidence, that the move to oust him was orchestrated by the United States, a claim Washington denies.
CONSPIRACY
Khan said later on Sunday his evidence of the conspiracy was accepted by the National Security Committee.
""When the country's highest national security body confirms this, then the [parliamentary] proceedings were irrelevant, the numbers were irrelevant,"" Khan said. 
U.S. officials on Sunday denied any involvement.
""There is no truth to these allegations,"" a State Department spokesperson told Reuters on Sunday, adding ""we respect and support Pakistan's constitutional process and the rule of law."" 
The opposition and analysts say Khan, an international cricket champion turned politician who rose to power in 2018 on the military's support, had fallen out with it, a charge he and the military deny.
""Army has nothing to do with the political process,"" Major General Babar Iftikhar, the head of the military's public relations wing, said when asked about any involvement in Sunday's events.
No prime minister has finished a full five-year term since Pakistan's independence from Britain in 1947, and generals on several occasions have ruled the country, which is perennially at odds with fellow nuclear-armed neighbour India.
KHAN STAYS 
President Arif Alvi, also of Khan's party, approved the prime minister's request to dissolve parliament and cabinet. Khan will remain prime minister, said Fawad Chaudhry, the former minister of information and law.
Farrukh Habib, another former minister, said fresh elections would be held in 90 days, although that decision rests with the president and the election commission.
Deputy Attorney General Raja Khalid, a top prosecutor, resigned, calling the government's dissolving of parliament unconstitutional. ""What has happened can only be expected in the rule of a dictator,"" he told local media. 
The political fight comes as Pakistan faces high inflation, dwindling foreign reserves and widening deficits. The country is in a tough International Monetary Fund bailout programme.
Islamabad also faces international pressure to prod the Taliban in neighbouring Afghanistan to meet human rights commitments while trying to limit instability there.
Khan lost his majority in parliament after allies quit his coalition government and he suffered a spate of defections within his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party. 
A prominent newspaper had recently said Khan was ""as good as gone"", but he had urged his supporters to take to the streets on Sunday ahead of the planned vote.

On the streets of the capital Islamabad, there was a heavy police and paramilitary presence, with shipping containers used to block off roads, according to a Reuters witness.
Police were seen detaining three supporters of Khan's ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party outside parliament, but the streets were otherwise calm.

(Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday made a surprise video appearance at the music industry's star-studded Grammy Awards celebration in Las Vegas and appealed to viewers to support his country ""in any way you can.""
""What is more opposite to music? The silence of ruined cities and killed people,"" said Zelenskiy in the video that introduced John Legend's performance of ""Free"" and featured Ukrainian musicians and a reading by Ukrainian poet Lyuba Yakimchuck.
""Fill the silence with your music. Fill it today, to tell our story. Support us in any way you can. Any, but not silence,"" Zelenskiy, wearing his now trademark olive green T-shirt, said in English, his voice hoarse. 
War broke out in Ukraine over a month ago after Russian military forces invaded, displacing millions of civilians and reducing cities to rubble. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"".
Actor-turned-wartime-leader Zelenskiy, 44, has used nightly videos to great effect at home, often appearing unshaven and wearing a T-shirt, and has also beamed his image directly to parliaments around the world. 

He has pleaded with allies in speeches at the U.S. Congress, Japanese National Diet, British and Australian parliaments and Israeli Knesset, and on Sunday chose an event dedicated to the universal language of music to spur support for his country.
""Our musicians wear body armor instead of tuxedos, they sing to the wounded, in hospitals, even to those who can't hear them but the music will break through,"" he said.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) -Sacramento police said on Sunday that multiple shooters were involved in early morning violence in which six people were killed and 12 were wounded but the suspects remain at large. 
Police Chief Kathy Lester provided no information about any suspects or the motive for the shooting, a few blocks from the state capitol, as bars began to close and revelers poured onto the streets. 
""We know that a large fight took place just prior to the shooting, and we have confirmed there were multiple shooters,"" Lester told a news conference. 
Lester said there were three men and three women among those killed. She did not identify any of the victims. 
President Joe Biden said the United States was once again mourning a community hurt by gun violence and he called on Congress to pass stricter gun legislation. 
""Ban ghost guns. Require background checks for all gun sales. Ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Repeal gun manufacturers' immunity from liability,"" Biden said in a statement. 
The shooting occurred at about 2 a.m. (0900 GMT), Lester said, near the Golden 1 Center, an arena where the Sacramento Kings basketball team plays and concerts are held.
Police said in a statement that they had recovered at least one gun at the scene and had located 12 victims ""with varying degrees of injuries.""
Officers cordoned off several blocks and the scene was dotted with blue and red plastic cones that marked evidence. 
Relatives waited outside the police lines seeking news about missing loved ones.
Among them was Pamela Harris, who said her daughter had called her at 2:15 a.m. to say that her 38-year-old son, Sergio, had been shot and killed outside a nightclub.
""She said he was dead. I just collapsed,"" Harris said. She said she was still waiting on official confirmation from police.
""I cannot leave here now until I know what's going on. I'm not going anywhere. It seems like a dream.""
Community activist Berry Accius said he had rushed to the scene shortly after the shooting.
""The first thing I saw was a young lady draped in her blood and others' blood. She was just on the phone saying 'My sister is dead! My sister is dead!',"" said Accius, whose Voice of the Youth leadership program is focused on gun violence prevention. 
The area of the shooting has recently been revitalized as an entertainment center. Over the past week, pandemic masks had started coming off and bars and restaurants began filling with people long isolated by COVID-19.
""The numbers of dead and wounded are difficult to comprehend. We await more information about exactly what transpired in this tragic incident,"" Mayor Darrell Steinberg said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""Rising gun violence is the scourge of our city, state and nation, and I support all actions to reduce it.

The incident comes a little more than a month after a man shot and killed his three children and a fourth person before taking his own life in the same city. 
In a separate shooting overnight in Dallas, Texas, a man was killed and 11 people were injured when a person opened fire into a crowd at a concert, Dallas police said. The incident is being investigated.

301,"<span>Apr 03, 2022 08:56PM ET</span>",,,,,,"BELGRADE (Reuters) -Serbia's incumbent President Aleksandar Vucic is set to win the presidential vote on Sunday with 59.8% of the votes, according to a projection by pollsters Ipsos and CeSID, based on a sample of the partial polling station count.
Zdravko Ponos, a retired army general representing the pro-European and centrist Alliance for Victory coalition, is set to come second with 17.1% of the votes. 
In the parliamentary vote Vucic's Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) is set to come first with 43.6% of votes, Ipsos and CeSID projections showed. 
The United for Victory opposition alliance trailed behind with 12.9% of the votes. 
The Socialist Party of Serbia, a long-time ally of the SNS, is seen third with 11.6% of the votes. The Nada (Hope) rightist coalition and Moramo (We Must), an alliance of green movements and parties, garnered around 5.4% and 4.3% of votes respectively. 
As the SNS would likely fail to secure enough of the 250-seat parliament to rule alone, it will have to seek coalition partners. 
According to the State Election Commission preliminary data, turnout stood at 58.54%.
Vucic ran for a second five-year term on a promise of peace and stability just as Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb 24, which has put Serbia under pressure from the West to choose between its traditional ties with Moscow and aspirations to join the European Union (EU).
Vucic acknowledged conflict in Ukraine impacted the campaign and said Serbia has no plans to deviate from its balancing game between the EU membership bid and close ties with Russia and China, a major investor.
""We will maintain policy that is important for the Europeans, Russians and Americans, and that is ... military neutrality."" 
""Serbia will try to preserve friendly and partnership relations in many areas with the Russian Federation,"" Vucic said. 
Serbia is almost entirely dependent on Russian gas, while its army maintains ties with Russia's military. 
The Kremlin also supports Belgrade's opposition to the independence of Kosovo by blocking its membership to the United Nations. 
Although Serbia backed two United Nations resolutions condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it refused to impose sanctions against Moscow. 
CeSID and CRTA pollsters reported several irregularities, including photographing of ballots. 
The opposition largely boycotted a parliamentary election in 2020, allowing Vucic's SNS party and its allies to secure 188 seats in the 250-seat parliament. 
A veteran politician who served as information minister in 1998 under former strongman Slobodan Milosevic, Vucic has transformed himself from a nationalist firebrand to a proponent of EU membership, military neutrality and ties with Russia and China.

Ponos has accused Vucic of using the war in Ukraine in his campaign to capitalise on people's fears. 
Opposition and rights watchdogs also accuse Vucic and his allies of an autocratic style of rule, corruption, nepotism, controlling the media, attacks on political opponents and ties with organised crime. Vucic and his allies have repeatedly denied all those allegations.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) -Hungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban scored a fourth consecutive landslide win in Sunday's election, as voters endorsed his ambition of a conservative, ""illiberal"" state and shrugged off concerns over Budapest's close ties with Moscow.
Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine had appeared to upend Orban's campaign in recent weeks, forcing him into awkward manouvering to explain decade-old cosy business relations with President Vladimir Putin.
But he mounted a successful campaign to persuade his Fidesz party's core electorate that the six-party opposition alliance of Peter Marki-Zay promising to mend ties with the European Union could lead the country into war, an accusation the opposition denied. 
Surrounded by leading party members, a triumphant Orban, 58, said Sunday's victory came against all odds. 
""We have scored a victory so big, that it can be seen even from the Moon,"" he said. ""We have defended Hungary's sovereignty and freedom.""
Preliminary results with about 98% of national party list votes counted showed Orban's Fidesz party leading with 53.1% of votes versus 35% for Marki-Zay's opposition alliance. Fidesz was also winning 88 of 106 single-member constituencies. 
Based on preliminary results, the National Election Office said Fidesz would have 135 seats, a two-thirds majority, and the opposition alliance would have 56 seats. A far-right party called Our Homeland would also make it into parliament, winning 7 seats.
His comfortable victory could embolden Orban, 58, in his policy agenda which critics say amounts to a subversion of democratic norms, media freedom and the rights of minorities, particularly gay and lesbian people.
Conceding defeat, Marki-Zay, 49, said Fidesz's win was due to what he called its vast propaganda machine, including media dominance.
""I don't want to hide my disappointment, my sadness ... We knew this would be an uneven playing field,"" he said. ""We admit that Fidesz got a huge majority of the votes. But we still dispute whether this election was democratic and free.""
The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) sent a full-scale election monitoring mission for the vote, only the second such effort in an European Union member state.
ONE-PARTY RULE 
One of Europe's longest-serving leaders, Orban has emerged as a vocal supporter of anti-immigration policies and an opponent of tough energy sanctions against Moscow.
Critics say he has sought to cement one-party rule by overhauling the constitution, taking control of a majority of media outlets and rejigging election rules, as well as staffing key government posts with loyalists and rewarding businessmen close to Fidesz with lucrative state contracts.
Still, he wins favour with many older, poorer voters in rural areas who espouse his traditional Christian values and with families who benefit from a host of tax breaks and price caps on fuel and some foodstuffs. 
The election comes at a time when global energy woes and steep labour shortages in the region have fuelled inflation increases throughout central Europe. Consumer price growth reached an almost 15-year high of 8.3% in February in Hungary.
Critics say the public perception of the war has been influenced by state-controlled media which have amplified Orban's accusations that an opposition-led government would support sanctions on Russian gas shipments and put Hungary at risk by shipping weapons to Ukraine.
With voting under way throughout Hungary, Ukraine accused Russian forces of carrying out a ""massacre"" in the town of Bucha, while Western nations reacted to images of dead bodies there with calls for new sanctions against Moscow. 
Orban has condemned the Russian invasion, which the Kremlin describes as a ""special military operation"" and has not vetoed any European Union sanctions against Moscow even though he said he did not agree with them. 

But he has banned any transport of arms to Ukraine via Hungarian territory, facing criticism from his nationalist allies in Poland, and said benefits of close ties with Russia include gas supply security. 
His victory, however, is a relief for Warsaw's nationalist Law and Justice government which has relied on his backing in Brussels to counter penalties over rule of law breaches.

WASHINGTON/ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan blocked a no-confidence vote he looked sure to lose on Sunday and advised the president to order fresh elections, fueling anger among the opposition and deepening the country's political crisis.
His actions have created huge uncertainty in Islamabad, with constitutional experts debating their legality and pondering whether Khan and his rivals can find a way forward.
The nuclear-armed nation of more than 220 million people lies between Afghanistan to the west, China to the northeast and nuclear rival India to the east, making it of vital strategic importance.
Since coming to power in 2018, Khan's rhetoric has become more anti-American and he has expressed a desire to move closer to China and, recently, Russia - including talks with President Vladimir Putin on the day the invasion of Ukraine began.
At the same time, U.S. and Asian foreign policy experts said that Pakistan's powerful military has traditionally controlled foreign and defence policy, thereby limiting the impact of political instability.
Here is what the upheaval, which many expect to lead to Khan's exit, means for countries closely involved in Pakistan:
AFGHANISTAN
Ties between Pakistan's military intelligence agency and the Islamist militant Taliban have loosened in recent years.
Now the Taliban are back in power, and facing an economic and humanitarian crisis due to a lack of money and international isolation, Qatar is arguably their most important foreign partner.
""We (the United States) don't need Pakistan as a conduit to the Taliban. Qatar is definitely playing that role now,"" said Lisa Curtis, director of the Indo-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security think-tank.
Tensions have risen between the Taliban and Pakistan's military, which has lost several soldiers in attacks close to their mutual border. Pakistan wants the Taliban to do more to crack down on extremist groups and worries they will spread violence into Pakistan. That has begun to happen already.
Khan has been less critical of the Taliban over human rights than most foreign leaders.
CHINA
Khan has consistently emphasised China's positive role in Pakistan and in the world at large.
At the same time, the $60-billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) which binds the neighbours together was actually conceptualised and launched under Pakistan's two established political parties, both of which want Khan out of power.
Opposition leader and potential successor Shehbaz Sharif struck deals with China directly as leader of the eastern province of Punjab, and his reputation for getting major infrastructure projects off the ground while avoiding political grandstanding could in fact be music to Beijing's ears.
INDIA
The neighbours have fought three wars since independence in 1947, two of them over the disputed Muslim-majority territory of Kashmir.
As with Afghanistan, it is Pakistan's military that controls policy in the sensitive area, and tensions along the de facto border there are at their lowest level since 2021.
But there have been no formal diplomatic talks between the rivals for years because of deep distrust over a range of issues including Khan's extreme criticism of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his handling of attacks on minority Muslims in India.
Karan Thapar, an Indian political commentator who has closely followed India-Pakistan ties, said the Pakistani military could put pressure on a new civilian government in Islamabad to build on the successful ceasefire in Kashmir.
On Saturday, Pakistan's powerful army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa said his country was ready to move forward on Kashmir if India agrees.
The Sharif political dynasty has been at the forefront of several dovish overtures towards India over the years.
UNITED STATES
U.S.-based South Asia experts said that Pakistan's political crisis is unlikely to be a priority for President Joe Biden, who is grappling with the war in Ukraine, unless it led to mass unrest or rising tensions with India.
""We have so many other fish to fry,"" said Robin Raphel, a former assistant secretary of State for South Asia who is a senior associate with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank.
With the Pakistani military maintaining its behind-the-scenes control of foreign and security policies, Khan's political fate was not a major concern, according to some analysts.
""Since it's the military that calls the shots on the policies that the U.S. really cares about, i.e. Afghanistan, India and nuclear weapons, internal Pakistani political developments are largely irrelevant for the U.S.,"" said Curtis, who served as former U.S. President Donald Trump's National Security Council senior director for South Asia.

She added that Khan's visit to Moscow had been a ""disaster"" in terms of U.S. relations, and that a new government in Islamabad could at least help mend ties ""to some degree"".
Khan has blamed the United States for the current political crisis, saying that Washington wanted him removed because of the recent Moscow trip.

BUCHA, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukraine on Sunday accused Russian forces of carrying out a ""massacre"" in the town of Bucha, while Western nations reacted to images of dead bodies there with calls for new sanctions against Moscow.
Russia's defence ministry denied the Ukrainian allegations, saying footage and photographs showing bodies in Bucha were ""yet another provocation"" by the Ukrainian government.
The images from the town, 37 km (23 miles) northwest of Kyiv's city centre, emerged after Ukraine said on Saturday its forces had reclaimed control of the whole Kyiv region and liberated towns from Russian troops. 
They prompted outrage in Ukraine and abroad, adding to pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin by increasing the likelihood of further Western sanctions. Western nations have already sought to isolate Russia economically and punish it for the invasion, which began on Feb. 24.
""Bucha massacre was deliberate,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the images as ""a punch in the gut,"" while United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for an independent investigation.
German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Russia must pay for ""war crimes."" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his government would step up sanctions, as well as military and humanitarian support for Ukraine. 
""Putin and his supporters will feel the consequences,"" said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, adding that Western allies would agree on further sanctions in the coming days.
Germany's defence minister Christine Lambrecht said the European Union must discuss banning the import of Russian gas - a departure from Berlin's prior resistance to the idea of an embargo on Russian energy imports.
Russia requested that the U.N. Security Council convene on Monday to discuss what Moscow called a ""provocation by Ukrainian radicals"" in Bucha.
The defence ministry in Moscow described photos and videos from the town as a ""staged performance."" 
Russia has previously denied targeting civilians and has rejected allegations of war crimes in what it calls a ""special military operation"" aimed at demilitarising and ""denazifying"" Ukraine. Ukraine says it was invaded without provocation.
On Saturday, Reuters saw bodies in a mass grave and still lying on the streets, while on Sunday the mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, showed reporters two corpses with white cloth tied around their arms, one of which appeared to have been shot in the mouth.
Oleksiy Arestovych, an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Ukrainian troops had found the bodies of women who had been raped and set alight as well as the bodies of local officials and children.
Bucha's mayor said 300 residents had been killed during a month-long occupation by the Russian army.
Reuters could not immediately verify the allegations by Arestovych and Fedoruk.
Ukraine's foreign minister called on the International Criminal Court to collect evidence of what he called Russian war crimes, while the foreign ministers of France and Britain said their countries would support any such probe.
However, legal experts say a prosecution of Putin or other Russian leaders would face high hurdles and could take years.
Human Rights Watch said it had documented ""several cases of Russian military forces committing laws-of-war violations"" in the Ukrainian regions of Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Kyiv.
Ukraine's Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said prosecutors investigating possible war crimes by Russia had found 410 bodies in towns near Kyiv, of which 140 had been examined. 
FIGHTING IN SEVERAL AREAS
Russia has pulled back forces that had threatened Kyiv from the north, saying it intends to focus on eastern Ukraine.
Fighting was reported on Sunday in several parts of Ukraine.
The governor of the eastern Donetsk region said shelling had continued throughout the night and day. Russian shelling killed seven people in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, according to the regional prosecutor's office. 
Missiles struck near the southern port of Odesa, with Russia saying it had destroyed an oil refinery used by the Ukrainian military. The Odesa city council said ""critical infrastructure facilities"" were hit.
Dmytro Lunin, governor of the central Poltava region, said the Kremenchug oil refinery, 350 km (220 miles) northeast of Odesa, had been destroyed in a separate rocket attack on Saturday.
Two blasts were heard in the Russian city of Belgorod near the border with Ukraine on Sunday, two witnesses told Reuters, days after Russian authorities accused Ukrainian forces of striking a fuel depot there.
Ukraine evacuated 2,694 people from conflict zones in the southeastern port of Mariupol and the region of Luhansk on Sunday, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. Ukrainian officials were in talks with Russia to allow several Red Cross buses to enter Mariupol, she added.
The Red Cross abandoned earlier attempts due to security concerns. Russia blamed the charity for the delays.
Mariupol is Russia's main target in Ukraine's southeastern region of Donbas, and tens of thousands of civilians there have been trapped for weeks with scant access to food and water. 
There was little sign of a breakthrough in efforts to negotiate an end to the war, although Russia's chief negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, said talks were due to resume on Monday via videoconference. 
Medinsky said that while Ukraine was showing more realism by agreeing to be neutral, renouncing nuclear weapons, not joining a military bloc and refusing to host military bases, there had been no progress on other key Russia demands.

""I repeat again and again: Russia's position on Crimea and Donbas remains UNCHANGED,"" he said on Telegram.
Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and has recognised declarations of independence by the self-proclaimed republics of Luhansk and Donetsk in the Donbas area of eastern Ukraine which rose up against Kyiv's rule.

BUCHA, Ukraine (Reuters) -The mayor of a recently liberated Ukrainian city accused Russian troops on Sunday of deliberately killing civilians during their month-long occupation of his town, allegations that Russia's defence ministry denied.
The mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, showed a Reuters team two corpses with white cloth tied around their arms which he said was what residents were forced to wear by fighters from Chechnya, a region in southern Russia that has deployed troops to Ukraine to support Russian forces.
One corpse had his hands bound by the white cloth, and appeared to have been shot in the mouth. 
Russia's defence ministry issued a statement on Sunday saying that all photographs and videos published by the Ukrainian authorities alleging ""crimes"" by Russian troops in Bucha were a ""provocation.""
Bucha lies 37 km (23 miles) northwest of Kyiv city and this weekend when journalists visited and the authorities began making allegations of atrocities, it was a scene of shattered buildings and streets strewn with corpses.
""Any war has some rules of engagement for civilians. The Russians have demonstrated that they were consciously killing civilians,"" Fedoruk said. 
Fedoruk said on Saturday that more than 300 residents of the town had been killed.
Reuters, which was taken to the scene by Ukrainian authorities, was not immediately able to verify the mayor's allegations. 
Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a Putin ally, said in a statement on Feb. 26 that Chechen forces would be fighting in Ukraine as part of Russia's special military operation, which was launched two days earlier.
Reuters was unable to determine if they operated in Bucha. A spokesman for Kadyrov did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In its statement, the Russian defence ministry said further that ""During the time that Russian armed forces were in control of this settlement, not a single local resident suffered from any violent actions"". It added that before Russian troops withdrew on March 30 they delivered 452 tons of humanitarian aid to civilians around the Kyiv region.
""For the entire time that the city was under the control of the Russian armed forces and, and afterwards, until today, in Bucha, local residents freely moved around the city and used cellular communications,"" the ministry said.
On Saturday Ukraine said its forces had retaken all areas around Kyiv and that it now had complete control of the capital region for the first time since the Russian invasion began on Feb 24. 
AFTERMATH
Bucha lies in a strategically significant cluster of towns on the northwestern outskirts of Kyiv, near Irpin and Hostomel military airport. It was captured in the days immediately after the invasion by Russian forces who swept south toward the capital.
Bucha and the northern outskirts of Irpin were the point at which the main body of Russian troops and armour advancing from the northwest was halted after meeting with unexpectedly fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces.
The area witnessed some of the bloodiest fighting for the capital, until Russia pulled forces back from north of Kyiv saying it planned to focus on eastern Ukraine.
On Saturday, Reuters journalists saw bodies in civilian clothes lying in the streets of Bucha or half-buried in the soil, Ukrainian soldiers took photos of each other next to incinerated Russian armoured vehicles.
Hands and other body parts could be seen poking out from the soil, while on the streets bodies lay beside the bicycles people had apparently been riding when they were killed. 
Alexander Syrsky, the Ukrainian general in command of Kyiv's defense, told reporters that the prosecutor's office, police and other agencies were working to de-mine the areas from with Russians had withdrawn, to identify bodies and ""to identify those who committed these crimes"".
Speaking at newly recaptured Hostomel airport, Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said on Sunday: ""these are inhumans who simply committed crimes against civilians, raped, killed, shot them in the back of the head. The whole world needs to know about this"".
Reuters could not immediately verify his allegations.
The Kremlin denies that it has invaded Ukraine, saying it is carrying out a ""special military operation"" to degrade the Ukrainian armed forces and that it is targeting military installations rather than carrying out strikes on civilian areas.
WAR CRIMES INVESTIGATIONS
On Sunday the New York-based advocacy group Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a statement saying it had found ""several cases of Russian military forces committing laws-of-war violations"" in Russian-controlled regions such as Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Kyiv - citing Bucha as one location.
Russia's defence ministry did not immediately respond to questions about the specific allegations in the HRW statement. 

On March 1, asked about separate allegations of war crimes related to strikes on civilians, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov asserted in a conference call with reporters that the government categorically denied this. He dismissed allegations made the previous day by Ukraine's ambassador to the United States of Russian strikes on civilian targets and the use of cluster bombs and vacuum bombs as fakes. 
The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, said last month he had opened an investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine but said it represents ""myriad challenges, opportunities and difficulties"". Several legal experts said a prosecution of President Vladimir Putin or other Russian leaders would face high hurdles and could take years.

Woods said six weeks ago that he had a ""long way to go"" in his recovery but speculation mounted with each passing day that his return could come at the April 7-10 Masters as he refrained from removing his name from the field of competitors.
""I will be heading up to Augusta today to continue my preparation and practice. It will be a game-time decision on whether I compete,"" Woods said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) https://twitter.com/TigerWoods/status/1510613298022129668.
Unlike regular PGA Tour events, the Masters does not set a deadline for players to commit or withdraw from the tournament, which means Woods could wait until his Thursday tee time before making a final decision.
Woods was also listed on the pre-tournament news conference schedule that was released on Sunday and will meet the media at 11:00 a.m. ET (1500 GMT) on Tuesday at Augusta National.
Woods' single-car crash resulted in a three-week hospital stay in Los Angeles where he faced the possibility of having his right leg amputated. He was then confined to a hospital-type bed for three months at his home in South Florida.
The 46-year-old Woods has not played on the PGA Tour since the November 2020 Masters. His only event since the accident came last December when he finished runner-up alongside his son in a 36-hole exhibition played on a flat course with no rough.
Playing at Augusta National, however, represents one of the more taxing walks on the PGA Tour given its undulating terrain that all but assures golfers will hit from any number of uneven lies during the week.
But Woods is no stranger to playing through pain, something he famously proved at the 2008 U.S. Open where he prevailed in a thrilling playoff at Torrey Pines while competing on what was essentially a broken leg.

Woods capped one of the most remarkable comebacks in professional sport when, at the age of 43, he won the Masters in 2019 after enduring years of surgery and personal problems that convinced many the best golfer of his generation was done.
Former world number one Rory McIlroy had said it would be ""phenomenal"" for the sport to have Woods return to competition at Augusta.

(Reuters) - Ukraine has accused Russia of war crimes in the town of Bucha just outside Kyiv, with Germany, France and others expressing outrage at the images of dead civilians. 
The mayor of Bucha said on Saturday that 300 residents had been killed by Russian troops during a month-long occupation. Victims were seen by Reuters in a mass grave and lying in the streets.
Russia's defence ministry denied the Ukrainian allegations, saying footage and photographs showing bodies in Bucha were ""yet another provocation"" by the Ukrainian government.
Russia has previously denied targeting civilians and rejected allegations of war crimes in what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.
Even before Bucha, Ukraine and its Western allies accused Russian forces of targeting civilians indiscriminately, citing the bombing in the southern port of Mariupol of a maternity hospital and a theater marked as sheltering children. 
Legal experts said a prosecution of President Vladimir Putin or other Russian leaders would face high hurdles and could take years, as outlined below:
HOW IS A WAR CRIME DEFINED?
The International Criminal Court in The Hague defines war crimes as ""grave breaches"" of the post-World War Two Geneva Conventions, agreements which lay out the international humanitarian laws to be followed in war time. Breaches include deliberately targeting civilians and attacking legitimate military targets where civilian casualties would be “excessive,” legal experts said.
The USSR ratified the Geneva Convention in 1954. Russia in 2019 revoked its recognition of one of the protocols, but remains a signatory to the rest of the agreements. 
HOW MIGHT A CASE PROCEED?
The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, said last month he had opened an investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine. 
Neither Russia nor Ukraine is a member of the ICC and Moscow does not recognize the tribunal. But Ukraine has given its approval to examine alleged atrocities on its territory dating back to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.
Russia may decide not to cooperate with the ICC and any trial would be delayed until a defendant is arrested. 
WHAT IS THE STANDARD OF PROOF?
The ICC will issue an arrest warrant if prosecutors can show ""reasonable grounds to believe"" war crimes were committed. To obtain a conviction, the prosecutor would have to prove a defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, experts said.
For most charges, that requires proving intent. One way to do this would be for a prosecutor to show there were no military targets in the area of an attack and that it was not an accident. 
“If it keeps happening again and again and the strategy appears to be to target civilians in urban areas, then that can be very powerful evidence of an intent to do so,” said Alex Whiting, a visiting professor at Harvard Law School.
WHO COULD BE CHARGED?
A war crimes investigation may focus on soldiers, commanders and heads of state, experts said.
A prosecutor could present evidence that Putin or another state leader committed a war crime by directly ordering an illegal attack or knew crimes were being committed and failed to prevent them.
WHAT MAKES A WAR CRIME CONVICTION DIFFICULT?
Legal experts said the bombings of the theater and maternity hospital in Mariupol appear to fall under the definition of war crimes. But securing a conviction can be difficult.
In addition to the challenges they face proving intent in many cases and linking leaders directly to specific attacks, prosecutors can have a tough time obtaining evidence from a war zone, including interviews with witnesses who might be intimidated or otherwise reluctant to speak.
In the case of Ukraine, ICC prosecutors will comb through publicly available video and photographic evidence.
Bringing defendants to trial can also be difficult. Moscow is almost certain to refuse to comply with arrest warrants. The ICC will have to track potential defendants to see whether they travel to countries where they can be arrested. 
ARE THERE ANY PRECEDENTS?
Since the ICC was formed, it has overseen 30 cases, some with multiple defendants, its website says. ICC judges have convicted five people of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, and acquitted four others. Congolese warlord Thomas Lubanga Dyilo was convicted in 2012. 
The court has issued arrest warrants for several defendants who remain at large, including Joseph Kony, leader of the Lord's Resistance Army militia group in Uganda.
The United Nations in 1993 created the separate International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia to examine crimes that took place during the Balkan Wars, which issued 161 indictments and sentenced 90 individuals. 

A year later, the United Nations set up the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to judge those responsible for the genocide and other crimes committed there and in neighbouring states in 1994. It indicted 93 people and sentenced 62. 
Legal experts have raised the possibility of creating a separate tribunal to examine potential war crimes in Ukraine, which could be done through the United Nations or a treaty.

308,"<span>Apr 03, 2022 01:13PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Russia on Sunday denied Ukrainian allegations that it had killed civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, describing footage and photographs of dead bodies as a ""provocation"" and a ""staged performance"" by Kyiv.
Ukraine has accused the Russian military of massacring residents of Bucha, a town northwest of the capital Kyiv, an area Ukrainian troops said they recaptured on Saturday.
""All the photos and videos published by the Kyiv regime, allegedly testifying to the 'crimes' of Russian servicemen in the city of Bucha, Kyiv region, are another provocation,"" Russia's defence ministry said in a statement. 
It called the footage ""another staged performance by the Kyiv regime for the Western media.""
Images of dead civilians strewn across the town prompted Western countries to call for those responsible for war crimes in Ukraine to be punished.
The Russian defence ministry said that all Russian military units had left Bucha on March 30, and that civilians had been free to move around the town or evacuate while it was under Russian control. 
""During the time that Russian armed forces were in control of this settlement, not a single local resident suffered from any violent actions,"" it said. 
Moscow has previously denied allegations that it has targeted civilians, and has rejected accusations of war crimes.

Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists. 
Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces.

VALLETTA (Reuters) -Pope Francis, struggling with leg pain, on Sunday said countries should always help those trying to survive ""amidst the waves of the sea"" as he wrapped up a trip to Malta, which is at the heart of Europe's migration debate.
At the start of the last day of his trip to the Mediterranean island, Francis visited the grotto in the town of Rabat. According to tradition, St. Paul lived there for two months after he was among 75 people shipwrecked on their way to Rome in the year 60 AD. The Bible says they received unusual kindness.
""No one knew their names, their place of birth or their social status; they knew only one thing: that these were people in need of help,"" the pope said in a prayer in the grotto.
The 85-year-old pontiff is suffering from a flare-up of leg pain and had difficultly walking in the small grotto. At a Mass for about 20,000 people afterwards, he mostly sat while Valletta Archbishop Charles Scicluna led much of the liturgy. 
Francis had to use a lift to board his flight in Rome and disembark on arrival in Valletta on Saturday, and at the end of Sunday's Mass, he skipped the traditional exit procession with all the bishops.
Malta is one of the more important routes used by migrants who cross from Libya to Europe.
""Help us to recognise from afar those in need, struggling amidst the waves of the sea, dashed against the reefs of unknown shores,"" the pope said in prayer at the grotto.
The government of Prime Minister Robert Abela insists that the island, by far Europe’s most densely populated country, is ""full up"", refusing to allow the disembarkation of migrants other than those rescued within its own rescue zone. 
Francis' last stop was a visit to a centre for migrants, known as a ""peace lab"". There, he heard Daniel, a Nigerian, tell of his several attempts to reach Europe in un-seaworthy boats and how he was detained in Libya, Tunisia and Malta.
""Sometimes I cried! Sometimes I wished I had died ... why were men like us treating us like criminals and not like brothers?"" Daniel said.
Francis told them that the humanitarian crisis of migration was ""a shipwreck of civilisation which threatens not only migrants but all of us"". Mistreatment of migrants sometimes occurs ""with the complicity of competent authorities,"" he said.
On Friday, the German NGO ship Sea Eye IV was outside Maltese territorial waters seeking to disembark 106 migrants rescued from Libyan waters and was denied entry.
Human rights organisations have criticised the island for its involvement in ""pushbacks"" where migrants rescued in coordination with Malta are taken back to Libya. The organizations say this breaks international law since Libya is not a safe country.

Speaking to Maltese government officials on Saturday, Francis denounced ""sordid agreements with criminals who enslave other human beings"". He has in the past compared conditions in centres holding migrants in Libya to Nazi and Soviet camps.
Malta argues that Europe should have an effective ""burden sharing"" mechanism. Francis also has called several times for shared responsibility for migrants among European countries.

LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) -A leading rights group said on Sunday it had documented ""apparent war crimes"" committed by Russian military forces against civilians in Ukraine.
Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a statement saying it had found ""several cases of Russian military forces committing laws-of-war violations"" in Russian-controlled regions such as Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Kyiv.
The statement, published in Warsaw, came one day after dead civilians were found lying scattered through the streets of the Ukrainian country town of Bucha near Kyiv, three days after the Russian army pulled back from a month-long occupation.
Russia's defence ministry denied on Sunday that its forces had killed civilians in Bucha. It said in a statement that all Russian units had left the town on March 30, and that footage and photographs showing dead bodies were ""yet another provocation"".
The ministry did not immediately respond to the specific allegations in the HRW statement. 
The Kremlin says its ""special military operation"" aims to degrade the Ukrainian armed forces and is targeting military installations, not civilians.
Asked about separate war crime allegations on March 1, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters: ""We categorically deny this."" He dismissed allegations of Russian strikes on civilian targets and the use of cluster bombs and vacuum bombs as fakes. 
The New York-based HRW referred to Bucha in its statement, for which it said it had interviewed 10 people including witnesses, victims and local residents, in person or by phone. It said some had been too scared to give their full names.
“The cases we documented amount to unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence against Ukrainian civilians,” said Hugh Williamson, HRW's Europe and Central Asia director. 
“Rape, murder, and other violent acts against people in the Russian forces' custody should be investigated as war crimes.”
These, it said, included one case of repeated rape; two cases of summary execution - one of six men - and other cases of unlawful violence and threats against civilians between Feb. 27 and March 14. 
""Soldiers were also implicated in looting civilian property, including food, clothing, and firewood. Those who carried out these abuses are responsible for war crimes,"" the report said.
Reuters was not immediately able to verify the HRW evidence.
HRW said that, on March 4, Russian forces in Bucha had ""rounded up five men and summarily executed one of them"". 
Reuters journalists visited Bucha on Saturday and Sunday, after being given access by Ukrainian forces who recaptured the area, and saw bodies wearing no military uniforms scattered in the streets. 
On Sunday, Bucha's mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, showed a Reuters team two corpses with white cloth tied around their arms, which the mayor said residents had been forced to wear during the month that Russian forces occupied the city.
Northeast of Kyiv in the Chernihiv region, the report said, Russian forces in Staryi Bykiv rounded up at least six men on Feb. 27, later executing them. It cited the mother of one of the men, who said she was nearby when her son was captured and who later saw the bodies of all six men.

HRW said all parties to the armed conflict in Ukraine were obligated to abide by international law and the laws of war.
“Russia has an international legal obligation to impartially investigate alleged war crimes by its soldiers,” Williamson said.

COLOMBO (Reuters) -Protesters in the Sri Lanka's largest city Colombo held numerous small, peaceful demonstrations over a severe economic crisis on Sunday, defying a nationwide curfew, while police used tear gas to disperse student protesters in the central city of Kandy. 
A senior police official said officers used tear gas and water cannons to stop a protest of university students in Kandy.
""There were about 750 participants but no arrests were made,"" said Nihal Thalduwa, a police spokesman.
Thalduwa said over 600 people who were arrested in the Western Province on Saturday night for breaking curfew orders were released on bail given by police and charges will be filed against them later.
President Gotabaya Rajapaksa declared a state of emergency on Friday as the Indian Ocean island nation grapples with rising prices, shortages of essentials and rolling power cuts. On Saturday, the government implemented a countrywide curfew after protests turned violent.
On Sunday afternoon the government lifted a block it had placed on social media platforms including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Whatsapp hours earlier. Telecommunications Regulatory Commission Chairman Jayantha de Silva said the measure was carried out on instruction from the Defence Ministry and aimed to ""maintain calm"". De Silva later told Reuters restrictions had been lifted.
While the block was in place, Minister for Youth and Sports Namal Rajapaksa, the president's nephew, nonetheless sent a tweet in which he said he would ""never condone the blocking of social media"".
Critics say the roots of the crisis, the worst in several decades, lie in economic mismanagement by successive governments that amassed huge budget shortfalls and a current account deficit.
The crisis was accelerated by deep tax cuts Rajapaksa promised during the 2019 election campaign and enacted months before the COVID-19 pandemic, which wiped out parts of Sri Lanka's economy. 
SOCIAL MEDIA RESTORED
In Colombo soldiers armed with assault rifles and police manned checkpoints to enforce the curfew, which is scheduled to run until till 6 a.m.(0030 GMT)on Monday.
Around two dozen opposition leaders protested at police barricades near the Independence Square, some shouting ""Gota(baya) Go Home"".
""This is unacceptable,"" said opposition leader Eran Wickramaratne referring to the curfew and other restrictions.
Others stood in small groups outside their homes or gathered in the street, some holding handwritten anti-government banners or waving the national flag.
""This government, we do not want them anymore. They have had years and years to show us that they could do change but there is nothing. The situation has just gotten worse by the day,"" said protester Anjalee Wanduragala, 22, a student at the University of Colombo.
""We really need a change, we are stripped of our basic rights...people are fed up,"" she said.

Emergency powers in the past have allowed the military to arrest and detain suspects without warrants, but the terms of the current powers are not yet clear.
Western and Asian diplomats based in Sri Lanka said they were monitoring the situation and expected the government to allow citizens to hold peaceful demonstrations.

KABUL/PESHAWAR (Reuters) - The Taliban announced on Sunday a ban on the cultivation of narcotics in Afghanistan, the world's biggest opium producer.
""As per the decree of the supreme leader of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, all Afghans are informed that from now on, cultivation of poppy has been strictly prohibited across the country,"" according to an order from the Taliban's supreme leader Haibatullah Akhundzada.
""If anyone violates the decree, the crop will be destroyed immediately and the violator will be treated according to the Sharia law,"" the order, announced at a news conference by the Ministry of Interior in Kabul, said. 
The order said the production, use or transportation of other narcotics was also banned. 
Drug control has been one major demand of the international community of the Islamist group, which took over the country in August and is seeking formal international recognition in order to wind back sanctions that are severely hampering banking, business and development. 
The Taliban banned poppy growing towards the end of their last rule in 2000 as they sought international legitimacy, but faced a popular backlash and later mostly changed their stance, according to experts.
Afghanistan's opium production - which the United Nations estimated was worth $1.4 billion at its height in 2017 - has increased in recent months, farmers and Taliban members told Reuters.
The country's dire economic situation has prompted residents of south-eastern provinces to grow the illicit crop that could bring them faster and higher returns than legal crops such as wheat. 
Taliban sources told Reuters they were anticipating tough resistance from some elements within the group against the ban on poppy and that there had been a surge in the number of farmers cultivating poppy in recent months.

A farmer in Helmand who spoke on condition of anonymity said that in recent weeks prices of poppy had already more than doubled on rumours the Taliban would ban its cultivation. But he added that he needed to grow poppy to support his family.
""Other crops are just not profitable,"" he said.

""Shocked by news of atrocities committed by Russian forces. EU assists Ukraine in documenting war crimes,"" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), adding all cases needed to be pursued by the International Court of Justice.
Ukraine said on Saturday its forces had retaken all areas around Kyiv, claiming complete control of the capital region for the first time since Russia launched its invasion on Feb 24. The mayor of Bucha, a liberated town 37 km (23 miles) northwest of the capital, said 300 residents had been killed by the Russian army. 
""Shocked by haunting images of atrocities committed by Russian army in Kyiv liberated region,"" the president of the EU Council grouping the bloc's member states, Charles Michel, commented on Twitter.
Russia has previously denied targetting civilians and rejected allegations of war crimes in what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. The Russian defence ministry in Moscow did not immediately reply to a request for comment when asked on Sunday about bodies found in Bucha. 

Michel said the EU was assisting Ukraine and non-governmental organisations in gathering the necessary evidence for the prosecution of crimes in international courts.
""Further EU sanctions and support are on their way,"" he added.

314,"<span>Apr 03, 2022 05:27AM ET</span>","SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Shanghai on Sunday ordered its 26 million residents to undergo two more rounds of tests for COVID-19 as public anger grows over how authorities in China's most populous city are tackling a record coronavirus surge.
Residents should self-test on Sunday using antigen kits and report any positive results, Shanghai government officials told a news conference, while a nucleic acid test would be conducted citywide on Monday. 
""The main task is to completely eliminate risk points and to cut off the chain of transmission so that we can curb the spread of the epidemic as soon as possible,"" said Wu Qianyu, an inspector from Shanghai Municipal Health Commission.
Essentially all of China's financial capital is locked down after the city began curbing movement in its eastern districts last Monday, extending the restrictions to the entire city days later 
Shanghai's lockdown has massively disrupted daily life and businesses, even as healthcare workers and volunteers work round the clock trying to test the entire population and supply residents with groceries. 
China's COVID caseload remains low by international standards, but spikes in places like Shanghai are testing its previously successful approach of stamping out the virus through strict curbs and aggressive testing and tracing.
Most of Shanghai's infections have been asymptomatic, according to official data, but China's ""dynamic clearance"" approach requires authorities to test, trace and centrally quarantine all positive cases. 
Shanghai on Sunday reported 7,788 daily locally transmitted asymptomatic cases, up from 6,501 the day before, while symptomatic cases rose to 438 from 260.
The city accounted for the bulk of mainland China's 11,781 daily locally transmitted asymptomatic cases and nearly one-third of its 1,506 symptomatic cases. This was the highest national case count since the early days of the pandemic in February 2020.
China is also battling a large outbreak in the northeastern province of Jilin.
Sent to Shanghai by the central government, Vice-Premier Sun Chunlan urged the city on Saturday to ""make resolute and swift moves"" to curb the pandemic.
GROWING ANGER
Stories of how Shanghai separates COVID-positive children from their parents have gone viral in the country and triggered widespread public anger.
Some have also demanded clarity over the testing regime, after a recorded phone call, reportedly between a Shanghai health official and a resident, was widely shared on Chinese social media.
Shanghai health officials said on Saturday they were investigating the case, in which the resident said his father had tested negative, according to his personal health app, but was told he was positive and had to be centrally quarantined. 
In a rare instance of grassroots lobbying, several residents reposted a statement on the WeChat and Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) social media platforms saying they wanted asymptomatic or mild cases to be allowed to isolate at home, after reports of unsanitary and crowded conditions at quarantine facilities. 
Jane Polubotko, a Ukrainian marketing manager quarantining at the Shanghai New International Expo Center, told Reuters there were no showers at the facility and she had only seen people with light symptoms, such as sneezes and coughs. 
Supply chains and businesses are also being tested. 
River congestion for containers and oil tankers off Shanghai has been easing since Thursday, but the number of bulkers queuing in outer Yangtze estuary anchorage jumped to nearly 90, the most since early October, Refinitiv data showed.
Nearby ports, such as Ningbo in Zhejiang province, are experiencing an acute surge in waiting vessels waiting, as companies divert cargos to avoid prolonged logistics turnarounds.

Still，some are hoping that lockdowns could start to ease soon.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc hopes to resume production at its Shanghai factory on Monday, two people familiar with the matter said, as it expects to see its first batch of workers released from lockdown.

ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukraine said on Saturday its forces had seized back all areas around Kyiv, claiming complete control of the capital region for the first time since Russia launched the invasion. 
As Russian troops regrouped for battles in east Ukraine, towns surrounding Kyiv bore scars of five weeks of fighting. Dead civilians laid scattered over streets, and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russian forces of leaving behind mines. 
Ukraine's troops have retaken more than 30 towns and villages around Kyiv since Russia pulled back from the area this week, Ukrainian officials said. 
""The whole Kyiv region is liberated from the invader,"" Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister, Hanna Malyar, wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). There was no Russian comment on the claim, which Reuters could not immediately verify. 
In the recaptured town of Bucha, reached by Reuters, the sprawled remains of more than a dozen bodies lined one road. A mass grave in the grounds of a church was still open, with hands and feet poking through the red clay heaped on top.
Bucha's mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said more than 300 residents had been killed. Many tearfully recalled brushes with death. 
""We don't want them to come back,"" said Mariya Zhelezova, 74, who spoke of coming under fire by Russian soldiers. ""I had a dream today - that they left, and didn't come back.""
British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she was appalled by atrocities in Bucha and voiced support for the International Criminal Court's inquiry into potential war crimes in Ukraine.
Russia denies targeting civilians and rejects war crimes allegations. 
PUTIN-ZELENSKIY TALKS? 
Since sending troops on Feb. 24 in what it calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarise its neighbour, Russia has failed to capture a single major city and has instead laid siege to urban areas, uprooting a quarter of Ukraine's population. 
Ukraine's armed forces reported diminished Russian air and missile strikes on Saturday but said Russian troops retreating from near Kyiv were deploying mines.
Zelenskiy warned in a video address: ""They are mining all this territory. Houses are mined, equipment is mined, even the bodies of dead people."" He did not cite evidence.
Ukraine's emergencies service said over 1,500 explosives had been found in one day during a search of the village of Dmytrivka, west of Kyiv. 
Russia's defence ministry did not reply to a request for comment on the mining allegations. Reuters could not independently verify them. 
Russia has depicted its drawdown of forces near Kyiv as a goodwill gesture in peace talks. Ukraine and its allies say Russia was forced to shift its focus to east Ukraine after suffering heavy losses near Kyiv. 
Both sides described talks held this week in Istanbul and by video link as ""difficult"". Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Saturday the ""main thing is that the talks continue, either in Istanbul or somewhere else"". 
A new round of talks has not yet been announced. But Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia said on Saturday that enough progress had been made to allow direct talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskiy.
""The Russian side confirmed our thesis that the draft documents have been sufficiently developed to allow direct consultations between the two countries' leaders,"" Arakhamia said. Russia has not commented on the possibility. 
FLEEING MARIUPOL
Among those killed near Kyiv was Maksim Levin, a Ukrainian photographer and videographer who was working for a local news website and was a long-time contributor to Reuters. 
His body was found in a village north of Kyiv on April 1, the news website LB.ua where he worked said on Saturday.
In the east, a Red Cross convoy was again seeking to evacuate civilians from the besieged port of Mariupol after abandoning an attempt on Friday over security concerns. It was not expected to reach the city until at least Sunday. 
Mariupol is Russia's main target in Ukraine's southeastern region of Donbas, and tens of thousands of civilians there are trapped with scant access to food and water. 
Some civilians who have escaped Mariupol said Russian soldiers seeking Ukrainian fighters repeatedly stopped them as they fled. 
""They stripped the men naked, looked for tattoos,"" said Dmytro Kartavov, a 32-year-old builder.
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) spokesperson Ewan Watson said its convoy had departed the city of Zaporizhzhia, some 200 kilometres (124 miles) from Mariupol, and would spend the night en route. Russia blamed the ICRC for the delays.
MISSILE STRIKES
Pope Francis said a ""potentate"" was fomenting conflicts for nationalist interests, the closest he has come yet to criticising Putin, although he did not name the Russian president.
""Once again, some potentate, sadly caught up in anachronistic claims of nationalist interests, is provoking and fomenting conflicts, while ordinary people sense the need to build a future that will either be shared or not be at all,"" he said. 
Ukrainian officials reported missile strikes in various parts of the country. 
In the south-central Dnipro region, a Russian rocket hit a rail line, badly damaging tracks and suspending train traffic, Ukrainian officials said. Earlier, Russian missiles hit the central Ukrainian cities of Poltava and Kremenchuk, said Dmitry Lunin, head of the Poltava region. 

Russia's defence ministry said its missiles had disabled military airfields in Poltava and Dnipro. It later said its forces had hit 28 Ukrainian military facilities across the country, including two weapons depots.
The Ukrainian military also reported Russian air strikes on the cities of Severodonetsk and Rubizhne in the Luhansk region.

PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron warned of the risk of a Brexit-style election upset in his only campaign rally before the first round of the presidential election, in a bid to convince dispirited voters and re-energise a lacklustre campaign.
A week or so before the April 10 vote, Macron finds himself on the defensive, with far-right leader Marine Le Pen staging a comeback in the polls and the race tightening between the two frontrunners for the crucial April 24 runoff.
""Look at what happened with Brexit, and so many other elections: what looked improbable actually happened,"" Macron told a crowd of flag-waving supporters. ""Nothing is impossible.""
""The danger of extremism has reached new heights because, in recent months and years, hatred, alternative truths have been normalised,"" he said. ""We have got used to see on TV shows antisemitic and racist authors.""
Although he is still projected to win a second mandate, Macron has lost ground in the polls, a dip that some aides attribute to a manifesto that includes tough, conservative measures such as raising the state pension age to 65. 
Others have also criticised a campaign that started late and lacked ""magic"".
After a rockstar-like entry on to the stage of a 35,000-seat stadium outside Paris, Macron started his two-hour speech with a long list of accomplishments and promises to create jobs in hospitals and nursing homes, in a clear attempt to convince centre-left voters that pollsters say could abstain.
""Our lives, their lives, are worth more than profits,"" he told the crowd, stealing a well-known anti-capitalist slogan. He also urged a round of applause for teachers and nurses. 
However, he stayed true to his reformist programme, saying the French will have to work longer to pay for these measures, because he refused to raise taxes and increase a public debt pile that has ballooned to 102% of GDP during the pandemic.
""I am not hiding the fact that we will have to work more,"" Macron said, attacking contenders such as Le Pen and far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon who have promised to cut the pension age to 60. 
""Don't believe those who say they will cut the retirement age to 60 or 62 and that everything will be alright. That's not true,"" he added.

The rally of about 30,000 supporters - almost reaching the venue's full capacity - was attended by former left-wing and right-wing prime ministers and other party grandees. Yet one supporter asked by Reuters found the speech underwhelming.
""It's a speech that shows he wants to explain what he will do, but it lacked inspiration,"" said Martin Rochepeau, a 22-year old student.

Ukraine says its troops have retaken control of more than 30 towns and villages in the Kyiv region since Russia announced this week it would scale down its operations around the capital and in the neighbouring northern region of Chernihiv to focus on battles in the east.
""In the north of our country, the invaders are leaving. It is slow but noticeable. In some places they are being kicked out with fighting. Elsewhere they're abandoning the positions themselves,"" Zelenskiy said in a video address released on Saturday, without citing evidence.
""They are mining all this territory. Houses are mined, equipment is mined, even the bodies of dead people.""
Chernihiv Governor Viacheslav Chaus on Saturday also accused Russian troops of planting mines as they drew back from positions around the regional capital.
""There are a lot of mines. They (the villages) are strewn with them,"" he said on national television. 
Russia's defence ministry did not reply to a request for comment on the allegations. 
Reuters could not independently verify the allegations.
On Saturday, the emergencies service told people in the Kyiv region's newly liberated zones to be vigilant, saying over 1,500 explosives had been found in one day during a search of the village of Dmytrivka, west of the capital.
Zelenskiy said efforts were ongoing to clear mines and secure the areas, but advised residents who had fled to stay away for now.
""It is still impossible to return to normal life as it was,"" he said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin calls the action he launched on Feb. 24 a ""special military operation aimed at demilitarising and denazifying"" Ukraine.
Ukraine and its allies call this a baseless pretext for a war of aggression. Since the invasion, more than 10 million people have been displaced from their homes.

BUCHA, Ukraine (Reuters) - Dead civilians still lay scattered over the streets of the Ukrainian country town of Bucha on Saturday, three days after the invading Russian army pulled back from its abortive advance on Kyiv to the southeast.
The smell of explosives still hung in the cold, dank air, mingling with the stench of death. 
Sixty-six-year-old Vasily, who gave no surname, looked at the sprawled remains of more than a dozen civilians dotted along the road outside his house, his face disfigured with grief.
Residents said they had been killed by the Russian troops during their month-long occupation.
To Vasily's left, one man lay against a grass verge next to his bicycle, his face sallow and eyes sunken. Another lay in the middle of the road, a few metres from his front door. Vasily said it was his son's godfather, a lifelong friend.
Bucha's still-unburied dead wore no uniforms. They were civilians with bikes, their stiff hands still gripping bags of shopping. Some had clearly been dead for many days, if not weeks.
For the most part, they were whole, and it was unclear whether they had been killed by shrapnel, a blast or a bullet - but one had the top of his head missing.
""The bastards!"" Vasily said, weeping with rage in a thick coat and woollen hat. ""I’m sorry. The tank behind me was shooting. Dogs!""
   ""We were sitting in the cellar for two weeks. There was food but no light, no heating to warm up. ""We put the water on candles to warm it ... We slept in felt boots.""
OPEN GRAVE
    Local officials gave Reuters reporters access to the area, and a policeman led the way through streets now patrolled by Ukrainian tanks to the road where the bodies lay.
It was not clear why they had not yet been buried.
Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk said more than 300 residents of the town had been killed, and a mass grave at one church ground was still open, with hands and feet poking through the red clay heaped on top.
   Several streets were strewn with the mangled wrecks of burned-out Russian tanks and armoured vehicles. Unexploded rockets lay on the road and, in one spot, an unexploded mortar shell poked out of the tarmac. 
    A column of Ukrainian tanks patrolled, flying blue and yellow national flags. One resident who had survived the ordeal hugged a soldier, and gave the military battle-cry: ""Glory to Ukraine, glory to the heroes!""
    Mariya Zhelezova, 74, worked as a cleaner at an airplane factory whose poor health stopped her leaving before the Russians came.
    Walking with her 50-year-old daughter Iryna, she tearfully recalled brushes with death.
""The first time, I went out of the room and a bullet broke the glass, the window, and got stuck in the dresser,"" she said. ""The second time, shattered glass almost got into my leg.
""The third time, I was walking and didn’t know he was standing with a rifle and the bullets went right past me. When I got home, I couldn’t speak.""
She removed a white cloth armband that she said residents had been ordered to wear. 

    ""We don’t want them to come back,"" she said. ""I had a dream today - that they left, and didn’t come back.""
The Kremlin and the Russian defence ministry in Moscow did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

He leaves behind his wife and four children.
His body was found in a village north of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on April 1, the news website LB.ua where he worked said on Saturday.
Levin, born in 1981, was a documentary film maker who had contributed to Reuters' coverage of the country since 2013. 
He had been working in the village of Huta Mezhyhirska. There had been heavy shelling in that area.
The prosecutor general's office in Ukraine said Levin was ""killed by servicemen of the Russian Armed Forces with two shots from small arms"". This could not be independently verified.

John Pullman, Reuters' global managing editor for visuals, said: ""We are deeply saddened to hear of the death of Maksim Levin, a long-time contributor to Reuters, in Ukraine.""
""Maks has provided compelling photos and video from Ukraine to Reuters since 2013. His death is a huge loss to the world of journalism. Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.""

“There is a world where we have six or seven sites in the UK” by 2050, Kwarteng told the newspaper.

The Sunday Telegraph said ministers have agreed to set up a new development vehicle, called Great British Nuclear, to identify sites, cut through red tape to speed up the planning process, and bring together private firms to run each site.
It said Britain's new energy security strategy, set to be unveiled on Thursday, is expected to commit the government to supporting the construction of at least two new large-scale nuclear plants by 2030 in addition to small modular reactors.

Los Angeles County Superior Court granted summary judgment to Judicial Watch on Friday. The conservative legal group had argued the law violates the equal protection clause of California's constitution. The ruling did not provide Judge Terry Green's reasoning behind the decision.
The law, passed in 2020, required that publicly traded companies with a main office in California appoint at least one member of the Asian, Black, Latino, LGBT, Native American, or Pacific Islander communities to their boards by the end of 2021 through either filling a vacant seat or creating a new one.
""This historic California court decision declared unconstitutional one of the most blatant and significant attacks in the modern era on constitutional prohibitions against discrimination,"" said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.

VALLETTA (Reuters) -Pope Francis said on Saturday he was considering a trip to Kyiv and implicitly criticised Russian President Vladimir Putin over the invasion of Ukraine, saying a ""potentate"" was fomenting conflict for nationalist interests.
Francis made the comments, first to reporters on the plane taking him to Malta for a two-day visit, and then in a hard-hitting speech in the island's presidential palace that left little doubt who he was referring to.
""From the east of Europe, from the land of the sunrise, the dark shadows of war have now spread. We had thought that invasions of other countries, savage street fighting and atomic threats were grim memories of a distant past,"" the pope said.
Moscow denies targeting civilians in the action it launched on Feb. 24, which it dubs a ""special military operation"" designed not to occupy territory but to demilitarise and ""denazify"" its neighbour. Francis has already rejected that terminology, calling it a war.
""However, the icy winds of war, which bring only death, destruction and hatred in their wake, have swept down powerfully upon the lives of many people and affected us all,"" Francis said. 
""Once again, some potentate, sadly caught up in anachronistic claims of nationalist interests, is provoking and fomenting conflicts, whereas ordinary people sense the need to build a future that, will either be shared, or not be at all,"" he said, without mentioning Putin by name.
Francis' voice was strong but he sat to deliver his speech. For the first time in his 36 trips abroad, a flare-up of pain in his knee had forced him to use a freight lift to board the plane in Rome and disembark in Valletta - to avoid ""unnecessary strain"", Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said.
The pope, who was limping as he walked in the presidential palace of the predominantly Catholic island, has already strongly condemned what he has called an ""unjustified aggression"" and denounced ""atrocities"" in the war.
NIGHT OF WAR
But he has only referred to Russia directly in prayers, such as during a special global event for peace on March 25.
""Now in the night of the war that is fallen upon humanity, let us not allow the dream of peace to fade,"" he said at the palace.
He again criticised the armaments industry and expressed distress at the fading enthusiasm for peace that emerged after World War Two, saying the clash of interests and ideologies had ""re-emerged powerfully in the seductions of autocracy, new forms of imperialism (and) widespread aggressiveness.""
Earlier, asked by a reporter on the flight if he was considering an invitation to visit Kyiv, the pope answered: ""Yes, it is on the table"". He gave no further details.
Francis has been invited by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko, Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk of Ukraine's Byzantine-rite Catholic Church, and Ukraine's ambassador to the Vatican, Andriy Yurash.
He has spoken on the phone with Zelenskiy and Shevchuk.
Francis also condemned corruption in Malta, where claims of financial irregularities and nepotism have dominated the political narrative for much of the past decade.
""May you always cultivate legality and transparency, which will enable the eradication of corruption and criminality,"" he said.
Malta for years has been on the front line of Europe's migration crisis, with thousands of migrants arriving from north Africa trying to make their way to the mainland.

In an apparent reference to some EU countries sending migrants rescued at sea back to Libya, Francis denounced ""sordid agreements with criminals who enslave other human beings"".
Francis has in the past has compared conditions in centres holding migrants in Libya to Nazi and Soviet camps.

ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine (Reuters) - As Dmytro Kartavov and his family joined thousands of people trying to flee the bombed-out city of Mariupol, one additional obstacle awaited as Russian troops sought to identify anyone fighting with Ukrainian forces defending the city.
    ""They stripped the men naked, looked for tattoos,"" said Kartayov, a 32 year-old builder, who said the troops paid particular attention to men's knees.
""I work, I do repairs, naturally my knees - these are working knees. They say - (you) climbed trenches, dug, and the like.""
    Speaking in a supermarket that has been turned into a reception centre in the Ukrainian-held town of Zaporizhzhia some 200 km from Mariupol, he told Reuters the family left the besieged city to the west, reaching the port of Berdyansk by bus before crossing into Ukrainian-held territory on foot.
On the way, Kartavov said Russian soldiers checked men for signs they had been fighting with Ukrainian forces.
    ""They checked my forearms, looked at the hands, checked if I was shooting, whether or not there will be a callus here on the arms,"" he added.
    Russia's defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment on the searches.
Mariupol, an industrial port city close to the breakaway Donetsk People's Republic, had a pre-war population of around 400,000, but the city has been devastated by regular bombardment since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. 
    Fierce resistance by Ukrainian forces including regular army troops and members of the Azov Battalion, a far-right militia now part of Ukraine's National Guard, have held off the assault for weeks, rejecting Kremlin demands to lay down their arms.
    The fighting has killed around 5,000 civilians, according to city authorities, and forced thousands to flee either by private car or in organized convoys of buses into eastern Ukraine where pro-Russian separatists are in control, or to the north and west to territory controlled by the Ukrainians. 
    As the convoys try to leave, checks to identify fighters have become a regular part of the ordeal, witnesses said.
    Vladimir Andreev, a 63-year-old pensioner from Mariupol and former employee of Metinvest steel company, travelled in a separate group that included his wife and their friend, Valentina Kirichek.

    Andreev said the party was stopped around 17 times at various Russian checkpoints.
    ""At each checkpoint we were stopped ... We were checked, undressed. They checked our shoulders, arms ... (to see) if I had been taking part in the fighting.""

But after numerous failed attempts at peace and more than a year of escalating violence, Yemenis have greeted the news cautiously. 
""The truce is good but I do not have faith in its success, because each side will have a different interpretation of how to implement it and it will collapse,"" said 38-year-old electrician Murad Abdullah in Aden, the interim capital of Yemen's government. 
The two-month truce, which coincides with the start of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, is the first time since 2016 that warring sides have agreed a nationwide cessation of hostilities. 
Government employee Ibtihal al-Arashi saw the deal as temporary, pointing to the failure of past Ramadan peace attempts. ""We want to end this absurd war. We want real peace under a civil state that protects rights and freedoms,"" she said. 
The ceasefire was due to come into effect at 7 p.m. local time (1600 GMT) and can be renewed. 
The deal includes a halt to offensive military operations, including cross-border attacks, and also allows fuel imports into areas controlled by the Iran-aligned Houthi group and some commercial flights to operate from the Houthi-held capital Sanaa. 
A military coalition led by Saudi Arabia, which intervened in March 2015 in support of the Yemeni government against the Houthis, controls Yemen's seas and air space.
Customers in a busy Sanaa market welcomed the possibility that the truce might herald real progress after years of hardship.
""This truce is indeed good, an excellent thing, but let's see how it is actually implemented ... Should the strikes on Sanaa stop, the airport open, Hodeidah port open, then we will feel there is a truce, that it has something tangible,"" said Najeeb al-Bashiri, a government employee. 
U.N. special envoy Hans Grundberg has said he will press for a permanent ceasefire. 
The U.N and U.S. Yemen envoys had been trying since last year to engineer a permanent truce needed to revive stalled political negotiations. The Houthis wanted the coalition blockade lifted first, while the alliance sought a simultaneous deal.
""We welcome this essential development for millions of Yemenis who need a respite after years of relentless fighting,"" said the Norwegian Refugee Council, a humanitarian agency operating in Yemen. ""We really hope this is the start of a new chapter."" 

The conflict is widely seen as a proxy war between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Iran.
Iran on Saturday said it hoped the truce could presage a complete lifting of the blockade and a permanent ceasefire.

COLOMBO (Reuters) -Sri Lanka's government imposed a weekend curfew on Saturday, even as hundreds of lawyers urged President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to revoke a state of emergency introduced following unrest over fuel and other shortages in a deep economic crisis.
The government's information department said a countrywide curfew would run from 6 p.m. (1230 GMT) on Saturday to 6 a.m. (0030 GMT) on Monday.
Rajapaksa introduced a state of emergency on Friday, raising fears of a crackdown on protests. Emergency powers in the past have allowed the military to arrest and detain suspects without warrants, but the terms of the current powers are not yet clear. 
The Indian Ocean island nation of 22 million people is grappling with rolling blackouts for up to 13 hours a day as the government scrambles to secure foreign exchange to pay for fuel and other essential imports..
""People take to the streets when things are impossible,"" 68-year-old Colombo shop owner Nishan Ariyapala told Reuters TV. ""When people take to the streets the political leaders of the country must act thoughtfully.""
Rajapaksa said the state of emergency was needed to protect public order and maintain essential supplies and services.
Angered by the shortages of fuel and other essential items, hundreds of protesters clashed on Thursday with police and the military outside Rajapaksa's residence as they called for his ouster and torched several police and army vehicles. 
Police arrested 53 people and imposed a curfew in and around Colombo on Friday to contain other sporadic protests.
Shops opened and traffic was normal on Saturday, while police remained stationed at some petrol stations. 
'FAILURE TO UNDERSTAND'
""There has been a failure to understand the aspirations of the people and to empathize with the suffering of the people of the country,"" the lawyers, members of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, said in their appeal, adding that freedom of speech and peaceful assembly should be respected.
Reacting to the state of emergency, U.S. ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung said: ""Sri Lankans have a right to protest peacefully - essential for democratic expression.
""I am watching the situation closely, and hope the coming days bring restraint from all sides, as well as much needed economic stability and relief for those suffering,"" she tweeted.
Highlighting the severe shortage of foreign currency, a vessel carrying 5,500 metric tonnes of cooking gas had to leave Sri Lankan waters after Laugfs Gas, the company that ordered it, could not procure $4.9 million from local banks to pay for it.
""People are struggling with an acute shortage of cooking gas, but how can we help them when there are no dollars? We are stuck,"" Laugfs Gas Chairman W.H.K. Wegapitiya told Reuters.
The ongoing crisis - the result of economic mismanagement by successive governments - has been compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has hit tourism and remittances. 
It has also marked a sharp turnaround in political support for Rajapaksa, who swept to power in 2019 promising stability.

The government has said it is seeking a bailout from the International Monetary Fund and loans from India and China.
In the first major food aid to the country since Colombo secured a credit line from New Delhi, Indian traders have started loading 40,000 tonnes of rice.

VALLETTA (Reuters) - Pope Francis had to use an elevator to board a plane taking him to Malta on Saturday, with Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni saying it was to ""avoid unnecessary strain"". 
It was the first time in the pope's 36 trips abroad that he did not walk up the plane steps on his own. The 85-year-old pope, who is making a two-day visit to Malta, suffers from sciatica, a nerve condition that causes pain in his legs.
While on the plane, the pope was in good spirits when greeting journalists onboard, but he was walking down the aisle of the aircraft with difficulty. 
He also used an elevator to disembark the plane once it landed in Valletta, Malta's capital.
Francis was forced to cancel a trip to Florence in February and did not take part in the Ash Wednesday services this year because of an acute flare up of pain in his knee. 

The pope was hospitalised for 11 days in July for surgery to remove part of his colon. After a period of rest he made a gruelling trip to Hungary and Slovakia in September.
He has been in general good health since but has occasionally complained of pain in his leg and knee.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) -Nepal's Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba met his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi and inaugurated the Himalayan nation's only railway link with its southern neighbour on Saturday in a summit meant to deepen relations.
Deuba's first trip to India since becoming prime minister in July comes a week after a visit by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi to Nepal.
Nepal, a natural buffer between India and China, traditionally balances its ties with Beijing and New Delhi as both seek to woo it by pouring in aid and investment for infrastructure.
After the meeting, Deuba and Modi jointly flagged off Nepal's only railway link between Janakpur in Nepal and the border town of Jaynagar in India.
The 35-km (22-mile) railway was reconstructed by India as a grant. It was built by the colonial British Indian government as a narrow-gauge line to transport logs from Nepal.
The two prime ministers also remotely inaugurated an electricity transmission line that will supply hydroelectric power generated in the Solukhumbu area, where Mount Everest is located, to Nepal's national power grid.
Both countries agreed to speed up the Pancheswar hydroelectric project on their border in west Nepal, which Modi said would be a ""game changer"" for the development of the region.
""The friendship between India and Nepal and mutual relationship between our people ... cannot be found anywhere in the world,"" Modi told a news briefing after the meeting. ""Threads of our civilization, culture and mutual exchanges have been linked since ancient times.""
Deuba said Nepal's ties with India were ""highly important"" and Kathmandu was ""eager to benefit from India's progress through a mutually beneficial economic partnership.""
Nepal agreed to use the Indian RuPay card which would strengthen ""financial connectivity,"" and promote Indian tourist flows, India said in a statement.
Both sides also signed agreements that include cooperation in railways and sharing technical expertise between the Indian Oil Corporation and Nepal Oil Corporation.

Analysts said the visit would help further promote the multi-faceted relations between India and Nepal.
""The visit is taking place after four years and will help increase trust and understanding between the two countries,"" Dinesh Bhattarai, a Nepali former ambassador to Geneva told Reuters.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Esther Zhao thought she was doing the right thing when she brought her 2-1/2-year-old daughter to a Shanghai hospital with a fever on March 26. 
Three days later, Zhao was begging health authorities not to separate them after she and the little girl both tested positive for COVID-19, saying her daughter was too young to be taken away to a quarantine centre for children. 
Doctors then threatened Zhao that her daughter would be left at the hospital, while she was sent to the centre, if she did not agree to transfer the girl to the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center in the city's Jinshan district. 
Since her daughter was sent to the centre Zhao has had only one brief message that she was fine, sent through a group chat with doctors, despite repeated pleas for information from Zhao and her husband, who is in a separate quarantine site after also testing positive.
""There have been no photos at all... I'm so anxious, I have no idea what situation my daughter is in,"" she said on Saturday through tears, still stuck at the hospital she went to last week. ""The doctor said Shanghai rules is that children must be sent to designated points, adults to quarantine centres and you're not allowed to accompany the children.""
Zhao is panicking even more after images of crying children at a Shanghai health facility went viral in China. The anonymous poster said these were children who had tested positive for COVID-19 and been separated from their parents at the Jinshan centre.
The photos and videos posted on China's Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) and Douyin social media platforms showed wailing babies kept three to a cot. In one video, a groaning toddler crawls out of a room with four child-sized beds pushed against the wall. While a few adults can be seen in the videos, they are outnumbered by the number of children. 
Reuters could not immediately verify the images, but a source familiar with the facility confirmed they were taken at the Jinshan facility. 
The Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center said, however, that the photos and videos circulating on internet were not of a ""Jinshan infant quarantine facility"" but were scenes taken when the hospital was moving its paediatric ward to another building to cope with a rising number of COVID paediatric patients. 
This was done to ""improve the hospital environment"", it said on its official WeChat account on Saturday, adding that it had organised for more pediatric workers and would strengthen communication with the children's parents.
""Paediatric patients admitted to our hospital... are guaranteed medical treatment and their daily needs taken care of,"" it said. 
Later on Saturday the Shanghai rumour buster WeChat account, which is backed by China's cyberspace watchdog, published four photos that it said showed the children's current situation at the Jinshan centre. 
One of the photos showed young children sitting in and standing around beds that were arranged neatly in two rows, though no adults were pictured. In another photo, a hazmat-suited person attends to a baby lying in a cot. Only one other adult, also in a hazmat suit, can be seen in the two other photos. 
The Shanghai government referred Reuters to the hospital's statement and declined to comment further.
A Shanghai health official said last week that hospitals that were treating COVID-positive children maintained online communications with their parents. 
POST DELETED
By Saturday, the original post had been deleted from Weibo, but thousands of people continued to comment and repost the images. ""This is horrific,"" said one. ""How could the government come up with such a plan?,"" said another. 
In some cases children as young as 3 months old are being separated from their breastfeeding mothers, according to posts in a quarantine hospital WeChat group shared with Reuters. In one room described in a post, there are eight children without an adult.
In another case, more than 20 children from a Shanghai kindergarten aged 5 to 6 were sent to a quarantine centre without their parents, a source familiar with the situation said.
Since Shanghai's latest outbreak began about a month ago, authorities have locked down its 26 million people in a two-stage process that began on Monday.
While the number of cases in Shanghai is small by global standards, Chinese authorities have vowed to stick with ""dynamic clearance"", aiming to test for, trace and centrally quarantine all positive cases. 

The U.S., French and Italian foreign consulates have warned their citizens in Shanghai that family separations could happen as Chinese authorities executed COVID curbs, according to notices seen by Reuters. 
Shanghai on Saturday reported 6,051 locally transmitted asymptomatic COVID-19 cases and 260 symptomatic cases for April 1, versus 4,144 asymptomatic cases and 358 symptomatic ones on the previous day.

LONDON (Reuters) - Russia accused Ukraine on Thursday of laying hundreds of mines near its coast and said some were drifting into open waters of the Black Sea and creating dangers for merchant shipping, a day after Kyiv said Moscow was responsible for planting mines.
The Black Sea is a major shipping route for grain, oil and oil products. Its waters are shared by Bulgaria, Romania, Georgia and Turkey as well as Ukraine and Russia, which have been at war since President Vladimir Putin invaded his southern neighbour on Feb. 24.
Ukraine's foreign ministry said on Wednesday that Russia was planting naval mines in the Black Sea as ""uncontrolled drifting ammunition"", turning them ""into a de facto weapon of indiscriminate action"".
Russia's defence ministry said on Thursday that from Feb. 24 to March 4, the remnants of the Ukrainian navy's mine-sweeping forces had placed about 420 sea anchor mines - 370 in the Black Sea and 50 in the Sea of Azov.
""As a result of storms in the Black Sea and due to unsatisfactory technical condition, cables with bottom anchors broke on about 10 Ukrainian mines,"" the defence ministry said. 
""Since then, under the influence of wind and surface currents, Ukrainian mines have drifted freely in the western part of the Black Sea in a southerly direction ... No one can know where the remaining Ukrainian mines are drifting today.""
Russia said Ukraine had ""created a direct mine threat to transport and cargo ships of all Black Sea countries"". Ukrainian officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Earlier this month Russia's main intelligence agency accused Ukraine of laying mines to protect ports and said several hundred of the explosives had broken from cables and drifted away. Kyiv dismissed that account as disinformation. 
In recent days Turkish and Romanian military diving teams have been involved in defusing stray mines around their waters.
Turkey's defence ministry said it had not yet identified the source and number of drifting mines and had been in contact with Ukrainian and Russian counterparts over the issue. 
Tayfun Ozberk, a former senior officer with Turkey's navy, told Reuters it was difficult to determine reliable information on the mines which were being used by both Russia and Ukraine. 
""Considering that it has been under a blockade for about two months, it seems very unlikely that Ukraine has recently laid mines,"" Ozberk said.
""In order for there to be 420 free floating mines, Ukraine must have laid 2,000-2,500 mines here. Because every mine you lay does not break, either. Therefore, the possibility that Ukraine may have just mined this area does not make much sense to me.""
Ozberk said it was unlikely for even old mines to break away from their thick chains in large numbers.
Yoruk Isik, Istanbul-based geopolitical analyst and head of the Bosphorus Observer consultancy, said if the mines threat got bigger it could require an international response including help from Spanish, Italian, French and Greek vessels. 
London's marine insurance market has widened the area of waters it considers high risk in the region and insurance costs have soared.
Five merchant vessels have been hit by projectiles - with one of them sunk - off Ukraine's coast, with two seafarers killed, shipping officials say.

The Iskander missiles can reach almost all of western Europe and there is no missile shield in place to protect against this threat, Germany's chief of defence Eberhard Zorn told Welt am Sonntag in an interview published on Saturday.
""The Israelis and the Americans possess such systems. Which one do we prefer? Will we manage to establish an overall (missile defence) system in NATO? These are the questions we need to answer now,"" Zorn said.
He did not specify the names of the systems but was most likely referring to Arrow 3 built by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) and the U.S. system THAAD produced by Raytheon (NYSE:RTN).
Russia said in 2018 it had deployed Iskander missiles to its Kaliningrad exclave, a slice of Russia wedged between Poland and Lithuania. A mobile ballistic missile system, the Iskander replaced the Soviet Scud missile and its two guided missiles can carry either conventional or nuclear warheads.
In a landmark speech days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Berlin would hike its defence spending to more than 2% of its economic output by injecting 100 billion euros ($110 billion) into the military.
Zorn belongs to a group of high-ranking officials consulting with Scholz on how to spend this money.
""So far, only one thing is clear: We have neither the time nor the money to develop these (missile defence) systems on our own because the missile threat is known to already be there"", Zorn said.

Referring to Germany's lack of a short-range missile defence, which can be used to protect troops on the move or under threat while deployed, he said Berlin had started looking into the purchase of such systems and it now had to make a decision.
Beyond this, the Bundeswehr will have to invest 20 billion euros by 2032 to replenish its ammunition storages, Zorn added.

Taiwan is excluded from most global organisations due to objections from China, which considers it one of its provinces and not a separate country. In particular, Taipei has complained that exclusion from the WHO has hampered efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.
The U.S. State Department said in a statement Friday the meeting took place in Washington between high-level diplomats including Assistant Secretary for International Organization Affairs Michele J. Sison and Taiwan's de facto U.S. ambassador Hsiao Bi-Khim.
""This discussion focused on opportunities for Taiwan's participation as an observer in the World Health Assembly in May and the possibilities for Taiwan's participation at the International Civil Aviation Organization,"" it added, referring to another United Nations body.
Taiwan attended the World Health Assembly, the WHO's decision-making body, as an observer from 2009-2016 when Taipei-Beijing relations warmed. But China blocked further participation after the election of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who China views as a separatist - a charge she rejects.
The G7 group of advanced industrialised countries have backed calls for Taiwan's participation at the WHO. China and the WHO say Taiwan has been given appropriate access to COVID information. 
The State Department added that at Thursday's meeting the two sides also discussed Taiwan's contributions through its membership or ""meaningful participation"" in other multilateral forums.
""All participants recognised the importance of working closely with all those who share our concerns regarding attempts to exclude Taiwan from contributing its expertise, resources, energy, and generosity to the international community.""

Last month, Chen Xu, China's ambassador to the U.N. mission in Geneva where the WHO is based, said Taiwan was a Chinese province with no justification to be represented in global bodies.
Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu shot back in a tweet: ""Lying all the time! You might as well claim the moon"".

BRUSSELS/BEIJING (Reuters) -China offered the European Union assurances on Friday that it would seek peace in Ukraine but said this would be on its own terms, deflecting pressure for a tougher stance towards Russia.
Premier Li Keqiang told EU leaders that Beijing would push for peace in ""its own way"", while President Xi Jinping said he hoped the EU would treat China ""independently"", in a nod to Europe's close ties with the United States.
The EU told Beijing during the virtual summit with Li and Xi not to allow Moscow to circumvent Western sanctions imposed over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""We called on China to help end the war in Ukraine. China cannot turn a blind eye to Russia's violation of international law,"" European Council President Charles Michel told a news briefing with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen after the first EU-China summit since Dec. 30, 2020.
""Any attempts to circumvent sanctions or provide aid to Russia would prolong the war,"" he said.
China is forging closer energy, trade and security ties with Moscow, positioning itself as a global force that can stand up to the United States. Several weeks before the Feb. 24 invasion, China and Russia declared a ""no-limits"" strategic partnership.
Li told the EU leaders that China has always sought peace and promoted negotiations and is willing to continue to play a constructive role with the international community, state broadcaster CCTV reported. CCTV also reported Xi's comments on an independent EU policy.
Michel said the two sides agreed that the war, which Russia calls a ""special military operation"", was threatening global security and the global economy.
China has refused to condemn Russia's action in Ukraine or call it an invasion, and has repeatedly criticised what it calls illegal and unilateral Western sanctions.
Michel and von der Leyen described the tone of the summit as ""open and frank"", while von der Leyen said trade between two of the world's biggest economies was far greater than China's economic ties with Russia.
More than a quarter of China's global trade was with the bloc and the United States last year, against just 2.4% with Russia, an EU official said.
'DEFINING MOMENT'
China has concerns that European countries are taking harder-line foreign policy cues from Washington and has called for the EU to ""exclude external interference"" from its relations with China. In 2019, the EU abruptly switched from soft diplomatic language to label China a systemic rival. 
The EU, Britain and the United States have sanctioned Chinese officials over alleged human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region, which prompted Beijing to retaliate in kind, freezing an already-negotiated EU-China investment deal.
China has since also suspended imports from Lithuania after the Baltic EU nation allowed Taiwan to open a de facto embassy in its capital, angering Beijing which regards the democratically ruled island as its own territory.

Von der Leyen said Beijing needed to defend the international order that has made China the world's second-largest economy. The West says Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a violation of the United Nations charter. 
""It is a defining moment because nothing will be like it was before the war. It's now a question to take a very clear stance to support and defend the rules-based order,"" she said.

(Reuters) - The road to organizing Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s first union in the United States was a long one for Christian Smalls.
The 33-year-old had worked at Walmart (NYSE:WMT),  Target  (NYSE:TGT) and  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD). A rapper early in his career, he gave up music to support twin children, and by 2015, he took a warehouse job at Amazon in his home state of New Jersey, and later New York, he said.
It was not until the COVID-19 pandemic that Smalls found an unlikely calling: uniting workers at a company that for decades had resisted unionizing, and re-writing a labor playbook in the process.
In March 2020, the virus's spread had alarmed workers at JFK8, the retailer's Staten Island warehouse, who believed Amazon was not addressing the threat. Smalls decided to help stage a walkout demanding health safeguards including the worksite's closure. He showed up despite being on paid quarantine from a close COVID contact, so Amazon fired him -- catapulting him to fame.
New York's attorney general that day started looking into his firing, precipitating months of legal battles between the state and the retailer. 
In leaked notes for which he voiced regret later, David Zapolsky, Amazon's general counsel, called Smalls ""not smart, or articulate"" and suggested the company ""make him the face of the entire union/organizing movement.""
And that's what happened.
The general counsel's attack was motivation to fight harder, Smalls said in an interview on Thursday. On Friday he pulled off an unthinkable victory as workers at JFK8 voted to unionize.
""It's the way we organized,"" he said, ""the way I spent every single day talking to workers, rain or shine.""
After his firing, he crisscrossed the country trying to rally essential workers, calling for an Amazon Prime Day boycott, even building a tree of defaced Amazon boxes outside founder Jeff Bezos's home around Christmas. People who said they were Smalls' associates alleged he did not properly account for the money he fundraised. Smalls disputed the claim and said he did not know the accusers.
He drew consternation from union officials, his likeliest allies, by saying his was the worker-led effort, free of older groups' baggage. Smalls said Thursday that he had no ill will toward traditional unions.
Many doubted Smalls when he announced plans to unionize JFK8 last year, but he set up a tent outside the warehouse, while supporters in the building touted how a union could demand higher wages, safer conditions and job security. His team raised money on GoFundMe. And over months, he dropped off food at JFK8 so the fledgling group, known as the Amazon Labor Union (ALU), could share literature over break-room meals.
He even got arrested. Amazon said he was repeatedly trespassing despite warnings, while Smalls framed the affair as Amazon's attempt to intimidate workers. Police made their own call on how to respond, Amazon said.
The ALU showed it was time to toss the manual on how to organize, said John Logan, a labor professor at San Francisco State University. While the group had to withdraw and later re-file its petition for a vote to make sure it had signatures from 30% of staff, Smalls had the right instincts.
""They filed with just over 30%, no experienced organizers or lawyers, ran a campaign that many called chaotic and unprofessional, but they had great media and social media,"" Logan said. ""Almost everything they have done goes against 'conventional organizer' wisdom.""

Having finally won plaudits from organized labor, Smalls is now aiming to bring a union to a second Amazon warehouse in Staten Island, in a vote this month he said ""will be a breeze"" by comparison. He also has a harder goal for JFK8 in mind.
""We’re going to try to deliver a contract. That's the number one priority,"" he said. ""The real fight is the contract; that’s what we’re going to focus on next.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will end a sweeping, pandemic-related expulsion policy that has effectively closed down the U.S. asylum system at the border with Mexico, U.S. health officials said on Friday, arguing it was no longer needed to protect public health.
The Title 42 order will remain in effect until May 23 to allow border officials time to prepare for its termination and to ramp up COVID-19 vaccines for arriving migrants, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a 30-page order.
""After considering current public health conditions and an increased availability of tools to fight COVID-19 (such as highly effective vaccines and therapeutics), the CDC Director has determined that an Order suspending the right to introduce migrants into the United States is no longer necessary,"" the CDC said in a separate statement. 
The order was originally issued in March 2020 as countries around the world shuttered their borders amid COVID-19 fears and more than a million migrants and asylum seekers have been rapidly expelled under the policy since then.
The formal announcement comes after Reuters and other news outlets reported details of the plan on Wednesday.
U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, kept Title 42 in place after taking office in January 2021 despite fierce criticism from his own political party and campaign promises to reverse the restrictive immigration policies of his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump.
Leading Democrats, medical experts and the United Nations criticized Title 42, saying it expels migrants to dangerous places in Mexico, denies them their legal right to request asylum and that scientific evidence does not support its stated goal of limiting the spread of the virus.
Republicans have blasted Biden this week, saying lifting the pandemic restrictions would encourage more migrants to enter illegally at a time when border crossings are already breaking records.
Guatemala's government said on Friday that it expects the number of Guatemalans seeking to migrate to rise after the U.S. government ends its Title 42 expulsion policy.
U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials on a call with reporters on Friday said they are setting up additional temporary facilities at the border to handle more migrants and are coordinating efforts across various agencies.
DHS has also already redeployed more than 600 law enforcement officers to the border in anticipation of the changes. 
""Nonetheless, we know that smugglers will spread misinformation to take advantage of vulnerable migrants,"" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. ""Let me be clear: those unable to establish a legal basis to remain in the United States will be removed.""
'WE CAN'T RETURN'
The Biden administration rolled out a major regulation last week that aims to speed up asylum processing and deportations at the U.S.-Mexico border and which is set to take effect in late May, close to when Title 42 is set to end.
At the same time the administration could ""employ in much greater numbers"" another Trump-era policy known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), said a DHS official on the call. The program makes asylum seekers wait in Mexico for U.S. court hearings. The Biden administration tried to end MPP but was compelled by a U.S. judge to reinstate it.
Several migrants in a nearly 2,000-person encampment in Reynosa, Mexico, who have been waiting at the border for months, told Reuters on Thursday they were hopeful the order would be lifted so they could legally claim asylum in the United States. 

Hilda Gonzalez, 34, a migrant from Guatemala, has spent eight months at Reynosa camp with her eight-year-old daughter and ten-year-old son. 
""My plan is to stay here until we can seek asylum,"" said Gonzalez, who did not detail why she fled. ""It's better to stay here, sleeping on the ground, than going back home. If we're here, it's because we can't return.""

DMYTRIVKA, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukraine recaptured more territory around Kyiv from Russian soldiers who left shattered villages and their own abandoned tanks as they moved away from the capital, while a disputed cross-border strike in Russia complicated peace talks on Friday.
In the hamlet of Dmytrivka to the west of the capital, smoke was still rising from the wrecks of armored vehicles and the bodies of at least eight Russian soldiers lay in the streets, Reuters correspondents saw.
""From one side we were hearing the tanks shooting at us, and from the area of Bucha was a massive mortar shelling,"" said resident Leonid Vereshchagin, a business executive, referring to a town to the north.
Ukrainian forces went on to take back Bucha, its mayor said on Friday in a video that appeared to be filmed outside the town hall. The advances followed several days of Ukrainian gains around Kyiv and in the north.
In southwest Ukraine, anti-air defences thwarted an attempted attack on critical infrastructure in the Black Sea port of Odesa, the Ukrainian military said. Reuters could not immediately verify the account.
Odesa's governor, Maksym Marchenko, said three missiles had hit a residential district, causing casualties. He said the missiles were fired from an Iskander missile system in Crimea, the southern Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.
Russia denies targeting civilians. 
'CONSTANT EXPLOSIONS'
President Vladimir Putin sent troops on Feb. 24 for what he calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarise Ukraine. 
The West calls it an unprovoked war of aggression that has killed thousands, uprooted a quarter of Ukraine's population and brought Russian-U.S. relations to their worst point since the Cold War.
Aiming to lower nuclear tensions with Russia, the U.S. military has canceled an intercontinental ballistic missile test that it had initially aimed only to delay, the Air Force told Reuters.
In the Russian border city of Belgorod, a logistics hub for its war effort, Moscow said Ukrainian helicopters struck a fuel depot, causing a huge fire. Ukraine denied responsibility for the incident, the first of its kind in the five-week-old war. 
The fire destroyed several oil tanks and will likely add short-term strain to Russia's already stretched logistics chains, Britain's defence ministry said.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the incident could jeopardise Ukrainian-Russian peace talks, which resumed on Friday by video link. Russia will strengthen its western borders so it won't ""cross anyone's mind to attack,"" Peskov said later.
Hours after the blaze began at the oil depot, an eyewitness reached by telephone in Belgorod, who asked not to be identified, said aircraft were flying overhead and there were continuous explosions from the direction of the border.
""Something is happening. There are planes and constant explosions in the distance."" Security camera footage showed an explosion following what appeared to be the flash of a missile.
Ukraine's top security official said Russia's accusations were not correct. Ukraine's defence ministry earlier had declined to confirm or deny involvement. 
""Ukraine is currently conducting a defensive operation against Russian aggression on the territory of Ukraine, and this does not mean that Ukraine is responsible for every catastrophe on Russia's territory,"" said ministry spokesperson Oleksandr Motuzyanyk.
A Russian threat to cut off gas supplies to Europe unless buyers paid with roubles by Friday was averted for now, with Moscow saying it would not halt supplies until new payments are due later in April.
EVACUATION THWARTED
Russia says the southeastern region of Donbas, where it has backed separatists since 2014, is now the focus of its war efforts. The besieged and bombarded Azov Sea port city of Mariupol has been its main target there.
Conditions on Friday made it impossible to go ahead with a plan to evacuate civilians from Mariupol, where tens of thousands are trapped, the International Committee of the Red Cross said.
United Nations aid chief Martin Griffiths will travel to Moscow on Sunday and then to Kyiv as the U.N. pursues a humanitarian ceasefire in Ukraine, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters.
A total of 6,266 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Friday, said Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the Ukrainian president's office. 
After failing to capture a single major city, Russia has painted its draw-down of forces near Kyiv as a goodwill gesture in peace talks. The negotiations led to a prisoner exchange on Friday, Tymoshenko said, with the release of 86 Ukrainian troops. 
Tymoshenko did not say how many Russian soldiers were released. 
Ukraine and its allies say Russian forces have been forced to regroup after suffering heavy losses due to determined Ukrainian resistance. 
Regional governors in Kyiv and Chernihiv said Russians were pulling out of areas in both those provinces, some heading back across borders to Belarus and Russia.
In Irpin, a commuter suburb northwest of Kyiv that had been one of the main battlegrounds for weeks, now firmly back in Ukrainian hands, volunteers and emergency workers carried the dead on stretchers out of the rubble. 
Lilia Ristich was sitting on a metal playground swing with her young son Artur. Most people had fled; they had stayed.

She listed neighbours who had been killed - the man ""buried there, on the lawn""; the couple with their 12-year-old child, all burned alive.
""I pray for all this to end and for them never to come back,"" she said. ""When you hold a child in your arms it is an everlasting fear.""

(Reuters) -A jury will begin deliberations on Monday in the trial of four men charged with conspiring to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, as one of the most closely watched trials in recent memory involving allegations of domestic terrorism neared its conclusion.
The 12-person jury was presented with dueling narratives during closing arguments that concluded late on Friday afternoon. Granted the option by U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker, jurors chose to start discussing the case on Monday.
On Friday, jurors heard a government prosecutor describe the defendants as ""filled with rage"" and bent on sparking a civil war, followed by defense attorneys who accused the FBI of entrapping their clients, who they said were often high on drugs and prone to ""crazy"" talk rather than concrete action.
The case stands as one of the most high-profile prosecutions of alleged members of right-wing organizations that have risen in prominence in the years since former President Donald Trump's election in 2016. It also highlights the extent to which the pandemic and government efforts to control it have become a wedge issue in U.S. politics, pushing some people to extremes.
In his closing argument, Assistant U.S. Attorney Nils Kessler sought to portray the men as hatching a specific plan of attack over several months, which included collecting firearms and conducting reconnaissance on Whitmer's vacation home.
""They trained to kidnap the governor, they cased her house in the middle of the night, they mapped it out, they planned it, they gathered weapons and bombs,"" Kessler said in federal court in Grand Rapids, Michigan. ""That is the conspiracy that they are charged with and in America it's a crime.""
All four of the defendants - Adam Fox, Brandon Caserta, Barry Croft Jr. and Daniel Harris - have been charged with kidnapping conspiracy. Fox, Croft and Harris were also charged with conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction. If convicted the men could spend the rest of their lives in prison. 
The attorney for Fox, who prosecutors have accused of being the ringleader of the plot, argued that his client was lured into actions by FBI informants and was vulnerable to entrapment due to his heavy marijuana use. 
""Somebody rattles the keys, somebody beats the drum and gets 'em all worked up,"" said the attorney, Christopher Gibbons. ""That’s unacceptable in America. That’s not how it works. You don’t make terrorists so we can arrest them."" 
Two other men initially charged in the alleged plot struck plea deals. The pair, Ty Garbin and Kalen Franks, served as star witnesses for prosecutors, who sought to prove that the four defendants planned to break into Whitmer's vacation home in northern Michigan, hog-tie her and take her away at gunpoint for a ""trial"" on treason charges over her COVID-19 mandates.
Garbin is currently serving a six-year sentence, while Franks is awaiting sentencing.
The four on trial are among 13 men who were arrested in October 2020 and charged with state or federal crimes in the alleged kidnapping conspiracy. Seven of them are facing charges in state court.
DUELING NARRATIVES
The FBI said it had begun tracking the group's movements after seeing online discussions that included posts about the violent overthrow of some state governments. 
The group's goal was to end pandemic restrictions, as well as trigger a second American civil war as adherents to the ""boogaloo"" movement, Kessler said. 
Harris, Caserta and an undercover informant who testified at the trial were members of the Wolverine Watchmen, a militia group, prosecutors say. Croft and Fox were members of the ""Three Percenters,"" a similar far-right organization.
In charging documents the men are accused of discussing Whitmer's kidnapping and planning to meet in Wisconsin to train with assault rifles. The men were also alleged to have discussed buying supplies to be used in the kidnapping and putting Whitmer's vacation home under surveillance, prosecutors say.
Fox ordered $4,000 worth of explosives from an undercover FBI agent posing as a co-conspirator, according to the indictment. The document also accused Fox and Harris of making payments for the explosives.

Joshua Blanchard, Croft's lawyer, described his client as engaging in ""crazy"" and ""stoned"" talk at times, but denied that he was ever involved in a concrete plan to kidnap Whitmer.
""There was no plan, there was no agreement,"" Blanchard said, accusing FBI informants of attempting to lure his client into action. ""It's just smoke and mirrors.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military has canceled a test of its Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile that it had initially aimed only to delay in a bid to lower nuclear tensions with Russia during the war in Ukraine, the Air Force told Reuters on Friday.
The Pentagon first announced a delay of the test on March 2 after Russia said it was putting its nuclear forces on high alert. Washington said at the time it was important both the United States and Russia ""bear in mind the risk of miscalculation and take steps to reduce those risks.""
But it had publicly stated its intent only to delay the test ""a little bit,"" and not cancel it.
Air Force spokesperson Ann Stefanek said the decision to cancel the test of the LGM-30G Minuteman III missile was due to the same reasons as when it had been first delayed. The next Minuteman III test is scheduled to take place later this year.
""The Air Force is confident in the readiness of the strategic forces of the United States,"" Stefanek said.
Altering the test schedule for America's ICBM force can be controversial. U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, expressed disappointment in March at the delay of a test he said was critical to ensure America's nuclear deterrent remains effective.
Jeffrey Lewis, a missile researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS), played down the impact of the cancelation.
""There's a value to doing the tests but I don't think missing one test in the grand scheme of things is a really big deal,"" said Lewis, adding the Minuteman III was extremely reliable. 
The nuclear-capable Minuteman III is key part of the U.S. military's strategic arsenal and has a range of 6,000-plus miles (9,660-plus km) and can travel at a speed of approximately 15,000 miles per hour (24,000 kph). 
Missiles are dispersed in hardened underground silos operated by launch crews.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said in February that his nation's nuclear forces should be put on high alert, raising fears that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could lead to nuclear war. But U.S. officials have said they have seen no reason so far to change Washington's nuclear alert levels.

Russia and the United States have by far the biggest arsenals of nuclear warheads after the Cold War that divided the world for much of the 20th century, pitting the West against the Soviet Union and its allies.
Russia announced earlier on Friday it would military strengthen its western borders with Europe.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The U.S. government should take stronger action to fight discrimination and sexual harassment in temporary work programs for migrants, an advocacy group for Mexican women who complain of such abuse said on Thursday.
Although the U.S. and Mexican governments have held meetings to address a petition filed on the matter last year, the efforts did not go far enough, said the Center for Migrant Rights. 
""A year has passed with lots of talk but little action,"" executive director Rachel Micah-Jones told reporters at the unveiling of a report sent to Mexican authorities.
Thursday's report describes certain agricultural jobs that appear to exclude women and highlights accusations of sexual harassment they face at work.
""Throughout my 13 years working in this industry, I have seen many situations where women suffer,"" said one of the women, Daria Hernandez.
In her work at a Maryland crab processing plant, she added, she often saw a male supervisor touch and harass women before threatening to report them or send them to Mexico if they complained.
Last year's petition urged Mexico to pursue remedies with U.S. authorities under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which has stricter labor provisions than the trade pact it replaced in 2020.
The U.S. Department of Labor and Mexico's Labor Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
U.S. and Mexican authorities have previously vowed to protect the rights of migrant workers.
Mexico's government could request further investigation by a dispute resolution panel set up under the USMCA, Micah-Jones added.
One of those who signed last year's petition was Adareli Ponce, who has worked at U.S. chocolate and crawfish businesses under a temporary program.

She said she had never heard back about a farming job she applied for last year, although she later saw men hired for the same position and similar work.
""I have not seen a single woman afforded the same opportunity,"" she said in the center's latest report, adding that many farm job ads call exclusively for men.

Saifullah Rauf, the U.S. citizen and U.S. Navy reservist, and Anees Khalil, a U.S. green card-holder, were ""unjustly detained"" and are in Qatar awaiting travel to the United States, State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement.
Their release came against a backdrop of icy U.S.-Taliban relations, fueled by a ban on Afghan girls returning to public secondary schools, nearly eight months after the Islamists seized Kabul as the last U.S. troops departed following 20 years of war.
""We are grateful for the efforts of all those who worked to secure"" the release of Rauf and Khalil ""but more work remains. Unjustly holding Americans captive is always unacceptable,"" Price said. ""We will not stop until every American who is being unjustly held against their will is able to hug their families once again.""
The pair's detention was kept extremely quiet. The most prominent American known to be in Taliban custody is Mark Frerichs who was abducted in January 2020.
A statement posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) by Human First Coalition, a U.S. private group involved in evacuating at-risk Afghans, identified Rauf as its president.
In the statement, Rauf said he and his brother ""were engaged in humanitarian work in Afghanistan when we were taken into Taliban custody"" on Dec. 18.
They were held for 105 days, he said.
""Our understanding is that this exceptionally unfortunate situation arose due to a misunderstanding; we did nothing wrong,"" he continued without elaborating.
Rauf thanked those involved in helping to free the pair, including U.S. officials, their family, Qatar, the British government and his organization.
The U.S. Navy said that Rauf is a reserve hospital corpsman who enlisted in March 2017 and whose last posting was in April 2021 at the medical facility at Joint Base Andrews, outside Washington.

DMYTRIVKA, Ukraine (Reuters) - Wisps of smoke still rising from the smouldering wrecks of tanks, business executive Leonid Vereshchagin wends his way past the charred corpses of Russian troops in this Ukrainian hamlet after what he calls a living hell.
    For a month, he and his wife sought refuge in a friend’s basement in Dmytrivka, about 22 miles (35 km) west of Kyiv, as Russian troops advanced and occupied the area and took over the homes of some of his neighbours.
Most of the 300 residents left, but around a third remained, co-existing with the Russians as their tanks patrolled day and night.
""They went to our houses. Those houses that were closed, they opened them, they just broke the windows and they tried to open the doors,"" he said, returning to his village on Friday. ""We were with them when they were visiting houses, they were trying to open cupboards.""
    ""I have a very brave wife, she was watching them, making clear that they should not take anything,"" he added, sitting in the same basement he had hunkered down in. Several mattresses lay on the floor, and to the side, shelves with provisions.
   Three days ago, while the Russians were patrolling the area, Ukrainian troops arrived. When the Russians returned, unaware, there was a fierce battle. Vereshchagin and his wife escaped in a car through the woods during a brief break in the fighting.
    Some houses in the smart residential area were completely destroyed. In the garden of one cowered a doe, badly injured from shelling, raw flesh exposed where patches of fur had burned.
    ""The Hell started in the evening on the (March) 29th,"" Vereshchagin said. ""From one side we were hearing the tanks shooting at us, and from the area of Bucha was a massive mortar shelling,"" he added, referring to a town to the north.
    ""It’s something like you having a casque (helmet) and someone is hitting by hammer from above.""
The pungent smell of dank vegetation sits heavy in the air. A mist envelops the rural area, a patchwork of fields and forest land.
Reuters correspondents saw the remains of eight Russian soldiers next to destroyed tanks on the road running through the hamlet. 
    One had been decapitated by a blast. His naked body lay nearby, his feet blown off and a blackened arm still extended upward as if frozen in time.
    ""You see that enemy overestimates its potential around Kyiv at least. And we keep going forward liberating our cities and evacuating our people,"" said Deputy Interior Minister Yevhen Yenin. ""The first task is to restore public order to provide supplies of water, food, electricity, communication,"" he added.
   To the north, near the Belarus border, lies the nuclear disaster site Chernobyl.
""According to our reconnaissance, Russians have left Chernobyl but we should be aware of any unpleasant surprise that could be hidden there,"" Yenin said.
    Vereshchagin dismisses Russian President Vladimir Putin's rationale for the invasion – clearing neo-Nazis and protecting Russians in Ukraine. While born in Ukraine, his mother tongue is Russian.

    ""I’ve never ever experienced any problems in Ukraine being a Russian-speaking Ukrainian,"" he said.
    ""Definitely neither I nor any of my Russian speaking friends were waiting for any salvation army, which was completely fake and paranoia.""

346,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 01:46PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Washington state has become the first in the United States to pass a law that creates an alert system for missing indigenous people. 
Governor Jay Inslee, a Democrat, on Thursday signed the bill, which calls on the Washington State Patrol to create the alert system. 
That system will include a hotline the public can call to report a missing indigenous person. That information would quickly be sent to law enforcement agencies throughout the state, along with the public via social media, news outlets and electronic signs along highways, similar to the national Amber alert system for abducted children. 
State studies show Native people, especially women and girls, represent a disproportionately large number of missing and murdered cases relative to the size of their population, but receive scant attention from law enforcement or media. Native American activists say this disparity is the result of deep-rooted racism. 
Researchers have found there is a national data crisis when it comes to cases involving missing and murdered indigenous people, with law enforcement agencies across the country having little information about the cases. 

Washington state representative Debra Lekanoff, a Democrat and Native American, said during the bill signing ceremony that the alert system will allow the public to hear ""the unheard screams"" of indigenous women who go missing. 
""I'm proud to say that the missing and murdered indigenous women's and peoples' alert system came from the voices of our Native American leaders,"" she said. ""Missing and murdered indigenous women and people is not just an Indian issue, it's not just an Indian responsibility.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Friday passed a bill to end the federal ban on marijuana, which has created legal headaches for users and businesses in the states that have legalized it, though the measure was seen as unlikely to pass the Senate.
It passed by 220-204, with few Republicans supporting the measure.
The Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act, sponsored by Democratic Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, which is in the process of legalizing the drug, removes marijuana from the list of controlled substances and eliminates criminal penalties for individuals who grow, distribute or possess it.
But the MORE act will need to gain 60 votes in the evenly divided Senate before moving to President Joe Biden's desk for his signature, an outcome widely seen as unlikely given the lack of Republican support for the measure.
The bill would ""end decades of failed and unjust marijuana policy,"" Democratic Representative Ed Perlmutter said on the House floor on Thursday ahead of the vote. ""It is clear prohibition is over. Today we have an opportunity to chart a new path forward on federal cannabis policy that actually makes sense.""
He added that the bill does not force any state to legalize marijuana.
Marijuana users and businesses that sell it face a complicated legal patchwork in the U.S, where 37 states have legalized it in some form -- either for recreation or medical use -- while 13 still ban it entirely.
Because federal law classifies cannabis as an illegal drug with no medical uses, researchers are severely limited in how they can study the drug and its impacts, making policy difficult to write.
Cannabis businesses are also largely blocked from the U.S. banking system because of the federal ban.
Republican Representative Michelle Fischbach called the legislation ""not only flawed but dangerous,"" arguing on the House floor that it did not protect minors and would encourage people to open marijuana businesses.

Legalization of marijuana is extremely popular among Americans: a 2021 Pew Research Center poll found that 91% agreed that either medical or recreational use should be allowed.
Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has proposed his own bill that would legalize marijuana, and has committed to moving forward with it in April.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on five entities it accused of providing support to North Korea's development of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs, increasing pressure on Pyongyang following a recent series of missile launches.
The Treasury Department in a statement said the action targets the Ministry of Rocket Industry, which it said is a North Korean weapons of mass destruction research and development organization directly linked to the development of new intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). 
It also designated four of the organization's subsidiaries - Hapjanggang Trading Corporation, Korea Rounsan Trading Corporation, Sungnisan Trading Corporation, and Unchon Trading Corporation.
North Korea’s mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new sanctions.
Friday's move follows a rise in tensions with North Korea after two ballistic missile tests on Feb. 26 and March 4 that involved a new ICBM system that North Korea is developing, and last week's first full ICBM test conducted by North Korea since 2017.
“The DPRK’s (Democratic People's Republic of Korea's) provocative ballistic missile tests represent a clear threat to regional and global security and are in blatant violation of UN Security Council resolutions,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in the statement. 
“The United States is committed to using our sanctions authorities to respond to the DPRK’s continued development of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles,"" she said.
Washington's move on Friday follows measures imposed by Japan, which froze the assets of six North Koreans for involvement in North Korea's weapons projects.

South Korean officials have reported new construction at the North's only known nuclear test site, which was shuttered in 2018.
There are increasing signs that North Korea could soon test a nuclear weapon for the first time since 2017 in a bid to improve its arsenal and increase political pressure, U.S. and South Korean officials and analysts said.

349,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 07:59AM ET</span>","ISTANBUL (Reuters) -Turkey's justice minister said on Friday his ministry would approve a request to transfer a trial over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi to Saudi Arabia, as Ankara seeks to mend ties with Riyadh.
Khashoggi's fiancee Hatice Cengiz and rights groups condemned the move, saying Saudi Arabia could not be expected to hold a fair trial.
Khashoggi's killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul four years ago grabbed headlines worldwide and strained ties between the two regional powers, leading to an unofficial Saudi boycott of Turkish goods that has cut Ankara's exports to Riyadh by 90%.
A Turkish prosecutor called on Thursday for the Istanbul trial in absentia of 26 Saudi suspects to be halted and transferred to Saudi authorities, who requested the transfer in a response to a letter from the Turkish court.
The court requested the Justice Ministry's opinion on the issue and is expected to rule on the request at its next hearing, set for April 7.
Amnesty International secretary general Agnes Callamard, who carried out a U.N.-led investigation that found Saudi officials ""planned and perpetrated"" the killing, described the prosecutor's request as ""spineless"".
The prosecutor said the defendants were foreign citizens, the arrest warrants could not be executed and their statements could not be taken, leaving the case in abeyance or suspension.
""As the ministry, we will send a positive opinion there (today) regarding the transfer of the case,"" Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said on Friday, adding that Riyadh had requested the transfer.
In a meeting with reporters, Bozdag said that if Saudi authorities convict the defendants, the Turkish court will drop the case, and that if they are acquitted in the kingdom, the Turkish court may resume the trial.
In 2020, Saudi Arabia jailed eight people for between seven and 20 years for Khashoggi's murder. None of the defendants were named, in what rights groups described as a sham trial.
A U.S. intelligence report released a year ago said Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had approved the operation to kill or capture Khashoggi. The Saudi government denied his involvement and rejected the report's findings.
Turkish officials said they believe Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the crown prince, was killed and his body dismembered in an operation President Tayyip Erdogan said had been ordered at the ""highest levels"" of the Saudi government.

But Erdogan now seeks better ties with states which had become bitter rivals in recent years, including Egypt, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.
Israeli and UAE leaders visited Ankara in recent months, but progress with Cairo and Riyadh has been slower. Erdogan said last month he hoped to take ""concrete steps"" with Riyadh soon.

""She is a historic figure who vigorously advocated for women’s rights and gender equality,"" Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro said in a statement on Thursday. 
""She is instrumental to why we now have women of all backgrounds, experiences and talents serving within our ranks, side by side with their male Sailor and Marine counterparts."" 
Del Toro cited Ginsburg's work issuing the majority opinion for United States v. Virginia, a landmark 1996 case that struck down Virginia Military Institute’s male-only admissions policy.

Ginsburg became a heroine to the American left after overcoming entrenched sexism in the legal profession to ascend to the U.S. Supreme Court, where she championed gender equality and other liberal causes during 27 years on the bench. She died on Sept. 18, 2020, at age 87 of complications from pancreatic cancer.
The future USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg (T-AO 212) will be a John Lewis-class replenishment oiler (T-AO) ship, a class of vessel named after late civil rights leader and U.S. Representative John Lewis. The oilers transfer fuel to the Navy's operating carrier strike groups and can hold 162,000 barrels of oil.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Police in Sri Lanka's capital lifted a curfew on Friday after protests in which dozens of people were arrested and injured near the home of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa over his handling of an economic crisis.
Hundreds of protesters gathered near Rajapaksa's residence in a Colombo suburb late on Thursday before police moved in to disperse them with tear gas and water cannons.
Rajapaksa's media division said in a statement a small group of people carrying iron bars, clubs and sticks had provoked the protesters, the majority of whom were unarmed. 
""We respect the people’s right to protest and that will be protected but they cannot harm any public property,” said police spokesman Ajith Rohana. 
""The 53 people arrested will be presented to court.”
The island nation of 22 million people is in the midst of its worst economic crisis in years with rolling blackouts for up to 13 hours a day because the government does not have enough foreign exchange to pay for fuel imports.
Protesters torched several police and army vehicles during the disturbance, including two buses, a jeep and several motorcycles, Rohana said.
A total of 24 police were injured, nine of whom remained in hospital, Rohana said.
Police did not confirm the number of protesters injured. Sources at two hospitals in Colombo said 20 to 25 people had been admitted, some of whom remained.
Streets in the capital were quiet on Friday morning as police combed through the wreckage of two burnt-out buses near Rajapaksa's home, a Reuters witness said. 
Tourism minister Prasanna Ranatunge said such protests would harm economic prospects.
""The main issue Sri Lanka is facing is a forex shortage and protests of this nature will hurt tourism and have economic consequences,"" Ranatunge told a news conference.
""Our stance is that people have the right to protest but it should be constructive. What happened yesterday was the opposite.""
The U.N. representative in the country, Hanaa Singer-Hamdy, called for restraint from all groups involved in the clashes.

""We are monitoring developments and are concerned by reports of violence,"" she said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Trading on the country's stock market was suspended for a third day in a row after the main blue-chip index fell 10% from the previous close.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Amid a regional backlash, the Solomon Islands said it would not allow a Chinese military base in the Pacific islands nation despite its plans to sign a security pact with Beijing.
A day after officials from the two countries initialled a draft agreement on security, the office of Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said on Friday the agreement does not invite China to establish a military base.
""Government is conscious of the security ramification of hosting a military base, and it will not be careless to allow such initiative to take place under its watch,"" a statement said.
Sogavare has not released details of the security agreement with China, amid concern sparked by a leaked draft that allowed Chinese navy ships to replenish in the islands. Ministers have not yet signed it.
When asked about the most recent comments from the Solomon Islands, China's foreign ministry said the ""starting point"" of the security agreement is to safeguard people's safety and property security.
""It does not have any military overtones,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters at a daily briefing on Friday.
""The relevant remarks and speculation in the media are groundless.""
Four people were killed during violent anti-government protests and much of the Chinatown neighborhood of Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands, was destroyed during violent anti-government protests in November.
The leader of the Federated States of Micronesia on Thursday urged the Solomon Islands not to sign the security pact, saying he had ""grave security concerns"" and feared the Pacific could become embroiled in war between China and the United States.
New Zealand has also warned against the pact, which it says could upset long-standing regional security cooperation. Australia's Defence Minister Peter Dutton on Friday said he respected Sogavare's perspective but urged caution. 
China had established 20 points of military presence in the South China Sea despite telling the United States it would not militarize the region, and Canberra feared Beijing was on a similar pathway in the Pacific islands, Dutton said in an interview with Sky News.
""They want a military port in PNG [Papua New Guinea]. They've got one in Sri Lanka, and they're looking obviously at other places where they can put them,"" he said.
China offered to redevelop a naval base in Papua New Guinea in 2018 but Australia's closest northern neighbour decided to have Australia to develop the base instead. 
A Chinese state company runs the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota under a 99-year lease, although Sri Lanka has previously said the port cannot be used for Chinese military purposes.
A Chinese military base in the Solomon Islands would prompt Australia to significantly increase its military deployment to the region because the islands are very close to Australia, Dutton said.

Australia's foreign minister Marise Payne said the security agreement between Solomon Islands and China would undermine stability in the region.
""We don't believe that there is a need for countries outside the Pacific family to have a security role,"" she said on local radio on Friday.

SEOUL (Reuters) - There are increasing signs that North Korea could soon test a nuclear weapon for the first time since 2017 in a bid to improve its arsenal and increase political pressure, U.S. and South Korean officials and analysts said.
Two U.S. officials told Reuters that there were indications, including activity near the Punggye-ri nuclear site, that Pyongyang may be preparing for some sort of test, though an exact timing was unclear.
A South Korean military official confirmed that they were tracking activity to restore one of the tunnels used for nuclear tests.
Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) declined this week to comment, but said Washington is concerned about the possibility of new tests because they would be an opportunity for North Korea to enhance its arsenal. 
""Every time you test you learn.... We know that this is a programme that they want to improve,"" he told a briefing on Tuesday. ""And so of course, we're concerned about efforts to do that.""
Analysts say that more testing could help North Korea reach its stated goals of making smaller nuclear warheads and improving their reliability.
A resumption of nuclear tests could send political shockwaves through the region. China and Russia had joined the United States and other United Nations Security Council members in sanctioning Pyongyang over its previous tests, but in the wake of last week's intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) flight, both Beijing and Moscow signalled opposition to any new measures and said sanctions should be eased.
Liu Xiaoming, China's envoy for Korean affairs, has called on all sides to show restraint, but said the root cause of tensions is Washington's failure to address North Korea's legitimate security concerns and to reciprocate steps Pyongyang had taken since 2018.
On Thursday State Department spokesman Ned Price said Washington remains open to talks, but that continued provocations by North Korea would incur additional responses from the international community.
A NUCLEAR SITE REBORN
North Korea has conducted all six of its nuclear tests in deep tunnels dug under the mountains at Punngye-ri. In 2018 it used explosives to close old entrances in front of invited foreign media but not international experts, raising questions about the extent of the demolition.
That year Pyongyang declared a voluntary moratorium on testing nuclear weapons and its ICBMs. Since then, it has said it is not bound to that because of a lack of reciprocal moves by the United States and its allies. Last month, it test-fired ICBMs for the first time since 2017.
Commercial satellite imagery from Thursday shows probable new excavation at the site's South Portal, just east of a former tunnel entrance that was destroyed as part of site dismantlement efforts in 2018, 38 North, a U.S.-based programme that monitors North Korea, said in a report.
Although some South Korean media reports suggested that workers were building ""shortcuts"" to connect with the test tunnels as quickly as possible, it seems more likely they were trying to excavate into a stable point rather than digging through the fractured rock around the former entrance, 38 North said.
The organisation noted that some technical buildings such as the site's command and control centre were not destroyed in 2018.
Since December, satellite imagery has showed activity at the main administrative area, the Vienna-based Open Nuclear Network (ONN) said in a report this week.

Notably, the South Portal tunnel that North Korea appears be reactivating was not previously used for testing, the ONN report said. Piles of what might be logs, often used to shore up such tunnels, have also been spotted, it added.
A separate 38 North report said satellite imagery shows increased activity around North Korea’s Sohae Satellite Launching Station, after leader Kim Jong Un ordered its expansion as part of a programme to launch spy satellites to monitor military moves by the United States and its allies.

354,"<span>Apr 01, 2022 02:56AM ET</span>","SHANGHAI (Reuters) -China's commercial hub of Shanghai ground to halt on Friday after the government locked down most of the city's 26 million residents to stop the spread of COVID-19, even as official numbers put local cases falling for the second day in a row. 
The city government late on Thursday extended an existing lockdown in eastern districts, just as western parts of the city were shut down as scheduled.
Fresh official guidance indicated that many in China's most populous city will now be required to stay home as long as it takes to control the outbreak - instructed not to cross their doorsteps even to dispose of rubbish or walk their dogs.
Public transport in most of the city has been suspended, while businesses considered non-essential, like restaurants and shopping malls, have also had to close. 
The lockdown, designed to stop an outbreak of the highly transmissible Omicron variant that started about a month ago, began on Monday and was originally due to last 10 days in total. Areas east of Shanghai's Huangpu River were to be closed for five days, before reopening as western districts began a five-day shutdown.
But the city government said it would lift the curbs in east Shanghai in stages instead.
This means the majority of districts are now under a lockdown that covers the office towers of the Lujiazui district, China's answer to Wall Street, and factories including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s joint venture with SAIC Motor and U.S. automaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s plant.
China's outbreak is small by global standards. But Shanghai, now accounting for three out of every four local asymptomatic cases across the country, has emerged as a test bed for the national government's handling of COVID - a ""dynamic clearance"" approach which aims to test for, trace and centrally quarantine all positive case. 
Authorities said on Friday the city's daily tally of infections eased for the second day in the row: it reported 4,144 locally transmitted new asymptomatic cases and 358 symptomatic cases for Thursday, versus corresponding figures of 5,298 and 355 the previous day.
Some residents however, have expressed scepticism about the daily tally, questioning how quickly positive cases are registered in the system. Shanghai publishes a daily list of addresses of where cases have been found, and some said their housing compounds were only included days after neighbours had tested positive - or not included at all.
Shanghai city authorities didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the scepticism over case numbers.
CONTAGION RISKS
While in lockdown, residents will be required to undergo rounds of nucleic acid testing carried out by healthcare workers in hazmat suits. They're only authorised to leave their apartments for the tests, to be carried out in or near their housing compounds, and authorities have asked residents to line up for testing two metres apart.
Ning Guang, president of Ruijin Hospital, told an online news conference on Friday that residents should be aware of contagion risks.
""If you have to take the elevator ... it would be best if you could take it alone. But if you can't it would be best if everyone inside can face the wall in order to lower the risk of contagion,"" he said.
He also urged residents to practice good hygiene to stay healthy while in lockdown, such as by brushing their teeth more than three times a day if possible. 
Meanwhile, the Shanghai New International Expo Center, which typically hosts trade shows like the Shanghai Autoshow, has been converted into the city's largest central quarantine centre with more than 15,000 beds, Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday. 
On Friday, the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai said a survey it conducted with 167 of its member companies found that 54% of respondents have reduced their annual revenue projections due to the outbreak.
Eric Zheng, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, said that the such arrangements were acceptable for a few days but ""not sustainable"" long term.
""Even if your employees are within the factory bubble, your trucks have to come and go sending inputs and outputs, but that's not possible,"" he said. ""I hope this is only a temporary, drastic measure to stop the spread.""

Shanghai has said that it will keep its airports open but many flights have been cancelled.
On Friday, only one flight was available at the domestic-focused Shanghai Hongqiao Airport, which took off from Shanghai at around 11 a.m. to the capital city of Beijing, according to aviation data provider Variflight.

(Reuters) -A New York state judge on Thursday threw out the state's new Democratic-backed congressional map as unconstitutional and ordered lawmakers to redraw the lines, a decision that could significantly hurt the party's chances of retaining control of the U.S. Congress in November's elections.
Steuben County Supreme Court Judge Patrick McAllister said the map violated a constitutional provision that districts should not be drawn to favor one political party over another.
The map, passed by the Democratic-controlled legislature and signed into law by Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul in February, gave the party the advantage in 22 of the state's 26 districts, according to analysts. Democrats currently hold 19 of 27 districts and the state will lose one seat this year due to sluggish population growth.
The plan helped offset Republican-skewed maps in states such as Texas and Georgia and went a long way toward erasing what had initially been expected to be a challenging national redistricting cycle for Democrats.
Democratic leaders, including Hochul and state Attorney General Letitia James, said they would appeal the decision.
""This is one step in the process,"" said Mike Murphy, a spokesperson for the Democratic Senate majority. ""We always knew this case would be decided by the appellate courts.""
In an 18-page decision, McAllister, a Republican, set April 11 as a deadline for a new map and said he would engage an expert to draw one if the legislature failed to come to a bipartisan compromise.
New York's primary election is scheduled for June 28, and McAllister acknowledged that an expert-drawn map might not be finished in time for this year's elections.
Under U.S. law, states must redraw congressional and legislative lines every decade to account for population changes. In most states, lawmakers control the process, allowing parties to manipulate lines for partisan advantage in a practice known as gerrymandering.
Thursday's decision is the second redistricting setback for Democrats in the span of a week. A Maryland court last Friday tossed a new Democratic-drawn map as an illegal gerrymander.
Judges in Ohio, North Carolina and Pennsylvania previously struck down Republican-favored maps.

Democrats currently hold a 222-210 edge in the U.S. House of Representatives, with three vacancies. Opinion polls suggest Republicans are favored to retake the House majority in November, which would allow them to block much of Democratic President Joe Biden's agenda.
In a conference call with reporters, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, the co-chair of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, which supports Republican redistricting efforts, said New York Democrats should be ""ashamed of themselves for what they tried to do here.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russia's invasion of Ukraine has made John Sullivan's tough job as U.S. envoy to Moscow even harder as he grapples with the Kremlin's nuclear saber-rattling and threats to sever relations while keeping his embassy running on one-tenth the normal staff.
""It was really bad two and a half years ago,"" Sullivan remembered of his arrival in Jan. 2020. ""It's gotten worse.""
Severe staff cuts imposed by Russia's government have not yet forced him to clean embassy toilets or buff floors, as rumored in Washington, though he said he knows how to do both. 
The loquacious grandson of Irish immigrants expounded this week in an interview about being Washington's man in Moscow five weeks into a war in which U.S.-supplied arms are killing his host nation's troops and sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies are devastating Russia's economy.
Until now, he said, his meetings with Russian foreign ministry officials have ""not been personally insulting or hostile,"" nor has there been a serious backlash against the embassy.
""The security situation here isn't that much different from what it was a month ago, six months ago,"" he said via video call from a spartan office overlooking an embassy courtyard dusted with fresh snow. ""But that could change at the discretion of the host government in a minute.""
Sullivan is dealing with circumstances that no previous U.S. ambassador to Russia faced, said John Herbst, a former U.S. envoy to Ukraine with the Atlantic Council think tank. ""We are truly in a period of hostile relations with Moscow.""
U.S.-Russian ties already were at their post-Cold War iciest when former U.S. President Donald Trump tapped Sullivan for one of the most difficult jobs in U.S. diplomacy, one previously held by luminaries such as John Quincy Adams and George Kennan.
The rivals were engaged in tit-for-tat expulsions and a diplomatic visa feud, with Moscow ordering the closure of the U.S. consulate in St. Petersburg in March 2018. The consulates in Vladivostok and Yekaterinburg were shut after he arrived, leaving the embassy as the only operating U.S. mission in Russia.
But its staff has shrunk from some 1,200 in 2017 to around 130, about half of them Marines and other security guards.
The sides also were at odds over issues ranging from Syria's civil war and the Kremlin's seizure of Crimea and backing of separatists in Ukraine's east to U.S. sanctions slapped on Russia for trying to sway the 2016 presidential vote to Trump.
As relations deteriorated, Trump's Democratic successor, Joe Biden, decided to retain Sullivan, an establishment Republican lawyer who does not speak Russian but whose affection for Russia dates to his childhood admiration of the Soviet hockey team.
In April 2021, Washington recalled Sullivan for consultations after Russia's envoy was summoned to Moscow.
Implementing a decree by President Vladimir Putin, the Russian government in May 2021 ordered the embassy to fire scores of Russian employees who performed critical tasks. That forced a halt to the processing of all but ""life or death"" visas.
Hopes that tensions would ease rose when Sullivan and Russia's ambassador to Washington returned to their posts in June and Biden and Putin met in Geneva the same month.
But relations worsened. Russia massed troops on Ukraine's borders, demanded sweeping security guarantees rejected by Washington and its NATO allies, and on Feb. 24 invaded its neighbor.
""We're in the Mariana Trench as far as diplomatic relations go,"" Sullivan said, referring to Earth's deepest ocean abyss.
Russia says it is waging a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. The war has killed thousands and uprooted millions.
Sullivan's challenges span the ominous to the routine.
Days after he unleashed his invasion, Putin put his nuclear forces on high alert, citing aggressive statements by NATO leaders and economic sanctions against Moscow.
U.S. officials say they are concerned about veiled threats of nuclear war that they continue to hear from Russian officials, including comparisons to the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.
Sullivan said he takes seriously a threat ""from the very top of the Russian government"" to sever diplomatic ties, asserting that ""The Russians don't engage in rhetorical flourishes.""
""The United States does not want to close its embassy here. President Biden does not want to recall me as ambassador. But that's not something that we necessarily control,"" he said.
'CROWBAR TO PRY ME OUT'
Russia expelled Sullivan's deputy in February and recently said another 37 U.S. staffers must leave by July. That would leave the embassy in ""caretaker status,"" secured by a skeleton contingent, one U.S. official said on condition of anonymity.
The embassy already has lost its elevator technician, meaning diplomats may soon be doing a lot of stairs, and keeping the sprinkler systems operating will become a serious safety issue if the last two electricians have to leave, the U.S. official said.
An increase in overnight calls with Washington as tensions mounted over Russia's military build up prompted Sullivan in February to move out of Spaso House, the elegant ambassadorial residence, a 15-minute drive from the chancery and its secure communications facility.
He moved into the more modest Townhouse One, where his deputy lived before being expelled, which is a quick walk to the chancery, the U.S. official said.
If diplomatic ties were severed, requiring the embassy to close, Sullivan said he could no longer pursue one of his most pressing tasks: advocating for detained Americans.
They include basketball star Brittney Griner and former Marines Trevor Reed, who is staging a second hunger strike, and Paul Whelan, as well as an unknown number of others.
""I've told my colleagues back home, they're going to have to use a crowbar to pry me out of here because I'm not leaving until, you know, until they either throw me out or the president just says, 'Look, you gotta come home.'

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans will be allowed to choose an X for gender on their passport applications and select their sex on Social Security cards, the Biden administration said on Thursday in announcing measures to support transgender Americans against wave of state laws targeting them.
The State Department in June said U.S. citizens could select their gender on applications without having to submit medical documentation. In October, it issued the first American passport with an ""X"" gender marker, designed to give nonbinary, intersex and gender-nonconforming people an option other than male or female on their travel document.
""Starting on April 11, U.S. citizens will be able to select an X as their gender marker on their U.S. passport application, and the option will become available for other forms of documentation next year,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.
Americans will also be able to select and add their gender to U.S. Social Security cards without medical documentation, beginning in the fall, the Social Security Administration said. The cards currently do not include gender indicators.
The changes were among several measures announced by the Biden administration to mark a ""Transgender Day of Visibility,"" a day after the Republican governors of Oklahoma and Arizona signed bills banning transgender athletes from girls' sports in schools.
They joined a growing list of states that have passed or enacted similar laws on a contentious election-year issue. Transgender rights have been pushed to the forefront of the culture wars playing out in parts of the United States in recent years, together with issues such as reproductive rights.
""The administration once again condemns the proliferation of dangerous anti-transgender legislative attacks that have been introduced and passed in state legislatures around the country,"" the White House said in a statement on initiatives it would take aimed at taking down barriers for transgender people.
They include easing travel, providing resources for transgender children and their families, improving access to federal services and benefits and advancing inclusion and visibility in federal data.
The Transportation Security Administration will implement gender-neutral screening at its checkpoints with changes in imaging technology, reducing the number of pat-down screenings, removing gender identification from checkpoint screenings and updating TSA PreCheck to include an ""X"" gender marker on its application. 
The Department of Health and Human Services released a new website that offers resources for transgender and LGBTQI+ youth, their parents, and providers.

Other agencies will announce new actions to expand the collection and use of sexual orientation and gender identity data, the White House said. 
""Every American deserves the freedom to be themselves. But far too many transgender Americans still face systemic barriers, discrimination, and acts of violence,"" the White House said.

    The United States and Britain released strongly-worded reports on Thursday detailing concerns about an erosion of freedoms in the global financial hub and the stifling of dissent in the city's legislature, civil society and media.
    The reports come after two senior British judges resigned from Hong Kong's highest court on Wednesday because of the national security law which punishes offences such as subversion with up to life imprisonment. 
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam called the resignations ""politically motivated"", while China blamed it on ""British pressure"".
    ""We strongly oppose the unfounded and ridiculous allegations against the Hong Kong special administrative region's government made by foreign countries through various reports,"" Hong Kong's government said in a statement.
    ""The government urges foreign countries to stop interfering into the internal affairs of China through Hong Kong affairs.""
    The UK report said it was no longer tenable for serving UK judges to sit on Hong Kong's top court, citing that the city's political and legal situation ""has now deteriorated beyond the point where it is acceptable for serving UK judges to take part"".
    British judges have long served among the foreign jurists appointed to the CFA, an arrangement put in place prior to Hong Kong's handover to China in 1997 to maintain confidence in a separate legal system widely seen as the bedrock of the city's social and commercial freedoms.
    Ten other foreign judges are still serving the Hong Kong court, six of whom are retired British jurists, one Canadian and three Australians.
    Business people and diplomats are watching particularly closely, given the importance of legal independence to Hong Kong's status as a global financial hub.
    The differences between Hong Kong and cities in mainland China are ""shrinking due to ongoing repression from the People's Republic of China,"" Antony Blinken, U.S. secretary of state, said in the report.
    Hong Kong's government said it was proud of its ""unwavering commitment"" to the rule of law and an independent judiciary. 

    It said it was firmly committed to safeguarding press and speech freedoms, with the media able to monitor the government's work and criticise policies as long as it was not ""in violation of the law.""

TROSTYANETS/LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin threatened on Thursday to halt contracts supplying Europe with a third of its gas unless they are paid in Russian currency, his strongest economic riposte so far to crushing Western sanctions over his invasion of Ukraine.
European governments rejected Putin's ultimatum for Friday, with the continent's biggest recipient of Russian gas, Germany, calling it ""blackmail"". Moscow did, however, offer a mechanism for buyers to obtain roubles via a Russian bank.
The energy showdown has huge ramifications for Europe as U.S. officials circle the globe to keep pressure on Putin to stop a five-week invasion that has uprooted a quarter of Ukraine's population. 
Europe wants to wean itself off Russian energy but that risks further inflating soaring fuel prices. Russia has a key revenue source at stake even as it reels from sanctions. 
Facing stiff resistance from Ukraine's military, Putin has played one of his biggest cards in the demand on European energy buyers.
""They must open rouble accounts in Russian banks. It is from these accounts that payments will be made for gas delivered starting from tomorrow,"" Putin said. 
""If such payments are not made (in roubles), we will consider this a default on the part of buyers, with all the ensuing consequences ... existing contracts will be stopped."" 
'BATTLES AHEAD'
Putin sent troops on Feb. 24 for what he calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise Ukraine. Western countries say Putin's real aim was to topple Ukraine's government. 
At talks this week, Moscow said it would reduce offensives near the capital Kyiv and in the north as a goodwill gesture and focus on ""liberating"" the southeastern Donbas region. 
Kyiv and its allies say Russia is instead trying to regroup after taking losses from a Ukrainian counter-offensive that has recaptured suburbs of the capital plus strategic areas in the northeast and southwest.
In a late night address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned of ""battles ahead"" in Donbas and the besieged southern port city of Mariupol. 
""We still need to go down a very difficult path to get everything we want,"" Zelenskiy said.
Peace negotiations are set to resume by video conference on Friday. Seeking to bolster its position, Moscow is redeploying forces from Russian-backed breakaway regions in Georgia to Ukraine, Britain's defence ministry wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
The reinforcements indicated Russia had sustained unexpected losses, it said. 
ENERGY CRISIS? 
With the war exacerbating global fuel prices, President Joe Biden launched the largest release ever from the U.S. oil reserve and challenged oil giants to drill more.
""This is a moment of consequence and peril for the world,"" Biden said as he announced a release of 180 million barrels starting in May. But that amount fails to cover a U.S. loss of Russian oil, which Biden banned this month. 
Western governments say Putin's demand for rouble payments would be a breach of contracts in euros or dollars.
An order signed by Putin allows customers to send foreign currency to a designated account at Russia's Gazprombank, which would then return roubles for the gas buyer to make payment. 
""Russia would have to physically halt gas flows to EU 27 (European Union member states) to force the issue, marking a major escalation not even performed at the height of the Cold War. It would mark another major financial blow to Russia's coffers,"" said analysts at Fitch Solutions.
U.S. and European officials say Putin has been misled by generals about his military's dire performance. 
The U.S. ambassador in Moscow, John Sullivan, told Reuters that the United States and Russia were ""in the Mariana Trench as far as diplomatic relations go,"" referring to the deepest place on Earth.
In a show of support for Ukraine's government, EU Parliament President Roberta Metsola said late on Thursday that she was on her way to Kyiv. 
'THE CHILDREN ARE SHAKING'
The war has been particularly fierce in Mariupol, a gateway to the Black Sea which links a strategic corridor between Donbas and the Russian-annexed Crimea peninsula. 
The mayor's office estimates 5,000 people have died. 
Tens of thousands have been trapped for weeks with scant food, water and other supplies in the city that was once home to 400,000 people but has been pulverised by bombardment. 
In a Russian-held part of Mariupol, people climbed out of cellars to appear, ghostlike, among the ruins. One man named Pavel placed a bowl and spoon as a tribute on a makeshift grave in a patch of grass, marked with a plain wooden cross.
""Our friend. March 16. Driving in a car. A bullet hit him in the throat. He was dead in five minutes,"" he said.
Elsewhere, there was evidence of Ukraine's successful counter-attack in Trostyanets, an eastern town. Burned-out Russian tanks and abandoned ammunition littered muddy roads.
""We spent 30 days in the basement with small children. The children are shaking, even still,"" said a woman named Larisa.
Ukraine's state nuclear company said all Russian forces that occupied the Chernobyl nuclear station had left the defunct plant, possibly concerned over radiation.

Britain and the United States imposed sanctions on Russian media outlets and the country's technology sector. Canada said Russia cannot be a constructive partner in the G20, a group composed of most of the world's largest economies.
""The bottom line is: It can't be business as usual to have Vladimir Putin just sitting around the table pretending that everything's okay,"" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

REYNOSA, Mexico (Reuters) -News the United States is poised to end a pandemic-related border expulsion policy is buoying hopes of thousands of migrants who have waited months in Mexico for a chance to seek asylum in the United States.
U.S. health officials are set to announce plans this week to terminate the order, known as Title 42, in May, Reuters reported on Wednesday. 
More than a million migrants have been expelled under the order since it was put in place in March 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the policy, U.S. border agents rapidly send people back to Mexico or other countries, often within hours after being apprehended, without giving them a chance to ask for refuge, a process rights groups say unlawfully denies them access to asylum.
In a public plaza in Reynosa, Mexico, nearly 2,000 migrants are camping in tents or under tarps right across the U.S. border from McAllen, Texas. Most are from South and Central America and the Caribbean, and have fled violence or persecution in their home countries.
On Thursday morning, under a beating sun, about a dozen migrants lined up to see volunteer health workers in the camp. A group of women fried fish over an open flame and children ran around, playing with marbles, racing scooters and sweeping up trash. 
Aile Rodriguez, 32, has family in McAllen but has been waiting since last August at the camp with her three children, aged 8, 13, and 15. She said they fled Honduras because of gang threats to their family and hope to seek asylum in the United States. ""I want to enter legally,"" she said. ""That's why we've suffered here for seven months.""
U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, has kept Title 42 in place since taking office in January 2021, even as he pledged to reverse the hardline immigration policies of his Republican predecessor, President Donald Trump. 
Immigration advocates, health experts and fellow Democrats have decried the order saying it violates migrants’ rights while exposing them to danger in Mexico. 
Glendy Juana de Leon, 30, from Guatemala said she was denied a chance to ask for asylum when she crossed the border in July. She has spent the nine months since her expulsion in the Reynosa camp with her eight-year-old son. She said she left home after death threats from her husband, who is in jail for domestic violence but is slated to be released soon. 
""I have all my documents, from the hospital, from the police in Guatemala, but they didn't look at any of them,"" she said. ""God willing they'll change,"" she said, ""and ask us why we fled.""
THOUSANDS WAITING
On the other side of the U.S.-Mexico border in Tijuana, Mexico across from San Diego, California, Enrique Lucero, the municipal director of migrant services said he estimates there are thousands of migrants waiting to make their case for asylum. 
""This gives them hope,"" said Jose Maria Garcia, the director of Tijuana's Movimiento Juventud 2000 shelter, referring to the plans to lift Title 42. 
Garcia and other immigrant advocates have long criticized the policy and are cheering its end. But Garcia acknowledged the decision could strain the border's already crowded shelters if more migrants head north.
""Most of the shelters are already at capacity,"" he said.
Republicans have criticized Biden's immigration policies as the number of migrants apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border broke records last year and is set to rise further this year. 
U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky on Thursday said ending Title 42 would ""effectively throw our borders wide open,"" and ""spark a humanitarian and security crisis like we've never seen."" The move could become a major attack point as his party seeks to win a majority in the November congressional elections. 
Democrats have argued that the United States must welcome, not block, asylum seekers. U.S. Representative Judy Chu from California said the order's use has been ""a shameful time in our country's history.""

But U.S. and Mexican officials say not all migrants have valid asylum claims, which is narrowly defined in U.S. law.
Esteban Moctezuma, Mexico's ambassador to the United States, said at an event in Washington that if Title 42 is lifted, migrants who aren't seeking refuge should be sent home to prevent a ""revolving door"" at the border.

(Reuters) -The U.S. government began privately warning some American companies the day after Russia invaded Ukraine that Moscow could manipulate software designed by Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky to cause harm, according to a senior U.S. official and two people familiar with the matter. 
The classified briefings are part of Washington's broader strategy to prepare providers of critical infrastructure such as water, telecoms and energy for potential Russian intrusions.
President Joe Biden said last week that sanctions imposed on Russia for its Feb. 24 attack on Ukraine could result in a backlash, including cyber disruptions, but the White House did not offer specifics. 
""The risk calculation has changed with the Ukraine conflict,"" said the senior U.S. official about Kaspersky's software. ""It has increased.""
Kaspersky, one of the cybersecurity industry's most popular anti-virus software makers, is headquartered in Moscow and was founded by Eugene Kaspersky, who U.S. officials describe as a former Russian intelligence officer.
A Kaspersky spokeswoman said in a statement that the briefings about purported risks of Kaspersky software would be ""further damaging"" to Kaspersky’s reputation ""without giving the company the opportunity to respond directly to such concerns"" and that it ""is not appropriate or just."" 
The senior U.S. official said Kaspersky's Russia-based staff could be coerced into providing or helping establish remote access into their customers' computers by Russian law enforcement or intelligence agencies.
Eugene Kaspersky, according to his company website, graduated from the Institute of Cryptography, Telecommunications and Computer Science, which the Soviet KGB previously administered. The company spokeswoman said that Kaspersky worked as a ""software engineer"" during military service.
The Russian cybersecurity firm, which has an office in the United States, lists partnerships with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) on its website. Microsoft declined to comment. Intel and IBM did not respond to requests for comment.
On March 25, the Federal Communications Commission added Kaspersky to its list of communications equipment and service providers deemed threats to U.S. national security.
It is not the first time Washington has said Kaspersky could be influenced by the Kremlin. 
The Trump administration spent months banning Kaspersky from government systems and warning numerous companies to not use the software in 2017 and 2018.
U.S. security agencies conducted a series of similar cybersecurity briefings surrounding the Trump ban. The content of those meetings four years ago was comparable to the new briefings, said one of the people familiar with the matter. 
Over the years, Kaspersky has consistently denied wrongdoing or any secret partnership with Russian intelligence. 
It is unclear whether a specific incident or piece of new intelligence led to the security briefings. The senior official declined to comment on classified information. 
Until now no U.S. or allied intelligence agency has ever offered direct, public proof of a backdoor in Kaspersky software. 
Following the Trump decision, Kaspersky opened a series of transparency centers, where it says partners can review its code to check for malicious activity. A company blog post at the time explained the goal was to build trust with customers after the U.S. accusations. 
But the U.S. official said the transparency centers are not ""even a fig leaf"" because they do not address the U.S. government's concern. 
""Moscow software engineers handle the [software] updates, that's where the risk comes,"" they said. ""They can send malicious commands through the updaters and that comes from Russia."" 
Cybersecurity experts say that because of how anti-virus software normally functions on computers where it is installed, it requires a deep level of control to discovery malware. This makes anti-virus software an inherently advantageous channel to conduct espionage. 
In addition, Kaspersky's products are also sometimes sold under white label sales agreements. This means the software can be packaged and renamed in commercial deals by information technology contractors, making their origin difficult to immediately determine. 

While not referring to Kaspersky by name, Britain's cybersecurity center on Tuesday said organizations providing services related to Ukraine or critical infrastructure should reconsider the risk associated with using Russian computer technology in their supply chains.
""We have no evidence that the Russian state intends to suborn Russian commercial products and services to cause damage to UK interests, but the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence,"" the National Cyber Security Centre said in a blog post.

Police investigating a tip about ""potential bio-hazard material"" found the five fetuses in the home on the 400 block of 6th Street, South East, on Wednesday, the Metropolitan Police Department said.
The disturbing discovery was made on Wednesday as criminal indictments were unsealed by the U.S. Justice Department against Lauren Handy and eight other anti-abortion activists. They were accused of conspiring in 2020 to overrun the clinic and set up a blockade to intimidate patients and staff.
The Justice Department described Handy, 28, as living in Alexandria, Virginia. The home where the fetuses were found was described by local media as her residence.
Asked whether the home where the fetuses were found was in fact Handy's residence, Metropolitan Police said ""We cannot confirm this information.""
Handy's attorney, Federal Public Defender Mary Petras, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The fetuses were collected by the DC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, police said. The case is under investigation.
Charged with Handy in the Oct. 22, 2020 clinic incident were Jonathan Darnel, 40, of Arlington, Virginia; Jay Smith, 32, of Freeport, New York; Paulette Harlow, 73, and Jean Marshall, 72, of Kingston, Massachusetts; John Hinshaw, 67, of Levittown, New York; Heather Idoni, 61, of Linden, Michigan; William Goodman, 52, of Bronx, New York; and Joan Bell, 74, of Montague, New Jersey.
They are charged with conspiring to injure, oppress, threaten and intimidate patients and employees, in violation of their federal rights to seek and provide reproductive health services.

They are also charged with violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE) for using force to interfere with the clinic's services.
If convicted, they each could face up to 11 years in prison and a fine of up to $350,000.

(Reuters) - More than a third of high school students surveyed in the United States experienced stress, anxiety or depression, and nearly a fifth said they seriously considered suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. researchers reported on Thursday.
The first nationwide survey of its kind found that 44% of students reported feeling sad or hopeless every day for two consecutive weeks or more during the prior year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study.
""The findings we presented today highlight complex issues, however, and kids, parents and schools cannot address them alone. The impact of COVID-19 will be felt for many years with devastating consequences,"" CDC official Jonathan Mermin told reporters in a news briefing.
The online survey of 7,705 students in grades 9-12 across the country was conducted during January to June 2021 and asked, ""how often was your mental health not good?""
The survey found the prevalence of poor mental health and suicidality was high across students of all sexual identity, racial and ethnic groups, but was more prevalent among students who identified as female than males.
Suicidal thoughts or attempts and general poor mental health were also more prevalent among LGBT students than among heterosexual youth, the survey published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report found.
The study confirms concerns raised by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and the Children’s Hospital Association, which in October 2021 jointly declared a national emergency in child and adolescent mental health, noting that the stresses brought on by the pandemic have exacerbated issues that existed prior to the health crisis.
As schools were closed during pandemic lockdowns, teenagers were exposed to a variety of stresses, including abuse from parents and isolation.
More than half of the students surveyed said they experienced emotional abuse by a parent or other adult at home, with 11% reporting physical abuse. Nearly 30% reported that a parent or other adult in their homes lost a job and 24% said they went hungry because there was not enough food. 
The study also found that perceived racism was highest among Asian students during the pandemic at 64%, followed by Black and multiracial students at about 55%.
The researchers noted an increase in racism during the pandemic, which began in China, particularly against Asian communities.

To address these mental health issues, researchers recommended improving student connectedness with other students as well as with staff, and noted that school districts should consider school-wide programs such as those focused on social and emotional learning.
Because the survey was the first of its kind, it was not possible to compare trends with those seen in other studies before the pandemic, researchers noted.

(Reuters) - Louisiana's Republican-controlled legislature overrode Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards' veto of a new congressional map, ensuring the state will maintain only a single majority-Black district among its six seats.
Edwards rejected the map earlier this month, saying lawmakers should have created a second majority-Black district to account for the Southern state's large and growing minority population. One-third of the state's 4.7 million residents are Black.
Both legislative chambers voted on Wednesday to invalidate Edwards' veto largely along party lines, with a two-thirds majority required.
Within hours, several civil rights groups -- including the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union -- filed a federal lawsuit challenging the map as a violation of the federal Voting Rights Act, which protects minority voters from racial discrimination.
""The Congressional map passed by the Louisiana legislature in February rejected basic principles of fairness and equity,"" NAACP Louisiana State Conference President Michael McClanahan said in a statement.
The new districts are similar to the state's current map, which features one district that stretches from New Orleans to Baton Rouge, both of which have significant Black populations. The state's congressional delegation has consisted of five white Republicans and one Black Democrat for the last decade.
Republicans have argued that a map with a second majority-minority district would break up other communities of interest and could result in districts with too narrow a Black majority to guarantee minority candidates would win.
States must redraw congressional and legislative lines every 10 years to account for population shifts. In most states, lawmakers control the process, allowing them to manipulate districts to create partisan advantage in a practice known as gerrymandering.
Only four states, including heavily populated Florida, have not finalized new congressional maps ahead of November's midterm elections, when control of the U.S. Congress will be at stake. Democrats are considered underdogs to maintain their slight majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Edwards criticized the legislature at a news conference after the vote.
""Simple math and simple fairness means that two of those districts need to be minority districts,"" he said. ""That's pretty easy to understand.""

A lawsuit challenging Alabama's congressional map based on the Voting Rights Act reached the U.S. Supreme Court in February.
Five of the nine-member court's conservative justices voted to overturn a lower court's ruling and allow the map to be used in November's election, signaling that the high court may be prepared to weaken the landmark civil rights law further.

Otherwise they could be blocked and face a fine of up to 5 million roubles.
Russian authorities, which did not comment for this article, have since doubled down on censorship in Russia. On March 4, lawmakers passed amendments that criminalised ""discrediting"" Russian armed forces or calling for sanctions against Russia.
Lawmakers made the spread of ""fake"" information an offence punishable with fines or a jail term of up to 15 years, a move that led some international news outlets to halt reporting in Russia.
Authorities also restricted access to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and blocked several independent media and Ukrainian websites.
In response, Twitter said people should have free and open access to the internet, particularly during times of crisis. Nick Clegg, president of global affairs for Facebook's parent company Meta, said millions of ordinary Russians would be cut off from reliable information.
Several Russian media outlets suspended their work. Ekho Moskvy, a liberal radio station, was dissolved by its board after the prosecutor general's office blocked its website over its coverage of the war. Television channel Rain suspended its work after its website was blocked. The Novaya Gazeta newspaper, whose editor Dmitry Muratov was a co-winner of last year's Nobel Peace Prize, said it would pause its work until the end of Russia's ""special operation"" in Ukraine.

Online censorship was already rising before the invasion. Ahead of the September elections last year, major internet outages were caused by a crackdown on websites linked to jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny and on technology used to circumvent online bans.
Around 200,000 websites were blocked in 2021, according to data from Roskomsvoboda, a group that monitors internet freedom in Russia. They included the website of OVD-Info, which has documented anti-Kremlin protests for years. This year, as of March 10, more than 46,000 sites have been blocked, according to Roskomsvoboda.

It was one of at least 20 raids across Surgut that day, Zhukov told Reuters. He said all of those targeted were Jehovah's Witnesses, an organisation that had been banned in Russia two years earlier after Russia's Supreme Court ruled it extremist. Russian authorities argued the organisation promotes its beliefs as superior to other faiths. 
Zhukov and his fellow believers were detained for questioning and accused of ""continuing the activities of an extremist organisation,"" a crime that could lead to imprisonment. Russian authorities didn't respond to questions from Reuters about the matter.
Zhukov, who trained as a lawyer, told Reuters he and the others have done nothing unlawful. The Surgut branch of the Jehovah's Witnesses was liquidated after the ban came into force, Zhukov said, ""but we continue to believe, regardless of whether there is a legal entity.""
Jarrod Lopes, a spokesperson for Jehovah's Witnesses, told Reuters, ""If Russia's skewed view of extremism was imposed on everyone, then just about every believer and non-believer would be banned in Russia, not just Jehovah's Witnesses.""
Jehovah's Witnesses say they are politically neutral. They don't lobby or vote for political candidates or run for office. They don't sing national anthems or salute the flag of any nation because they view it as an act of worship. They also reject military service – a choice that has led to the imprisonment of Jehovah's Witnesses members in several countries.
Religious life in Russia is dominated by the Orthodox Church, which is championed by President Vladimir Putin. Some Orthodox scholars view Jehovah's Witnesses as a ""totalitarian sect.""
Zhukov's case is still working its way through the courts. But his name already appears on the register of ""terrorists and extremists"" and he can't travel outside the city without permission. He has only restricted access to his bank account. If he wants to withdraw more than 10,000 roubles ($120) in a single month he has to explain the reasons: ""I need to pay for the apartment, for kindergarten, for school.""
Over the past three years, Zhukov said, police and investigators threatened him with jail and he was forcibly admitted to a hospital in Yekaterinburg, 1,000 km away, to undergo a psychiatric examination. He said he spent 14 days there alongside patients who included violent criminals. ""I passed all the tests, some involving devices on my head.""
The list of ""terrorists and extremists"" has grown steadily. At the end of 2021, there were more than 12,200 individuals and groups on the register, up 13% from about a year earlier. Russia doesn't publish the dates on which names are added, but Reuters compared the current list with previous versions saved on archive.org, which stores web pages.
Violent extremists such as neo-Nazi groups and Islamic State appear on the list. At least 400 local Jehovah's Witnesses groups are currently designated as extremist or terrorist, according to a Reuters analysis of the Russian list.
In January, a 56-year-old female Jehovah's Witness was sentenced to six years in a penal colony for extremism. The following month, a 64-year-old man was handed a six-year sentence on the same charge. Both had insisted their innocence. Zhukov too insists that his religious beliefs do not contravene any law. 

""As a lawyer, I can very easily distinguish between a religious association and a legal entity,"" he said. ""I can't explain why some lawyers and judges can't see the difference. And what threat do we pose?""
""We preach, we tell people about the kingdom of God from the Bible.""

Speaking at an American Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan event late on Wednesday, Sandra Oudkirk, director of the American Institute in Taiwan which handles relations in the absence of formal diplomatic ties, said managing U.S. differences with China faces ""distinct challenges"".
""The PRC's increasingly aggressive behaviour is nowhere more evident than in relation to Taiwan, where the PRC has continued to exert military, diplomatic, and economic pressure,"" she said, referring to the People's Republic of China, in remarks released by her office on Thursday. 
""The PRC's provocative military activities near Taiwan are destabilising, risk miscalculation, and undermine regional peace and stability,"" Oudkirk added, at the event also attended by Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen. 
""Continued efforts by Beijing to choke Taiwan's international space, pressure its friends, and interfere in Taiwan's democratic system represent a threat to all democracies.""
China claims democratically-governed Taiwan as its own territory, and has over the past two years or so ramped up military and diplomatic pressure to assert those claims.
The United States is Taiwan's most important international supporter and arms supplier, a source of constant friction between Washington and Beijing. 
Oudkirk said that in order to strengthen Taiwan's role as a regional security partner, the United States remains committed to helping Taiwan ""maintain its ability to deter aggression and to defend itself"". 
""We have a shared and abiding interest in peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. We consider this central to the security and stability of the broader Indo-Pacific region and are deeply concerned by ongoing PRC efforts to undermine that stability.""
Taiwan rejects China's sovereignty claims and says only the island's people can decide their own future.
The United States has also been working with Taiwan on supply chains, the island being a major producer of semiconductors.

Oudkirk said both sides were working on diversifying supply chains and to facilitate investment in sectors like chips, electric vehicles, cybersecurity, 5G and renewable energy.
""AIT's commercial section is now organising visits by robust industry-focused delegations to many parts of the United States this summer,"" she added, without giving details.

PORTLAND, Ore. (Reuters) - From his home in Seattle, Andrey Nokhrin sent his mother in Moscow a clip of a television editor interrupting a live Russian state-run news bulletin to hold up a sign and shout slogans protesting the Ukraine invasion.
The editor, Marina Ovsyannikova, told Reuters earlier this month that she hoped her protest would open Russians' eyes to propaganda.
But his mother said the protest looked fake, as if it had been staged with a green screen, according to Nokhrin. 
It is an example of how Russian Americans are sending their relatives in Russia accounts of the war in Ukraine produced by Western and other media outlets that contrast with what Russian state media is reporting. Reuters interviews with 11 Russian Americans suggest that, as with the case of Nokhrin's mother, skepticism about the war in Ukraine runs deep.
""The propaganda there works very well,"" said Nokhrin, a 37-year-old IT entrepreneur. ""They've been told that this is a peacemaking operation and they truly, honestly believe it.""
State TV, the main source of news for many millions of Russians, closely follows the Kremlin line that Russia was forced to act in Ukraine to demilitarize and ""denazify"" the country, and to defend Russian-speakers there against what the Kremlin calls ""genocide.""
Russia passed a law earlier this month banning the ""public dissemination of deliberately false information about the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation."" Offenders face up to 15 years in jail.
Russian state TV did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The Kremlin declined to comment.
Russian Americans interviewed by Reuters said they are engaging in conversations with family over messaging apps WhatsApp and Telegram, sharing material they collect from social media and international news sites.
Nokhrin has sent his relatives pictures of injured Ukrainian children, dead Russian soldiers, and bombed-out apartment buildings and hospitals. He sent his mother the link to a news site that aggregates content about Ukraine from international news sites and translates them into Russian. He used WhatsApp to message his mother a YouTube clip of Russia's independent news broadcaster, TV Rain, signing off with ""No to war.""
Reuters has seen the messages sent by Nokhrin and others interviewed for this story and verified the sources of the videos and pictures they included. Reuters was unable to interview the relatives in Russia to verify the conversations.
""This military operation has been presented to them as if there were Ukrainian fascists that are trying to enslave the Russian population,"" Nokhrin said. ""My mom, she thinks (President Volodymyr) Zelenskiy is this evil monster who wants to join NATO, which wants to nuke Russia.""
""It's crazy for us to think of this, since we see the other side of this, but when you are isolated in Russia and just seeing government media it really informs what you believe.""
Russian President Vladimir Putin has said in the past that the United States is an ""empire of lies"" that sows disinformation about Russia. Senior Russian officials such as Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov say Western media has misreported the conflict in Ukraine and has repeatedly failed to show the persecution of Russian-speaking people there. 
Julia Bari, a New York City-based insurance broker who emigrated from Moscow 26 years ago, described a cousin's reluctance to engage in a fraught discussion about what was happening in Ukraine.
Bari said she is frequently in touch over WhatsApp with the cousin living in southwestern Russia. After the invasion, ""I called her to say, 'Oh my God, war is happening,' and she shut me down. She said, 'Look, we don't know anything. This is politics.' I became quiet because my insides were boiling from anger.""
Bari sent her cousin what she could find: pictures of Ukrainian children sleeping in bomb shelters, videos of buildings being hit by artillery strikes, photos of orphans being evacuated on trains.
""I told her, you know, this is real. This is murder,"" Bari said. ""She said that it was unpleasant to see but she couldn't be involved with it. She wants to act like everything is normal.""
International reaction to the invasion has been severe and includes sweeping sanctions that have sent the rouble plunging to record lows and left Russians isolated.
Bari said she is concerned for her cousin, whose salary with one of Russia's largest state-owned companies was recently cut by 60%, according to Bari. She declined to name the company.
""She thinks (Russia) can switch to its own production lines or get whatever they need from China,"" Bari said. ""I'm scared for her.""
After leaving Moscow in 2018, Sasha and Vitaly, a couple in their mid-30s who asked that their last names not be used out of concern for the safety of their family, started a WhatsApp chat with their relatives. Until three weeks ago, their content was mostly pictures of their two young children. These days, they send news updates and videos about the invasion.
Vitaly's mother, who works in healthcare in Moscow, reads the stories he sends her from independent Russian news sources that post on Telegram.

""She would bring up the war with her colleagues, and they'd say, 'You think this way because your son is in America and has brainwashed you. That's why you're not supporting President Putin,'"" Vitaly said in an interview at a café in Portland, Oregon. Vitaly's mother, he said, was open to the idea of seeing the invasion of Ukraine as an atrocity.
However, since Russia passed the law on information dissemination, Vitaly said his mother, at his request, has stopped talking to colleagues about the war, for fear she could be accused of spreading falsehoods.

MALA ROHAN/NEAR IRPIN, Ukraine (Reuters) - Russian forces bombarded the outskirts of Kyiv and a besieged city in northern Ukraine on Wednesday after promising to reduce attacks there in what the West dismissed as a ploy by Moscow to stem its heavy losses and regroup for other offensives.
Nearly five weeks into an invasion in which Russia has failed to capture any major city, the top U.N. human rights official said Moscow had bombed 50 hospitals as well as homes and schools across Ukraine in what may amount to war crimes.
Ukrainian officials called Russia out for having said on Tuesday it would curtail operations near the capital Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv ""to increase mutual trust"" for peace talks.
""It's not true,"" Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said in a video address to European Union regional officials. ""The whole night we listened to sirens, to rocket attacks and we listened to huge explosions east of Kyiv and north of Kyiv. There are immense battles there, people died, still die."" 
Intensified bombardment could be heard in Kyiv on Wednesday morning from suburbs where Ukrainian forces have regained territory in recent days. Windows rattled from the relentless artillery on its outskirts.
Southeast of Irpin, a Kyiv suburb which has seen intense fighting for weeks, frequent shelling and ordnance exploding on the ground and in the air could be heard. Ukrainians evacuating spoke of heavy shelling north of Irpin and shells landing in Irpin itself. 
Ukraine and Western leaders had cautioned that Moscow's apparent peace gesture at Tuesday's talks in Istanbul was a cover for reorganizing forces that had failed to take Kyiv.
Russia said on Wednesday its forces had achieved their objectives near Kyiv and Chernihiv and were regrouping to focus on the ""liberation"" of the breakaway eastern Donbas region.
The Pentagon said that Russia had started to reposition under a fifth of its forces arrayed around Kyiv, but warned Moscow was expected to refit and resupply them for redeployment.
OIL AND GAS SUPPLY DOUBTS 
Western sanctions imposed on Russia as punishment for its invasion have largely isolated its economy from world trade but Moscow is still the biggest supplier of oil and gas to Europe. Russia's new demand for payment in roubles, rejected by the West, has raised fears of energy shortages and heightened recessionary risks in Europe. 
Germany, Russia's biggest gas customer, declared an ""early warning"" on Wednesday of a possible emergency if Russia were to cut off supplies. Economy Minister Robert Habeck urged people to reduce consumption, saying ""every kilowatt-hour counts"". 
Russian sources told Reuters it might keep the energy contract currency as is, with final payment in roubles. 
Floating a potential compromise, Russian President Vladimir Putin told German Chancellor Olaf Scholz that payments could be made in euros and sent to Gazprombank, which would convert the money to roubles, a German government spokesperson said.
Gazprombank is one of the main channels for payments for Russian oil and gas.
""Scholz did not agree to this procedure in the conversation, but asked for written information to better understand the procedure,"" the spokesperson said.
TRAPPED
In northern Ukraine, Chernihiv's Mayor Vladyslav Astroshenko said Russian bombardment of his city had intensified over the past 24 hours, with more than 100,000 people trapped inside with just enough food and medical supplies to last about another week.
""This is yet another confirmation that Russia always lies,"" he told CNN. He said 25 civilians had been injured in a mortar attack in the city centre.
Reuters could not verify the situation in Chernihiv. Russia's defence ministry did not reply to a request for comment.
Reuters journalists who entered the Kyiv suburb of Irpin, recaptured by Ukrainian forces this week, on Tuesday saw Ukrainian troops patrolling an abandoned ghost town of ruined buildings, with the body of an old man and a woman lying on the streets.
Around a quarter of Ukrainians have been driven from their homes and the United Nations said on Wednesday that the number who have fled the country had risen above 4 million. More than half of those refugees are children and the rest mostly women.
Over the past week, Ukrainian forces have recaptured towns and villages on the outskirts of Kyiv, broken the siege of the eastern city of Sumy and pushed back Russian forces in the southwest.
In the village of Mala Rohan in the eastern Kharkiv region, two burned-out tanks with their turrets ripped off stood near damaged houses. Maksym, a Ukrainian soldier, said the Russians were being pushed back ""slowly but steadily"".
""Most of them already understood that they made a huge mistake when they came here. Therefore, I think they have no chance here, we will win.""
Russia's defence ministry said the humanitarian situation in Kharkiv was getting worse and accused Ukrainian forces there of shooting at civilians, Russian news agencies reported, without presenting evidence. 
Russia says it is carrying out a ""special operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" its neighbour. Western countries say Moscow's invasion was entirely unprovoked.
The Donbas region, where Russia says it will now focus its efforts, includes the port of Mariupol, where heavy fighting was again reported on Wednesday. 

Mariupol, which had a pre-war population of more than 400,000 people, has been laid waste in a month. The United Nations says thousands of people may have died there.
Russian forces were shelling nearly all cities along the region's frontline on Wednesday, said the governor of Donetsk, which is part of the Donbas.

RIYADH (Reuters) -United Nations and United States envoys on Wednesday welcomed unilateral truce moves by Yemen's warring sides as encouraging steps, while stressing the need for a more comprehensive ceasefire that would help alleviate a dire humanitarian crisis.
The Saudi-led coalition fighting Yemen's Houthis had said it would temporarily halt military operations from Wednesday after the Iran-aligned group this week declared a three-day cessation of cross-border attacks and ground offensives in Yemen.
As part of efforts to end the seven-year-old war that has killed tens of thousands and pushed millions into hunger, the initiatives followed a U.N. call for a truce during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan that starts this week.
U.N. special envoy Hans Grundberg and U.S. special envoy Tim Lenderking, speaking at a gathering of allied Yemeni factions in Riyadh on Wednesday, said the unilateral announcements were a step in the right direction.
The two envoys have been pressing Riyadh to ease coalition sea and air restrictions on areas held by the Houthis, who ousted the Saudi-backed government from the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014, prompting the coalition to intervene months later.
They have also urged the Houthis to end an offensive in energy-producing Marib, the internationally recognised government's last stronghold in North Yemen.
""Yemen needs a truce. I am engaging with the parties with a sense of urgency to reach this truce by the beginning of Ramadan. The truce will ease the fuel crisis and facilitate the freedom of movement,"" Grundberg told the gathering.
Lenderking said the U.N. proposal could serve as a first step towards a comprehensive ceasefire and a ""new, more inclusive political process"".
Two sources familiar with the matter had said the proposal was for a temporary truce in exchange for allowing fuel ships to dock at Houthi-held Hodeidah port and a small number of commercial flights to operate from Sanaa airport.
A senior U.S. State Department official said there were ""real opportunities"" for progress because there was ""buy in"" within Yemen and from countries in the region.
""We've seen positive statements from the Houthis that they would be willing to engage,"" the official said.
A permanent ceasefire has proved elusive as both sides resisted compromise. The Houthis want the coalition to lift its blockade ahead of any truce talks while the alliance, which controls Yemen's seas and air space, wants a simultaneous deal.
Houthi chief negotiator Mohammed Abdulsalam told Reuters the group has for over a month been discussing a ""humanitarian truce"" with Grundberg and hoped ""those efforts will succeed"".

""On Riyadh's dialogue, we are not concerned about it nor its outcomes,"" he said, referring to the week-long Yemeni talks that the Houthis shunned for not being held in a ""neutral"" country. 
Riyadh has struggled to exit the conflict that is largely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system and foreign aggression.

(Reuters) -The Republican governors of Oklahoma and Arizona on Wednesday signed bills banning transgender athletes from girls' school sports, joining a growing list of states that have passed or enacted similar laws on a contentious election-year issue.
Arizona Governor Doug Ducey also signed a bill banning irreversible gender reassignment surgery for minors.
""This legislation is common-sense and narrowly-targeted to address these two specific issues ⁠- while ensuring that transgender individuals continue to receive the same dignity, respect and kindness as every individual in our society,"" Ducey said in a statement.
The American Civil Liberties Union signaled it would challenge the ban on gender reassignment surgery in court, saying on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that ""the government can't violate our rights without a fight.""
Transgender rights have been pushed to the forefront of the culture wars playing out across the United States in recent years, together with issues such as reproductive rights. Ducey on Wednesday also signed a bill banning abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.
Supporters of the sports bans argue they are needed to ensure transgender athletes do not have an unfair advantage, while opponents call the measures discriminatory.
Oklahoma's Save Women's Sports Act http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/cf_pdf/2021-22%20ENR/SB/SB2%20ENR.PDF applies to public schools in the state through college.
""We are protecting women's sports, we're ensuring a level playing field for female athletes,"" Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt said at a signing ceremony, surrounded by young female athletes.
Oklahoma and Arizona are now among 14 states that have enacted legislation prohibiting transgender girls from participating and competing in girls' sports in school.
A similar bill passed in Kentucky last week and awaits action from Democratic Governor Andy Beshear. 
Opponents of the bans have characterized the laws as backed by conservative special interests to drum up support ahead of November's midterm congressional elections, when Republicans seek to win back a majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives. 
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6803a3.htm in 2019 that 1.8% of high school students in the country are transgender. The advocacy group Human Rights Campaign has said that according to surveys https://assets2.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/PlayToWin-FINAL.pdf, only about 12% of them play on girls' sports teams. 

The Human Rights Campaign said it is tracking more than 300 bills targeting the LGBTQ+ community that are currently moving through state legislatures, many specifically aimed at transgender youth. 
Gender reassignment surgery for people under 18 is extremely rare and would take place only after years of treatment in cases where the patient's wishes are unwavering, according to experts in transgender medicine.

(Reuters) -A Connecticut judge on Wednesday held conspiracy theorist Alex Jones in contempt and fined him $25,000 a day until he sits for a deposition in a defamation lawsuit filed by relatives of the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting.
Jones, founder of the right-wing Infowars website who claimed the shooting was a hoax, failed to comply with court orders to appear at a deposition on March 23 and 24, Connecticut Superior Court Judge Barbara Bellis said during an online hearing.
His lawyers had sought to explain his absence by claiming that ""Jones was remaining at home under his doctor's supervision when, in fact, he was working at his studios and broadcasting his show,"" Bellis said, referring to a podcast produced by Jones.
She set an April 15 deadline for Jones to complete a two-day deposition, a goal that would ""purge"" the contempt ruling. Starting April 1, the court would assess a fine of $25,000 each weekday until he sits for the deposition, the judge ruled.
""Alex Jones willfully and in bad faith violated without justification several clear court orders requiring his attendance at his depositions,"" the judge said.
The defamation suit has already been decided in favor of the families of the shooting victims, with the judge saying in November that Jones defaulted by failing to provide documents and is responsible for damages to the plaintiffs.
The online hearing on Wednesday took place a day after Sandy Hook families rejected an offer by Jones to pay $120,000 to each of the 13 plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit. 
The plaintiffs are suing Jones in response to his claims that the shooting, which left 20 children and six school employees dead, never happened. He had claimed the incident at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, was fabricated by gun-control advocates and mainstream media.
In response, several parents sued Jones and Infowars, as well as its parent company, for defamation in both Austin, Texas and in Waterbury, Connecticut. Infowars is based in Texas.

According to court records, his rejected offer to the plaintiffs included a statement that read in part: ""Mr. Jones extends his heartfelt apology for any distress his remarks caused.""
Each of the plaintiffs immediately turned down the offer, saying it was ""a transparent and desperate attempt by Alex Jones to escape a public reckoning under oath with his deceitful, profit-driven campaign against the plaintiffs and the memory of their loved ones lost at Sandy Hook.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors on Wednesday accused a Chinese citizen of seeking to pressure critics of China's government living in the United States to travel to China, where they might face punishment. 
Sun Hoy Ying, 53, was charged with two counts of acting and conspiring to act as an unregistered agent of the Chinese government, according to a complaint unsealed in Manhattan federal court.
U.S. prosecutors said the FBI has been investigating people who at the direction of China's government were involved in a campaign, known as ""Operation Fox Hunt"" or ""Operation Skynet,"" to forcibly repatriate people whom China considered fugitives.
Sun is at large in China, prosecutors said in a statement. It was not known when he left the United States and he could not immediately be reached for comment. The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""Today's charges reflect this office's continued commitment ... to combat transnational repression and bring to justice those who perpetrate it,"" Damian Williams, the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement. 
The charges were announced two weeks after federal prosecutors in Brooklyn accused five people of trying to spy on and intimidate Chinese dissidents living in the United States, including a candidate for the U.S. Congress. Three were arrested in that case.
Prosecutors said Sun used private investigators to surveil a U.S. citizen whose then-pregnant daughter was held against her will in China for eight months.

China's government told the daughter not to seek help from the U.S. government, and that she could not leave China until she helped make the target to return there, prosecutors said.
Sun also worked with a co-conspirator, a U.S. law enforcement officer, to pressure another target of the operation to comply with China's demands, prosecutors said.

(Reuters) - The FBI searched a home in a Detroit suburb in an investigation into threats made to people involved in the trial of four men accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, the U.S. law enforcement agency said on Wednesday.
The FBI's Detroit office is working with law enforcement agencies across the country to identify the source of the threats made in connection with the high-profile trial taking place in a federal court in Grand Rapids, it said in a statement. 
""We do not anticipate there being any impact on the ongoing prosecution,"" the office said. ""We will continue to work with the district court's security personnel and law enforcement agencies in & around Grand Rapids to ensure that anyone participating in that proceeding is safe.""
The FBI would not elaborate about when and how the threats were made but said agents raided a home on Friday in Hazel Park outside of Detroit as part of their investigation. The Detroit News reported that the threats were made against Chief U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker, who is presiding over the trial, and defense lawyers Josh Blanchard and Christopher Gibbons. 
Adam Fox, Brandon Caserta, Barry Croft Jr. and Daniel Harris are being tried on charges of conspiring to kidnap the Democratic governor in 2020 over her COVID-19 mandates. The prosecution rested its case on Wednesday in the trial, which began three weeks ago. 

The defendants' attorneys have argued in court that their clients only engaged in idle talk and never conspired to abduct the governor. 
A total of 13 men, some of whom prosecutors said were associated with an anti-government militia group known as Wolverine Watchmen, were arrested in October 2020 and charged with state or federal crimes in the alleged kidnapping conspiracy. Seven of them are facing charges in state court.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan 55% of Americans support sending more U.S. troops to Washington's NATO allies in central and eastern Europe in response to Russia's five-week old invasion of Ukraine, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll completed on Tuesday.
President Joe Biden has deployed thousands of additional troops to Europe to support North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies concerned by Moscow's war on its smaller neighbor. 
Biden has made clear no U.S. troops will be sent to Ukraine though Washington is supplying Kyiv with weapons and has aggressively sanctioned Russia's economy, including a ban on U.S. imports of Russian oil.
Some 61% of Democrats and 54% of Republicans back further troop deployments to NATO countries, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted on Monday and Tuesday.
On Tuesday, the Pentagon announced a new tranche of U.S. troops and military hardware bound for NATO allies, including 10 F-18 jets and more than 200 personnel heading to eastern Europe, including Lithuania.
There are currently more than 100,000 U.S. troops in Europe, up from the roughly 80,000 before Russian troops moved into Ukraine.
The poll also showed 61% of Americans feel U.S. sanctions on Russia are worth the price of higher fuel costs - even after gasoline prices surged at the onset of the war. 
That was almost unchanged from a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted a month earlier, though gasoline prices have surged by nearly 20% since then to $4.24 per gallon, according to automobile club AAA.
Some 47% of Americans approve of how Biden has handled the Ukraine crisis, well above the Democratic leader's 39% rating on the economy, the poll showed.

Biden's overall popularity has sunk to the lowest levels of his presidency in recent weeks, a warning sign that his Democratic party could lose its razor-thin majorities in the U.S. Congress in the Nov. 8 midterm elections.
The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States, gathering responses from 1,005 adults. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 4 percentage points.

The port city of Mariupol, which had a prewar population of more than 400,000, is a key target for Russia in its apparent attempt to create a land bridge between the Crimean peninsula, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014, and pro-Russian separatist regions in eastern Ukraine.
Denis Pushilin, head of the self-styled Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), said on Russian television that ""about 140,000 left Mariupol ... Both towards the DPR and towards Russia"", Interfax reported.
There was no way to verify Pushilin's statement. Ukraine has previously accused Moscow of forcing Mariupol residents into Russian-backed rebel territory and Russia against their will.
Russian President Vladimir Putin recognised the DPR and the adjacent Luhansk People's Republic as independent states three days before he sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Moscow says one of the aims of its military campaign is to ""liberate"" largely Russian-speaking places such as Mariupol from the threat of genocide by what it calls Ukrainian nationalists and Nazis. 
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy - himself a native Russian speaker - has rejected those claims, saying they are just a pretext for Russia's invasion. 

The mayor's office estimated on Monday that nearly 5,000 people had been killed in Mariupol since the start of the siege and that about 170,000 people remained trapped amid ruins without food, heat, power or running water after 290,000 left.

(Reuters) - Maryland lawmakers have passed a bill to increase and protect abortion access in the state, a proactive move as the U.S. Supreme Court weighs whether to overturn or weaken constitutional abortion rights this spring. 
The state's General Assembly on Tuesday approved a bill that eliminates a restriction that only physicians can provide abortions. The legislation would allow any ""qualified provider,"" such as nurse practitioners or physician assistants, to perform abortions. 
The bill also requires most insurance plans to cover the cost of abortions. It establishes an abortion care clinical training program to ensure ""that there are enough health professionals to provide abortion care,"" and mandates $3.5 million in state funding annually beginning in fiscal year 2024. 
The bill heads to Governor Larry Hogan, a Republican, for consideration. If enacted, the law would take effect on July 1.
Hogan's office stated ""The governor will consider the legislation when it reaches his desk."" In the past, he has had a hands-off approach to abortion rights legislation, allowing a related 2017 law to pass without his signature.
""Both chambers of the Maryland General Assembly have boldly declared that abortion is health care, health care is a human right, and that our rights mean nothing without access,"" Planned Parenthood of Maryland said in a statement after the bill passed. 
Republican state Senator Justin Ready on Tuesday called the bill ""radical"" and criticized its goal of adding more abortion providers.
""I think we need to have a different approach to life in our state, even in the varying ways that we may feel about life beginning,"" he said. 
Maryland's is one of several Democrat-led legislatures - including Colorado, Vermont, California - that has sought to codify abortion rights protections this year. 
Lawmakers anticipate that the Supreme Court could soon overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 precedent that established the right to terminate a pregnancy before the fetus is viable, which is around 23 or 24 weeks. The conservative-leaning court has signaled its willingness to uphold a Mississippi law banning abortion after 15 weeks.
Republican-led states, meantime, are rapidly passing anti-abortion laws with the expectation that the court's ruling would open the door for stricter abortion measures. More than 500 abortion restrictions have been introduced in 41 states so far in 2022, according to the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights advocacy group.

ALEXANDRIA, Va. (Reuters) - A former British national accused of engaging in ""brutal hostage-taking"" as an alleged member of an Islamic State cell nicknamed ""the Beatles"" appeared in a U.S. federal court on Wednesday for the start of his criminal trial.
El Shafee Elsheikh, 33, is standing trial in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, just outside Washington, on charges including lethal hostage-taking and conspiracy to commit murder.
U.S. authorities have said Elsheikh was one of four ISIS militants belonging to the cell, which operated in Iraq and Syria, and whose member were nicknamed ""the Beatles"" for their British accents. 
The cell garnered international attention after releasing videos of the murders of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig, among other victims, in 2012 through 2015.
In a brief opening statement at Elsheikh's trial, his defense lawyer, Edward MacMahon, told jurors that he would not minimize the violence hostages endured but rather cast doubt on Elsheikh's legal responsibility for those acts.
""It was horrific and senseless. None of that is in dispute,"" MacMahon said. ""What is in dispute — and what you must decide — is whether Mr. Elsheikh bears any legal responsibility.""
U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis will oversee the trial, which is expected to last three or four weeks and will include testimony from released hostages.
In his opening statement to jurors, prosecutor John Gibbs said Elsheikh ""played a role in a brutal hostage-taking scheme"" that included gruesome acts of torture.
""We do not intend to display the most graphic evidence publicly,"" Gibbs said, adding that jurors would be able to view beheading videos and other horrific photographic evidence during their deliberations.
MacMahon said during his remarks that the ""Beatles"" all shared similar British accents and characteristics, and discrepancies in the testimony of released hostages means Elsheikh cannot be conclusively identified as a member of the terrorist cell.
Elsheikh and another member of the cell, Alexanda Kotey, were held in Iraq by the U.S. military before being flown to the United States to face trial. 
Mohammed Emwazi, a British citizen who oversaw the executions, died in a drone strike in 2015. Aine Lesley Davis, the group's fourth member, was convicted in Turkey on terrorism charges and jailed.
Kotey pleaded guilty in September 2021 to the murders of Foley, Kassig, Sotloff, and Mueller. He will be sentenced next month.

Kotey and Elsheikh were citizens of the United Kingdom, but the British government withdrew their citizenship.
The charges against Elsheikh carry a potential death sentence, but U.S. prosecutors have advised British officials that they will not seek the death penalty against Elsheikh or Kotey.

389,"<span>Mar 30, 2022 12:31PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - A California task force on reparations recommends limiting any government payments to Black people whose ancestors were in the United States in the 19th century, rather than giving money to all Black people.
After a lengthy debate, the panel in the most populous U.S. state voted 5-4 on Tuesday evening to narrow the qualification for receiving compensation if the state were to create a reparation payment program in the future, local media reported. 
The panel is charged with issuing recommendations on possible reparations to California's legislature by June 2023. It began meeting monthly in June 2021, a year after legislation authorized it to study the issue. 
Before the vote, Rev. Amos Brown, president of the San Francisco branch of the NAACP and vice chair of the task force, told fellow members they must set an eligibility definition that reflects political realities in the United States. 
""Please, please, please I beg us tonight, take the first step,"" he said. ""We’ve got to give emergency treatment to where it is needed.""
The conversation around reparations for Black Americans has gained traction in the wake of a national reckoning on racial inequity that followed the police killings of George Floyd and other Black Americans in recent years. 
The practicality of implementation has been a matter of debate. Some question whether taxpayers can afford to pay reparations while others question how jurisdictions should determine eligibility for such programs - whether by race, ancestry or evidence of discrimination. 
The California task force has yet to determine how potential recipients of reparations would be required to prove their ancestry. 
Last March, the Chicago suburb of Evanston created the first reparation program in the United States. Its program offers reparation money to Black residents whose families suffered lasting damage from decades of discriminatory practices. 

In January, a committee approved the first 16 applicants to receive $25,000 in the city's reparations housing program. The applicants can use the money for home repairs, down payments or mortgage payments. 
Other cities, including Chicago; Providence, Rhode Island; and Burlington, Vermont, have also created committees to look at reparations.

ALMATY (Reuters) -A U.S. astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts safely landed in Kazakhstan on Wednesday after leaving the International Space Station aboard the same capsule despite heightened antagonism between Moscow and Washington over the conflict in Ukraine.
The flight -- carrying NASA's Mark Vande Hei and Russians Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov back to Earth -- had been closely watched to determine whether escalating strife had spilled over into longtime cooperation in space between the two former Cold War adversaries.
Russian space agency Roscosmos broadcast footage of the landing from the Kazakh steppe and said a group of technical and medical specialists had been dispatched to help the astronauts out of the capsule.
""The crew is feeling good after landing, according to rescuers,"" Roscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin wrote on Telegram messenger.
Vande Hei, who had completed his second ISS mission, logged a U.S. space-endurance record of 355 consecutive days in orbit, surpassing the previous 340-day record set by astronaut Scott Kelly in 2016, according to NASA.
Vande Hei, 55, smiled and waved as rescuers removed him from the capsule and medics checked his vital signs.
""Mark's mission is not only record-breaking, but also paving the way for future human explorers on the Moon, Mars, and beyond,"" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement.
The all-time record for the longest single stay in space was set by Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov, who spent more than 14 months aboard the Mir space station, returning to Earth in 1995. 
It was the first space flight for Dubrov, 40, who was launched to the ISS with Vande Hei last April from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
Shkaplerov, 50, who was ending his rotation as the latest ISS commander, is a veteran of four missions to the orbital outpost, accumulating 708 total days in space, far exceeding Vande Hei's 523-day career tally, according to NASA. Shkaplerov began his latest space station stint last October.
SPACE RELATIONS TESTED
Announcing U.S. economic sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin's government on Feb. 24, U.S. President Joe Biden ordered high-tech export restrictions against Russia that he said were designed to ""degrade"" its aerospace industry, including its space program. 
Rogozin of Roscosmos had then lashed out in a series of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) posts suggesting the U.S. sanctions could ""destroy"" ISS teamwork and lead to the space station falling out of orbit.
The following week, state-run Russian news agency RIA Novosti posted a video spoof depicting cosmonauts waving farewell to Vande Hei before Russia's ISS module detaches from the space station and flies away without him to the applause of Russian officials at mission control, leaving the rest of the station sinking lower in orbit.
The clip, described by RIA Novosti as ""comic,"" plays out to the Russian-language love ballad ""Goodbye,"" by Russian vocalist Lev Leshchenko. 
At about the same time, Rogozin announced that Russia would stop supplying or servicing Russian-made rocket engines used by two U.S. aerospace NASA suppliers, suggesting U.S. astronauts could use ""broomsticks"" to get to orbit.
NASA, for its part, has said that U.S. and Russian ISS crew members were well aware of events on Earth but were working professionally together without tension.
The three returning ISS crew were replaced on the space station by three cosmonauts who flew to orbit on March 18, joining the three remaining U.S. colleagues of Vande Hei and a German astronaut from the European Space Agency.

Russia's space agency dismissed Western media reports suggesting the newly arrived Russian cosmonauts had chosen to wear yellow flight suits with blue trim - the colors of Ukraine's national flag - in support of Ukraine. They were greeted warmly, with hugs and handshakes.
""Sometimes yellow is just yellow,"" Roscosmos's press service said on its Telegram channel.

LONDON (Reuters) - Russia and Ukraine are talking about a peace deal while their soldiers kill each other, but there has been no breakthrough and they remain far apart on the question of territory.
President Vladimir Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Moscow had to defend against the persecution of Russian-speaking people by Ukraine.
Ukraine says it is fighting against an imperial-style land grab and that Putin's claims of genocide are nonsense.
WHAT ARE THE MAIN ISSUES?
1) Territory: This is the toughest part of the talks. Neither side has compromised or shown any sign of an intention to. One option being discussed is to simply to try to park the issue - in other words, agreed ambiguity for years to come.
Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and on Feb. 21 recognised two Russian-backed rebel regions of east Ukraine as independent states.
Since their invasion, Russian forces have taken control of a swathe of territory across Ukraine's southern flank north of Crimea, territory around the rebel regions and territory to the east and west of Kyiv.
Russia has at least another 170,000 square km of territory - an area about the size of Tunisia or the U.S. state of North Dakota - under its control. 
Ukraine has said it will never recognise Russia's control over Crimea, the independence of the Russian-backed rebel regions or the vast additional territory taken by Russia.
Kyiv has repeatedly demanded the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory - including Crimea. Ukrainian officials say they will not accept annexation of territory or recognise the Russian-backed rebel regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. 
Recognition of what amounts to effective Russian sovereignty over up to a third of its territory would be difficult for any Ukrainian leader. 
For Moscow, Ukrainian recognition of Russian control of Crimea, the rebel regions and probably the swathe of land north of Crimea which gives it a land bridge to Crimea and control over drinking water supplies for the peninsula, would be essential.
The territory along the southern flank of Ukraine is of particular interest to Russia as it was added to Russia in 1783 by Russian Empress Catherine the Great after the defeat of the Ottoman Empire.
One option is to effectively park the question of Crimea by agreeing to a 15-year consultation period on the status of annexed Crimea. Ukrainian nationalists, though, might see that as a partition in all but name. 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Crimea was part of Russia so there would be no discussions about its fate. 
Some analysts are sceptical despite optimistic statements after talks in Istanbul on Tuesday.
""Moscow will not agree anything with Kyiv unless it is a full capitulation (and that is not what is being talked about),"" said Tatiana Stanovaya, a non-resident scholar at the Carnegie Moscow Center. 
2) Neutrality: Ukraine agrees to be neutral which it did in 1990 in any case. 
Ukraine has proposed in writing that it become a neutral country in return for security guarantees from the United States, United Kingdom, Turkey, France and Germany. 
Such a decision would require a referendum and Kyiv has said that security guarantees could only be given once Russia withdraws troops. 
After talks in Turkey, Russia agreed to scale down military operations around Kyiv. 
Russia's Medinsky said Ukraine had expressed a willingness to agree to Moscow's key demands - give up its NATO alliance ambitions, adopt ""non-bloc"" status, renounce any attempt to acquire nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction and commit not to host foreign troops or military bases.
""If these obligations are met, then the threat of creating a NATO bridgehead on Ukrainian territory will be eliminated,"" he said.
Russia would then not oppose Ukraine - the parts still under Kyiv's control - from joining the European Union, according to the Ukrainian proposal. 
The devil, though, will be in the detail and the chronology. As the Soviet Union crumbled, Ukraine's parliament in its 1990 Declaration of State Sovereignty proclaimed its intention to be a permanently neutral state.
Putin said in February that he wanted written guarantees Ukraine would never join the NATO military bloc. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine would not join NATO soon because members would not accept Ukraine. 
Russia has also repeatedly raised concerns about Ukraine developing nuclear weapons. In the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, the United States, Russia and the United Kingdom gave Ukraine security assurances in exchange for Kyiv's adherence to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. 
3) Russian rights: The status of Russian language and Russian-speaking people in Ukraine is an issue for Moscow. A law passed by Ukraine in 2019 granted special status to the Ukrainian language and made it mandatory for public sector workers.
4) ""De-Nazification"": Putin says Ukraine has allowed Nazi-like groups to commit ""genocide"" against Russian-speaking communities. 
The Azov Battalion, part of Ukraine's national guard, has been accused by Moscow of being a Nazi organisation which has terrorised Russian civilians and carried out war crimes. 
Formed in 2014 from volunteers who fought against Russian-backed rebel regions, its founders have expressed extreme right-wing white supremacist and anti-Semitic views. The Azov Battalion did not reply to a request for comment. 
Ukrainian presidential aides have repeatedly mentioned the role of Azov in the defence of the port city of Mariupol where it is based. 
Ukraine dismisses such claims of genocide against Russian speakers. Zelenskiy says it is Russia that is behaving like the Nazis by visiting destruction on Ukrainian cities. 
WHO IS TALKING AND HOW?
Talks on trying to find an end to the conflict began on Feb. 28, four days after Putin ordered troops into Ukraine. Some talks have been in person at the Belarusian border or in Belarus and Turkey, while others have taken place via video conference.
The Russian team is led by presidential adviser Medinsky, a Russian who was born in Soviet Ukraine but who casts modern Ukraine as a ""historical phantom"" because ""the so-called history of Ukraine is not simply inextricably linked to the thousand year history of Rus/Russia/U.S.S.R. but it is Russian history itself"".
He said on Wednesday that Ukraine had expressed a willingness to agree to Russia's demands. Ukraine's negotiating team is Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov and presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak.

PUTIN AND ZELENSKIY?
A meeting between Putin and Zelenskiy would indicate a real chance of peace as Russia has repeatedly said there will be no meeting until the details of a deal have been largely agreed.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli security forces were on high alert on Wednesday after a Palestinian gunman killed five people in a Tel Aviv suburb, the latest in a string of fatal attacks that has stoked fears of wider escalation ahead of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan.
Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said Israel was facing a ""new wave of terrorism"" and called a security cabinet meeting, as police beefed up their presence in Israeli cities.
The shootings on Tuesday in Bnei Brak, a Jewish ultra-Orthodox city, raised to 11 the number of people killed by Arab attackers in Israel over the past week.
It was the sharpest spike in attacks on city streets in years, raising again for Israelis a familiar sense of insecurity. 
Police said the gunman was a Palestinian from Ya'bad, a town in the occupied West Bank. He was shot dead by police during the shooting spree. 
Witnesses said he had walked methodically through residential neighbourhoods in Bnei Brak, where he killed a policeman, two Israeli civilians and two Ukrainian nationals who were veteran workers in Israel.
An assailant who carried out a stabbing and car ramming attack in the Israeli city of Beersheba on March 22 and two gunmen in an assault in the city of Hadera on Sunday were Arab citizens of Israel. Israeli authorities said those assailants, who were killed during the attacks, were loyal to Islamic State.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the shootings in Bnei Brak, which was not claimed by any armed group, though residents in Ya'bad linked the assailant to the leader's Fatah party. 
The Israeli military said it had boosted its deployment in the West Bank and troops were seen patrolling through Ya'bad. Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said Israeli security forces were at their highest level of alert since a Gaza war last May.

Israeli officials had warned about a potential surge in assaults in the run-up in April to the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, a period during which violence has surged in the past.
Nightly Ramadan clashes last year between Palestinians and Israeli police in East Jerusalem, captured by Israel along with the West Bank in a 1967 war, helped ignite violence between Israel and Gaza militants that led to the 11-day war in May.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan's King Abdullah called for calm following a historic summit with Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Wednesday after the sharpest spike in street violence in years stoked fears of a wider escalation ahead of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan.
Abdullah told Herzog after receiving him in the Husseiniya Palace in the first official visit by an Israeli head of state that peace was more pressing now to end a conflict that he said had ""lasted too long"".
A palace statement said the king condemned ""violence in all its forms"" including the latest attack on Tuesday in which an Arab gunman killed at least five people in a Tel Aviv suburb.
""This conflict has lasted for very long and the violence it is has resulted in continues to cause much pain and creates a fertile soil for extremism,"" the monarch was quoted as saying in the statement.
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including Israel's nearly 55-year-old occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, has long weighed on relations between Israel and Jordan, who have been peace partners since 1994.
An Israeli statement said Abdullah offered Herzog his condolences to the victims' families amid fears in both countries of a surge in assaults in the run-up in April to the holy month of Ramadan.
""I always say, the fact that Muslim leaders are meeting together Jewish leaders and Israeli leaders is an alternative to the abyss of hatred and bloodshed,"" Herzog was quoted as saying in a statement.
“As we enter these holy days... we must move towards enabling everyone to practice their beliefs in safety, in security, in calm circumstances. This is what we need to work towards,"" Herzog added.
Israeli security forces were on high alert on Wednesday after the Tel Aviv shooting, the latest in a string of fatal attacks in the past week -- the sharpest spike in attacks on city streets in years.
Both countries have engaged in a flurry of top-level diplomatic and security talks in recent days to reduce tensions that Jordan fears could spiral with repercussions in a kingdom where many of its citizens are of Palestinian origin.
Anti-Israeli sentiment runs high in Jordan.
Last year, clashes erupted between Israeli police and Palestinians around Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque at the height of the Ramadan fasting month. The violence helped ignite an 11-day war in May between Gaza militants and Israel. 
In his meeting with Herzog, Abdullah urged Israel to allow freedom of prayer to Muslim worshippers, an official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. The king also asked that Israeli police stop provocations by Jewish worshippers in the Al Aqsa mosque compound.

Citing security concerns, Israel has imposed age limits on Muslim worshippers at Al-Aqsa during periods of tension and restricted Palestinian travel to Jerusalem from the West Bank, territory that it captured, along with the eastern part of the holy city, in a 1967 war.
Jerusalem is a particularly sensitive issue for Jordan's royal Hashemite family, which has custodianship of Muslim and Christian holy sites in the eastern part of the city, an area controlled by Jordanian forces from 1949 to 1967.

LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Two senior British judges, including the president of the UK Supreme Court, resigned from Hong Kong's highest court on Wednesday because of a sweeping national security law imposed by China cracking down on dissent in the former British colony.
Robert Reed, who heads Britain's top judicial body, said that he and colleague Patrick Hodge would relinquish their roles with immediate effect as non-permanent judges on the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal (CFA). 
""I have concluded, in agreement with the government, that the judges of the Supreme Court cannot continue to sit in Hong Kong without appearing to endorse an administration which has departed from values of political freedom, and freedom of expression,"" Reed said in a statement.
Britain, which handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, has said the security law that punishes offences like subversion with up to life imprisonment has been used to curb dissent and freedoms. London also says the law is a breach of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration that paved the way for the handover.
Many of the city's democratic campaigners have been arrested, detained or forced into exile, civil society groups shuttered and liberal media outlets forced to close under a security crackdown since the law was enacted in June 2020. 
Beijing says the law has brought stability to Hong Kong, rocked by months of sometimes violent anti-government street protests in 2019, and that it includes human rights safeguards.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam expressed ""regret and disappointment"" over the move.
Lam said in a statement that foreign judges had made a valuable contribution to Hong Kong for 25 years but ""we must vehemently refute any unfounded allegations that the judges' resignations have anything to do with...the national security law"".
Hong Kong Chief Justice Andrew Cheung said in a statement that he noted with ""regret"" the resignations of Reed and Hodge, saying the judiciary was committed to the rule of law.
PRESSURE ON OTHER FOREIGN JUDGES
British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Hong Kong had witnessed ""a systematic erosion of liberty and democracy"".
""The situation has reached a tipping point where it is no longer tenable for British judges to sit on Hong Kong's leading court, and (this) would risk legitimising oppression,"" she added.
Truss this month criticised Hong Kong authorities for accusing a British-based human rights groups of colluding with foreign forces in a ""likely"" violation of the security law.
In a report on Hong Kong last December, she said that while judicial independence was increasingly finely balanced, she believed British judges could still ""play a positive role in supporting this judicial independence"". 
The presence of foreign judges in Hong Kong is enshrined in the Basic Law, the mini-constitution that guarantees the global financial hub's freedoms and extensive autonomy under Chinese rule, including the continuation of Hong Kong’s common law traditions forged during the colonial era.
Reed has previously said he would not serve on the HKCFA in the event the judiciary in the city was undermined.
Local lawyers said the resignations would likely put pressure on the 10 other foreign Court of Final Appeal judges to quit. Six of these are British. 
Those judges, also from Canada and Australia, are mostly retired senior jurists in their home countries, unlike Reed and Hodge, who were still serving.
Two other foreign judges, Britain's Brenda Hale and Australia's James Spigelman, have also stepped down from the city's highest court since 2020. 

""It is a big blow to the local fraternity and the grand tradition of Hong Kong's rule of law,"" one veteran barrister told Reuters. ""For all the pressures ahead, we really needed them and I fear what comes next."" 
In a statement on Wednesday, Hong Kong Law Society president Chan Chak Ming urged Reed and Hodge to reconsider their moves, expressing ""deep regret"" and saying that the decision ""disappointingly falls short"" of the support among the public and legal community for the continued role of overseas judges.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hackers who crippled tens of thousands of satellite modems in Ukraine and across Europe are still trying to hobble U.S. telecommunications company Viasat as it works to bring its users back online, a company official told Reuters. 
Viasat Inc has been working to recover after a cyberattack remotely disabled satellite modems just as Russian forces pushed into Ukraine in the early hours of Feb. 24. The official said a parallel attack was launched at almost exactly the same time and used ""high volumes of focused, malicious traffic"" to try and overwhelm Viasat's network and was still ongoing. 
""We're still witnessing some deliberate attempts,"" the official said Tuesday. He said that Viasat was so far resisting the hackers with defensive measures but that ""we've been seeing repeated attempts by this attacker to alter that pattern to test those new mitigations and defenses.""
The official - who spoke on the condition that he not be identified - briefed Reuters ahead of a report being published early Wednesday which outlines how the hackers systematically sabotaged satellite modems across Europe - and in Ukraine in particular - on the morning of Russia's invasion.
The exact effect of the outage on Ukraine still is not clear, but the disruptive hack triggered ""a really huge loss in communications"" at the outset of the conflict, Ukrainian cybersecurity official Victor Zhora told reporters during a briefing on March 15.
Few other details have been released since. On Friday, the Washington Post said https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/03/24/russian-military-behind-hack-satellite-communication-devices-ukraine-wars-outset-us-officials-say that U.S. analysts believed that the hackers were working for Russia's military intelligence agency.
The report did not identify the hackers and the Viasat official said the company would not be commenting on who might be responsible. 
The Russian Embassy in Washington has not responded to repeated attempts to seek comment about the hack.
Viasat's report said that the intruders took advantage of a misconfigured virtual private networking device to gain remote access to the management network for the company's KA-SAT satellite, which is run by an Italy-based company called Skylogic and serves customers across Europe. 
Skylogic did not immediately return a message late Tuesday.
The report said that it was from inside the network that the hackers sent rogue commands to tens of thousands of modems all at once, overwriting key chunks of data in the device's memory and rendering them inoperable.

The report said the disruptive hack began about 6:15 a.m. Ukraine time on Feb. 24 and would eventually cripple a majority of Viasat's modems in Ukraine. The parallel attack using malicious traffic began about an hour earlier.
The company declined to provide a global figure of stricken devices but the report said that nearly 30,000 fresh modems had already been shipped to distributors to bring customers back online.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Heavy rains deluged Australia's east coast on Wednesday, submerging entire towns, while thousands of people fled their homes for the second time within weeks after fast-moving flood waters burst river banks and broke over levees. 
Several towns in northern New South Wales, already reeling after record floods over a month ago, were pounded by an intense low-pressure system overnight. Some regions took a month's rainfall in under six hours, officials said. 
""Unfortunately overnight, our worst fears have been realised with significant heavy rainfall across already saturated landscapes,"" New South Wales Emergency Services Minister Stephanie Cooke said during a media briefing.
The main street in Byron Bay, a popular tourist destination about 750 km (465 miles) north of Sydney, was inundated with several shops under water, television footage showed. One family was seen wading out through knee-deep water, one woman with a child on the hip and other members carrying suitcases filled with belongings. 
""Oh, it's devastating,"" Annick Nuylle, a Byron Bay store owner said. ""I've put many years and a lot of love and hard work, so no matter if there is or there is no insurance, I think it's my livelihood and it has been my life for 17 years, so it's very sad.""
Dean Prosser, another resident of Byron Bay, said he has never seen so much rain in the more than 50 years he has lived in the town. ""We just had too much water fall out of the sky,"" he told broadcaster ABC. 
A total of 14 evacuation orders and eight warnings are in place along the northern New South Wales coast stretching across a distance of around 500 kms (311 miles).
In the northern New South Wales city of Lismore, among the worst impacted by record floods earlier in March, water levels in the city's Wilsons river breached the levee height of 10.65 metres. Lismore, home to nearly 30,000 people, received around 400 mm (16 inches) of rain over a 24-hour period up to Wednesday morning, data showed.
There was no official warning that the levee had been breached after sirens malfunctioned, local media reported. 
""Everything is falling apart in Lismore at the moment ... second time in a month,"" Mayor Steve Krieg told Nine Network. Footage in social media showed stranded vehicles, including a caravan, floating on flooded streets. 
Police said they were currently searching for a woman believed to be missing in floodwaters near Lismore since Tuesday night after reports her vehicle became stuck. So far, two people have died in the recent weather event. 

The weather bureau forecast ""bands of very localised heavier rainfall"" to drop within a few hours on Wednesday, potentially leading to life-threatening flash floods with up to 200 mm predicted to pummel many regions.
Australia's east coast summer has been dominated by the La Nina climate pattern, typically associated with greater rainfall, for the second straight year with rivers already at capacity after torrential rains. Sydney has already recorded 537 mm (21.1 inches) so far this month - its wettest March on record.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba's communist government is seeking to rally support for a new family code that would open the door to gay marriage and boost women's rights, but experts and a recent survey suggest an upcoming referendum vote may not provide a rubber stamp.
Tepid support for the reforms, which clash with the island's entrenched ""machista"" culture, threatens to hand state-backed supporters a defeat amid a government push to encourage open and frank debate.
The proposed 100-page code, under scrutiny in town-hall style meetings throughout Cuba, groups together a swath of new regulations on family conduct. It overhauls several 1975 laws from the era of former Cuban President Fidel Castro.
Castro in 2010 acknowledged the persecution of gays on the island, who were rounded up shortly after his 1959 revolution and placed in forced labor camps. Castro took personal responsibility and called it a ""great injustice.""
The new code would legalize same sex marriage and civil unions, allow such couples to adopt children, double down on women's rights, and promote equal sharing of domestic responsibilities. It also adds such novelties as prenuptial agreements and assisted pregnancy.
Parents would have ""responsibility"" instead of ""custody"" of children, and be required to be ""respectful of the dignity and physical and mental integrity of children and adolescents.""
The code repeatedly states parents and courts should grant maturing offspring more say over their lives.
But the outcome of the referendum vote, slated for sometime this fall, is far from certain.
The Cuban Roman Catholic Church has lashed out against gay marriage, saying the proposal is riddled with ""gender ideology"" that threatens parental authority and would lead to ""indoctrination of children in schools without parental consent.""
The Communist Party daily, Granma, reported in mid-March on a high level meeting where organizers said that with more than half of the scheduled meetings through April already complete, just 54% of participants had expressed support for the new code.
Referendums in Cuba typically pass by overwhelming majorities, but this one may face an uphill battle as the vote nears, three experts consulted by Reuters said.
Bert Hoffman, a Latin America expert at the German Institute of Global and Area Studies, said the code was perhaps the most progressive in Latin America on gender and generational rights. But the text was largely compiled by state authorities, rather than being a grassroots movement, Hoffman added.
""All elections, all referendums, have been under the guidance of the Communist Party or Fidel Castro's leadership, and the outcome was always a given, and now for the first time the outcome is uncertain,"" Hoffman said.
Proponents argue that the 46,000 neighborhood meetings held on the issue so far constitute a model of democratic process.
""People have the possibility of raising their doubts or concerns,"" said Rafael Ortega, who attended a night-time meeting earlier this year in the Havana neighborhood of Diez de Octobre. ""I consider this to be a very democratic thing.""
The code reflects the growing clout of women on the island, where they are increasingly represented in political leadership, experts said.
Females already head nearly half of Cuban households, according to government statistics, and make up more than 60% of Cuban professionals.

Codifying those changes would be ""revolutionary,"" said Mariela Castro, daughter of former Cuban leader Raul Castro, adding she was convinced Cubans would approve the reforms.
""Anything new always brings with it uncertainty,"" the long-time social activist said.

    Lam's comments come amid a backlash from businesses and residents who see the rest of the world shifting to living with the virus while Hong Kong officially sticks to a dynamic-zero COVID-19 strategy to curb all outbreaks as soon as they occur.
   Lam said no one valued the international status of Hong Kong more than she, but the government had to adopt anti-pandemic measures to protect residents.
    ""These measures have certain influence on corporates and individuals, although we don't have a figure. … It's an unarguable fact that we have a brain drain and some senior management of some corporates have left Hong Kong,"" she told a daily news briefing on Wednesday.
""The most important thing is Hong Kong keeps its advantages. I believe after the pandemic, Hong Kong can have a better development.""
    Lam said ""streamlining"" certain measures, including lifting a ban on flights from nine countries and reducing quarantine for arrivals from abroad, would help ease concerns about the city's international status.
    Her remarks come just weeks before the city's May 8 election to choose its leader for the next five years, but Lam declined to say if she would run again.
Hong Kong adopted at the start of the year its most draconian measures since the pandemic began more than two years ago, frustrating many residents who had been largely compliant with curbs in hopes of resuming travel.
    Its border has effectively been shut since 2020, with few flights landing and transit allowed to hardly any passengers, isolating a city that had built a reputation as a global hub for finance and travel.
But behind its public adherence to China's dynamic-zero policy, Hong Kong has begun to shift to mitigating the effects of outbreaks it can no longer prevent.
    The rules, together with mixed messages by the government on issues such as a citywide lockdown and mass testing, spurred an exodus of residents in the past two months. 
Health authorities reported 6,981 new infections on Wednesday, continuing a steady decline from a record high of more than 58,000 on March 9. 

    The former British colony's tally of infections exceeds 1.1 million with more than 7,600 deaths, most in the past five weeks.
Densely populated Hong Kong has registered the most deaths per million people globally in recent weeks.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese drone maker DJI has dismissed as ""utterly false"" accusations that it is leaking data on Ukrainian military positions to Russia, after a German retailer cited such information as a reason for taking its products off shelves.
The rejection followed Friday's Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) revelation of the removal by German electronics and home appliances giant MediaMarkt in response to ""information from various sources"", although it gave no details of the information it had.
MediaMarkt said, ""In the last few days, we have received more and more information from various sources that the Russian army is using products and data from the Chinese drone supplier DJI for military activities in Ukraine."" 
On Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Chinese firm said, ""What we have declared as 'utterly false' in our statement published yesterday is the claim that DJI is actively supporting the Russian military with hardware and flight data.""
While the company had noticed footage online that suggested the Russian military was using its products, the spokesperson added, it had not been able to confirm this and had no control over the use of its products.
In its Twitter statement on Saturday, DJI had said, ""We do not support any use that does harm to people's lives, rights and interests,"" adding, ""DJI promotes civilian drone applications that benefit society."" 
MediaMarkt, which runs more than 800 stores in 12 European nations and Turkey, did not say what information it had received about DJI.
""As a responsible company, we have taken immediate action and removed the manufacturer from our product range groupwide until further notice,"" it said on its official Twitter account on Friday.
MediaMarkt was replying to a user who accused DJI of leaking GPS data of Ukrainian military positions to Russia.
""We will closely examine further indications and developments,"" it added.
It called the move ""a clear signal for the values that have the highest priority for us"", which it saw come under attack by Russia's ""aggressive"" war against Ukraine.
Users of the Chinese drone giant's products range from photography hobbyists to U.S. fire departments.
The firm has found itself in an uncomfortable position after Russia invaded Ukraine more than a month ago in what Moscow calls a ""special military operation"".
While Western firms have pulled out of Russia in protest, DJI has stayed on, like many Chinese companies, taking a cue from Beijing's stance of refraining from criticism of Moscow over the invasion.
Ukrainian officials and citizens have accused DJI of leaking data on the Ukrainian military to Russia.

On March 16, Mykhailo Fedorov, the minister of digital transformation, said he had asked the firm's founder, Frank Wang, in a letter to cut ties with Russia, accusing its troops of using DJI products for the navigation of missiles that kill Ukrainian civilians. 
The next day, DJI responded on Twitter that its products, designed for civilian use, were inappropriate for military missions.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's military has said North Korea's largest missile test yet used an older, smaller intercontinental ballistic missile, and not the massive new Hwasong-17 ICBM, in part to try to head off negative domestic reaction to a failed launch.
South Korean and U.S. officials have concluded that the March 24 launch appears to have been a Hwasong-15 ICBM, a defence ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Washington has not yet publicly weighed in, with Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) telling reporters on Tuesday that the test was still being analysed.
North Korea fist test-fired the Hwasong-15 in Nov. 2017, before imposing a moratorium on ICBM testing that ended with last week's launch.
Open-source analysts noted discrepancies in video and photos released by North Korean state media after that launch, saying shadows, weather, and other factors suggested it was from an earlier test, possibly a failed launch on March 16.
“The choice of the Hwasong-15, which is more reliable with the successful test in 2017, could be intended to block rumours and ensure regime stability by delivering a message of success within the shortest time possible, after residents of Pyongyang witnessed the failure of the March 16 liftoff,” the defence ministry said in a report provided to parliament and obtained by Reuters. 
The test could additionally have been aimed at boosting its status as a military powerhouse and improving bargaining power against South Korea, the United States and the international community, the report concluded.
U.S. and South Korean officials had said that tests on Feb. 27 and March 5 involved the Hwasong-17 system, likely in preparation for a full-range launch. North Korea never acknowledged the March 16 launch or its reported failure.
Debris from that failed test rained down over Pyongyang, Ha Tae-keung, a South Korean lawmaker briefed by the military told reporters on Tuesday.
That failure prompted North Korea to tell a “big lie” and say the March 24 Hwasong-15 launch was a Hwasong-17 to avoid negative domestic public opinion, Ha said.
Thursday's missile flew for 67.5 minutes to a range of 1,090 km (681 miles) and a maximum altitude of 6,248.5 km (3,905 miles) state media reported. Those numbers are similar to data reported by Japan and South Korea and are further and longer than the first Hwasong-15 test, which flew for 53 minutes to an altitude of about 4,475 km and range of 950 km.
Thursday's missile's characteristics, such as ascending acceleration, combustion, and stage separation times were similar to those of Hwasong-15 even thought the flight flew farther and reached higher altitudes, the report said.
South Korean officials had suggested North Korea may have modified a Hwasong-15 or launched it without a significant test payload to increase its range.
Analysts say the March 16 explosion may have been caused by a problem in the engines. The ministry report noted that the Hwasong-17 requires a more sophisticated cluster of four Paektusan-class engines compared with the Hwasong-15's two, and that eight days between launches was not enough to analyse the cause of the failure.

""If March 16 was a Hwasong-17 failure and March 24 was a Hwasong-15, it obviously shows the Hwasong-17 still has teething problems,"" said Vann Van Diepen, a former U.S. government official involved in weapons of mass destruction and nonproliferation.
A second successful test of the Hwasong-15 would have confirmed its reliability, but if its improved performance was only because of reduced payload, then the significance would be limited, he said.

LUKYANIVKA, Ukraine (Reuters) - The burnt wreckage of two Russian tanks with blown off turrets and several armoured personnel carriers attest the ferocity of last week's clashes in Lukyanivka village just outside Kyiv. The charred corpse of a Russian soldier lies in a field nearby.
""There were mortars so strong that it was scary even in the cellar,"" local resident Valeriy Hudym told Reuters on Sunday, two days after Ukrainian soldiers seized back control of Lukyanivka in a five-hour battle with the Russians.
""Tanks were firing, artillery, and machine guns. Everything possible was there,"" Hudym said. Two Ukrainian soldiers, involved in the battle to retake the village, said the fighting was intense.
More than a month since Russia's invasion, the defence of Ukraine's capital Kyiv has played out in heavy clashes in places like Lukyanivka and the nearby town of Brovary to the east, Irpin and Bucha to the northwest and Makariv to the west.
When the histories are written such towns and villages may be minor details, but they are where the Russian advance has been halted, sometimes by small, mobile Ukrainian units wielding anti-tank weapons shipped in from abroad.
Moscow promised at peace talks in Istanbul on Tuesday that it would drastically scale back operations around Kyiv to help the dialogue.
In Lukyanivka, two hours' drive from the centre of Kyiv, residents recall warning Russian troops who had occupied their settlement to leave while they could.
""I have a neighbour called Svitlana. She told them openly to their face: 'Guys, go home. You will be killed here',"" Hudym said. Reuters was unable to independently confirm this.
The reversal in Lukyanivka has been repeated in areas around the northern half of the capital, as Ukrainian troops claw back territory lost in the first month of fighting in small battles, without scoring a decisive victory.
The Russian defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the military situation around Kyiv.
But the small victories have dealt a psychological blow to a more powerful enemy and shown how nimble units with knowledge of the area can defend lines and even push them back, according to military experts.
They also serve strategic goals - to keep Russian artillery further from the city centre and prevent the invading army from fully encircling Kyiv, the experts said.
Cities including Kharkiv and Mariupol have suffered heavy bombardment as Russian ground advances stalled - part of what the Pentagon and other Western military officials describe as a sign of Russian frustration at the lack of progress.
Kyiv has also been struck by shells and missiles, and at least 264 civilians have been killed according to city authorities. But the scale of devastation, particularly to the city centre, is far smaller, according to witnesses.
Russia describes its actions in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" with the aim of demilitarising its neighbour. It has denied targeting civilians.
In Lukyanivka, Reuters saw Ukrainian soldiers driving away two apparently serviceable Russian heavy tanks captured during the fighting.
""We knocked out the Russians. The Russians are now being moved a few kilometres away,"" said Marat Saifulin, from the Ukrainian ""Brotherhood battalion"" that took part in recapturing the village in an attack that lasted from noon until dusk.
SETBACKS AND RESISTANCE
CIA Director William Burns said in early March that the intention of Russian President Vladimir Putin was to seize Kyiv within two days of the start of the invasion on Feb. 24.
Putin and Russian officials have consistently said that Russia's military operation in Ukraine has gone according to plan.
However, two early setbacks suggested it would not be plain sailing for an available Russian force estimated by some diplomats before the war at around 190,000 troops. Russia has not given a figure for its deployment in Ukraine.
Russian paratroopers attacked Hostomel airport, a potential bridgehead northwest of Kyiv, on the first day of the invasion. But heavy fighting there slowed the Russian advance toward the capital, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Satellite imagery also captured a huge column of military hardware stretching 40 miles (64 km) and coming from a similar direction.
Seen by some Western defence officials as a major threat to Kyiv in the first days of the war, by March 10 it had largely dispersed, with some vehicles spreading into surrounding towns.
A senior U.S. defence official said in early March that Russia's advance on Kyiv, including the convoy, appeared to be stalling because of logistical problems including shortage of food and fuel, as well as low morale among some units.
Attacks by small units of Ukrainian troops on advancing tank columns, in some cases using shoulder-held anti-tank weapons such as the U.S.-made Javelin system, were also a factor in bogging down Russia's military machine.
To the east, in Brovary, a convoy of Russian tanks was repelled after several were destroyed in an ambush captured in dramatic drone footage released by pro-Ukrainian forces.
To the north in Bucha, near Irpin, the town's mayor filmed scenes of burnt out tanks and armoured vehicles still smouldering after coming under fierce attack.
In Irpin, Ukrainian forces destroyed a large bridge linking northwestern towns to Kyiv as a way of stalling the enemy's progress. On Monday, Irpin's mayor said Ukraine was back in full control. Reuters could not immediately verify his claim.
The result of the flexible defensive strategy and Russian shortcomings has been no major advances on Kyiv for several days.
In the city, where only half the peacetime population of 3.4 million remains, there have been signs of normal life returning to the streets, with some shops, restaurants and cinemas opening and people enjoying the spring sunshine in parks.
Hopes that the immediate threat to the capital may be receding were fuelled last week by the head of the Russian General Staff's Main Operational Directorate.
He said that the first phase of the operation in Ukraine had largely been completed and that Russian forces would henceforth concentrate on the Donbass region in the east.
That appeared to chime with Western intelligence assessments that Russian forces had abandoned, at least for the moment, their active attempt to take Kyiv following heavy losses and unexpectedly stubborn Ukrainian defences.
PAYING PENSIONS, POOR MORALE
On many roads leading out of Kyiv, wrecked houses and debris show the price paid by those who decided to stay. Gas and electricity is often cut and there is no certainty about when and where the next missile might fall.
In Krasylivka village, 92-year-old Hanna Yevdokimova said the invasion was her third conflict after the Soviet-Finnish Winter War of 1939-1940 and World War Two, when she saw German troops march through the village.
Last week, her home was hit by missile wreckage. A twisted fragment of a Russian Kalibr missile lay 100 metres (328 ft) away in a neighbour's garden.
""What can I do? All I want is to rebuild so that I can die in my own home,"" she said.
Some residents of Lukyanivka said they spent nearly a month under Russian occupation as virtual prisoners in their own homes, their mobile phones confiscated and movement only permitted under armed escort.
Now they can come and go as they please amid badly damaged houses.
Near Makariv west of Kyiv, which is still contested, heavy shelling could be heard last week. Even so, the town's mayor Vadym Tokar travelled through surrounding villages wearing military fatigues and handing out pensions to the elderly.
Farmer Vasyl Chaylo, from Peremoha, described what he said were fearful Russian conscripts, short on rations and disciplined by tougher professional fighters.
""They are afraid. According to my observation, some of them perhaps do not want to fight and want to surrender, but they are kept in line by special forces,"" he said.
Chaylo added that he had asked tank crews who set up outside his house how long their dry rations would last and been told a week. ""They came to us on the eighth day and said that they had nothing to eat.""
Russia's defence ministry has acknowledged some conscripts have taken part in the conflict, after earlier denials by the Kremlin and military authorities. The ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment about rations.
Halyna Shybka, a former nurse in a military hospital in Kyiv for 25 years, ignored the entreaties of her grandchildren and remains with her husband Mykola in the house in Kalynivka, near the frontlines of Brovary, where they have lived in since 1974.

""They tried to persuade us in every way they could to leave with them, but I wanted to stay,"" she said, pouring cups of tea in her small kitchen, the sound of outgoing Ukrainian artillery fire rumbling in the background.
    ""This is our land, we're not going to leave.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's deputy national security adviser for economics, Daleep Singh, will travel to New Delhi and meet government officials to discuss Russia's war against Ukraine and develop an economic framework for the Indo-Pacific, the White House said on Tuesday.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is also planning to visit India, one of the biggest buyers of Russian commodities. New Delhi has called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine but has refused to explicitly condemn Moscow's actions. India has also abstained from voting on multiple U.N. resolutions on the war.
""Singh will consult closely with counterparts on the consequences of Russia's unjustified war against Ukraine and mitigating its impact on the global economy,"" the White House said in a statement.
Last week, Biden said only India among the Quad group of countries was ""somewhat shaky"" in acting against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.
The South Asian nation has tried to balance its ties with Russia and the West but unlike other members of the Quad countries - United States, Japan, Australia - it has not imposed sanctions on Russia.
""In response to his aggression, we have presented a united front throughout the NATO and in the Pacific,"" Biden told a business forum last week, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""The Quad - with the possible exception of India being somewhat shaky on some of these - but Japan has been extremely strong, so is Australia in terms of dealing with Putin's aggression,"" he said.
Russia promised on Tuesday to scale down military operations around Ukraine's capital and north, while Kyiv proposed adopting neutral status, in confidence-building steps that were the first signs of progress toward negotiating peace.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. officials are preparing for the possibility of thousands of more migrants per day attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border without authorization, a pace that could shatter last year's record-breaking levels, as the Biden administration weighs lifting a COVID-era order currently blocking most asylum seekers.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is readying for as many as 18,000 migrants per day in the coming weeks, but also preparing for a smaller increase to 12,000 arrivals per day or arrivals similar to current levels, an agency official said during a Tuesday call with reporters, requesting anonymity to discuss internal matters. 
The official did not provide the current number of migrant encounters at the border each day. As of mid-March, around 5,000 migrants were arriving per day on average, two separate U.S. government sources told Reuters at the time. 
Another DHS official on the same call said it remained unclear whether lifting the COVID-era order would increase migration, but preparations were underway anyway.
U.S. health officials face a deadline this week to renew, modify or terminate the so-called Title 42 COVID-19 health order. The order was implemented in March 2020 by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during the administration of former Republican President Donald Trump to limit the spread of the virus. U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, has so far kept it in place.
Under Title 42, U.S. border agents can ""expel"" migrants to Mexico within hours or rapidly send them to other countries without the opportunity to seek asylum in the United States.
Health experts, immigrant rights advocates and leading Democrats argue the policy unlawfully cuts off access to asylum and puts migrants in danger in Mexico, and that scientific evidence does not support its stated goal of helping to curb the spread of the virus. They have chastised Biden for keeping it in place despite promises to roll back Trump's most restrictive immigration policies.
Republicans across the country have made rising illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border a major attack line heading into the Nov. 8 congressional election, where Democrats risk losing control of Congress, stymieing Biden's legislative agenda.
Reuters reported earlier this month that Biden officials were leaning toward ending the order after court decisions complicated its usage and U.S. health officials moved to loosen pandemic restrictions nationwide more broadly. DHS said on Monday that it had started giving COVID-19 vaccines to migrants in custody at the border.
The Biden administration has said the decision to lift the order lies with CDC, which declined to comment. 
INCREASED FEDERAL STAFFING
DHS officials told congressional offices earlier this month that tens of thousands of migrants who are already near the border could arrive within hours of Title 42 being lifted and more than 1 million in southern Mexico and other countries could come within weeks, according to an aide briefed on the matter.
DHS did not respond to a request for comment on those estimates.
The planning effort involves building additional temporary holding facilities along the border, some of which will be ready for use by early April, one of the DHS officials said on Tuesday's call. DHS is also working to add more staffing and transportation, in an effort that involves multiple federal agencies that work with immigrants, the person said.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), an emergency agency that usually responds to floods, storms and other major disasters, is assisting with the planning effort, although the administration has not formally issued a disaster declaration.

DHS is working on a system that would allow migrants seeking asylum to register electronically and schedule a time to approach a legal port of entry as part of a ""more orderly process,"" one of the DHS officials said.
Some asylum seekers have been stranded in Mexico for months waiting for the restrictions to be lifted. Reuters interviewed five LGBTQ asylum seekers from Jamaica stuck in Tijuana, Mexico in recent weeks, some of whom said they had resorted to prostitution because they could not work legally and faced discrimination in Mexico.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Thousands of civilians may have died in the besieged port city of Mariupol in southern Ukraine since bombing began four weeks ago, the head of the U.N. human rights mission told Reuters on Tuesday, providing its first estimate.
Nearly 5,000 people, including about 210 children, have been killed in Mariupol since Russian forces laid siege to it a month ago, a spokesperson for Mayor Vadym Boichenko said on Monday.
His office said 90% of Mariupol's buildings had been damaged and 40% destroyed, including hospitals, schools, kindergartens and factories.
""We do think that there could be thousands of deaths, of civilian casualties, in Mariupol,"" Matilda Bogner, head of the U.N. human rights mission in Ukraine which deploys some 60 monitors, said in a virtual interview.
She said the mission did not have a precise estimate but was working to gather more information. 
Local officials, citing witness accounts, last week estimated that 300 people were killed in the March 16 bombing of a Mariupol theatre where people were sheltering.
As of Tuesday, the U.N. human rights office had confirmed 1,179 civilians killed and 1,860 injured across Ukraine in the five-week old conflict, amid reporting delays due to the hostilities, a statement said.
Last week Bogner told a briefing that U.N. monitors had received more information about mass graves in Mariupol, including one that appeared to hold 200 bodies.
""On the mass graves, actually we've decided now we should be calling it 'improvised graves',"" Bogner said on Tuesday.
This was because the term ""mass graves"" may imply victims of a crime, whereas people who have perished in Mariupol reflect deaths from a range of causes, she said.
Civilian casualties from the conflict were believed to be a ""fairly small portion"" of bodies in the improvised graves in parks and gardens, she said. 
Some people who died naturally were never taken to morgues or individual tombs due to the hostilities, while others never reached doctors, she added.

It was not clear if any military casualties are buried in the improvised graves, she said.
Robert Mardini, director-general of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), told Reuters in a separate interview on Tuesday that it had ""no first-hand information"" on casualties from the Mariupol theatre bombing.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon on Tuesday clarified that U.S. troops in Poland were ""liaising"" with Ukrainian forces as they hand over weapons to them, but were not training ""in the classic sense"" following remarks from President Joe Biden on the matter.
On Monday, Biden told reporters that while in Poland last week, he had been talking to U.S. troops who were helping ""train"" Ukrainian forces in Poland. 
Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) told reporters that U.S. troops in Poland were ""liaising"" with Ukrainian forces when weapons are handed over to the forces fighting back against Russia's invasion. 
""It's not training in the classic sense that many people think of training. I would just say it's liaising,"" Kirby said.
He did not provide details on what exactly the interactions entail or how long they usually lasted. It was not immediately clear whether the distinction between liaising and training had greater significance, as the United States tries to limit any direct military involvement in the war.
The United States and countries from around Europe have largely limited their military support to intelligence sharing and heavy supplies of weaponry to Ukrainian forces, including anti-aircraft and anti-tank systems. 
The United States withdrew its military trainers of Ukrainian forces from western Ukraine before Russia's invasion, and the training site where they had previously operated near the Ukrainian city of Lviv was subsequently bombed by Russian air-launched cruise missiles earlier this month.
Kirby added that additional aircraft, including 10 F-18 jets, and more than 200 personnel would be headed to eastern Europe, including Lithuania.
This marks the latest tranche of additional U.S. troops that have been deployed to the region after Russia's invasion of Ukraine more than a month ago. 
There are currently more than 100,000 U.S. troops in Europe, up from the roughly 80,000 before Russian troops moved into Ukraine. 
Moscow promised on Tuesday to scale back its military operations near the Ukrainian cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv and Ukraine proposed a neutral status with international security guarantees while maintaining its territory.
The Russian pledge was met by widespread skepticism in the West.
""Has there been some movement by some Russian units away from Kyiv in the last day or so? Yes, we think so. Small numbers,"" Kirby said.

He said that it did not mean that the threat to Kyiv was over and the troops moving away from Kyiv would likely be used in other parts of Ukraine. 
""Russia has failed in its objective of capturing Kyiv. It has failed in its objective of subjugating Ukraine,"" he added.

ISTANBUL/KYIV OUTSKIRTS/MARIUPOL, Ukraine (Reuters) - Russia promised on Tuesday to scale down military operations around Kyiv and another city but the United States warned the threat was not over as Ukraine proposed adopting a neutral status in a sign of progress at face-to-face negotiations.
Talks took place in an Istanbul palace more than a month into the largest attack on a European nation since World War Two that has killed or injured thousands, forced nearly 4 million to flee abroad and pummelled Russia's economy with sanctions.
Russia's invasion has been halted on most fronts by stiff resistance from Ukrainian forces who have recaptured territory even as civilians are trapped in besieged cities.
""A decision was made to radically, by a large margin, reduce military activity in the Kyiv and Chernihiv directions,"" Russian Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin told reporters on Tuesday.
He made no mention of other areas that have seen heavy fighting, including around Mariupol in the southeast, Sumy and Kharkiv in the east and Kherson and Mykolaiv in the south.
Russia has started moving very small numbers of troops away from positions around Kyiv in a move that is more of a repositioning than a retreat or a withdrawal from the war, the Pentagon said on Tuesday.
""It does not mean that the threat to Kyiv is over,"" spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) told a news briefing.
A total of 10 U.S. F-18 aircraft and more than 200 troops are being deployed to NATO member and Russian neighbour, Lithuania, and U.S. troops in Poland are ""liaising"" with Ukrainian forces as they hand over weapons to them, he added.
Russia calls its assault a ""special operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" Ukraine. The West says it launched an unprovoked invasion.
Some analysts noted that Russia's promise to reduce fighting mostly covered areas where it has been losing ground. 
""Does 'we'll drastically reduce military operations around Kyiv' = 'we’re getting our ass kicked, transitioned to a hasty defense?'"" tweeted Mark Hertling, a retired U.S. lieutenant general and former commander of U.S. forces in Europe.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said only a concrete result from the talks can be trusted.
""We can say the signals we are receiving from the talks are positive but they do not drown out the explosions of Russian shells,"" he said. 
PROPOSALS
Ukrainian negotiators said that under their proposals, Kyiv would agree not to join alliances or host bases of foreign troops, but would have security guaranteed in terms similar to ""Article 5"", the collective defence clause of the transatlantic NATO military alliance.
They named Israel and NATO members Canada, Poland and Turkey as countries that may give such guarantees. Russia, the United States, Britain, Germany and Italy could also be involved.
The proposals, which would require a referendum in Ukraine, mentioned a 15-year consultation period on the status of Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014. 
The fate of the southeastern Donbas region, which Russia demands Ukraine cede to separatists, would be discussed by the Ukrainian and Russian leaders.
Kyiv's proposals also included one that Moscow would not oppose Ukraine joining the European Union, Russia's lead negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said. Russia has previously opposed Ukrainian membership of the EU and especially of NATO.
Medinsky said Russia's delegation would study and present the proposals to President Vladimir Putin.
To prepare a peace agreement, Medinsky later told the TASS news agency, ""we still have a long way to go"".
U.S. President Joe Biden spoke by phone about Ukraine with the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy.
A source familiar with the situation told Reuters the allies discussed more financial aid of up to $500 million for Ukraine.
SCAVENGING
On the ground, reports of attacks continued.
A shell hit a temporary Russian military camp near the border with Ukraine late on Tuesday, Tass news agency said and cited a source as saying preliminary data showed it had been fired from the Ukrainian side.
Tass issued the report shortly after a senior local official reported a series of explosions outside the city of Belgorod, close to the border with Ukraine. Reuters could not immediately verify the details.
In Mariupol, besieged for weeks by Russian forces, thousands of civilians may have died, the head of the United Nations human rights mission in the country told Reuters on Tuesday, providing its first estimate of the toll.
Those who remain there are suffering. 
""We are eight people. We have two buckets of potatoes, one bucket of onions,"" said Irina, an engineer, in her apartment where windows had been blasted out. Her group boiled soup on a makeshift stove in the stairwell.
Elsewhere, however, Ukrainian forces have made advances, recapturing territory from Russian troops on the outskirts of Kyiv, in the northeast and in the south.
One recaptured area on a road towards the village of Rusaniv was littered with burnt-out tanks and bits of Russian uniforms. Surrounding houses were destroyed.
In the southern city of Mykolaiv, a missile blasted a hole through the main administrative building. Authorities said at least 12 people were killed and 33 injured.

The Moscow-backed self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic in eastern Ukraine may consider joining Russia once it controls all of Ukraine's Donetsk region, its leader was quoted as saying. Kyiv has said any such move would have no legal basis. 
Several European Union countries on Tuesday expelled dozens of Russian diplomats, some for alleged spying, in what the Irish prime minister said was a coordinated move. Russia vowed retaliation.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) -Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, who is sanctioned by the West over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, made a surprise appearance in Istanbul on Tuesday at the first direct peace talks in weeks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators. 
The two teams sat facing each other at a long table in the presidential office on an Ottoman palace grounds. The Russian oligarch sat in the front row of observers wearing a blue suit, a Turkish presidential video showed. 
In the most tangible sign yet of progress towards ending the war, Russia emerged from the talks promising to scale down military operations around Kyiv and the country's north, and Ukraine proposed adopting a neutral status. 
For Abramovich, signals have emerged since the war began that he has sought to encourage negotiations, and he has travelled to Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and Israel in March. Two of his superyachts are docked at Turkish resorts. 
His presence initially baffled at least one Ukrainian diplomat, while Moscow said he was not formally negotiating but rather there as a go-between and had approval from the Ukrainian side.
A spokesman for Abramovich did not respond to a request for comment. Abramovich showed no signs of a reported suspected poisoning early this month. 
The Wall Street Journal and investigative outlet Bellingcat, citing people familiar with the matter, said Abramovich and Ukrainian negotiators suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning after a meeting in Kyiv.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the poisoning reports as untrue and part of an ""information war"". 
NATO member Turkey shares a maritime border with Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea, has good ties with both and has offered to mediate the conflict. While calling Moscow's invasion unacceptable, Ankara has also opposed the Western sanctions. 
In a speech ahead of the talks by the Bosphorus strait, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told the delegations the time had come for concrete results and that progress would pave the way for a meeting of the countries' two leaders. 
""It is up to the sides to stop this tragedy. Achieving a ceasefire and peace as soon as possible is to the benefit of everyone,"" he said. 
Footage released by Kyiv showed Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov being warmly greeted by his Turkish counterpart ahead of the talks at the Dolmabahce palace grounds. 
Reznikov, who was not wearing a face mask, joked with Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar that Ukraine had scrapped COVID-19 precautions when Russia invaded.
Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Putin called it a ""special military operation"" to demilitarize Ukraine. Ukraine and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war of aggression.
SUPERYACHTS IN TURKEY
Commenting on Abramovich's presence, Ukrainian ambassador to Britain Vadym Prystaiko told the BBC: ""I have no idea what Mr Abramovich is claiming or doing. He is not a part of the negotiation team.""
Peskov told reporters on a conference call Abramovich was not an official member of the Russian delegation at the talks, but acknowledged his presence there to ""enable certain contacts"" between sides.
The Kremlin has said he played an early role in talks but the process was now up to negotiating teams. TV video showed he sat next to Erdogan's spokesman and adjusted his headphones to listen to the president's speech. 
The West has imposed heavy sanctions on Abramovich and other Russian billionaires, Russian companies and officials, in a bid to force Putin to withdraw from Ukraine.
Abramovich had sought to sell his English soccer club Chelsea, a process that was taken out of his hands by the British government when it blacklisted him. 

Superyachts linked to him, together worth an estimated $1.2 billion, have been docked at Bodrum and Marmaris in southwest Turkey since last week. Sources have said he and other wealthy Russians were looking to invest in Turkey given sanctions elsewhere.
Its potential as a safe haven for Russian investment raises risks for Turkey's government, banks and businesses that could face penalties if the United States and others pressure Moscow with broader ""secondary"" sanctions.

411,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 12:04PM ET</span>","LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukraine proposed adopting neutral status in exchange for security guarantees at talks with Russia in Turkey, meaning it would not join military alliances or host military bases, Ukrainian negotiators said on Tuesday. 
The proposals would also include a 15-year consultation period on the status of annexed Crimea and could come into force only in the event of a complete ceasefire, the negotiators told reporters in Istanbul.
The proposals are the most detailed and concrete that Ukraine has aired publicly. They also envisage security guarantees along the lines of the NATO military alliance's Article 5, its collective defence clause. Poland, Israel, Turkey and Canada could among the potential security guarantors. 
""If we manage to consolidate these key provisions, and for us this is the most fundamental, then Ukraine will be in a position to actually fix its current status as a non-bloc and non-nuclear state in the form of permanent neutrality,"" said negotiator Oleksander Chaly.
""We will not host foreign military bases on our territory, as well as deploy military contingents on our territory, and we will not enter into military-political alliances,"" he said, in comments broadcast on Ukrainian national television.
""Military exercises on our territory will take place with the consent of the guarantor countries."" 

There was enough material in the current Ukrainian proposals to warrant a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Ukrainian negotiators said, adding they were awaiting Russia's response.
Ukrainian and Russian negotiators met in Turkey on Tuesday for the first face-to-face talks in nearly three weeks, with Ukraine seeking a ceasefire without compromising on territory or sovereignty as its forces have pushed Russians back from Kyiv.

RABAT (Reuters) -U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet the de facto ruler of the United Arab Emirates in Morocco on Tuesday in a bid to ease disagreements with Washington's traditional Gulf allies over oil, Iran and the Ukraine crisis. 
The meeting with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan will be his most important during a regional trip that unusually for a secretary of state did not include any stops in Gulf monarchies or talks with Saudi officials. 
Blinken said on Tuesday his meeting with Sheikh Mohammed would be an opportunity to have a ""truly strategic"" conversation. 
Washington's Arab allies chafe at what they see as declining U.S. commitment to security in their region in the face of Iranian involvement in Yemen, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon which has nudged them into common cause with former arch-foe Israel. 
Blinken over the weekend attended a summit between Israel and Arab countries with which it has agreed peace, including the UAE and Morocco, but he has not met any senior Saudis. 
Though the United States is focused long-term on the strategic challenge of growing Chinese influence, and its attention now is on the Ukraine crisis, very high crude prices have underscored the continued relevance of Gulf oil producers.
Blinken is expected to stress the importance of both the UAE and Saudi Arabia in his talks with Sheikh Mohammed, discussing Iran, Yemen, global energy markets and the UAE's rapprochement with Syria, U.S. officials said. 
In return, he is seeking to overcome Gulf resistance to a U.S. request to raise oil output to tame rampant crude prices that have aggravated high inflation rates globally. 
""The United States is a very important partner for all of us and we are very proud of the relationship. I think what we need is pragmatism. We need to look at the objective of the energy and what we're asking for is not to tell us 'do this' or 'do that',"" said UAE Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei on Tuesday. 
UKRAINE ASSISTANCE
Washington wants its Arab allies to take a stronger stance against Russia over its assault on Ukraine by voting with the United States in the United Nations, joining Western sanctions or even sending security assistance to Ukraine. 
The UAE abstained in a U.N. Security Council vote on Ukraine last month and Morocco did not show up for a general assembly vote. The UAE and Saudi Arabia both have increasingly important energy ties with Russia. 
""Energy is coming back as a major component of many of the Middle East and, indeed, world discussions. What people thought was the death of fossil fuels is, I think, a little bit premature,"" senior Emirati official Anwar Gargash said on Tuesday. 
Gulf states have for years been frustrated at what they see as U.S. inaction in confronting Iran's role in the region, but their concerns have grown since Joe Biden became president 14 months ago. 
They are worried about the impact of a potential new nuclear deal with Iran and annoyed that Washington has ended its support for their war in Yemen, put new conditions on weapons sales to Gulf states and criticised their human rights records. 
    Blinken is expected to reassure Sheikh Mohammed of Washington's commitment to stopping Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon amid a series of missile attacks by the Tehran-backed Houthi group in Yemen.

Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE, concerned that Washington's push for a deal over Iran's nuclear programme will not tackle its development of missiles or the role of its regional proxies, have moved to engage with Tehran directly. 
""We need to turn the page... reaching out to various friends, of course, but adversaries also,"" said Gargash, who was speaking at the World Government Summit in Dubai.

Bolsonaro was hospitalized in Brasilia late on Monday after feeling abdominal ""discomfort"", according to Communications Minister Fabio Faria.
Faria said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) early on Tuesday the president was ""super well"" after leaving the hospital.
Bolsonaro has kept his Tuesday's agenda unchanged and traveled to the city of Ponta Pora on the border between Brazil and Paraguay, where he is expected to attend an event later this morning, his aides said.
This was the second time Bolsonaro has been hospitalized this year. In January, the president was on vacation in the southern state of Santa Catarina when he was urgently taken to hospital in Sao Paulo with an intestinal obstruction.

The blockage, the latest complication he has experienced since a 2018 stabbing during a campaign rally, was cleared after a few days and no surgery was needed.
Far-right Bolsonaro, who has undergone six surgeries since the stabbing, is set to seek re-election in an October voting. He currently trails former leftist president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in opinion polls.

LONDON (Reuters) -British police said on Tuesday that 20 fines would be issued over gatherings in Boris Johnson's offices and residence that broke coronavirus lockdown rules, sparking fresh opposition calls for the prime minister to resign.
Police are investigating 12 gatherings held at Downing Street and the Cabinet Office in 2020 and 2021 after an internal inquiry said Johnson's staff enjoyed alcohol-fuelled parties, with the British leader attending some of the events himself.
The police action confirmed for the first time that unprecedented regulations to protect the nation from COVID-19 were broken by officials at the heart of the government that designed them. 
The issue threatened Johnson's position earlier this year, when members of his own party began calling for him to quit and public trust in his leadership plummeted - although the focus on Ukraine has relieved some of the immediate pressure on him. 
Revelations of the gatherings, many of which took place when people could not attend funerals or say farewell to loved ones dying in hospital due to lockdown rules, were first reported in late 2021.
At that time, Johnson said all the rules were followed, though he later apologised to parliament for attending one event, which he said he thought was work related, and then to Queen Elizabeth for another at which staff partied on the eve of her husband's funeral.
Recipients of the fines will not be identified but Downing Street has previously said it will say if the prime minister receives one. Johnson's office said he had not been notified that he was one of the 20 subject to fines. 
Police said further fines were still possible.
POLL RATINGS
""We will today initially begin to refer 20 fixed penalty notices to be issued for breaches of COVID-19 regulations,"" the Metropolitan Police said in a statement. 
Fixed penalty notices are issued to people deemed to have broken COVID-19 rules - as well as for some motoring offences and anti-social behaviour. The penalty for participating in a gathering of more than 15 people is an 800 pound ($1,050) fine. 
The police statement immediately reignited opposition anger.
""Boris Johnson’s Downing Street has been found guilty of breaking the law,"" said Angela Rayner, deputy leader of the Labour Party. 
""The culture is set from the very top. The buck stops with the prime minister, who spent months lying to the British public, which is why he has got to go."" 
Johnson's office said that once police had concluded their investigation, the full findings of an internal inquiry would be released, and the prime minister will make a further statement. 
""The prime minister has apologised to the house (parliament)already. He has said sorry for the things we did not get right, he has said sorry for the way that things have been handled and that mistakes have been made,"" the spokesman said. 
Polls show his ratings have improved from their lowest point. 
""They've come from being incredibly bad to merely mediocre,"" Anthony Wells, head of European Political and Social Research at YouGov told Reuters.

YouGov data showed 30% of respondents thought Johnson was doing well, up from 22% in January, but below their average over the last two years and far off a peak of 66% seen in April 2020.

LVIV (Reuters) -Nina spent her 16th birthday in a Lviv state shelter for children last week, far from her family and friends in the east of Ukraine, after she fled advancing Russian forces early in the war.
One of 23 children evacuated from another childcare centre in Lysychansk, a town more than 1,000 km (620 miles) away near the eastern frontlines, Nina says she misses her friends there and does not know when she will see them again.
""They always came to visit. We've been through so many things together,"" said Nina, who ran away from home in February last year when her mother started drinking and bringing men to the house after her father died. 
At first, Nina went to live with a friend, but her school found out and she was placed in Ukraine's extensive childcare system last year. Ukraine has the biggest number of children living in state care in Europe, mostly because their families are either too poor or broken to look after them.
Nina has no desire to go back to live with her mother - and doesn't think her mother wants her at home - but the war has left her stranded and alone in a distant town.
Lviv shelter director Svitlana Havryliuk and her staff say they are doing their best to look after Nina and the other children, aged between 3 and 18, under their watch.
But Ukraine's vast state childcare programme, a legacy of the government's prominent role in society during Soviet times, is struggling as war forces thousands to flee their homes and often makes tracing relatives impossible.
Before Russia's invasion, Ukraine had 100,000 children living in nearly 700 state shelters, boarding schools and baby homes, according to U.N. children's agency Unicef. 
The latest data, shared with Reuters by the ministry for social policy, showed that as of March 25 around 6,500 of these children had been evacuated to safer areas in the country or abroad since the beginning of the war.
Some 47,300 - or almost half of the children in the system - have been hurriedly returned to their parents or legal guardians, which caregivers and child psychologists say raises its own challenges. 
""The children come from places where there's fighting,"" Havryliuk told Reuters. ""I don't know how it works during a war ... How will their parents be found? Who knows if they are alive? What if there is an emergency?""
No one at the Lviv shelter seems to know what happened to the parents of 5-year-old Nastya and her two brothers, aged 3-1/2 and 7, who, like Nina, were whisked away from Lysychansk on Feb. 24, the day the war broke out.
Olga Tronova, the caregiver who brought them to Lviv in the far west of the country, said the only thing she knew was that they were taken away from their alcoholic mother late last year and no relative has tried to make contact with them since.
In the background, Nastya, wearing a pink coat with a pink and white bonnet, played in the sand in the garden playground outside. Her brothers climbed up and down a nearby slide.
TOUGH CHOICES
Some of the children in Ukraine's network of shelters are orphans, but more often they have been taken from families struggling with drug addiction, alcoholism and domestic abuse. Around half of them have physical or mental disabilities.
The sheer number of children in need, and Ukraine's relatively short wait time for adoptions, made the country a popular destination for adoptive families in the West.
According to U.S. government figures, for example, Ukraine was the top European country of origin for adoptions by U.S. parents over the past 15 years.
The system has long been questioned by child welfare organisations including Unicef and Save the Children, which have argued that whenever possible the priority should be to support families before they reach breaking point.
Now the war has caused further upheaval for tens of thousands of children in state care.
The ministry for social policy said 230 state homes - a third of the total - had been evacuated as of March 25, and care givers face tough choices over whether to reunite children with parents or guardians if it gets them further from the war zone.
Child psychologist Oleksii Heliukh, who is helping the young residents of the Lviv shelter, said sending children back home without proper vetting could do more harm than good.
""When children are taken from their families, it happens for a reason. If their needs were not met in peaceful times, then things can get worse during a war."" 
But Volodymyr Lys, regional head for child protection under the ministry of social policy in Lviv, said that wartime danger meant authorities often had little choice.
""The biggest risk is being killed by a bomb, trust me...It is clear that no matter who the parents are, they are still parents.""
CHILDREN TRAVELLING ALONE
Fighting has also separated families where children had been living with their parents, and aid agencies have warned that significant numbers of unaccompanied children have crossed into neighbouring countries and beyond.
""We've had reports of children travelling alone ending up in Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany,"" said Amanda Brydon, a child protection expert at Save the Children, which has been working in Ukraine since 2014.
These may be children on their way to reach relatives or friends in Europe, she said. People smuggling is a big concern.
""What we don't have is a systematic registration and tracking system of these children,"" she said. ""It's been quite a chaotic system to try and track.""
Lys, the regional head for child protection, said the situation had improved since the first few weeks of war thanks to the help of international aid agencies inside and outside Ukraine.
With documents and records lost or destroyed, and 1.8 million children estimated by Unicef to have fled the country so far, the Kyiv government has tightened border checks and suspended adoptions, already disrupted by the COVID-19 emergency.
Aid agencies welcomed the move. 
Brydon at Save the Children said they had been ""inundated"" with calls from would-be adoptive families keen to help, but warned of the risk of legal standards being ignored and children being separated from parents who are still alive.
For the 47 children of the Lviv shelter and those in other state institutions, that could mean having to wait out the war.
Tronova, the caregiver who was working in a state centre for children in Lysychansk when the war broke out, remembers vividly the phone call she got at dawn on Feb. 24. 
""Olga, now! You need to pull the children out,"" she recalls the shelter principal telling her, before hearing an explosion in the distance. She rushed to fetch the children, leaving her own family behind.
In the three days that it took to get to Lviv by train, the smallest ones fell sick. ""When they arrived here, they all had nausea, they vomited, they had fever,"" said Havryliuk.
Since then, she and the other caregivers, helped by university students-turned-volunteers, have tried to restore a sense of normality and calm.
The children are well fed and sleep in neat dormitories with flowers, trees and animals painted on blue and green walls.
Neighbours who before the war would barely say hello have showered the shelter with food, clothes and toys. On one of the days Reuters visited, a Polish charity sent stuffed teddy bears from France with the word ""Courage"" written on them.
But even in the relative tranquility of Lviv, which has been largely spared heavy bombardment and combat but where nights are punctuated by anti-raid alarms, the war is never far away.
""The children are sleeping, then the siren goes off and they start to scream,"" Havryliuk said.
All but two of the 23 children who arrived from Lysychansk are still legally in their parents' custody. In normal times, courts would decide whether to strip families of their parental rights.

One child with psychiatric problems, 11-year old Timofey, was two days away from being placed into foster care, but that fell apart as he, too, was evacuated to Lviv.
""He is very angry,"" Tronova said. ""I cannot predict anything for my future or the children's. The only thing I can say is that we are at God's mercy.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A Singapore court rejected on Tuesday an appeal against the execution of a Malaysian convicted of drugs smuggling, dismissing an argument put forward by his legal team that he should be spared because he was mentally impaired.
Nagaenthran Dharmalingam, 34, has been on death row for more than a decade for trafficking 42.7 grammes (1.5 oz) of heroin into Singapore, which has some of the world's toughest narcotics laws.
His plight has attracted international attention with a group of United Nations experts and British billionaire Richard Branson joining Malaysia's prime minister and human rights activists to urge Singapore to commute his death sentence. 
Dharmalingam's lawyer Violet Netto had previously sought an independent psychiatric review for her client after objecting to presenting his prison medical records, citing confidentiality.
But turning down a request for an independent review, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon said on Tuesday it had been unreasonable not to share the medical records and there was no admissible evidence showing any decline in his mental condition.
""The appellant has been afforded due process under law, and it is not open to him to challenge the outcome of that process when he has put nothing forward to suggest that he does have a case to be considered,"" the five-judge panel said in its ruling.
Dharmalingam, who was wearing a purple prison uniform, did not appear to show any reaction to the ruling.
His sister condemned the court's decision.
""We can't accept it, it's an unfair judgment for my brother. This is a heartless punishment,"" Sarmila Dharmalingam told Reuters.
Rights groups also called for Dharmalingam's life to be spared. 
""The Singaporean government must act now to stop a grave travesty of justice from taking place and end its inhumane, shameful strategy of using the death penalty to address drug-related problems,"" Amnesty International said.
Anti-death penalty group Reprieve said it believed Dharmalingam  is intellectually disabled and should be protected from the death penalty.
The Singapore government says the death penalty is a major deterrent against drug trafficking and that the majority of its citizens support capital punishment. 
Dharmalingam has now exhausted his legal avenues in Singapore to escape the death penalty and a petition to the country's president for clemency had been denied.
Clemency for death row inmates is rare in Singapore and the country's leaders had sent a letter to their Malaysian counterparts to say Dharmalingam had been ""accorded full due process under law"".

It was not immediately clear when the execution would be carried out.
From 2016 to 2019, Singapore hanged 25 people - the majority for drug-related offences, according to official data.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -China's most populous city tightened the first phase of a two-stage COVID-19 lockdown on Tuesday, asking some residents to stay indoors unless they are getting tested as the number of new daily cases exceeded 4,400.
The financial hub of Shanghai, home to 26 million people, is in its second day of a lockdown authorities are imposing by dividing the city roughly along the Huangpu River, splitting the historic centre from the eastern financial and industrial district of Pudong to allow for staggered testing.
While Shanghai's caseload remains modest by global standards - a record 4,381 asymptomatic cases and 96 symptomatic cases for Monday - the city has become a testing ground for China's ""zero-COVID"" strategy as it tries to bring the highly infectious Omicron variant under control.
Residents east of the Huangpu were locked down in their housing compounds on Monday but were mostly allowed to roam within them. On Tuesday, however, three residents told Reuters neighbourhood committees had told them they were no longer allowed to step outside their homes.
""Children were still having picnics yesterday and having fun,"" said one of them, who declined to be identified, citing privacy concerns.
Wu Qianyu, an official with the municipal health commission, told a briefing that a ""clear request"" had been made to residents not to leave their apartments, even to take pets for a walk or throw out trash, during ""a key stage in nucleic acid testing"". 
She said 8.26 million tests were performed by as many as 17,000 testing personnel in the city's locked-down districts on Monday.
""The vast numbers of medical staff, grass-roots cadres, community workers and volunteers shared the very hard work on the front line of epidemic prevention and control, and should be thanked,"" Wu said.
There were growing signs of frustration on China's social media and dozens of residents flocked to the Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) platform to seek help for relatives, with some struggling to access medical services. 
Though China is sticking to its plan for crushing the outbreak, experts overseas remain sceptical about the efficacy of lockdowns in the face of a highly infectious new variant. 
""It is clear from Australia and elsewhere in the world that lockdowns are simply not effective against Omicron – so expect a big wave coming,"" said Adrian Esterman, an expert in biostatistics at the University of South Australia. 
STOCKING UP 
Drone footage published by state media showed empty streets below the skyscrapers of the city's Lujiazui financial district. Public transport in the east has been shut and all unapproved vehicles ordered off the streets.
The Shanghai Stock Exchange, in the west of the city, said it has kept a skeleton staff in place in the bourse for key operations while others work from home.
General Motors (NYSE:GM)'s joint venture has managed to maintain production by asking workers to sleep on factory floors, people familiar with the matter said.
Residents in the west of the city have been stocking up at shops and markets in anticipation of their lockdown from April 1.
But U.S. hypermarket chain Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST), whose Shanghai store has in recent days attracted throngs of shoppers, said it was closing from Tuesday, along with some gyms and shopping malls also in western districts.
The city government rolled out new measures to try to support COVID-affected businesses, including rent exemptions and tax rebates. 
The Communist Party tabloid the Global Times quoted Peking University economist Cao Heping as saying that while the city's growth would be hit, the national economy would not suffer greatly.

Elsewhere, the city of Changchun, capital of Jilin province in the northeast, apologised to its 8.5 million residents for food shortages related to disruption caused by containment measures.
The manufacturing hub of Shenzhen is starting to get back on its feet after shutdowns but many firms are worried about the near-term outlook, the Securities Times reported.

418,"<span>Mar 29, 2022 01:27AM ET</span>",,,,,,"SYDNEY (Reuters) -Heavy rains drenched east Australia on Tuesday, triggering evacuation orders for thousands of flood-weary residents for the second time this month as authorities warned the intense weather is likely to persist for the next 24 hours.
The death toll from the latest floods rose to two as a man was found dead in Queensland state after his vehicle became stuck in floodwaters.
Several towns across northern New South Wales and southeast Queensland were still battling to clear tonnes of debris after devastating floods earlier in March killed at least 21 people and swept away hundreds of farms, houses and livestock.
Many buildings inundated a month ago in some of the worst-hit regions are expected to be flooded again, New South Wales Emergency Services Minister Stephanie Cooke told reporters.
""It is an unfortunate reality of the current situation that we are facing,"" Cooke said.
Amid the recovery efforts, the Bureau of Meteorology on Tuesday warned of potentially life-threatening flash floods along the northern New South Wales coast across a distance of more than 500 km (311 miles). There could be isolated rainfall of up to 300 mm (12 inches) in some regions over six hours, the weather bureau said.
With rising river levels, residents in the northern New South Wales town of Lismore, among the worst-hit by the record floods a month ago, were ordered to evacuate by Tuesday afternoon.
""We are very much in the hands of the gods today,"" Lismore mayor Steve Krieg told Channel Nine television on Tuesday. Krieg said another deluge within weeks while residents were getting their lives on track ""just really drains you emotionally and mentally.""
""Just another, here we go again,"" Lismore business owner Paul Sullivan told broadcaster ABC, after clearing his shop to limit any flood damage. ""At least after the water does come in, there is nothing here that can sort of get pushed out into the gutters.""
Television footage showed residents grabbing sandbags from emergency services before fleeing their homes. About 3,300 military personnel will remain in the flood-hit regions to help evacuate residents, the Department of Defence said.
Amid criticism over slow relief, Prime Minister Scott Morrison, behind in polls in an election year, has declared the floods a national emergency and designated catastrophe zones in flood-stricken towns which will receive extra recovery funds.
Summer on Australia's east coast has been dominated by the La Nina weather pattern, typically associated with increased rainfall, for the second straight year, with many rivers already near capacity before the latest drenching. Some places received around 280 mm of rain over a 24-hour period up to 9 a.m. on Tuesday (2200 GMT Monday), official data showed.

LIMA (Reuters) -Peruvian President Pedro Castillo survived on Monday an impeachment vote in Congress that fell short of the votes needed to oust the leftist leader eight months after he took office. 
Overall, 55 lawmakers out of 130 in the unicameral Congress voted in favor of the impeachment. Congress needed 87 votes to oust Castillo.
The result will avoid a new political crisis in the short term although Castillo's administration has been turbulent anyway, with four Cabinets in less than a year in office. 
Castillo, a former teacher from a peasant farming family who shot to prominence when he narrowly won election last year, has been facing accusations of graft that he strongly denies. He survived an attempt to impeach him late last year. 
""Unfortunately, a bid to oust me through impeachment has become the central axis of the political and journalistic agenda since my election; this cannot continue,"" Castillo said in a speech to lawmakers before the vote. 
He said he had not broken the law since taking office and called for unity to deal with the political and economic crisis, citing Russia's invasion of Ukraine as exacerbating problems in the world's second biggest copper-producing country.
""I am aware we all make mistakes and have defects, but I am loyal to my commitments, values and principles,"" he said. ""Members of Congress, I ask that you vote for democracy, vote for Peru, vote against instability.""
Still, Castillo is facing a plummeting approval rating, which is hovering around 25%, according to an IEP poll published over the weekend. 
In a sign of the pressure Castillo is under, prosecutors earlier in the day raided the homes of some of his former officials and relatives who are under investigation for alleged corruption.
Protesters took to the streets in Lima, the capital, over the weekend calling for Castillo to be voted out of office.

""People can't take it anymore. We are fed up, the people demand justice and all the corrupt people to be gone,"" said one protester, Claudia Iriarte.
The Andean country has had five presidents since 2016. In 2018, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski resigned before an impeachment vote. Martín Vizcarra was impeached in 2020.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has called for a propaganda campaign to increase popular support for the country's ideology of self-reliance amid ""the worst difficulties,"" state media KCNA said on Tuesday. 
Kim sent a letter to ruling Workers' Party officials attending a workshop on Monday that aimed to boost motivation for socialism and advance innovation in the party's ideological work, KCNA said. 
In the dispatch, Kim said the party has been ""advancing in the face of the worst difficulties"" and stressed the need to spread its vision for ""juche"", or self-reliance. 
""We should regard the ideological and moral strength of the popular masses as the foremost weapon as ever and stir it up in every way,"" he said, according to KCNA. 
The juche theory means that ""nothing (is) impossible to do when the people are motivated ideologically,"" he said. 
North Korea faces mounting economic woes amid sanctions over its weapons programmes, natural disasters and COVID-19 lockdowns that sharply cut trade with China, its major ally and economic lifeline.
The United States is pushing for tightening international sanctions over Pyongyang's first full test of an intercontinental ballistic missile last week, despite opposition from China and Russia.
North Korea has not confirmed any COVID-19 cases, but closed borders and imposed strict travel bans and other restrictions.
Kim said the ideological campaign should focus on dispelling ""evil spirits of anti-socialism"" and non-socialist elements that have ""gnawed away at our revolutionary position,"" KCNA said. 

Pyongyang has cracked down on the influx of South Korean music and entertainment via the Chinese border to curb what it says are non-socialist and anti-socialist influences. 
Kim also called for beefing up visual content and stressed film as ""an ideological education means of the greatest influence.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -In a case that could help clarify when and how artists can make use of the work of others, the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide a copyright dispute between a photographer and Andy Warhol's estate over Warhol's 1984 paintings of rock star Prince. 
The justices took up the Andy Warhol Foundation's appeal of a lower court ruling that his paintings - based on a photo of Prince that photographer Lynn Goldsmith had shot for Newsweek magazine in 1981 - were not protected by the copyright law doctrine called fair use. This doctrine permits unlicensed use of copyright-protected works under certain circumstances. 
Goldsmith, 74, countersued Warhol's estate for infringement in 2017 over Warhol's unlicensed paintings of Prince after the estate asked a Manhattan federal court to find that his works did not violate her rights. Warhol, who died in 1987, often based his art on photographs. 
Goldsmith, who has said she did not learn about the unlicensed works until after Prince died in 2016, asked the court to block Warhol's estate from making further use of her work and for an unspecified amount of money damages.
A judge ruled that Warhol's works were protected against Goldsmith's infringement claims by the fair use doctrine, finding they transformed Goldsmith's portrayal of Prince as a ""vulnerable human being"" by depicting him as an ""iconic, larger-than-life figure."" 
After Goldsmith challenged that decision, the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year found that Warhol's paintings had not made fair use of the photo, allowing Goldsmith's case to proceed.
The 2nd Circuit decided that https://www.reuters.com/article/ip-copyright/2nd-circuit-reverses-win-for-andy-warhol-foundation-over-prince-images-idUSL1N2LO2PP a transformative work must have a ""fundamentally different and new artistic purpose and character,"" and that Warhol's paintings were ""much closer to presenting the same work in a different form.""
The Andy Warhol Foundation asked the Supreme Court in December to overturn the 2nd Circuit decision, arguing that it created ""a cloud of legal uncertainty"" for an entire genre of art like Warhol's.
Warhol Foundation attorney Roman Martinez said he welcomed the high court's decision to hear the case and hopes it will ""recognize that Andy Warhol's transformative works of art are fully protected by law.""
Goldsmith said in a statement provided by one of her lawyers that she looks forward to continuing her legal fight at the Supreme Court.
""Five years ago, the Foundation sued me to obtain a ruling that it could use my photograph without asking my permission or paying me anything for my work. I fought this suit to protect not only my own rights, but the rights of all photographers and visual artists to make a living by licensing their creative work - and also to decide when, how and even whether to exploit their creative works or license others to do so,"" Goldsmith said.

The Supreme Court addressed the issue of copyright fair use last year in a ruling finding that the use of  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) software code by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google in its Android operating system was protected. 
In a 1994 Supreme Court ruling on fair use involving artistic creation, the justices found that rap group 2 Live Crew's parody of Roy Orbison's ""Oh, Pretty Woman"" made fair use of Orbison's song.

SDE BOKER, Israel (Reuters) -The top diplomats of the United States and four Arab countries convened in Israel on Monday in a display of unity against Iran but also used the rare summit to press their host to revive long-stalled peacemaking with the Palestinians.
Concluding two days of discussions at a desert retreat where its founding father David Ben-Gurion is buried, Israel said the event would be repeated and expanded as it builds up commercial and security ties with like-minded Sunni Arab states.
""This new architecture - the shared capabilities we are building - intimidates and deters our common enemies, first and foremost Iran and its proxies,"" Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said alongside his U.S., Emirati, Bahrani, Moroccan and Egyptian counterparts. 
Israel and some Arab countries worry that an emerging nuclear deal with Iran will leave Tehran with the means to build a bomb and bolster Iranian-backed guerrillas.
The United States and other world powers see restoring a 2015 Iranian nuclear deal as their best option. But U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken offered Washington's regional allies reassurances in the event that diplomacy failed. 
""As neighbours and, in the case of the United States, as friends, we will also work together to confront common security challenges and threats, including those from Iran and its proxies,"" he said.
U.S. officials briefing reporters on the meeting said there was a straightforward discussion on Iran and Blinken assured the foreign ministers that Washington would coordinate to counter Iran's behaviour in the region, whether or not the nuclear deal is revived. 
'NOT A SUBSTITUTE'
The UAE, Bahrain and Morocco normalised ties with Israel under a 2020 U.S. initiative known as the Abraham Accords. Egypt in 1979 became the first Arab state to make peace with Israel. 
While hailing the accords, Blinken added: ""We have to be clear that these regional peace agreements are not a substitute for progress between Palestinians and Israelis"". 
The atmosphere at Monday's meeting was very positive, very cooperative, the U.S. officials said. 
The countries agreed to establish working groups on counterterrorism, water and food security, energy, education, tourism and public health, the officials said.
“But the other thing that did come up was how we can ensure that the Palestinians benefit from the energy that is being devoted and created from these normalization agreements,"" one of the senior State Department officials said.
Like the Arab countries present, the United States wants to see a Palestinian state established alongside Israel. Talks to that end stalled in 2014. Israel has settled much of the occupied West Bank while the Gaza Strip, another Palestinian territory, is ruled by hardline Islamists.
The cross-partisan coalition government of nationalist Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has said conditions are not right for any renewal of diplomacy with the Palestinians who, for their part, have placed the onus on Israel. 
""Unless the occupation ends, Arab normalisation meetings are nothing but an illusion and free reward for Israel,"" Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh told his Cabinet on Monday.
Jordan's King Abdullah arrived in Ramallah to hold talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, a first such visit in years that was expected to focus on efforts to reduce regional tensions ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
A U.S. official said Jordan, which made peace with Israel in 1994 but did not join Monday's summit, was invited and would be ""warmly welcomed"" to future gatherings.
Israel was jarred on Sunday by a shooting spree by two Islamic State-aligned Arab citizens who killed two police officers. Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita said his presence alongside the other Arab delegates at the Israeli-hosted summit was ""the best response to such attacks"".

Bahraini Foreign Minister Abdullatif Al Zayani described the discussions as helpful to fend off Iranian-backed groups like Hezbollah. ""Of course, part of this process will be renewed efforts to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,"" he added.
In another sign the allies were closing ranks against Iran, the Israeli ambassador to Manama, Eitan Naeh, said on Monday that Israel will appoint a military attache to the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet headquarters in Bahrain soon.

LVIV/KHARKIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukraine said it was hoping that the first face-to-face peace talks with Russia in over two weeks, set for Tuesday, could lead to a ceasefire, but a U.S. official said President Vladimir Putin did not appear ready to make compromises to end the war.
The more than month-long invasion, the biggest of a Western nation since World War Two, has seen over 3.8 million people flee abroad, left thousands dead or injured, and brought the isolation of Russia's economy. 
Nearly 5,000 people have been killed, including about 210 children, in the port city of Mariupol amid heavy Russian bombardment, according to figures from the mayor. Reuters was unable to immediately verify the numbers.
Survivors have told harrowing tales of people dying from lack of medical treatment, bodies being buried wherever space could be found, and women giving birth in basements.
A Ukrainian delegation arrived in Istanbul for the negotiations, TV footage showed. 
""The minimum programme will be humanitarian questions, and the maximum programme is reaching an agreement on a ceasefire,"" Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said on national television.
""We are not trading people, land or sovereignty."" 
Putin does not appear ready to make compromises to end the war, a senior U.S. State Department official told Reuters on Monday on condition of anonymity. 
And Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko said earlier that he doubted ""there will be any breakthrough on the main issues.""
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said talks so far had not yielded any substantial breakthroughs but that it was important that they continued in person. He declined to give more information, saying that to do so could interfere with the process.
In besieged Ukrainian cities where conditions are desperate, the threat of Russian attacks blocked exit routes for civilians, two Ukrainian officials said.
In Mariupol, the mayor said some 160,000 people are trapped.
""There is no food for the children, especially the infants. They delivered babies in basements because women had nowhere to go to give birth, all the maternity hospitals were destroyed,"" a grocery worker from Mariupol who gave her name only as Nataliia told Reuters after reaching nearby Zaporizhzhia.
The United Nations said it had been able to bring food and medical supplies into Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-biggest city and one of its hardest hit.
A predawn missile blew out the wall of a Kharkiv school.
The mayor of Irpin, near Kyiv, said Ukrainian forces were back in full control and a U.S. defence official said the Ukrainians had also recaptured the eastern town of Trostyanets, south of Sumy, and were continuing to try to take back ground.
Russia's defence ministry said its troops had destroyed ammunition depots in the Zhytomyr region west of Kyiv and had hit 41 Ukrainian military sites in the past 24 hours. Reuters could not immediately verify any of the reports.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" its neighbour. Kyiv and the West consider this a pretext for an unprovoked invasion to try to topple the elected Ukrainian government. 
'CHANGE THEIR GOALS'
Tuesday's talks will be the first in person since an acrimonious meeting between foreign ministers on March 10, a sign of shifts behind the scenes as Russia's invasion has stalled and sanctions have hit home.
""We have destroyed the myth of the invincible Russian army. We are resisting against the aggression of one of the strongest armies in the world and have succeeded in making them change their goals,"" Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said.
He said 100 people had been killed in the capital, including four children, and 82 multi-storey buildings had been destroyed. It was not possible to verify the figures.
Russia's military signalled last week it would concentrate on expanding territory held by separatists in eastern Ukraine, but Ukraine said it saw no sign Russia had given up a plan to surround the capital.
When the sides last met in person, Ukraine accused Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov of ignoring pleas to discuss a ceasefire, while Lavrov said a halt to fighting was not even on the agenda.
Since then, they have held talks via video link and publicly discussed a formula under which Ukraine might accept some kind of formal neutral status. 
But neither side has budged over Russia's territorial demands, including Crimea, which Moscow seized and annexed in 2014, and eastern territories known as the Donbas, which Moscow demands Kyiv cede to separatists.
British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said talks should not end up ""selling Ukraine out"", noting the ""uneasy settlement"" which left it vulnerable after Russia annexed Crimea.
Britain's defence ministry said there had been no major change in Russia's positions in the past 24 hours, with most Russian gains near Mariupol and heavy fighting underway there.

Elsewhere, Russia's armoured columns are bogged down, with trouble resupplying and making little or no progress.
""As of today, the enemy is regrouping its forces, but they cannot advance anywhere in Ukraine,"" Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar said.

""But any outcome of the operation (in Ukraine), of course is not a reason for usage of a nuclear weapon,"" Peskov said. ""We have a security concept that very clearly states that only when there is a threat for existence of the state, in our country, we can use and we will actually use nuclear weapons to eliminate the threat for the existence of our country.""

(Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday urged Western nations to toughen sanctions quickly against Russia, including an oil embargo, to stop Moscow having a free hand to escalate its measures against his country.
In his nightly video address to Ukrainians, a clearly irritated Zelenskiy said the West had miscalculated last year in delaying sanctions and the invasion had followed.
""A full-scale war has begun. Now there are many hints and warnings that supposedly tougher sanctions, such as an embargo on Russian oil supplies to Europe, will be put in place if Russia uses chemical weapons,"" Zelenskiy said, occasionally banging his hands on a table.
""There are simply no words ... We, people who are alive, have to wait. Doesn't everything the Russia military has done to date warrant an oil embargo? Don't phosphorous bombs warrant it? A shelled chemical production facility or a shelled nuclear power plant doesn't warrant it?""
Russia's month-old invasion of Ukraine, the biggest European conflict since World War Two, has seen over 3.8 million Ukrainians flee abroad, left thousands dead or injured and isolated Russia's economy.
Zelenskiy said sanctions had to be ""effective and serious"" given Russia's actions to date.
""If the sanctions packages are weak or do not work strongly enough, if they can be circumvented, it creates a dangerous illusion for the Russian leadership, as if they will be permitted to continue doing what they are doing now,"" he said.

""Ukrainians are paying for this with their lives. Thousands of lives.""
The United States has already introduced an embargo on Russian oil shipments. But Europe, far more dependent on Russian energy, has been more hesitant. Germany, Europe's largest economy, has said introducing such an embargo would trigger recession and mass unemployment.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) -Survivors of Canada's residential schools on Monday asked Pope Francis to guarantee unfettered access to Church records on the institutions where indigenous children were abused and their culture denied.
Francis met for about an hour each with representatives of the Métis and Inuit nations, the first of four meetings this week with Canada's native peoples in what both sides have called a called a process of healing and reconciliation.
""It was a very comfortable meeting,"" Cassidy Caron, president of the Métis National Council, told reporters afterwards, adding that the pope listened attentively as elderly survivors told their stories.
The stated aim of the schools, which operated between 1831 and 1996, was to assimilate indigenous children. They were run by several Christian denominations on behalf of the government, most by the Catholic Church.
""He repeated 'truth, justice and healing' (in English) and I take that as a personal commitment so he has personally committed to those three actions,"" she said.
""I felt some sorrow in his reactions .... we shared a lot with him,"" Caron said.
About 150,000 children were taken from their homes. Many were subjected to abuse, rape and malnutrition in what the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2015 called ""cultural genocide"".
Caron said the topic of records came up. Records are held in Canada's dioceses and in archives of Rome headquarters of various religious orders. Archbishop Donald Bolen of Regina, Saskatchewan, told reporters no records were believed to be the Vatican itself. 
""The Métis nation needs to be sure to understand our full truth, and that will be unfettered access to Church records and we will be speaking more with the pope on this,"" she said.
Canada's indigenous peoples and the Canadian government want the pope to visit Canada to make an apology there for the Church's role in the schools.
Caron said she was not disappointed that the pope did not apologise on Monday because the indigenous want him to do so in Canada.
She said she expected the trip to be ""soon."" Vatican sources have said it will likely be this summer. 
""While the time for acknowledgement and apology and atonement is long overdue it is never too late to do the right thing,"" she said. ""Now it is his (the pope's) turn to join us in that work,"" she said.
Matan Obed, an Inuit leader, said he asked the pope to help bring to justice a priest who is accused of abusing several children and is living in France.
The recurring schools scandal broke out again last year with the discovery of the remains of 215 children at the former Indian Residential School in Kamloops in the Western Canadian province of British Columbia.
The discovery at the school, which closed in 1978, reopened old wounds and brought fresh demands for accountability. Hundreds more unmarked burial sites have been found since.

Francis was elected pope nearly two decades after the last schools closed.
""Part of justice is acknowledging what has taken place in the past. That acknowledgement, even though it was not him personally, is really meaningful and important,"" Caron said.

The killings took place in Las Tinajas in the state of Michoacan, where the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) has been fighting local gangs for control of drug routes. 
""It was a massacre of one group by another,"" President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told a regular news conference, expressing his regret at the deaths.
He blamed criminal gangs in the area for the killings and said a team was on the way to investigate the crime.
Seventeen of the dead were men and three were women, and officials secured 15 vehicles as part of the investigation, Michoacan state prosecutors said in a statement.
All the victims had gunshot wounds, and the last of them died on his way to hospital, authorities said.
Four people were being treated for injuries.
Michoacan has long been one of the most lawless areas in Mexico, and last month, the United States temporarily suspended shipments of avocados from the state after U.S. inspectors received threats. The suspension was later lifted.
Gang violence was fuelling record levels of homicides by the time President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office in late 2018 pledging to pacify the country, adopting a less confrontational approach to dealing with organized crime.
But widespread violence has persisted, and average annual homicide totals are on track to be the highest under any Mexican administration since modern records began.

Homicides were down nationally during the first two months of 2022 compared to the same period last year, but they were up in Michoacan, according to official government data.
Las Tinajas is in the municipality of Zinapecuaro, about 50 km (30 miles) northeast of the state capital, Morelia.

LONDON (Reuters) -The Kremlin said on Monday that U.S. President Joe Biden's remark that Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power"" was a cause for alarm, a guarded response to the first public call from the United States for an end to Putin's 22-year rule.
""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power,"" Biden said on Saturday at the end of a speech to a crowd in Warsaw. He cast Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a battle in a much broader conflict between democracy and autocracy.
The White House tried to clarify Biden's remarks and the U.S. president said on Sunday he had not been publicly calling for regime change in Russia, which has more nuclear warheads than any other power.
Asked about Biden's comment, which received little coverage on Russian state television, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""This is a statement that is certainly alarming.""
""We will continue to track the statements of the U.S. president in the most attentive way,"" Peskov told reporters.
Putin has not commented publicly on Biden's remark - which comes amid Moscow's biggest confrontation with the West since the end of the Cold War.
In his first live appearance since the remark, Putin was shown on state television on Monday being briefed by Alexander Sergeev, president of the Russian Academy of Sciences, on the accumulation of carbon in molluscs and the use of artifical intelligence to decipher ancient Tibetan manuscripts.
Biden last year cast Putin as ""a killer"". After that comment, Biden phoned Putin who then said he was satisfied with the U.S. leader's explanation for the remark.
'REGIME CHANGE'?
Such a blunt remark from Biden on the need to end Putin's power, however, appeared to breach the norms of U.S-Russian relations and also, bizarrely, align with the narrative of the former KGB spies who form Putin's closest circle in the Kremlin.
""It is unusual for the president to talk about regime change so bluntly,"" William Wohlforth, professor of government at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, told Reuters. 
""But it wouldn't seem that unusual from the perspective of Putin's propaganda as he often describes that as the goal of U.S. foreign policy,"" Wohlforth said.
Putin's inner circle, including Security Council chief Nikolai Patrushev, previously head of the powerful Federal Security Service spy agency, has long argued that the United States is plotting a revolution in Russia.
Dmitry Medvedev, who served as president from 2008 to 2012, said on March 23 the world could spiral towards a nuclear dystopia if Washington pressed on with what the Kremlin casts as a long-term plot to destroy Russia. 
Medvedev painted a grim picture of a post-Putin Russia, saying it could lead to an unstable leadership in Moscow ""with a maximum number of nuclear weapons aimed at targets in the United States and Europe"".
IDEOLOGICAL WAR 
Putin, Russia's paramount leader since Boris Yeltsin resigned on the last day of 1999, casts the war in Ukraine as necessary to protect his country's vital interests in the face of a United States he says is bent on world hegemony. He is particularly keen to quash Ukraine's hopes of joining NATO.
Ukraine says it is fighting for its very survival against a Russian imperial-style land grab that has divided the two biggest Eastern Slav peoples.
Biden's remark on ending Putin's rule overshadowed a speech which had a much broader theme: the battle between democracy and autocracy.
That indicates a much longer war, according to Russian aluminium tycoon Oleg Deripaska.
""Now some sort of hellish ideological mobilisation is underway from all sides,"" he said on Sunday. 
""It appears all sides are recklessly gearing up for a long-term war that will have tragic consequences for the entire world,"" said Deripaska, who has been sanctioned by the United States and Britain.

Under constitutional changes approved in 2020, Putin, who turns 70 this year, could seek election for two more 6-year terms as president, allowing him to stay in power until 2036. 
The Kremlin says Putin is a democratically elected leader and that it is for the Russian people, not Washington, to decide who leads their country.

SAO JORGE, Portugal (Reuters) -Fatima Viveiros was a little girl when she decided to become a volcanologist. It was a dream come true and now, at age 44, she is putting her skills to use to protect her home in Portugal's Azores islands. 
The lush mid-Atlantic volcanic island of Sao Jorge, where she grew up, has been rattled by more than 14,000 small earthquakes in the past seven days.
Viveiros and other experts fear the tremors, which have reached a magnitude of up to 3.3 on the Richter scale, could trigger a volcanic eruption for the first time since 1808, or a powerful earthquake.
""My home is located on an active volcanic system,"" said Viveiros, who works for the region's CIVISA seismo-volcanic surveillance centre. 
""When (something happens) in our home we must be a little cold-blooded, so our feelings don't affect our thinking,"" she added. ""But the feelings are there because it's my home, my people.""
Viveiros was carrying a yellow machine on her back to measure soil gases on Sao Jorge.
Soil gases, such as carbon dioxide and sulphur, are indicators of volcanic activity, and Viveiros and her team have been battling Sao Jorge's rain and strong winds for days to dig for answers. So far, the levels remain normal. 
The island's sudden increase in seismic activity is reminiscent of the earthquakes detected before the eruption of the Cumbre Vieja volcano on Spain's La Palma island last year, some 1,400 km (870 miles) southeast of the Azores. 
Over 85 days, that eruption destroyed thousands of properties and crops.
Viveiros, who travelled to La Palma at the time to support the Canary Islands Volcanology Institute and monitor soil gases there, said Sao Jorge's volcanic system was similar to the one on the Spanish island.
""One of the possible scenarios on the table is that we see something similar to what happened in La Palma,"" she added. 
'ABNORMALITY'
Spanish and other international teams of experts are prepared to travel to Sao Jorge if needed, Viveiros said.
CIVISA raised the volcanic alert to Level 4 on Wednesday, meaning there is a ""real possibility"" the volcano could erupt.
Jose Bolieiro, the president of the Azores, which is an autonomous region of Portugal, said the number of earthquakes that hit Sao Jorge in recent days was double those recorded in the region as a whole last year. 
""There is clearly an abnormality,"" he told reporters.
Although authorities have said an eruption was not imminent, around 1,500 people have left the island by air or sea in recent days. Many have no idea when they will be able to return.
Arriving by helicopter, Portugal's President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa visited Sao Jorge on Sunday to attend a briefing about the situation and calm the local population. He also visited a historic tower that survived the 1808 eruption.
Later on Sunday, Rebelo de Sousa interacted with locals in Calheta, a town on the eastern part of the island where people have sought safety. Most of the seismic activity has been in the western side of Sao Jorge. 
He drank a traditional Azorean spirit, kissed and hugged members of the crowd and took selfies with them.
Dozens of soldiers have been mobilised to Sao Jorge where they are staying in large tents with beds that could accommodate 100 people in case of an evacuation. Sao Jorge's municipalities also have transformed various facilities into temporary reception centers.

As soldiers worked behind him, Major Rodolfo Romeiro told Reuters more resources would be sent to the island next week.
""Our mission is to help the population,"" Romeiro said. ""In these situations the motivation (of the armed forces) is even greater.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission called on EU governments on Monday to end national programmes to sell citizenship to investors, also known as golden passports schemes, and urged them to suspend the sale of visas to Russians and Belarusians.
The move follows a new push from the European Parliament to shrink and regulate the multi-billion-euro citizenship and visa industry which the EU has long considered a security risk.
It comes amid concerns that people hit by European Union sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine may be holders of EU golden visas or passports. 
""Some Russian or Belarusian nationals who are subject to sanctions or are significantly supporting the war in Ukraine might have acquired EU citizenship or privileged access to the EU, including to travel freely in the Schengen area, under these schemes,"" the European Commission said on Monday.
Since the start of the Russian aggression, which Moscow calls a special operation, the EU has blacklisted nearly 700 top politicians, businessmen and military staff accused of supporting the Kremlin.
The Commission urged an immediate end to existing national programmes for the sale of passports. Currently only Malta, Cyprus and Bulgaria have such schemes and they have all committed to ending them. Bulgaria's parliament has recently voted to end its programme.
Brussels also said governments should check whether sanctioned people were holding a golden passport or visa they had issued.
The European Commission said it did not know whether sanctioned people were among the beneficiaries of the programme. A spokesman declined to clarify whether it had asked EU states to provide lists of people who had bought visas or passports.
Countries should determine whether to annul those passports and should immediately withdraw residence permits, the Commission said.

Several EU countries run golden visa schemes and have had golden passports programmes.
The Commission refrained from calling for the end of golden visa programmes, but urged strict checks and asked EU governments to suspend the granting of residence permits to Russians and Belarusians. (This version of the story corrects to Bulgaria's parliament instead of Cyprus' parliament in paragraph 6)

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghanistan's Taliban has instructed all government employees to wear a beard and adhere to a dress code or risk being fired, three sources told Reuters, the latest of several new restrictions imposed by the hardline Islamist administration.
The sources said representatives from the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice were patrolling the entrances to government offices on Monday to check that employees were in compliance with the new rules.
Employees were being instructed not to shave their beards and to wear local clothing consisting of a long, loose top and trousers, and a hat or turban. They were also told to ensure they prayed at the correct times, two of the sources said. 
Workers were told they would from now on be unable to enter offices and would eventually be fired if they did not meet the dress codes, the sources said. 
A spokesman for the public morality ministry did not respond to a request for comment. 
Last week, the Taliban banned women from taking flights without a male chaperone and failed to open girls' schools as promised. 
On Sunday it ordered parks to be segregated by sex, with women allowed to enter three days a week, and men the other four days, including the weekend, meaning even married couples and families cannot visit together. 
The Taliban administration has drawn criticism at home and from Western governments for forcing its hardline interpretation of Islamic law onto all Afghans.
The Taliban say they will respect everyone's rights in line with Islamic law and Afghan customs and that they have changed since their 1996-2001 rule, when they barred women from leaving the house without a male relative and forced men to grow beards. 

Wednesday's u-turn on girls' schools led to protests from the international community, including the United States, which pulled out of planned meetings with Taliban officials in Qatar to discuss key economic issues. 
The Taliban needs Western countries to lift sanctions that are crippling the Afghan economy.

Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine signed an agreement last week to set up a team to enable the exchange of information and investigation into suspected war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Participation in the team may be extended to other EU member states, third countries or other third parties, Eurojust said in a statement, which did not mention Russia.
""The main aim of the JIT is to support the gathering of evidence and its swift and secure exchange between partners, as well as the transmission of information and evidence,"" Eurojust said.
Eurojust said it would provide legal and technical assistance and support evidence gathering and sharing.

The team will also coordinate with the International Criminal Court (ICC), the world's permanent war crimes tribunal, which opened its own investigation in Ukraine days after Russia's invasion.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" its neighbour. Kyiv and the West consider this a pretext for an unprovoked invasion.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan agreed in a telephone call on Sunday for Istanbul to host the talks, which Ankara hopes will lead to a ceasefire in Ukraine.
Turkey said the talks could begin as early as Monday, but Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that was unlikely as the negotiators would only be arriving in Turkey on Monday. 
""While we cannot and will not speak about progress at the talks, the fact that they continuing to take place in person is important, of course,"" Peskov told reporters on a conference call.
""We are adhering to a policy of not disclosing any information about the talks, which we think could only hurt the negotiation process."" 
Peskov added that no major progress had been made in the talks themselves, or on the idea of a potential meeting between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
""Unfortunately we cannot see any substantial achievements or breakthroughs (in the talks) so far,"" he said.
In separate comments, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said a meeting between the two leaders would be counterproductive if it were held now. He said they should meet once the sides achieve progress.
""A meeting between Putin and Zelenskiy is needed as soon as we will be close to resolving all key issues,"" Lavrov said in an interview with Serbian media.

Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists.
Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Reports suggest North Korea's biggest missile test ever may not have been what it seemed, raising new questions over the secretive country's banned weapons programme.
North Korea said it had test-fired its new Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Thursday, the first test of a missile that size since 2017.
North Korean state media heralded the launch as an ""unprecedented miracle"", and South Korean and Japanese officials independently confirmed flight data that showed it flew higher and longer than any previous test.
But new details - including discrepancies spotted in the North's heavily stylized video featuring leader Kim Jong Un overseeing the launch in a leather jacket and sunglasses - have poked holes in Pyongyang's claims.
""The biggest question now is what was launched on March 24,"" said Colin Zwirko, a senior analytical correspondent with NK Pro, a Seoul-based website that monitors North Korea. 
He has examined commercial satellite imagery and footage released by state media and he says discrepancies in weather, sunlight, and other factors suggest the launch shown by North Korea happened on another day.
""I've been able to determine that there's some sort of deception going on, but the question remains: did they test another Hwasong-17 and they're just not showing us, or did they test something else?"" Zwirko said.
The U.S.-based James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) concluded that some of the North Korean footage is most likely from a test on the morning of March 16 that South Korea said failed shortly after launch, exploding in midair over Pyongyang. North Korea never acknowledged that launch or a failure.
South Korea's Yonhap news agency has cited unnamed sources who said intelligence officials in Seoul and Washington believed that North Korea then tested a Hwasong-15 ICBM on Thursday, an older and slightly smaller type it had last launched in late 2017.
South Korea's defense ministry has not confirmed that conclusion. On Friday, a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, deflected when asked whether the latest launch was really the new missile.
""We know this is a test of a long-range ballistic missile and clearly they try to learn from each of these tests to try to develop their capability further,"" the official said. ""But I am going to refrain from talking about it too specifically as we're still analyzing our own intelligence on it.""
North Korea has a history of doctoring footage or reusing old images, but it would be ""a whole new level"" if they were lying about the successful test of a major new weapon such as the Hwasong-17, Zwirko said. North Korea has not responded to any outside reports that the launch may have been deceptive.
""I think it's likely that the March 16 launch was meant to have been the inaugural launch of the Hwasong-17, but it failed shortly after ignition,"" said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""This left the North Koreans with sufficient video footage and imagery to build a propaganda narrative after the March 24 launch succeeded.""
The March 24 missile may have featured a light payload, or none at all, to achieve a higher altitude and longer flight time than the 2017 Hwasong-15 test, he added.
""The North Korean state media report included specific numbers on how high and far the missile flew, suggesting that there was an intent to engineer a launch that would look like a larger missile than the Hwasong-15, even if it wasn't,"" Panda said.

Hong Min, director of North Korean Research Division of Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, said no matter which ICBM was tested, North Korea has proved it can launch missiles that can strike the far side of the planet.
""We will need to check thoroughly if the video was fabricated, but it’s not like the threat is reduced at all,"" Hong said.

(Reuters) -Kristen Stewart rocked the Oscars red carpet in shorts and Timothee Chalamet went shirtless on Sunday as stars made a full-fledged return for Hollywood's big night out after the seismic changes wrought by COVID-19.
After last year's smaller-than-usual affair held at a train station last year due to the pandemic, Sunday's unbridled Oscars glamour at Los Angeles' Dolby Theatre brought lots of pastel colors punctuated by bright splashes of gold.
Jessica Chastain, a contender for the best actress statuette for her portrayal of American evangelist Tammy Faye Bakker, dazzled the carpet crowd in a two-toned Gucci dress, while actress Lupita Nyong'o's sparkling golden dress also turned heads.
As the ceremony approached, more of the night's biggest stars strolled down the red carpet in their haute couture garbs. 
Stewart, also a nominee for best actress, wore the black shorts as part of her Chanel outfit alongside fiancee Dylan Meyer.
She said that playing the late Princess Diana in ""Spencer"" brought on some unexpected emotions. ""It just made me feel six feet tall and, like, happy,"" she told cable channel E!. ""She's cool, she's fun and she touches you."" 
""Dune"" star Chalamet also opted to show some skin, wearing only a short-cropped, glitzy blazer paired with dark pants and boots - and no shirt.
Jason Momoa, who also starred in best picture nominee ""Dune,"" donned a blue-and-yellow pocket square in his Tuxedo in support of war-torn Ukraine.
After a scaled-down ceremony at Los Angeles' Union Station last year, the Oscars have returned to their traditional venue, which will be filled to about three-quarters capacity with 2,500 guests, allowing for some social distancing. 
""The Power of the Dog"" star Kirsten Dunst, accompanied by partner and co-star Jesse Plemons, chose a ruffled red gown for the night that could see her take home the Oscar for best actress in a supporting role. 
Earlier in the day, Hollywood veteran Jamie Lee Curtis stepped onto the carpet in a neck-high, glittery Stella McCartney gown.
Curtis announced that during the ceremony she will present a special tribute to late TV and movie icon Betty White, who passed away on Dec. 31, a couple of weeks shy of her 100th birthday. 
""I am wearing Stella McCartney, who's an animal rights activist, as Betty White was,"" Curtis told ABC. ""It felt like a perfect way to walk the walk and talk the talk."" 

Saniyya Sidney, the young actress who portrayed tennis superstar Venus Williams in the Oscar-nominated biopic ""King Richard,"" stunned in an Armani Prive gown embroidered with floral motifs. 
""We talked about boyfriends, old boyfriends,"" she told cable channel E! about her interactions with tennis great Williams. ""We talked about school and how growing up in Compton was like.""

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) -Residents of a suburb of Anchorage in Alaska were ordered on Sunday to evacuate a mountainous area after one massive avalanche buried a road and another huge slide was considered imminent.
Anchorage Mayor Dave Bronson issued the evacuation order, citing ""a grave and immediate threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens"" in the affected area at Eagle River, on the city's outskirts.
The avalanche roared down a mountainside shortly before midnight local time on Thursday (0800 GMT) covering the main road with a snow layer up to 80 feet (24 metres) deep. But only about half of the snow in the unstable slide zone was released then, and a secondary avalanche is considered certain, local officials said.
""If we have an uncontrolled release at an unknown time, that could result in the loss of life. We want to do everything we can to prevent that,"" Anchorage Municipal Manager Amy Demboski said at a Sunday news conference.
The avalanche cut off access to about 100 homes, some of which are now without power, Demboski said.
The evacuation of homes in the affected neighborhood and mitigation efforts that include placing explosives by helicopter to create a controlled avalanche are intended to make the area safer over the coming days, Demboski said. 
Emergency responders have cut a small trail to those stranded residents and are running snowmobile shuttles, said Assistant Anchorage Fire Chief Alex Boyd, the incident commander.
There have been no injuries reported, said Corey Allen Young, Bronson's spokesman, by email, and officials are assessing the extent of damage to houses.
While avalanches are common in the region's Chugach Mountains, the size and location of this slide make it an unprecedented event, officials said.

""The size of this avalanche is massive. It has been described by avalanche experts as a once-in-a-hundred-year event,"" Demboski said at the news conference.
Without mitigation, the road in the area could be blocked by snow until summer, Demboski said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese drone maker DJI has dismissed as ""utterly false"" accusations that the Russian military is using its drones in Ukraine after a German retailer cited such information as the reason for taking its products off the shelves.
The rejection followed Friday's Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) revelation of the removal by German electronics and home appliances giant MediaMarkt in response to ""information from various sources"", although it gave no details of the information it received.
On Twitter, the Chinese firm said, ""DJI promotes civilian drone applications that benefit society,"" adding that MediaMarkt's accusation was ""utterly false"".
In Saturday's statement, it said, ""We do not support any use that does harm to people's lives, rights and interests."" 
On Monday, DJI did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment.
MediaMarkt, which runs more than 800 stores in 12 European nations and Turkey, did not say what information it had received about DJI.
""As a responsible company, we have taken immediate action and removed the manufacturer from our product range groupwide until further notice,"" it said on its official Twitter account on Friday.
MediaMarkt was replying to a user who accused DJI of leaking GPS data of Ukrainian military positions to Russia.
""We will closely examine further indications and developments,"" it added.
It called the move ""a clear signal for the values that have the highest priority for us"", which it saw come under attack by Russia's ""aggressive"" war against Ukraine.
Users of the Chinese drone giant's products range from photography hobbyists to U.S. fire departments.
The firm has found itself in an uncomfortable position after Russia invaded Ukraine more than a month ago in what Moscow calls a ""special military operation"".
While Western firms have pulled out of Russia in protest, DJI has stayed on, like many Chinese companies, taking a cue from Beijing's stance of refraining from criticism of Moscow over the invasion.

On March 16, Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's minister of digital transformation, said he asked DJI founder Frank Wang in a letter to cut ties with Russia, accusing its troops of using DJI products for the navigation of missiles that kill Ukrainian civilians. 
The next day, DJI responded on Twitter that its products, designed for civilian use, were inappropriate for military missions.

Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement posted on its Telegram account.
The two assailants in Hadera, a city about 50 km (30 miles) north of Tel Aviv, were Arab citizens of Israel and sympathisers of the group, Israeli security officials said.
""We condemn today's terrorist attack in Hadera, Israel,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""Such senseless acts of violence and murder have no place in society. We stand with our Israeli partners and send our condolences to the families of the victims.""
The attack occurred five days after an Arab from southern Israel killed at least four Israelis in a stabbing and car ramming spree in the city of Beersheba, before he was fatally shot by a passerby.
Surveillance camera footage broadcast on Israeli television stations showed two men opening fire with assault rifles on a main street in Hadera, raising fears in Israel of a wave of such attacks.
Two members of Israel's paramilitary border police were killed by the assailants, police said. The two gunmen were shot dead by police officers who had been dining at a nearby restaurant.
""Luckily, our officers managed to neutralise the assailants and prevent a bigger terrorist attack,"" national police spokesman Eli Levy said on Israel's Kan television.
In Israel's southern Negev desert, the foreign ministers of the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco, three countries that normalised relations with Israel in 2020, convened for a summit with Blinken in attendance.
Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid ""updated the foreign ministers participating in the Negev Summit on the details of the terror attack in Hadera,"" the Israeli foreign ministry tweeted.
""All the foreign ministers condemned the attack, and asked to send their condolences to the families of the victims & wishes for the recovery of the wounded,"" the ministry said.

Israeli security officials have cautioned about an escalation in attacks on Israelis in the run-up to the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in April - a volatile period in the past.
Jordan's King Abdullah is due to meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the occupied West Bank on Monday in what is widely seen in Israel as an attempt to calm tensions ahead of the holiday period, which also includes Easter and Passover.

439,"<span>Mar 27, 2022 10:37PM ET</span>","(Reuters) -A senior Ukrainian official accused Russia on Sunday of ""irresponsible"" acts around the occupied Chernobyl power station that could send radiation across much of Europe, and urged the United Nations to dispatch a mission to assess the risks.
Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Russian forces were ""militarising"" the exclusion zone around the station, site of the world's worst civil nuclear accident in 1986.
Russian forces, she said, were transporting large amounts of old and badly maintained weapons, creating a risk of damaging the containment vessel constructed around the station's wrecked fourth reactor. 
And Russian forces were preventing firefighters from bringing under control large numbers of fires in the zone.
""In the context of nuclear safety, the irresponsible and unprofessional actions of Russian servicemen present a very serious threat not only to Ukraine but to hundreds of millions of Europeans,"" Vereshchuk said on her Telegram account.
""We therefore demand that the U.N. Security Council adopt immediate measures to demilitarise the exclusion zone around the Chernobyl station as well as dispatching a special mission to eliminate the risks of any repeat of the Chernobyl accident resulting from the actions of Russian occupying forces,"" she said.
Vereshchuk said damage to the containment vessel, built with European financing, would ""inevitably lead to the release in the atmosphere of a considerable amount of radioactive dust and contamination not only in Ukraine but also in other European countries"".
Russia, she said, was ""ignoring these risks"" by continuing to transport weapons in areas near the station.
Reuters could not immediately verify Vereshchuk's claims on the ground. Russia has previously denied that its forces have put nuclear facilities inside Ukraine at risk. 
The fire and explosion in 1986 in Chernobyl's fourth reactor sent radiation wafting as far away as Britain and Spain. Thousands of deaths have been linked to the aftermath of the accident and the radiation it released.
All its reactors have now been taken out of service.
Russian forces occupied the Chernobyl station in the first days of the invasion last month and for a time prevented staff maintaining facilities there from leaving or being spelled off by other workers.
The mayor of Slavutych, the town created and built to house the plant's staff in the aftermath of the 1986 accident, said early on Monday that Russian forces that took over the town at the weekend had now left.

Yuri Fomichev said in an online video post that the troops ""hey completed the work they had set out to do"" and were gone. He originally said three people had been killed in clashes. [L2N2VV04H]
The International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement that it was closely monitoring the situation and expressed concern about the ability of staff to rotate in and out of the station.

SDE BOKER, Israel (Reuters) -Israeli and Arab partners convened for a rare summit in Israel on Sunday attended by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who sought to reassure the U.S. allies over Washington's diplomacy with Iran.
The issue is likely to dominate the two-day gathering, which includes foreign ministers from three Arab states that normalised ties with Israel in 2020, even as peacemaking with the Palestinians remained stalled.
Blinken's visit comes as some U.S. allies in the region question President Joe Biden administration's commitment and brace for fallout from an Iranian nuclear deal and the Ukrainian crisis.
The nuclear talks had been close to an agreement several weeks ago until Russia made last-minute demands of the United States, insisting that sanctions imposed on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine should not affect its trade with Iran.
Restoring a 2015 nuclear deal ""is the best way to put Iran's nuclear programme back in to the box it was in"", Blinken said.
But whether or not that happens, ""our commitment to the core principle of Iran never acquiring a nuclear weapon is unwavering,"" he said alongside Israeli counterpart Yair Lapid in Jerusalem, before the summit got under way.
""The United States will continue to stand up to Iran when it threatens us or when it threatens our allies and partners,"" Blinken said.
In Israel, internal security concerns deepened when Arab assailants, identified by security officials as Israeli citizens and Islamic State sympathisers, shot and killed two border police officers in Hadera, a city 50 km (30 miles) north of Tel Aviv. Police shot the two men dead.
Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, according to a statement posted on the group's Telegram account. 
On Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Blinken wrote: ""We condemn today's terrorist attack in Hadera, Israel. Such senseless acts of violence and murder have no place in society."" At the summit, Blinken is also expected to press Arab allies to step up support for Ukraine to fend off Russia's invasion as several Gulf nations have so far stopped short of providing meaningful assistance. 
After talks with Blinken, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who has cautioned that a nuclear deal with Iran would not be binding on Israel, said he hoped Washington ""will hear the concerned voices from the region, Israel's and others'"".
Attending the Lapid-hosted summit in a desert hotel will be the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco, which were part of the so-called Abraham Accords brokered by the Trump administration to normalise ties with Israel.
Egypt's foreign minister, whose country on Saturday marked 43 years of peace with Israel, will also join the summit.
""Normalisation is becoming the new normal in the region,"" Blinken said, adding that Washington hoped ""to bring others in"".

Before travelling to the summit venue, Blinken held talks in the occupied West Bank with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and voiced continued U.S. commitment to a two-state solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The venue for the foreign ministers' meeting is Sde Boker, where Israel's founding father and first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, retired and is buried.

SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korea will continue to develop ""formidable striking capabilities"" that cannot be bartered or sold for anything, leader Kim Jong Un said, according to state media on Monday, as he visited workers involved with the country's biggest missile test.
Kim was meeting with officials, scientists, technicians and workers who contributed to a missile launch on Thursday, which North Korea said was its largest intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), state news agency KCNA reported.
""Only when one is equipped with the formidable striking capabilities, overwhelming military power that cannot be stopped by anyone, one can prevent a war, guarantee the security of the country and contain and put under control all threats and blackmails by the imperialists,"" Kim said, according to the report.
While personally overseeing the test on Thursday, Kim said the new ICBM was to help deter any military moves by the United States, which remains technically at war with the North after the 1950-1953 Korean War ended in an armistice rather than a peace agreement.
Washington has sought to pressure Pyongyang into surrendering or reducing its arsenal of nuclear weapons and ICBMs, which may be able to strike targets in the United States.
But Kim said his self-defence force ""can not be bartered nor be bought with anything"" and will be held firm without the slightest vacillation despite harsh trials and difficulties.
North Korea will continue to build a ""more perfect and stronger strategic force,"" Kim said, referring to the country's nuclear force.
The United States said on Friday it will push United Nations sanctions on North Korea to be strengthened over ""increasingly dangerous provocations,"" but China and Russia signaled opposition and instead argued for such measures to be eased.

North Korea said Thursday's missile was the Hwasong-17, and Japan and South Korea confirmed that flight data showed the launch flew higher and longer than any previous North Korean test.
But analysts said that state media coverage appeared to be trying to pass off footage from a previous launch, and South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported on Sunday that intelligence officials in Seoul and Washington believe the North actually tested an older and slightly smaller Hwasong-15 ICBM.

LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukraine is willing to become neutral and compromise over the status of the eastern Donbass region as part of a peace deal, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday, even as another top Ukrainian official accused Russia of aiming to carve the country in two. 
Zelenskiy took his message directly to Russian journalists in a video call that the Kremlin pre-emptively warned Russian media not to report, saying any agreement must be guaranteed by third parties and put to a referendum.
""Security guarantees and neutrality, non-nuclear status of our state. We are ready to go for it,"" he said, speaking in Russian.
But even as Turkey is set to host talks this week, Ukraine's head of military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, said Russian President Vladimir Putin was aiming to seize the eastern part of Ukraine. 
""In fact, it is an attempt to create North and South Korea in Ukraine,"" he said, referring to the division of Korea after World War Two. Zelenskiy has urged the West to give Ukraine tanks, planes and missiles to help fend off Russian forces. 
In a call with Putin on Sunday, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan agreed to hold talks this week in Istanbul and called for a ceasefire and better humanitarian conditions, his office said. Ukrainian and Russian negotiators confirmed that in-person talks would take place. 
Top American officials sought on Sunday to clarify that the United States does not have a policy of regime change in Russia, after President Joe Biden said at the end of a speech in Poland on Saturday that Putin ""cannot remain in power"". 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Biden had simply meant Putin could not be ""empowered to wage war"" against Ukraine or anywhere else.
After more than four weeks of conflict, Russia has failed to seize any major Ukrainian city and signalled on Friday it was scaling back its ambitions to focus on securing the Donbass region, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting the Ukrainian army for the past eight years. 
A local leader in the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic said on Sunday the region could soon hold a referendum on joining Russia, just as happened in Crimea after Russia seized the Ukrainian peninsula in 2014.
Crimeans voted overwhelmingly to break with Ukraine and join Russia -- a vote that much of the world refused to recognise.
Budanov predicted Ukraine's army would repel Russian forces by launching a guerrilla warfare offensive.
""Then there will be one relevant scenario left for the Russians, how to survive,"" he said.
Ukraine's foreign ministry spokesperson also dismissed talk of any referendum in eastern Ukraine.
""All fake referendums in the temporarily occupied territories are null and void and will have no legal validity,"" Oleg Nikolenko told Reuters.
'CRUEL AND SENSELESS'
Moscow says the goals for what Putin calls a ""special military operation"" include demilitarising and ""denazifying"" its neighbour. Ukraine and its Western allies call this a pretext for unprovoked invasion.
Ukraine has described previous negotiations, some of which have taken place in Russian ally Belarus, as ""very difficult"". 
The invasion has devastated several Ukrainian cities, caused a major humanitarian crisis and displaced an estimated 10 million people, nearly a quarter of Ukraine's population.
Tatyana Manyek, who crossed the Danube by ferry into Romania on Sunday with other refugees, said people in her home city of Odesa were ""very afraid"" but she would have stayed were it not for her daughter.
""It would be very difficult to provide the child with basic living conditions. That's why we decided to leave,"" she said, clutching a pet dog in her arms.
In his Sunday blessing, Pope Francis called for an end to the ""cruel and senseless"" conflict.
CALL FOR WEAPONS
Zelenskiy demanded in a late-night television address on Saturday that Western nations hand over military hardware that was ""gathering dust"" in stockpiles, saying his nation needed just 1% of NATO's aircraft and 1% of its tanks.
Western nations have given Ukraine anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles as well as small arms and protective equipment, without offering heavy armour or planes.
Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko said Russia had started destroying Ukrainian fuel and food storage centres. Appearing to confirm that, Russia said its missiles had wrecked a fuel deposit on Saturday as well as a military repair plant near the western city of Lviv.
Ukraine was mounting small counter-offensive actions as Russian forces try to encircle its forces in eastern Ukraine, a Ukrainian presidential advisor said.
The United Nations has confirmed 1,119 civilian deaths and 1,790 injuries across Ukraine but says the real toll is likely to be higher. Ukraine said on Sunday 139 children had been killed and more than 205 wounded so far in the conflict.

Ukraine and Russia agreed two ""humanitarian corridors"" to evacuate civilians from frontline areas on Sunday, including allowing people to leave by car from the southern city of Mariupol, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.
The encircled port, located between Crimea and eastern areas held by Russian-backed separatists, has been devastated by weeks of heavy bombardment. Thousands of residents are sheltering in basements with scarce water, food, medicine or power.

Azeri troops in 2020 drove ethnic Armenian forces out of swathes of territory they had controlled since the 1990s in and around Nagorno-Karabakh before Russia brokered a ceasefire.
Russia said on Saturday it was deeply concerned about a rise in tensions in Nagorno-Karabakh and called for calm after what it said were breaches of the 2020 ceasefire brokered by President Vladimir Putin.
Russia said Azerbaijan had violated the agreement by allowing its forces to enter a zone policed by Russian peacekeepers near the village of Farrukh but that Azerbaijan had by Sunday withdrawn the soldiers.
Azerbaijan, though, denied the Russian statement.

""There has been no change in the positions of the Azeri army in the village of Farrukh, which is part of the sovereign territories of our country,"" the Azeri defence ministry said.
""The information about the withdrawal of units of the Azerbaijani Army from those positions does not reflect the truth. Our army is in full control of the operational situation,"" Azerbaijan's defence ministry said in a statement.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - El Salvador's Congress approved on Sunday emergency powers that temporarily suspended some constitutional protections after the Central American country recorded a sharp rise in killings attributed to criminal gangs.
Police reported a total of 62 homicides on Saturday in the nation of some 6.5 million people. It was the highest daily toll of homicides so far this century, according to Celia Medrano, a longtime human rights advocate.
In response, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele asked Congress to approve the emergency measures, which include restrictions on free assembly and the inviolability of correspondence and communications, as well as an extension of administrative detention.
""We approve the exceptional regime, which will allow our government to protect the lives of Salvadorans and confront criminality head-on,"" said Ernesto Castro, the president of Congress, after holding an extraordinary session early on Sunday.
After the vote, Bukele praised the move.
""The measures to be taken will be implemented by the relevant institutions and announced only when necessary. For the vast majority of people, life continues normal. God bless us all,"" Bukele wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
In 2015, El Salvador recorded a rate of 103 homicides for every 100,000 people, one of the highest in the world. Figures show that rate has fallen steadily since Bukele took office in 2019. 

Yet, critics say Bukele's administration has been marked by democratic backsliding, as he has sought to consolidate his control over the legislative and judicial branches. 
His government has also been accused of brokering a pact https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/exclusive-salvadoran-ex-prosecutor-says-government-quashed-probe-into-pact-with-2021-12-28 with the two main gangs, offering gang members better prison conditions, money and other benefits in exchange for them reducing homicide rates and giving electoral support to Bukele's party at legislative elections. He has repeatedly denied those accusations.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Canadian indigenous peoples meet Pope Francis this week to ask him to apologise for the Catholic Church's role in residential schools where children were abused and their culture denied.
More than 30 indigenous elders, residential schools survivors and young people will meet him several times at the Vatican between Monday and Friday in what Canada's Catholic Church has called a process of healing and reconciliation.
""We expect that these private encounters will allow the Holy Father to meaningfully address both the ongoing trauma and legacy of suffering faced by Indigenous Peoples to this day,"" Canada's bishops said in a statement.
The meetings would also focus on ""the role of the Catholic Church in the residential school system, which contributed to the suppression of indigenous languages, culture and spirituality,"" it said.
The recurring schools scandal broke out again last year with the discovery of the remains of 215 children at the former Indian Residential School in Kamloops in the Western Canadian province of British Columbia. 
The discovery at the school, which closed in 1978, reopened old wounds and brought new demands for accountability. Hundreds more unmarked burial sites have been found since.
""This is something that is an important step,"" said Gerald Antoine, chief of the Dene people and regional chief of the Assembly of First Nations, said of the meetings.
He told a news conference in Canada that the delegates would ask the pope ""to visit our family and to apologise. I think this is an issue which is long overdue.""
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has asked Francis to make an apology during a visit to Canada.
Last October, Francis accepted an invitation from the Canadian bishops. Vatican sources say he likely will go this summer.
The stated aim of the schools was to assimilate indigenous children. They operated between 1831 and 1996 and were run by several Christian denominations on behalf of the government, most by the Catholic Church.
About 150,000 children were taken from their homes. Many were subjected to abuse, rape and malnutrition in what the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2015 called ""cultural genocide.""

Delegates from the Inuit and Metis people and from the Assembly of First Nations will have three separate private meetings with the pope before he addresses all on Friday.
Francis was elected pope nearly two decades after the last of the schools closed. He already has apologised generically for the Church's role in colonialism in the Americas.

Some 15 girls and 32 boys, as well 52 children whose sex is as yet unknown, were among the dead, the United Nations said in a statement which covered the period between when the war began on Feb. 24 and midnight on March 26.
The true casualty figures are expected to be considerably higher, the world body said, with reports delayed in some regions where intense hostilities are going on, while many reports still require corroboration.

This was particularly the case around the besieged southern port of Mariupol, as well as Volnovakha in the Donetsk region, Izium in the Kharkiv region, Popasna and Rubizhne in the Luhansk region, and Trostianets in the Sumy region, the United Nations said. 
Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes, the United Nations said.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada is increasingly relying on temporary residents to meet its labor force needs, according to a Reuters analysis of official data, but this phenomenon makes workers vulnerable and fails to provide wage growth or stability to businesses, warn workers, advocates, economists and industry groups.
Temporary residents come to Canada on time-limited visas, some of them tied to specific employers, after which they are expected to return to their countries of origin. While there are ways to become permanent residents, and many come intending to do so, there are often significant hurdles to achieving this.
Offering temporary visas is seen as an easy fix for tight job markets and may allow politicians to avoid the potential political fallout of large numbers of new permanent residents, analysts say. 
But this trend can depress labor standards, which employers might otherwise boost to entice hires. People with permanent resident status are better positioned to demand better working conditions, economists say.
Wage suppression can reduce the overall population's spending power and hurt economic growth, said economist Armine Yalnizyan, Atkinson Fellow on the Future of Workers.
University of Waterloo economist Mikal Skuterud argues that to promote economic equality it may make more sense to prioritize the immigration of higher-skilled people, who will exert downward pressure on the highest salaries while employers of lower-paid workers raise wages to woo employees.
Temporary residents - who often come from Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean - say their precarious immigration status leaves them open to exploitation. 
The programs are an ""essential tool"" for Canada's economy, its immigration minister told Reuters, but he sees room for broader pathways to permanency.
The number of people living and working in Canada on a temporary basis has grown faster than the annual number of new permanent residents in the past decade, according to Reuters analysis of federal immigration data.
In 2020 temporary residents were more than triple the number of new permanent residents; last year, when Canada set a permanent resident record, it had more than twice as many temporary ones.
This growth has been fueled in part by international students, whose ranks more than doubled in a decade. The number of people in Canada on post-graduate work permits, meanwhile, almost quintupled between 2012 and 2021.
Many international students can work, subject to different limitations, but Canada's immigration department said it doesn't know how many do.
PATH TO PERMANENT RESIDENCY
Kathleen Sullivan, CEO of Food and Beverage Canada, said some of her members, strapped for labor, are racing to bring in temporary foreign workers for the first time.
But they would prefer stability, she said.
""If I have a permanent job, I want a permanent employee – I’m investing in training, I’m investing in them,"" she said.
Canada's immigration system prioritizes high-skilled jobs but its labor market needs people doing lower-skilled work, too. Canada’s job vacancy rate in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 5.3%, and was highest in accommodation and food services, at 10.8%. That sector also had the lowest average hourly wages, according to Statistics Canada, at C$15.50 ($12.37) late last year.
Temporary foreign workers saved Louis Bontorin's family bakery, he said. But his goal is to make them permanent. Of the 60 temporary workers they brought over in five years, he figures all but five are in Canada to stay.
It would make a big difference for people to have permanent residency on arrival, he said. ""It really changes the dynamic of how they sort of plan with their family,"" he said. 
Last year, Canada announced a limited plan to make 90,000 temporary residents permanent. So far, it has given 23,880 permanent residency; the immigration department said more applications are being processed.

Canada’s Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Minister Sean Fraser said in a January interview it may be time to establish a path to permanent residency.
""Certain temporary programs can develop into a tool to solve permanent and persistent gaps in the labor force. I think there is a better answer.""

DOHA (Reuters) -U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley said on Sunday he was not confident that a nuclear deal between world powers and the Islamic Republic was imminent, dampening expectations after 11 months of talks in Vienna that have stalled.
The failure of efforts to restore a 2015 accord, which would curb Tehran's nuclear programme in exchange for lifting sanctions that have hammered Iran's economy, risks raising political tensions in the Middle East and further increasing world oil prices, analysts say. 
""I can't be confident it is imminent... A few months ago we thought we were pretty close as well,"" Malley told the Doha Forum international conference. 
""In any negotiations, when there's issues that remain open for so long, it tells you something about how hard it is to bridge the gap.""
His assessment of the negotiations in Vienna came after Kamal Kharrazi, a senior advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said a deal could come soon.
""Yes, it's imminent. It depends on the political will of the United States,"" Kharrazi told the conference. 
LAST-MINUTE DEMANDS
Then-U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned the nuclear pact in 2018, prompting Tehran to start breaking nuclear limits set under the deal. Months of on-and-off talks to revive the deal were delayed earlier this month as Russia wanted guarantees it would be able to carry out its work as a party to the deal.
But there are still outstanding issues. Kharrazi said in order for the deal to be revived Washington must remove the foreign terrorist organisation (FTO) designation against Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). 
The IRGC, created by the Islamic Republic's late founder Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, is more than just a military force and has enormous political clout. It was placed under sanctions in 2017 and put on the FTO list in April of 2019.
""IRGC is a national army and a national army being listed as a terrorist group certainly is not acceptable,"" said Kharrazi.
Malley said regardless of what happens, many sanctions on the IRGC will remain.
Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett urged the United States to heed calls against any removal of the Revolutionary Guards from the U.S. terrorism blacklist.
""We're concerned about the intention to delist the IRGC,"" Bennett told Blinken. ""I hope the United States will hear the concerned voices from the region, Israel's and others, on this very important issue."" 
IRAN SEEKING GUARANTEE
Tehran has been pushing for guarantees that any future U.S. president would not withdraw from the agreement and the extent to which sanctions would be rolled back is another unresolved issue.
The United States' allies in the Gulf and Israel believe Iran is a security threat and have deep misgivings over the talks.
Israel and the United States will continue to cooperate in preventing a nuclear-armed Iran, Israel's foreign minister said on Sunday.
""We have disagreements about a nuclear agreement and its consequences, but open and honest dialogue is part of the strength of our friendship,"" Yair Lapid said in Jerusalem during a joint press conference with visiting U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
Blinken said a return to the 2015 deal was the best way to contain Iran's nuclear programme.
But whether or not that happens, ""our commitment to the core principle of Iran never acquiring a nuclear weapon is unwavering"", he said.
The issue is likely to dominate a two-day summit in Israel which will include foreign ministers from three Arab states.

In Tehran, EU envoy Enrique Mora, who is the coordinator of the talks, met with Iran's chief nuclear negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani on Sunday to discuss pending issues in the nuclear talks.
Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian told Mora in a meeting that ""the lack of an American political decision is the current obstacle we have in achieving results in Vienna talks"", according to the semi-official Fars news agency.

Flight MU5735 crashed on Monday, killing all 132 people onboard, mainland China's deadliest aviation disaster in 28 years. 
Heading to coastal Guangzhou from the southwestern city of Kunming, the plane dived from cruising altitude around the time it should have started its landing descent. The dead included nine crew members. 
The black box, which could shed light on the cause of the crash, has been sent to Beijing for examination and analysis, state media reported. The other black box - the cockpit voice recorder - was delivered to experts in the Chinese capital after being found on Wednesday. 
It was too soon to determine the cause of the crash, and crashes are usually the result of a combination of factors, experts said. 
The second black box was dug out of a slope at the crash site about 9:20 a.m. (0120 GMT) in muddy conditions after rain in recent days. 
The device, part of which was badly damaged, was recovered 1.5 metres (5 feet) underground and 40 metres (130 feet) from the point of impact, said Zhu Tao, head of aviation safety at the Civil Aviation Administration of China.
""Civil aviation investigators at the site confirmed that the storage unit of the flight data recorder has been found,"" Zhu told a news conference in Guangxi. ""Parts of the recorder were seriously damaged, but the outside of the storage unit was in fairly good condition.""
The crash was the deadliest since a China Northwest Airlines flight from Xian to Guangzhou crashed, killing all 160 people on board.
RUMOURS
Monday's flight briefly appeared to pull out of its nosedive before resuming its plunge to earth, according to flight tracking website FlightRadar24. Its data showed the aircraft was plummeting 31,000 feet per minute.
The pilots did not respond to repeated calls from air traffic controllers and nearby planes during the rapid descent, authorities said.
The disaster has shocked China, sending social media into overdrive as netizens parsed what little was known for clues. 
China's cyberspace watchdog ordered internet platforms and websites to clamp down on rumours, conspiracy theories and any online mockery of the disaster.
Since the crash, authorities have banned users and closed accounts to deal with more than 167,000 rumours, ranging from the deaths of seven directors of a company to divine prophesies of a plane crash by the end of March. 

China is leading the crash investigation. The United States has been invited to take part, as the Boeing 737-800 was designed and manufactured there.
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said it was working with U.S. and Chinese authorities to resolve visa and COVID-19 quarantine issues before participating.

William released the statement at the end of an eight-day tour with his wife Kate to Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas that included protests and calls for reparations payments by Britain and an apology for slavery. 
Some British and international media have also criticised some images from the tour, such as the royals shaking hands with Jamaican children through wire fences and standing on an open-top vehicle to observe a military parade that recreated an image of Queen Elizabeth doing the same thing in the 1950s.
""I know that this tour has brought into even sharper focus questions about the past and the future,"" William said. ""In Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas, that future is for the people to decide upon."" 
William, second in line to the British throne, had travelled to the Caribbean with Kate to mark Queen Elizabeth's 70 years as monarch. But it came as some countries consider cutting ties with the British monarchy and after Barbados dropped the 95-year-old queen as head of state and became a republic.
Elizabeth remains queen of 15 realms, including Australia, Canada and New Zealand. 
William, whose official title is Duke of Cambridge, said he and his wife wanted to serve.
""For us that's not telling people what to do. It is about serving and supporting them in whatever way they think best, by using the platform we are lucky to have.""

He added that he was also not thinking about who would lead the Commonwealth of Nations, a group of 54 countries, almost all of which are former colonies of the United Kingdom, which is primarily focused on promoting democracy and development. 
The queen is the head of the Commonwealth and while the role is not hereditary, it will pass to William's father and heir to the throne, Prince Charles.

The move comes after the Taliban backtracked on their previous commitment to open high schools to girls, a u-turn that shocked many Afghans and drew condemnation from humanitarian agencies and foreign governments. 
The United States on Friday cancelled planned meetings with Taliban officials on key economic issues due to its decision on Wednesday.
The sources, who are not being named for security reasons, said that the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice sent airlines a letter on Saturday informing of them of the new restrictions. 
They added that unaccompanied women who had already booked tickets would be allowed to travel on Sunday and Monday. Some women with tickets had been turned away at Kabul's airport on Saturday, they said.
Spokespeople for the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice and the Ministry of Culture and Information did not immediately respond to request for comment. 
A Taliban administration spokesman had previously said that women travelling abroad for study should be accompanied by a male relative. 
The Taliban say they have changed since their previous rule from 1996 to 2001 in which they barred women from education, work or leaving the house without a male relative. They say they are allowing women their rights in accordance with Islamic law and Afghan culture. 
However, the closure of high schools along with some restrictions on women in work and the requirement that women have a chaperone for long-distance travel has drawn criticism from many Afghan women and rights groups.

It was not immediately clear whether the restrictions on air travel would allow any exemptions, for example in emergencies or for women with no living male relatives in the country and whether it applied to foreigners or women with dual citizenship. 
The international community has so far not officially recognised the Taliban administration and enforcement of sanctions has crippled the country's banking sector which combined with slashed development funding has plunged the country into a humanitarian crisis.

Russia hit a fuel depot being used by Ukrainian forces near Lviv with long-range missiles and used cruise missiles to strike a plant in the city being used to repair anti-aircraft systems, radar stations and sights for tanks, the ministry said.
""The armed forces of the Russian Federation continue offensive actions as part of the special military operation,"" the ministry's spokesman Igor Konashenkov said in a statement.
The ministry showed video of the missile strikes in Lviv.
Officials in Lviv, just 60 km (40 miles) from the border with NATO-member Poland, said people had been wounded in the missile attacks.

Russia also used sea-based long-range missiles to destroy an arsenal of S-300 missiles and BUK anti-aircraft missile systems near Kyiv, the ministry said. Russian forces also destroyed a number of drones, it said.
Russia has started destroying Ukrainian fuel and food storage depots, meaning the government will have to disperse the stocks of both in the near future, Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko said on Sunday.

Located in a scenic lake in Batangas province south of Manila, the 311-metre (1,020-foot) Taal volcano spewed an 800-metre-tall plume followed by one of 400 metres. This followed a phreatomagmatic eruption - the result of super-hot magma interacting with water - from its main crater on Saturday.
The seismology and volcanology agency recorded 14 volcanic earthquakes around Taal in the 24 hours after the first eruption.
""Activity at the main crater was dominated by upwelling of hot volcanic fluids in its lake,"" it said in a bulletin, warning of a possible volcanic tsunami should stronger eruptions subsequently occur.
The alert for Taal volcano remained at level 3 on the five-level scale, meaning ""there is a magmatic intrusion at the main crater that may further drive succeeding eruptions"".
President Rodrigo Duterte's office said it was closely monitoring the situation. As of Sunday, nearly 3,000 people had been evacuated to temporary shelters, it said.

In January 2020, Taal spewed a column of ash and steam as high as 15 km, forcing more than 100,000 people to evacuate while dozens of flights were cancelled and heavy ash fell as far away as Manila.
A Taal eruption in 1911 killed more than 1,300 people.

At the end of a tour with his wife Kate that has been marked by protests about the legacy of the British Empire, William, Queen Elizabeth's grandson, acknowledged the relationship between the three Caribbean states and the Crown was changing. 
""Next year, I know you are all looking forward to celebrating 50 years of independence – your Golden Anniversary,"" he said in a speech in the Bahamas capital Nassau.
""And with Jamaica celebrating 60 years of independence this year, and Belize celebrating 40 years of independence last year, I want to say this: We support with pride and respect your decisions about your future. Relationships evolve. Friendship endures.""
His speech is the clearest indication the royal family would back the three nations ditching the queen as their head of state, echoing the decision taken by Barbados last November.
Usually, Buckingham Palace says such matters are for the local people and politicians to decide.
During her 70 years on the throne - a landmark that the tour was to designed to mark - Elizabeth has watched as former British colonies have cut their ties, but she remains queen of 15 realms, including Australia, Canada and New Zealand.
However, the tour by William and Kate, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, has thrown a spotlight on the waning support for the monarchy in the Caribbean. During the trip there have been protests and calls for reparations payments by Britain and an apology for slavery. 
Meanwhile the Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness told William directly at a meeting on Wednesday that his country wanted to be ""independent"".

Some British media have also criticised public relations mistakes which have seen the royals shaking hands with Jamaican children through wire fences and other appearances, described as ""tone-deaf"" blunders by the Daily Mirror tabloid because it said they appeared to be a throwback to colonial times.
The tribulations of the tour have reflected wider questions about the role and future of the royals back in Britain following the scandal of a U.S. sex abuse lawsuit involving the queen's second son Prince Andrew - settled last month - and criticism of the institution from William's younger brother, Prince Harry.

(Reuters) -Chinese authorities on Sunday recovered the second black box from a China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) jet that plunged into a mountainside last Monday with 132 people on board, state media reported. [nL2N2VU011]
The recovery of the flight data recorder (FDR) from the crash site follows the retrieval of the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) on Wednesday.
This is how the black box readout process works.
WHAT ARE BLACK BOXES?
They are not actually black but high-visibility orange. Experts disagree how the nickname originated but it has become synonymous with the quest for answers when planes crash.
Many historians attribute their invention to Australian scientist David Warren in the 1950s. They are mandatory.
The aim is not to establish legal liability but to identify causes and help prevent accidents.
HOW HAVE THEY EVOLVED?
The earliest devices recorded limited data on wire or foil. Modern ones use solid state memory.
The recordings are housed inside crash-survivable containers able to withstand 3,400 times the force of gravity on impact.
Both black box recordings were recovered from a Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX crash in March 2019 that, like the China Eastern plane, dove into the ground at a very high velocity.
HOW BIG ARE THEY?
They weigh about 10 pounds (4.5 kg) and contain four main parts:
* a chassis or interface designed to secure the device and facilitate recording and playback
* an underwater locator beacon
* the core housing or ""Crash-Survivable Memory Unit"" made of stainless steel or titanium
* inside there, the recordings on chips or older formats.
There are two recorders: a CVR for pilot voices and cockpit sounds, and a FDR that captures information on parameters including altitude, airspeed, heading and engine thrust.
HOW WILL THE RECORDERS BE HANDLED?
Technicians peel away protective material and carefully clean connections to make sure they do not accidentally erase data. The audio or data file must be downloaded and copied.
The data itself means nothing at first. It must be decoded from raw files before being turned into graphs.
Investigators sometimes use ""spectral analysis"" - a way of examining sounds that allows scientists to pick out barely audible alarms or the first fleeting crack of an explosion.
HOW MUCH INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE?
Both of the China Eastern jet's black boxes were manufactured by Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON), Chinese accident investigator Mao Yanfeng told reporters on Wednesday, without naming the models.
The CVR installed at the rear of the passenger cabin had a recording time of two to three hours, with four channels including the captain and first officer, a backup channel and one for ambient noise in the cockpit, he said.
The China Eastern plane crashed 66 minutes after take-off.
The FDR at the back of the cargo bay had a recording time of 25 hours including around 1,000 data parameters, Mao said.
WHERE WILL THE DATA BE READ?
The CVR, discovered first, was sent to an institute in Beijing for decoding. 
The recording material from the CVR appeared to have survived the crash in relatively good shape, Mao said.
It could take 10 to 15 days to arrive at a preliminary analysis, and longer before a final conclusion can be presented in a report, according to Chinese state media.
The FDR will be sent to Beijing for checks on Sunday, according to state media.
WHEN WILL RESULTS BE MADE PUBLIC?

Interim reports into a crash are published after a month but are often sparse. Deeper investigations take a year or more to complete.
Experts say air accidents usually result from a combination of factors.

LVIV, Ukraine and WARSAW (Reuters) -Rockets struck the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Saturday, signalling a potential new front in Moscow's invasion as U.S. President Joe Biden decried Russian President Vladimir Putin's grip on power and sought to steel Europe for a long fight ahead.
Intense fighting raged in several parts of Ukraine, suggesting there will be no swift let-up in the month-old war while Biden framed the fight as part of the historic struggle for democratic freedoms in a major address from Poland as he concluded his European trip aimed at bolstering Western resolve. 
""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power,"" Biden said in Warsaw. A White House official later said Biden was not urging regime change but was saying ""Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region."" 
The Kremlin dismissed Biden's comment, saying it was ""not for Biden to decide."" 
After more than four weeks of fighting, Russia has failed to seize any major Ukrainian city and the conflict has killed thousands of people, sent nearly 3.8 million abroad and driven more than half of Ukraine's children from their homes, according to the United Nations.
Moscow signalled on Friday it was scaling back its military ambitions to focus on territory claimed by Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Saturday implored the West to speed up military aid.
Four rockets on Saturday hit the outskirts of Lviv, some 60 km (40 miles) from the border with Poland just before Biden delivered his remarks in Warsaw. 
The attack appeared to be the first time the western Ukrainian city was struck after so far escaping the heavy bombardment that has devastated other cities closer to Russia.
Regional Governor Maksym Kozytskyy said five people had been wounded and residents were told to head to shelters after an initial strike hit mid-afternoon. Reuters witnesses saw black smoke rising from the northeast side of the city and Lviv's mayor said an oil storage facility had been hit.
Ukrainian officials later reported another strike significantly damaged Lviv's infrastructure but that so far there were no reported deaths. 
Russian forces also seized Slavutych, a town where workers at the nearby defunct Chernobyl nuclear plant live, and three people were killed, Interfax Ukraine news agency quoted the local mayor as saying. 
Ukrainian staff have continued to work at Chernobyl after the plant was seized by Russian forces, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has expressed alarm about the situation if workers are unable to rotate. 
Russian forces also fired at a nuclear research facility in the city of Kharkiv, the Ukrainian parliament said in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post on Saturday.
In the encircled southern city of Mariupol, Mayor Vadym Boichenko said the situation remained critical, with street fighting in the centre. Mariupol has been devastated by weeks of Russian fire.
UKRAINE KEPT WAITING
A visibly irritated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in his nightly address, again demanded Western nations send military hardware and asked whether they were intimidated by Moscow, saying, ""We've already been waiting 31 days.""
Zelenskiy also expressed disappointment over the lack of transferred aircraft in a call with Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda on Saturday, Zelenskiy's office said. Washington had rejected a surprise offer by Poland to transfer Russian-made MiG-29 fighter jets to a U.S. base in Germany to replenish Ukraine's air force. 
The United States, which has already pledged billions in aid, will give an additional $100 million for field gear and other civilian security assistance for Ukraine's border guard and police, it announced Saturday.
Zelenskiy earlier compared Mariupol's devastation to the destruction inflicted on the Syrian city of Aleppo by combined Syrian and Russian forces in Syria's civil war, speaking to Qatar's Doha Forum via video link.
He also warned of dire consequence if his country - one of the world's major grains producers - could not export its foodstuffs and urged energy-producing countries to boost output so Russia cannot use its oil and gas wealth to ""blackmail"" other nations.
BIDEN IN POLAND
Biden earlier on Saturday sharpened his tone calling Putin a ""butcher"" after meeting Ukrainian refugees in Poland -- a comment the Kremlin was cited by Russia's TASS news agency as saying would further damage prospects for mending Russian-U.S. ties. 
Biden also saw Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov in the Polish capital Warsaw in his first face-to-face meeting with top Ukrainian officials since the start of the war.
Biden's visit to Poland was his final stop on a trip to Europe that has underscored his opposition to the Russian invasion, his solidarity with Ukraine and his determination to work closely with Western allies to confront the crisis.
""We need to be clear-eyed. This battle will not be won in days or months ... We need to steer ourselves for a long fight ahead,"" Biden said in his speech. He also urged Europe to accelerate the shift to cleaner renewable energy and wean itself off Russian oil and gas.
Zelenskiy pushed late on Friday for further talks with Russia after its defence ministry said a first phase of its operation in Ukraine was mostly complete and that it would now focus on the Donbass region bordering Russia, where Russian-backed forces have been fighting pro-government forces since 2014.
Reframing Russia's goals may make it easier for Putin to claim a face-saving victory, analysts said.
Moscow has until now said its goals for what it calls its ""special military operation"" include demilitarizing and ""denazifying"" its neighbour. Ukraine and its Western allies have called that a baseless pretext for an unprovoked invasion.
""It's a lie,"" Biden said. ""Russia has strangled democracy — has sought to do so elsewhere, not only in its homeland.""
The United Nations has confirmed 1,104 civilian deaths and 1,754 injuries in Ukraine since the Feb. 24 invasion but says the real toll is likely higher. Ukraine says 136 children have been killed.
Russia's defence ministry said 1,351 Russian soldiers had been killed and 3,825 wounded, the Interfax news agency reported on Friday. Ukraine says 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed. Reuters could not independently verify the claims.
LAID WASTE
Footage from Mariupol, home to 400,000 people before the war, showed destroyed buildings, burnt out vehicles and shell-shocked survivors venturing out for provisions. Residents have buried victims in makeshift graves as the ground thaws.
""It's scary, I don't know how we're going to survive,"" an elderly woman resident said, declining to identify herself by name. ""We're lying there, hoping they won't bomb us. Look at how many dead bodies we've buried around the building.""
To the north, battle lines near the capital Kyiv have been frozen for weeks with two main Russian armoured columns stuck northwest and east of the city. 
The Russian defence ministry said its troops had seized a dug-in command centre in a Kyiv suburb and captured more than 60 Ukrainian servicemen. Reuters could not immediately verify this.

The general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said Russia's losses were such that Moscow was conducting ""hidden mobilizations"" and taking battle tanks out of long-term storage. 
A British intelligence report said Russian forces were relying on indiscriminate bombardments rather than risk large-scale ground operations, a tactic the report said could limit Russian military casualties but would harm more civilians in Ukraine. A later report cited a 60% failure rate among such Russian munitions.

LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) -Four rockets hit the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Saturday, local officials said, in the most significant attack on the city since the start of the war with Russia.
Lviv, just 60 kilometres (40 miles) from the Polish border, has so far escaped the heavy bombardment and fighting that has devastated some Ukrainian cities closer to Russia since Moscow launched its invasion on Feb. 24.
Governor Maksym Kozytskyy said five people had been wounded after two rockets hit a fuel depot and two others later hit a military factory. Earlier he reported powerful explosions in Lviv's eastern outskirts from the strikes.
""Stay in shelters! Do not go out into the streets!,"" he warned after the first strike.
The rockets fell as U.S. President Joseph Biden, speaking in Warsaw during a visit to Poland, condemned Russian aggression and assured Ukraine of the United States's unwavering support. 
""With today's blows, the aggressor sends greetings to President Biden, who is in Poland,"" Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadoviy said in a televised briefing, saying Russia had fired the rockets from Sevastopol in Crimea which it annexed in 2014.
There was no immediate comment on the Lviv attacks from the Russian authorities, who refer to the invasion as a ""special military operation"" aimed at demilitarising Ukraine.
The city authorities did not give the exact locations of the strikes, but said they damaged critical infrastructure, set fire to the fuel depot and blasted the windows out of a school building. No residential buildings were hit, according to the mayor.
Reuters witnesses in central Lviv saw heavy black smoke rising from the northeast side of the city and a strong smell of burning filled the air.
Men huddled together on the street to watch a plume of smoke rising behind an apartment block. Most residents appeared to stay indoors, peeking out from behind curtains as others hurried past on the road carrying their bags.
The Ukrainian president's chief of staff Andriy Yermak said the attacks showed Russia wanted to intimidate Ukraine and the foreign diplomats who have relocated their embassies to Lviv for the perceived relative safety compared to the capital, Kyiv. 
""Ukraine should definitely not be intimidated by such crimes of the Russians, and I want to say to my Western partners once again - close the sky, show strength,"" he said on Telegram.
This referred to Ukraine's repeated request for no-fly zone, which NATO has ruled out.

Lviv had a pre-war population of around 717,000, but for the thousands of families fleeing the worst of the fighting in eastern, southern and central Ukraine, it has become either a place of refuge within the country or a transit hub for people leaving the country.
Two weeks ago, a barrage of Russian missiles hit a large Ukrainian base just 25 km (15 miles) from the border with Poland.

Flight MU5735 was travelling from the southwestern city of Kunming to the port city of Guangzhou on Monday when it plummeted from cruising altitude to crash in a heavily forested area of Guangxi region.
There had been little hope of finding any survivors. Speaking to reporters on Saturday night, Hu Zhenjiang, deputy director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), confirmed that there were no signs of life from the crash site and all 123 passengers and 9 crew members had been killed, state media said.
The search team had earlier said it had identified DNA from 120 of the people on board.
It is still searching for the second black box, or flight data recorder. 
It has, however, found an emergency location transmitter from the plane that was close to where the second black box was installed, said Zhu Tao, director of the Aviation Safety Office of CAAC during an earlier press conference. 
The team is also seeking the data module from the flight data recorder itself.
The other black box, the cockpit voice recorder, was found on Wednesday and has been sent to Beijing for examination by experts.

The search team has been digging for plane parts in heavy mud both by hand and with machinery.
No key compounds from common explosives have been detected in the crash debris, a Guangxi official said.

DOHA (Reuters) -Top EU diplomat Josep Borrell said on Saturday Iran and world powers were ""very close"" to agreement on reviving their 2015 nuclear deal, which would curb Tehran's nuclear programme in exchange for lifting tough sanctions.
Meanwhile Iran's foreign minister appeared to show flexibility on an issue which has been a leading sticking point in the nuclear talks, and Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group launched an apparent peace initiative to end a seven-year war.
Then-U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned the pact in 2018, prompting Tehran to start violating its nuclear limits about a year later, and 11 months of on-and-off talks to revive it paused in Vienna earlier this month after Russia presented a new obstacle.
Russia later said it had received written guarantees that it would be able to carry out its work as a party to the deal, suggesting Moscow could allow it to be resuscitated.
""Now we are very close to an agreement and I hope it will be possible,"" the European Union's Borrell said in an address to the Doha Forum international conference. Borrell later told reporters that he believed a deal could be reached ""in a matter of days"".
The failure of efforts to restore the pact could carry the risk of a regional war, or lead to more harsh Western sanctions on Iran and continued upward pressure on world oil prices that are already high due to the Ukraine conflict, analysts say.
Enrique Mora, the EU coordinator for the nuclear talks, said on Friday he would travel to Tehran on Saturday to meet Iran's chief negotiator.
There are several difficult issues pending. Iran wants the removal of a U.S. foreign terrorist organisation (FTO) designation against its elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).
Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said on Saturday that the lifting of U.S. sanctions on the Revolutionary Guards was among Iran's top demands in talks, but added that senior Guards officials had said that the deal should not be held up over the issue of sanctions against the Guards if the accord serves the interests of the people.
""But the Guards are among the main institutions in the country... and despite the permission of the Guards officials, this is one of our main issues,"" Amirabdollahian told state TV.
Yemen's Houthi group said on Saturday it was suspending missile and drone strikes for three days on Saudi Arabia, Iran's regional rival, in a peace initiative it said could be a lasting commitment if the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen stopped air strikes and lifted port restrictions.
Amirabdollahian said this week that a nuclear deal can be reached in the short term if the United States is pragmatic.

But U.S. officials have been more cautious in their assessment of efforts to revive the accord, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). 
Tehran has also been seeking guarantees that the United States will not unilaterally withdraw from any agreement. The extent to which sanctions would be rolled back is another sensitive subject.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The ""monster"" Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) shown this week in North Korean state media after the country's biggest test-fire ever is likely from an earlier launch, analysts said after examining the images and video.
North Korea said the launch on Thursday was of the Hwasong-17, a huge new ICBM unveiled at a pre-dawn military parade in October 2020 but never before publicly tested. 
But analysts said shadows, weather, and other aspects of the imagery suggest the launch shown by North Korea actually happened on a different date and time.
""Multiple pieces of visual evidence suggest North Korea's version of events is misleading at best, and possibly a complete fabrication of a successful Hwasong-17 test at worst,"" NK Pro, a Seoul-based research website that tracks North Korea, said in a report.
There is little doubt that a missile test happened on Thursday, and that it was the longest and highest ever conducted by North Korea. Flight data were independently corroborated by South Korea and Japan, which tracked the launch.
However the NK Pro report said the missile shown in state media coverage may in fact have been one that South Korea said exploded in mid-air shortly after launch on March 16. 
North Korea never publicly acknowledged that apparent test launch or its failure, which reportedly sent debris raining down in or near Pyongyang.
Michael Duitsman, with the U.S.-based James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS), said researchers at the center agreed that some of the footage released by North Korea is from the failed test on the morning of March 16 rather than the March 24 test, which occurred around 2:24 p.m.
Photographs and video released by North Korean state media show a Hwasong-17 lifting off from its 22-wheeled transporter, erector, launch (TEL) vehicle at the Pyongyang airport.
""The TEL's shadow matches a morning launch much better than an afternoon launch,"" he said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
U.S. and South Korean officials previously said that the Hwasong-17 system was tested during launches on Feb. 27 and March 5, but not at full range or capability. Neither Washington or Seoul has confirmed what missile was involved with the failed launch, or commented on the discrepancies in North Korea's claims.

South Korean media have cited unnamed officials saying they were examining whether North Korea had in fact launched an older and smaller type of ICBM, the Hwasong-15, which had previously been test-fired in Nov. 2017.
""While this does not mean that the March 24 test was a Hwasong-15, it does raise questions,"" Duitsman said of the imagery.

SAO JORGE, Portugal (Reuters) - With no idea when they might return, a retired couple had their picture taken outside their beloved house before leaving Sao Jorge, an island in Portugal's Azores that is bracing for disaster following a series of small earthquakes.
Fatima and Antonio Soares, who are in their 70s, decided to leave their home along with dozens of other residents on Saturday, a week since thousands of tremors started to rattle the volcanic, mid-Atlantic island.
Seismologists fear the more than 12,700 tremors, which have had a magnitude of up to 3.3, could trigger a volcanic eruption or a powerful quake.
""I asked the taxi driver to please take a picture of us because I don't know if my house will look the same when I come back,"" Fatima said as the couple waited at Sao Jorge's airport for a flight to the nearby island of Terceira.
""Tears started to fall straight away,"" she said.
The couple, who were on the island when a big quake struck in 1964, are staying at a small hotel for the time being but hope to return to their island, home to around 8,400 people, as soon as possible. 
""Leaving our house at this age is hard,"" Antonio said. 
Dozens of other Sao Jorge residents also left early on Saturday, with the latest government figures showing about 1,250 people left the island on March 23 and March 24 alone. 
The region's CIVISA seismo-volcanic surveillance centre raised the volcanic alert to Level 4 on Wednesday, meaning there is a ""real possibility"" the volcano could erupt for the first time since 1808.
""Annually Sao Jorge has few earthquakes and now we're talking about thousands,"" seismologist Joao Fontiela, who is on the island setting up seismic monitoring stations, told Lusa news agency. 
He thinks the current situation could drag for months. 
CIVISA said there was ""no evidence that a volcanic eruption was imminent"" but said such a scenario could not be discounted. The number of earthquakes remains above normal levels, it said.

The island's ports said on Saturday they were preparing in case of a natural disaster, and authorities are drawing up plans to keep livestock and other animals safe.
Care home residents and those hospitalised in the municipality of Velas, where the majority of the seismic activity has been recorded, have already been transferred to the other side of the island.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq's parliament failed again on Saturday to vote for a president after Iran-backed groups boycotted the session, in a setback to an alliance led by cleric Moqtada al-Sadr which won the election and threatened to remove them from politics.
Sadr had hoped parliament would elect Rebar Ahmed, a veteran Kurdish intelligence official and current interior minister of Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region.
But only 202 members of parliament out of 329 were present, which is less than the necessary two-thirds quorum needed to choose a new president for the mostly ceremonial post, while 126 lawmakers boycotted the session.
""It is a storm in a cup. Today is a good proof that the party that had claimed that it has the majority had failed to achieve it. It is a bad situation getting worse"" said Farhad Alaaldin, chairman of the Iraq Advisory Council, a policy research institute.
A win for Sadr's allies would threaten to exclude Tehran's allies from power for the first time in years.
The delay prolongs a bitter deadlock in Iraqi politics months after an October general election from which Sadr emerged the biggest winner, with his Shi'ite, pro-Iran rivals receiving a hammering at the polls.
    The vote on the president was postponed to Wednesday. The current caretaker government will continue to run the country until a new government is formed. 
    Sadr, a Shi'ite cleric, has pledged to form a government that would exclude key Iranian allies that have long dominated the state, a red line for those parties and militias and the first time they would not have a cabinet place since 2003.
    The candidates put forward for president in the months since the election have been viewed by Iran-aligned groups as Western-leaning and a threat to their interests. 
    An attempt to secure the post for Kurdish politician Hoshyar Zebari, a former foreign minister, failed when Iraq's Supreme Court last month banned his candidacy of over alleged corruption charges that had resurfaced. Zebari, who was backed by Sadr and allies of Sadr, denies the charges.
POLITICAL DEADLOCK
    Under a power-sharing system designed to avoid sectarian conflict, Iraq's president is a Kurd, its prime minister a Shi'ite and its parliament speaker a Sunni.
    Since the U.S.-led invasion of 2003 that toppled Sunni dictator Saddam Hussein, the selection of a president and prime minister after each election has been a long, slow process hampered by political deadlock.
    Iran-aligned groups have normally had their way, using their role in defeating Islamic State in 2017 to catapult commanders into parliamentary seats in an election the following year.
    Sadr opposes all foreign influence in Iraq, including by the United States and Iran. He has increased his political power in recent years but must still contend with his Shi'ite rivals.
    Sadr has vowed to push through what he calls a ""national majority"" government, a euphemism for one that excludes pro-Iran groups. Those groups retain heavily-armed and powerful militias and maintain a grip over many state institutions.
    Sadr's Sadrist Bloc has joined forces with the Kurdish Democratic Party and a Sunni Muslim alliance in efforts to form a parliamentary majority.
    Most Iraqis view all groups involved in governing the country as corrupt. Anger has simmered for years at the Shi'ite-dominated political class that emerged after the 2003 invasion.

    That anger burst into mass demonstrations in 2019, in which government security forces and Iran-aligned militiamen shot dead hundreds of demonstrators.
    Officials and analysts fear Sadr's intensifying face-off with the Iran-aligned groups could descend into violence.

The alert for the Taal volcano, about 70 km (45 miles) south of central Manila, was increased to level 3 from level 2 on the 5-level scale, which the seismology and volcanology agency said meant ""there is magmatic intrusion at the main crater that may further drive succeeding eruptions"".
""Magma in the shallow part of the crater interacted with water, causing an eruption called phreatomagmatic activity,"" Renato Solidum, head volcanology agency, told DZMM radio station.
But Solidum said activity would not be as explosive as the January 2020 eruption and that ash fall could be limited to communities within the volcano, which sits in the middle of a lake.
Authorities evacuated more than 1,100 persons living in lakeside communities near the volcano, the disaster agency said. The evacuees include fishermen and fish cage workers in the lake.
In January 2020, Taal shot a column of ash and steam as high as 15 km, which forced more than 100,000 people to evacuate while dozens of flights were cancelled and heavy ash fell as far away as Manila.

Taal is one of the world's smallest active volcanoes. Despite standing at only 311 metres (1,020 feet), it can be deadly and an eruption in 1911 killed more than 1,300 people.
The Philippines lies on the ""Ring of Fire"", a belt of volcanoes circling the Pacific Ocean that is also prone to earthquakes.

Russia's Eastern Military District said it was conducting military drills on the Kuril islands with more than 3,000 troops and hundreds of pieces of army equipment, Russia's Interfax news agency said Friday.
It did not say where on the island chain, connecting Russia's Kamchatka peninsula and Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido, the drills were taking place. Japanese media said they were on territory the Soviet Union seized at the end of World War Two that is claimed by Tokyo.
Japan's Foreign Ministry and Prime Minister's Office could not be reached outside business hours to comment on the exercises.
The territorial dispute over the four islets - which Russia says are part of its Kuril chain and which Japan calls its Northern Territories - has prevented Tokyo and Moscow from reaching a peace treaty formally ending hostilities.
Japan reacted angrily on Tuesday after Russia withdrew from long-running treaty talks and froze joint economic projects related to the islands, in retaliation for Japan joining Western sanctions over Moscow's month-old invasion.

Russia's exercises involved repelling amphibious warfare, including destroying defence aircraft carrying troops and testing skills to operate fire control systems of anti-tank guided missiles, Interfax said.
""In addition to this, units of the Air Defense Forces are carrying out a set of measures to detect, identify and destroy aircraft of a mock enemy that would carry out an airborne assault,"" the agency cited the District's press service as saying.

WUZHOU, China (Reuters) - As recovery crews sifted through the mud at the China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) crash site, dozens of relatives of those on board flight MU5735 remained nearby in an anxious wait for further news.
One was Qin Haitao who comes from neighbouring Hunan province.
Qin's daughter, Shujun, was a passenger on the flight on Monday that had been en-route from the southwestern inland city of Kunming to the southeastern coastal city of Guangzhou, when it plummeted to the ground in a rural part of the Guangxi region, leaving no known survivors.
Guangzhou-based migrant worker Shujun, 40, had travelled to Kunming to accompany her mother to see a specialist doctor she had heard was very good.
""We couldn't believe it and didn't dare say anything, for fear that my wife would not be able to bear it,"" Qin said, when describing the moment he heard the news of the crash on Monday.
""Our eyes were full of tears but we dared not weep. In fact, we knew the truth, but we kept it from her for a night, for half a day plus one night.""
Qin said he initially received no official confirmation about his daughter's situation. But on Monday night his brother-in-law rushed to Guangzhou's Baiyun International Airport, where the flight was scheduled to arrive. There, he was shown a list of the passengers' names, which included Shujun's.
On Tuesday, Qin, his son and two others drove to Wuzhou and the next day visited the crash site accompanied by staff and volunteers from China Eastern.
""It's so painful,"" he said in a broken voice, holding back tears. ""We have nothing but grief now…We are living in grief every day.""
By 10am on Friday, 375 family members of the 132 people on board flight MU5735 had visited the crash site, officials said. 
Rescue workers have reported finding human remains, pieces of personal belongings of the passengers and debris from the plane.
""Many family members were burning incense,"" Qin said, about the visit to the crash site. 
""I prayed and put my daughter's name there. It happened to be her birthday that same day...so I said: 'Dad came to see you, my child. Happy birthday.'""
After that visit to the site, Qin has largely stayed at his hotel with his son, Shujun's elder brother and only sibling.
Shujun herself leaves behind a teenage daughter.

""We don't have any requests now,"" Qin said. 
""Our only request is to find my daughter's body as soon as possible and bring her home.""

The Pacific island nation on Friday said it was expanding ties with China to combat security threats and ensure a safe environment for investment as it diversifies security relations.
A potential China security pact with Solomon Island has sparked concerns among U.S. allies Australia and New Zealand about Chinese influence a region where they have for decades held strong sway.
Asked by reporters in Sydney about the matter, Morrison said ""there is great concern across the Pacific family because we are in constant contact with our Pacific family"".
""I will be in further discussions with leaders over the course of this weekend, there was a meeting yesterday with our head of mission and Prime Minister (Manasseh) Sogavare,"" he said.
Morrison said Sogavare on Friday indicated to Canberra that he appreciated Australia's ongoing support for Solomon Islands.
""We are the Solomon Islands' single largest development partner, daylight second, third, fourth,"" Morrison said.
Australia has previously expressed concern about the impact on regional security of military cooperation between China and Solomon Islands after a draft document outlining the proposed cooperation was leaked this week. 
On Thursday, a Solomon Islands official told Reuters a security deal with China covering the military would be sent to its cabinet for consideration. The Solomons has already signed a policing deal with China. 

Solomon Islands, a small island nation around 2,000 km (1,240 miles) northeast of Australia, switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing from Taiwan in 2019, signalling China's growing influence in the Pacific.
Washington last month said it would open an embassy in nation's the capital Honiara amid fears China was seeking to strengthen military relations there.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India said ties with China could not be normal until their troops pulled back from each other on the disputed border, but Beijing struck a conciliatory note during a meeting of their foreign ministers in New Delhi on Friday.
Both nations have deployed thousands of troops on the high-altitude border since hand-to-hand fights killed 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers northern Himalayan region of Ladakh in June 2020. Talks between senior military officers have made little progress.
""I was very honest in my discussions with the Chinese foreign minister, especially in conveying our national sentiments,"" India's Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told a news briefing after his three-hour meeting with Wang Yi.
""The frictions and tensions that arise from China's deployments since April 2020 cannot be reconciled with a normal relationship between the two neighbours.""
In a statement, Wang said China and India should work together to promote peace and stability around the world.
""The two sides should ... put the differences on the boundary issue in an appropriate position in bilateral relations, and adhere to the correct development direction of bilateral relations,"" he said.
""China does not pursue the so-called ""unipolar Asia"" and respects India's traditional role in the region. The whole world will pay attention when China and India work hand in hand.""
Jaishankar, a former ambassador to Beijing, said it was at China's request that India did not announce Wang's trip before his arrival in the capital late on Thursday.
Wang met India's national security adviser, Ajit Doval, who also pressed him for a de-escalation at the border.
It was not immediately clear if India offered to pull back its troops if China did.
In a statement on Saturday, China's foreign ministry said Wang called for transitioning the border issue from a state of emergency response to normal management as soon as possible.
Both agreed to speed up the resolution of remaining issues, properly manage the situation on the ground and avoid misunderstandings and miscalculations, it added.
Wang and Jaishankar also discussed their nations' approaches to tackling Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""Both of us agreed on the importance of an immediate ceasefire, as well as a return to diplomacy,"" Jaishankar said.
India and China each consider Russia a friend and have rejected Western calls for condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Russia calls a ""special military operation"".

Wang, who visited Pakistan and Afghanistan earlier this week, is set to fly to the Himalayan nation of Nepal later on Friday during a whirlwind tour of South Asia, where China is trying to strengthen its influence.
Before his arrival, Wang drew a rebuke from India for remarks in Pakistan on disputed Kashmir, a Muslim-majority region each rules in part but claims in full, an issue on which China has generally backed its close ally, Pakistan.

SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korea said it tested a new, powerful type of intercontinental ballistic missile on Thursday, marking an end to a self-imposed moratorium on long-range testing in place since 2017 and drawing international condemnation.
State media said leader Kim Jong Un directly guided the test of the Hwasong-17, a ""new type"" of intercontinental ballistic missile that is North Korea's biggest ever. He said it was key to deterring nuclear war.
It said the missile flew for 1,090 km (681 miles) to a maximum altitude of 6,248.5 km (3,905 miles) and precisely hit a target in the sea.
Kim said North Korea was preparing for long confrontation with U.S. imperialism and its strategic force was ready to check and contain any military attempt by the United States, North Korean media said.
Flight data from the South Korean and Japanese militaries earlier indicated the missile flew higher and for a longer time than any of North Korea's previous tests before crashing into the sea west of Japan.
It was the first full-capability launch of the nuclear-armed state's largest missiles since 2017, and represents a major step in Pyongyang's development of weapons that might be able to deliver nuclear warheads anywhere in the United States.
North Korea's return to major weapons tests poses a new headache for U.S. President Joe Biden as he responds to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and presents a challenge to South Korea's incoming conservative administration.
Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, meeting at a Group of Seven summit in Brussels in a show of unity against the Kremlin's war, condemned the North Korean launch, stressed the need for diplomacy and agreed to work together to hold Pyongyang ""accountable,"" a White House official said.
""This launch is a brazen violation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions and needlessly raises tensions and risks destabilising the security situation in the region,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said earlier.
North Korea had put its ICBM and nuclear tests on hold since 2017, but has defended the weapons as necessary for self-defence. Amid stalled denuclearisation efforts Biden has been unable to jumpstart, Pyongyang has called U.S. overtures insincere while its maintains ""hostile policies"" such as sanctions and military drills.
North Korea's launch missile was a jarring reminder that its leader Kim Jong Un will not be ignored even as the world's attention is gripped by the Ukraine crisis.
South Korea's outgoing President Moon Jae-in, who made engaging North Korea a major goal, condemned the launch as ""a breach of the moratorium on ICBM launches that Chairman Kim Jong Un himself promised to the international community"". Moon is due to leave office in May.
Kishida called it an ""unacceptable act of violence.""
The launch prompted South Korea to test-fire a volley of its own, smaller ballistic and air-to-ground missiles to demonstrate it has the ""capability and readiness"" to precisely strike missile launch sites, command and support facilities, and other targets in North Korea if necessary, South Korea's military said.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and South Korean Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong called for a decisive response and agreed that additional measures by the U.N. Security Council were essential, South Korea's foreign ministry said.
U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his South Korean counterpart also spoke and agreed that a firm response was necessary, the Pentagon said. It said Austin also spoke with his Japanese counterpart.
In a statement to a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, General Glen VanHerck, head of the U.S. Northern Command, said North Korea’s ""ongoing development of increasingly complex and capable strategic weapons"" showed the need for on-time or early deployment of a next generation missile defence interceptor and for a new long-range radar in Alaska to achieve full operational capacity on schedule.
The United States, Britain, France, Ireland, Albania and Norway asked the U.N. Security Council to hold a public meeting on Friday to discuss the launch and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged Pyongyang ""to desist from taking any further counter-productive actions.""
However, securing a tough international response to North Korea's latest ICBM launch will be far more difficult for Washington than in 2017. World powers capable of imposing new U.N. sanctions on Pyongyang, as they did then, are at odds over Ukraine and appear unlikely to find common ground. [nL5N2VR4T3}
NEW ICBM?
Japanese authorities said the launch appeared to be a ""new type"" of ICBM that flew for about 71 minutes to an altitude of about 6,000 km (3,728 miles) and a range of 1,100 km (684 miles).
It landed inside Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ), 170 km (106 miles) west of the northern prefecture of Aomori, at 3:44 p.m. (0644 GMT), the coast guard said.
South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff put the missile's maximum altitude at 6,200 km and its range at 1,080 km.
That is further and longer than North Korea's last ICBM test in 2017, when it launched a Hwasong-15 missile that flew for 53 minutes to an altitude of about 4,475 km and range of 950 km.
South Korea's military said the latest missile was launched from near Sunan, where Pyongyang's international airport is located. On March 16, North Korea launched a suspected missile from that airport that appeared to explode shortly after liftoff, South Korea's military said.
U.S. and South Korean officials warned this month that North Korea was preparing to test-fire the Hwasong-17, its largest ICBM. U.S. officials said two recent tests featured the Hwasong-17 system, but did not demonstrate full ICBM range or capability.
Pyongyang said at the time it was testing components for a reconnaissance satellite system.
Amid a flurry of diplomacy in 2018, Kim declared a moratorium on testing ICBMs and nuclear weapons, but later suggested such tests could resume amid stalled denuclearisation talks.
That moratorium had often been touted as a success by former U.S. President Donald Trump, who held historic summits with Kim in 2018 and 2019, but never secured a concrete pact to limit North Korea's nuclear or missile arsenals.

New construction has also been spotted at North Korea's only known nuclear test site, which was shuttered in 2018.
The possibility of resumed nuclear tests, more joint U.S.-South Korea military drills, and a new conservative South Korean president mean ""all conditions are present for a tit-for-tat chain reaction of escalatory steps"", said Chad O'Carroll, CEO of Korea Risk Group, which monitors North Korea.

BUCHA/LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Moscow signalled on Friday it was scaling back its ambitions in Ukraine to focus on territory claimed by Russian-backed separatists in the East as Ukrainian forces went on the offensive to recapture towns outside the capital Kyiv.
In an announcement that appeared to indicate more limited goals, the Russian Defence Ministry said a first phase of its operation was mostly complete and it would now focus on the eastern Donbass region, which has pro-Russia separatist enclaves.
""The combat potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been considerably reduced, which ... makes it possible to focus our core efforts on achieving the main goal, the liberation of Donbass,"" said Sergei Rudskoi, head of the Russian General Staff's Main Operational Directorate.
Reframing Russia's goals may make it easier for President Vladimir Putin to claim a face-saving victory, military analysts said. Moscow had said its goals included demilitarising Ukraine. Western officials dismiss this as a baseless pretext for a war they say is aimed at toppling Ukraine's government. 
Facing stiff resistance, Russian troops have failed to capture any major city in the month since invading Ukraine. Instead, they have bombarded cities, laid waste to urban areas and driven a quarter of Ukraine's 44 million people from their homes.
More than 3.7 million of them have fled abroad, half to neighbouring Poland, where U.S. President Joe Biden met soldiers from the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division bolstering the NATO alliance's eastern flank.
""Hundreds of thousands of people are being cut off from help by Russian forces and are besieged in places like Mariupol,"" Biden said, referring to the besieged southeastern port.
""It's like something out of a science fiction movie.""
Battlelines near Kyiv have been frozen for weeks with two main Russian armoured columns stuck northwest and east of the capital. A British intelligence report described a Ukrainian counter-offensive that had pushed Russians back in the east.
""Ukrainian counter-attacks, and Russian forces falling back on overextended supply lines, have allowed Ukraine to reoccupy towns and defensive positions up to 35 km east of Kyiv,"" the report said. Both the United States and Britain have given Ukraine arms. 
'UNPREPARED TROOPS'
Russia's defence ministry said 1,351 Russian soldiers had been killed 3,825 wounded, the Interfax news agency reported. Ukraine says 15,000 Russian soldiers have died.
Volodymyr Borysenko, mayor of Boryspol, an eastern suburb where Kyiv's main airport is located, said 20,000 civilians had evacuated the area, answering a call to clear out so Ukrainian troops could counter-attack. 
Ukrainian forces recaptured a nearby village the previous day and would have pushed on but halted to avoid putting civilians in danger, Borysenko said.
On the other main front outside Kyiv, to the capital's northwest, Ukrainian forces have been trying to encircle Russian troops in the suburbs of Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel, reduced to ruins by heavy fighting.
In Bucha, 25 km (15 miles) northwest of Kyiv, a small group of Ukrainian troops armed with anti-tank missiles was digging foxholes. A Ukrainian soldier who identified himself only as Andriy told Reuters he enlisted as soon as the invasion began. 
""I told my wife to grab the children and to hide in the basement, and I went to the drafting station and joined my unit straight away,"" he said.
In the Vinnytsia area west of Kyiv, the Ukrainian Air Force said Russian cruise missiles hit several buildings while attempting to strike the Air Force's command in the area. 
The United Nations said it had confirmed 1,081 civilian deaths and 1,707 injuries in Ukraine since the Feb. 24 invasion, adding that the real toll was likely higher.
Mariupol, a city of 400,000 before the war, has been among the worst hit by the Russian bombardment. Tens of thousands of people are still believed to be trapped with little access to food, power or heat. 
Local officials, citing witness accounts, said they estimated that 300 people were killed in the bombing of a theatre in Mariupol on March 16. The city council had not previously provided a toll and made clear it was not possible to determine an exact figure after the incident. Russia has denied bombing the theatre.
The governor of Ukraine's Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said Ukrainian forces still controlled Mariupol. Around 65,000 people had fled but efforts to organise mass evacuations under ceasefires had mostly failed.
The cities of Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy in the east have also endured devastating bombardment. Chernihiv was effectively surrounded by Russian forces, its governor said. 
CULTURE WAR?
Weeks of on-and-off peace talks have failed to make significant progress. In a video address late Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said his troops' resistance had dealt Russia ""powerful blows"". 
""Our defenders are leading the Russian leadership to a simple and logical idea: we must talk, talk meaningfully, urgently and fairly,"" Zelenskiy said.
Western sanctions have isolated Russia from global trade. President Vladimir Putin accused the West of trying to ""cancel"" Russian culture, including composers Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Sergei Rachmaninov, comparing it to actions by Nazi Germany in the 1930s.
China is the biggest power not to have condemned the Russian invasion and has repeatedly voiced opposition to the sanctions. 

But in the first big sign that Western sanctions on Moscow were hurting investment from China, sources said state-run Sinopec (NYSE:SHI) Group, Asia's biggest oil refiner, halted talks on a petrochemical investment and a venture to market Russian gas.
""Companies will rigidly follow Beijing's foreign policy in this crisis,"" said an executive at a Chinese state oil company. ""There's no room whatsoever for companies to take any initiatives in terms of new investment.""

SEOUL/UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) -North Korea said on Friday its launch of a big new intercontinental ballistic missile this week was designed to demonstrate the might of its nuclear force and deter any U.S. military moves.
The United States responded by saying it would push the U.N. Security Council to ""update and strengthen"" sanctions on North Korea over its ""increasingly dangerous provocations,"" a move Pyongyang's allies China and Russia are likely to oppose. 
Thursday's launch was the first full ICBM test by nuclear-armed North Korea since 2017. Flight data indicated the missile flew higher and for a longer period than any of North Korea's previous tests before crashing into the sea west of Japan.
What North Korea calls the Hwasong-17 would be the largest liquid-fuelled missile ever launched by any country from a road-mobile launcher, analysts say. 
Its range and size suggest North Korea plans to tip it with multiple warheads that could hit several targets or with decoys to confuse missile defences, they say.
The leaders of the Group of Seven industrialised nations and the European Union condemned the test as a ""reckless"" threat to peace and security and a danger to international civil aviation and maritime navigation. They said it demanded a united response.
North Korea's return to testing weapons experts believe are capable of striking the United States is an unwelcome additional challenge to President Joe Biden as he responds to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
North Korea's last ICBM launches and nuclear tests in 2017 prompted U.N. Security Council sanctions, but the United States and its allies are at odds with Russia and China over the Ukraine war, making such a response more difficult.
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield nevertheless announced a new sanctions push at a meeting of the 15-member Security Council on Friday. 
North Korea's nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches have long been banned by the Security Council and subjected to sanctions that have been strengthened over the years.
However, while they backed sanctions in 2017, China and Russia have since pushed for their easing to encourage North Korea to return to denuclearisation talks with the United States and others.
""Now is not the time to end our sanctions, now is the time to enforce them,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. 
""Offering sanctions relief, without substantive diplomatic progress, would only funnel more revenue to the regime and accelerate the realization of its WMD (weapons of mass destruction) and ballistic-weapons goals.""
China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun told the council ""no party should take any action that would lead to greater tensions"" and added, referring to North Korea by the initials of its official name: ""The U.S. must not continue to brush aside the DPRK's justified demands. It should offer an attractive proposal to pave the way for early resumed dialogue.""
Russia's RIA news agency earlier quoted the Russian foreign ministry as saying that Russia and China had agreed to coordinate closely on the Korean situation.
""Concern was expressed over the latest developments in the sub-region"" at a meeting between Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov and China's representative for the Korean Peninsula, it said, adding that they emphasised the need to step up efforts towards fair political and diplomatic solutions.
North Korean state media said leader Kim Jong Un ordered the test because of ""daily-escalating military tension in and around the Korean peninsula"" and the ""inevitability of the long-standing confrontation with the U.S. imperialists accompanied by the danger of a nuclear war"".
""The strategic forces ... are fully ready to thoroughly curb and contain any dangerous military attempts of the U.S. imperialists,"" Kim said while overseeing the launch.
It came after the election of a new, conservative South Korean administration that has pledged a more muscular military strategy towards North Korea.
In a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping after the launch, South Korean President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol called for close coordination on North Korea's complete denuclearisation, his office said. Xi said Beijing and Seoul should bolster mutual political trust, Chinese state media said.
China urged restraint on ""all sides"" after the test.
'STRIKING DEMONSTRATION'
Washington announced its own sanctions on Thursday on two Russian companies, a Russian and a North Korean individual, and North Korea’s Second Academy of Natural Science Foreign Affairs Bureau for transferring sensitive items to North Korea’s missile programme.
Kim said the test would help convince the world of the power of his strategic forces.
""Any forces should be made to be well aware of the fact that they will have to pay a very dear price before daring to attempt to infringe upon the security of our country,"" he said.
North Korean state media showed a massive missile, painted black with a white nosecone, rising on a column of flame from a launch vehicle.
It said the Hwasong-17 flew for 1,090 km (680 miles) to an altitude of 6,248.5 km (3,905 miles) and hit a target in the sea. Similar numbers were reported by Japan and South Korea.
Seoul-based website NK Pro said discrepancies in the imagery and video on state media suggested it may have been shot on different dates, raising the possibility that North Korea was hiding details.
Pyongyang never acknowledged what South Korea said was a failed launch from the same airport last week, and on Thursday South Korea's Yonhap news agency cited unnamed officials who said they were examining whether the latest test may have been a smaller Hwasong-15 ICBM, which was test fired in November 2017.
Officials in Seoul and Washington previously said launches on Feb. 27 and March 5 involved parts of the Hwasong-17 ICBM system, likely in preparation for a full test. 

North Korea called Thursday's test a ""striking demonstration of great military muscle"". 
Kim, shown in video at the launch site dressed in a leather jacket and sunglasses, called it a ""miraculous"" and ""priceless"" victory for the Korean people.

RZESZOW, Poland (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday got a firsthand look at international efforts to help some of the millions of Ukrainian war refugees in Poland, and spoke to American troops bolstering NATO's eastern flank. 
Biden shared a meal with soldiers from the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division stationed in the area of Rzeszow airport, and spoke about the high stakes of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
""You are in the midst of a fight between democracies and oligarchs,"" Biden said, referring to rich Russians who have faced Western sanctions since the war started on Feb. 24. ""What's at stake is what are your kids and grandkids going to look like in terms of their freedom,"" Biden said.
Biden's schedule in Poland was briefly delayed after the plane carrying President Andrzej Duda was turned back en route to Rzeszow and made an emergency landing in Warsaw. Duda later boarded a different aircraft and headed back. 
An official in his office said Duda had not been in any danger in the incident, which for many Poles brought back memories of the 2010 Smolensk air crash in Russia that killed top military officers and politicians, including President Lech Kaczynski.
""We all know the history we have when it comes to flights,"" Duda told reporters. ""I did not argue, that was the decision of the plane's captain,"" he said, adding that the passengers could feel that the plane had become unstable.
Biden received a briefing on the humanitarian response to help civilians sheltering from Russian attacks inside Ukraine and to respond to the growing flow of refugees fleeing Ukraine.
""I'm here in Poland to see first hand the humanitarian crisis,"" he said at the start of a meeting with NGOs, U.S. and Polish officials and Duda. ""Quite frankly part of my disappointment is I can't see it first hand like I have in other places. They won't let me, understandably, I guess, cross the border and take a look at what's going on in Ukraine.""
Poland has taken in more than 2.23 million people fleeing violence in Ukraine, out of some 3.7 million all together who have poured over borders across central Europe during the last four weeks.
""Hundreds of thousands of people are being cut off from help by Russian forces and are besieged in places like Mariupol,"" Biden said in a reference to the port city in eastern Ukraine which has been under siege since the war's early days.
""It's like something out of a science fiction movie.""
Biden told reporters in Brussels on Thursday that his visit will ""reinforce my commitment to have the United States make sure we are a major piece of dealing with the relocation of all those folks, as well as humanitarian assistance needed both inside Ukraine and outside Ukraine.""
In Rzeszow, TV footage showed him sharing a pepperoni and jalapeno pizza and chatting with U.S. paratroopers gathered in the base's cafeteria. 
""I just came by to say thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.""
WESTERN REINFORCEMENT ON EASTERN FLANK
Biden on Thursday attended an unprecedented triple summit in Brussels of NATO, G7 nations and European leaders which addressed the continent's worst conflict since the 1990s Balkans wars. 
On Friday evening, he landed in the capital Warsaw. On Saturday, he was scheduled to have further talks with Duda and give what the White House described as a major address.
Poland hopes that Biden's visit will underline the security assurances already made by the United States that it will defend ""every inch"" of NATO territory. Warsaw is keen to see even more U.S. troops stationed on NATO's eastern flank.
Poland is also likely to raise the idea of an international peacekeeping mission involving troops being stationed in Ukraine, an idea first proposed by ruling party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski during a trip to Kyiv.
En route to Poland on Air Force One, national security adviser Jake Sullivan briefed reporters. Asked whether Russia would try to bomb convoys carrying supplies to Ukraine over land through NATO countries, Sullivan said: ""We are doing contingency planning for the possibility that Russia chooses to strike NATO territory in that context or in any other context. 
""And the president has been about as clear as one can be about his absolute determination to respond decisively, alongside the other members of our alliance if Russia attacks NATO,"" Sullivan said.
He also suggested the United States and its allies could still impose new measures to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. 

""Of course, there are additional measures to tighten the screws on sanctions, and we will be constantly reviewing those,"" he said.
Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" to disarm its neighbor. Kyiv and its Western allies call it an unprovoked war of aggression and say Russia's true aim was to overthrow the government of what President Vladimir Putin regards as an illegitimate state.

(Reuters) - Republican governors in Utah and Indiana this week rejected legislation banning transgender athletes from competing in girls' sports, pushing back against a rising tide of similar Republican-sponsored legislation nationwide. 
But the vetoes of those governors appear to be among the solitary voices in a party that has become increasingly fixated on polarizing cultural issues involving race, sex and gender as a cudgel to win over suburban and rural voters and regain power in November’s congressional elections. 
Utah lawmakers on Friday voted to override Governor Spencer Cox's veto, joining 11 other states that have enacted laws banning transgender girls from participating in girls' sports since 2020, according to the Equality Federation, which tracks legislation that targets lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people.
The veto in Indiana also is expected to be overridden by Republicans in the state's legislature, making the actions by Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb and Utah's Cox largely symbolic. 
""Saving women’s sports is now a litmus test for Republicans,” said Terry Schilling, president of the American Principles Project, a conservative group that has made state high school transgender bans central to its advocacy. ""These governors just shot themselves in the foot for no good reason.""
The issue gained new resonance this month when collegiate swimmer Lia Thomas became the first openly trans athlete to win a Division I championship in any sport. Conservatives have used her victory as a rallying cry for more restrictive legislation.
Republican Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida, who is up for re-election and has become perhaps his party’s most high-profile cultural warrior, this week declared the second-place finisher in Thomas’ race the actual winner, saying the NCAA was “perpetuating a fraud” and undermining the integrity of women’s sports. 
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated in 2019 that just 1.8% of high school students in the country are transgender, and the Human Rights Campaign has said that, according to surveys, only about 12% play on girls' sports teams. 
In Utah, Cox called the issue of transgender students participating in sports “one of the most divisive of our time” and said he wanted to approach the issue with compassion. He expressed concern for the mental health of trans youths, who, he said, simply want to participate in sports as a means of belonging. 
Cox said he found only one instance of a transgender student playing on a girls' high school team in Utah.
“Rarely has so much fear and anger been directed at so few,” Cox wrote in a letter explaining his veto. “I don’t understand what they are going through or why they feel the way they do. But I want them to live.”
POLITICAL RISK
In vetoing the bills, both Cox and Holcomb suggested the restrictions were unnecessary and would invite costly lawsuits.
Beyond Utah and Indiana, governors in three other states have vetoed similar bans, although South Dakota then enacted a revised law, according to the Equality Federation.
Fran Hutchins, the organization's executive director, called the legislative pushes a ploy to drum up support ahead of the midterm elections, when Republicans could win back a majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives. 
“I really hope that the Republican vetoes are the beginning of a sea change in the way that conservatives are thinking about this,” Hutchins said. “But I fear that we're going to see this rhetoric continue beyond legislative sessions and into the elections.”
Chris Wilson, a Republican pollster who consults on Senate and gubernatorial campaigns, said that Democrats oppose such bans at their peril, saying they are favored by some independents and Democrats who believe it is unfair to allow transgender students to compete in girls’ athletics. 
A May 2021 poll by Gallup found that 62% of Americans said trans athletes should only be allowed to play on sports teams that correspond with their birth gender, while 34% say they should be able to play on teams that match their gender identity. 
Wilson said Democrats who vote against such bans could see political blowback similar to the controversy over calls by progressives to de-fund police departments, a position that has largely been rejected by a majority of voters nationwide.
Republicans could face political risks as well.

In vetoing the Indiana bill, Holcomb may have wanted to avoid the firestorm that arose in 2015 when then-governor Mike Pence signed a controversial religious freedom bill. 
And in 2016, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican, lost his re-election bid after the state’s so-called “bathroom bill” requiring transgender people to use the bathroom of their original sex triggered a backlash that damaged the state’s economy.

LONDON (Reuters) - Russia has reframed its war goals in Ukraine in a way that may make it easier for President Vladimir Putin to claim a face-saving victory despite a woeful campaign in which his army has suffered humiliating setbacks, military analysts say.
Russia attacked its neighbour by land, air and sea on Feb. 24 and pushed as far as the capital Kyiv - where its forces have been stalled for weeks - in what Ukraine and the West said was a bid to topple the democratic government of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
On Friday, however, a senior military official said the real objective was to ""liberate"" the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting the Ukrainian army for the past eight years. 
""The main objectives of the first stage of the operation have generally been accomplished,"" said Sergei Rudskoi, head of the Russian General Staff's Main Operational Directorate.
""The combat potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been considerably reduced, which ... makes it possible to focus our core efforts on achieving the main goal, the liberation of Donbass.""
Donbass, where Putin has accused Ukraine without evidence of waging ""genocide"" against ethnic Russians - has long occupied a prominent place in Moscow's litany of grievances against Ukraine.
But if capturing the whole of Donbass had been the objective from the start, Moscow could have mounted a much more limited offensive and spared itself the effort and losses involved in invading Ukraine from the north, east and south.
""Obviously they have completely failed in everything they've set out to do and so now they are redefining what the purpose is so they can declare victory,"" said Ben Hodges, a former commander of U.S. army forces in Europe who now works for the Center for European Policy Analysis.
""Clearly they do not have the ability to continue sustained large-scale offensive operations... Their logistics problems have been apparent to everybody, they've got serious manpower issues and the resistance has been way beyond anything they could have possibly imagined."" 
HIGH COSTS
The costs of Russia's ""special military operation"" have been steep. Rudskoi, the General Staff official, on Friday acknowledged 1,351 deaths among Russian soldiers. Ukraine claims the real figure is more than 10 times as high.
Oryx, a Dutch military blog that records both sides' equipment losses based on verifiable photos and video, says Russia has lost 1,864 pieces of hardware including 295 tanks, 16 planes, 35 helicopters, three ships and two fuel trains. It has verified Ukrainian losses of 540 items, including 77 tanks.
Each side makes regular claims of the amount of enemy equipment it is destroying, but neither confirms its own losses.
Thwarted in its offensive, Russia has resorted to pounding cities to rubble with rockets and artillery.
""The advance is stalled or at best very slow at this stage,"" said Nick Reynolds, a land warfare analyst at the RUSI think-tank in London.
""Its original strategy is now completely unachievable. Its original strategy was to decapitate the Ukrainian government or cause it to collapse by just moving the military into the country... Obviously that didn't happen; quite the opposite.""
Russia has more work ahead to achieve even the more modest goal of driving Ukraine's forces out of the east. Of the two regions that make up the Donbass, its defence ministry says Russian-backed forces control 93% of Luhansk but only 54% of Donetsk.
Meanwhile Ukraine is sounding increasingly confident.
Deputy Chief of Staff of Ground Forces Oleksandr Gruzevich said on Friday that Russia would need three to five times more forces to take Kyiv, and was being blocked in its efforts to establish a land corridor across the south coast to link up annexed Crimea with Donbass.
Hodges, the retired U.S. general, said the question now was whether the West would be bold enough to overcome its fears of a Russian escalation using chemical or nuclear weapons - which he said would offer no tactical advantage to Moscow - and step up support to Ukraine even further.

He said more equipment such as long-range rockets, artillery and drones, coupled with provision of Western intelligence, could enable Kyiv to move from defence to attack.
""We're only parcelling out support to Ukraine instead of flooding them,"" he said. ""It feels like we want to keep them from being defeated but we're not willing to let them win.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -EU leaders bickered on Friday over steps to ease the energy market crunch exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but managed to present a united front amid mounting concern over the impact on hard-hit consumers of soaring gas and oil prices. 
An intense debate on whether to cap energy prices, which pitted some of the European Union's southern countries against Germany and the Netherlands, spun the second day of an EU summit well into the evening and ended with a trade-off deal.
At one point Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez left the summit meeting room for ""a technical stop, so that the negotiations could get back on track,"" a Spanish official said. 
The war in Ukraine has pushed energy prices to fresh record highs and prompted the European Union to pledge to cut Russian gas use by two-thirds this year, by hiking imports from other countries and boosting renewable energy.
While the Mediterranean rim states pressed for a cap on gas prices to shield poorer households, opponents say this effectively uses public cash to subsidise fossil fuel generation.
Sanchez said after the summit that Spain and Portugal would be allowed to implement temporary measures to cut energy prices.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen made clear that an exception had been agreed for these countries, describing it as ""special treatment for the Iberian peninsula.""
Earlier on Friday, U.S. President Joe Biden - who joined the first day of the summit - committed to helping Europe with more LNG deliveries as it grapples with the need to reduce dependency on Russia for its energy needs.
Russia supplies 40% of the gas the EU needs for heating and power generation and more than a quarter of its oil imports.
Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, who backed southern European countries' push for market intervention, said governments across the EU faced mounting public pressure.
""The EU is not only about big principles, big meetings and American presidents,"" he said. 
""Today is about the everyday issues of the people and that is the electricity and gas invoice of the people, and that's the impact we see today of that war in Ukraine,"" he said. ""We are at war and in a war you need to take extraordinary measures.""
DEPENDENT ON RUSSIA
There was agreement among the 27 member states on a plan for joint purchases of gas to tame prices.
The European Commission has said it is ready to lead negotiations on pooling demand and seeking gas before next winter, following a similar model through which the bloc bought COVID-19 vaccines on behalf of member states.
However, the EU remained divided over whether to ban Russian oil and gas imports in addition to the slew of sanctions it has imposed on Moscow since the invasion a month ago. 
Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Kyiv and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war. 
Europe's dependency on energy from Russia means the question of whether to impose an embargo, as the United States has done, is economically risky, and no decision was taken on Friday. 
Germany, Hungary and Austria were among the most reticent about imposing a ban on Russian oil and gas.

No common position emerged either on Russia's demand this week that ""unfriendly"" countries must use roubles to pay for its oil and gas, and whether the Commission would get a mandate to tackle that.
The Kremlin's demand poses a dilemma for countries reliant on Russian energy because, by agreeing to it, they would be shoring up the rouble and channelling hard currency into Moscow - but refusal could mean their energy supplies dry up.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday granted a request by President Joe Biden's administration to let the Navy decline to deploy SEALs and other special operations forces personnel who refused mandatory COVID-19 vaccination due to religious objections.
The court put on hold part of a federal judge's ruling stating that 26 members of the elite Navy SEALs and nine other special operations forces personnel were entitled to a religious exemption to the vaccine requirement under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment, which protects the free exercise of religion, as well as a law called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
""In this case, the district court, while no doubt well-intentioned, in effect inserted itself into the Navy’s chain of command, overriding military commanders’ professional military judgments,"" Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in a concurring opinion.
The court -- which has a 6-3 conservative majority -- was divided, with three conservative justices saying they would have denied the request. 
In a dissenting opinion, conservative Justice Samuel Alito said that the court ""does a great injustice"" to the Navy personnel who ""appear to have been treated shabbily.""
Under another part of Texas-based U.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor's ruling not affected by the Supreme Court action, the service members cannot be disciplined or discharged as a result of refusing the vaccine.
Besides the SEALs, the other nine plaintiffs include specialist naval craft crewmen, divers and a bomb disposal expert. 

On Feb. 28, the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a similar request from Biden's administration.
The administration is contesting O'Connor's Jan. 3 decision in favor of the servicemembers, in which the judge wrote that their ""loss of religious liberties outweighs any forthcoming harm to the Navy.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The early bird is getting even earlier.
With climate change spurring earlier springs across much of North America, many birds are laying their eggs earlier in the year, according to a new study – adding to mounting evidence that global warming is turning wildlife habits upside down.
Of 72 bird species examined around Chicago, roughly a third lay their eggs about 25 days earlier than they did a century ago, researchers report in the paper published on Friday in the Journal of Animal Ecology.
Those affected include the mourning dove, American kestrel and Cooper's hawk.
The scientists so far haven't found any clear traits shared by these species, such as size or migratory status, that might explain why they’re changing their schedules.
But ""the majority of the birds we looked at eat insects, and insects' seasonal behavior is also affected by climate,"" said lead author John Bates, curator of the bird division at the Field Museum in Chicago.
How animal and plant life cycles are affected by climate change and seasonal disruptions is a question that's ""becoming more front and center in people's minds,"" Bates said.
Just a few temperature degrees off from the long-term average can have a big impact on when insects emerge, when trees sprout leaves, when flowers bloom and, according to the new research, when eggs hatch.
Scientists believe those changes could be among the many reasons for the steep decline in bird populations since the 1970s, with the United States and Canada losing roughly a third of their birds - or about 3 billion birds - according to a 2019 study in the journal Science.
Bates and his colleagues studied more than 1,500 egg shell records held at Chicago's Field Museum, many dating back to the period between 1872 to 1920 when gathering eggs was a popular pastime. These Victorian era ova enthusiasts left detailed, handwritten labels listing information such as the bird’s species and collection date.

The scientists then compared those records with more than 3,000 modern records, along with data describing carbon dioxide levels on the nesting dates across time, for their analysis. 
The findings echo similar results from studies carried out in recent decades in the United Kingdom, which also found that egg-laying was happening earlier along with reported changes in the growing season.

""China and Russia should send a strong message to (North Korea) to refrain from additional provocations,"" Porter told a regular news briefing ahead of a U.N. Security Council meeting to discuss the launch later on Friday.
North Korea said it launched a big, new ICBM on Friday, a test its leader Kim Jong Un said was designed to demonstrate the might of its nuclear force and deter any U.S. military moves. It was the nuclear-armed country's first full ICBM test since 2017.
Referring to North Korea by the initials of its official name, Porter called the launch a ""brazen"" violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.
""We urge all countries to hold the DPRK accountable for such violations and we also call on the DPRK to come to the table for serious negotiations,"" she said.
She said she was unable comment on the position China and Russia might take at the Security Council, but added:

""We are in the early stages of consulting on this issue. There have been developments that should be of concern to all countries, particularly those who share a border with the DPRK. The DPRK's decision to return to ICBM tests is a clear escalation.""
North Korea's last ICBM launches in 2017 prompted U.N. Security Council sanctions, but the United States and its allies are at odds with Russia and China over the Ukraine war, making such a response more difficult.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States assesses that Russia is prioritizing eastern Ukraine's Donbass, as opposed to Kyiv, in what could be an effort to build leverage in negotiations and cut off Ukrainian forces in the east from the rest of the country, a senior U.S. defense official said on Friday.
Russia said earlier on Friday that the first phase of its military operation was mostly complete and it would focus on completely ""liberating"" Ukraine's breakaway eastern Donbass region.
The announcement appeared to indicate Moscow may be switching to more limited objectives after running into fierce Ukrainian resistance in a month of war.
The senior U.S. official suggested Russia's activities on the ground appeared broadly to back up Moscow's announcement.
""They are prioritizing it and we concur, our information would concur, with that,"" the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters. 
The official said the United States was seeing Russian forces become more aggressive in the Donbass area.
""They have certainly made it a higher priority on their list,"" the official added.
The city of Kherson, a regional capital of about 250,000 people, did not seem to be as solidly in Russian control as it was before and appeared to be contested, the official said.
Kherson was the first big urban center to fall into the hands of Russian troops after they invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Russian troops have largely stalled around Kyiv and are establishing defensive positions, the official said. 
On Friday, Sergei Rudskoi, head of the Russian General Staff's Main Operational Directorate, said 1,351 Russian soldiers had died in the operation and 3,825 been injured. Ukraine's military has said some 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in combat.
Russia's combat power in Ukraine was somewhere between 85 and less than 90% of its pre-invasion levels, the U.S. defense official said. 
For the first time, the official said, the United States had signs that Russia was looking to draw on its troops in Georgia to help in Ukraine. 
It was unclear what their timeline was and where exactly they would go, but the official said it would not be surprising if they were sent into the Donbass region.
Ukrainian authorities have said Russian forces had effectively surrounded the northern city of Chernihiv and were bombarding areas where residents were stuck without electricity, heating and water.
The U.S. official said Ukrainian forces were making incremental progress against Russian troops around Chernihiv.

On Thursday, Ukraine said it had destroyed a large Russian landing support ship at the Russian-occupied port of Berdiansk on the Sea of Azov.
The U.S. official confirmed Ukrainian forces had destroyed the Russian warship in Berdiansk, but it was unclear how many casualties there had been.

RZESZOW, Poland/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A call this month between Jill Biden and her Polish peer, Agata Kornhauser-Duda, helped speed medical assistance to the frontlines of the refugee crisis following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Kornhauser-Duda, the wife of Polish President Andrzej Duda, spoke to Biden, the wife of U.S. President Joe Biden, about Poland's stretched response to millions of desperate people fleeing the war in neighboring Ukraine. They spoke on March 11 at Kornhauser-Duda's request, the White House said.
Days later, Kornhauser-Duda arrived in the United States and obtained medicine and equipment to be used to help support hospitals in Poland treating wounded children from Ukraine, the Polish president said on Friday.
""I'd like to ask you to convey my personal words of thanks to the First Lady,"" Duda told the U.S. president on a trip to an airport fewer than 100 km (62 miles) from the Polish-Ukrainian border. ""Thank you so much for this very swift assistance.""
Details were not available on the donations obtained by Kornhauser-Duda.
Both women are teachers: Kornhauser-Duda taught German in a Krakow high school, Biden is an English professor in a Virginia community college. A spokesperson for Jill Biden declined to offer more details about their interaction. 
She is not traveling in Poland. On Friday, she was set to visit St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, a Memphis, Tennessee, children's hospital now caring for four Ukrainian children whose cancer treatment was disrupted by the war.

The crisis has aligned two NATO allies that have been at odds over issues including judicial independence, LGBT rights and media freedoms. A social conservative, Duda was close with Biden's predecessor Donald Trump and did not immediately recognize Trump's 2020 election defeat.
Poland has taken in more than 2.23 million people fleeing Ukraine, out of 3.7 million who have poured into neighboring countries since the war began on Feb. 24.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis led the world's Catholic bishops on Friday in praying for peace between Russia and Ukraine, saying the world had forgotten the tragedies of the 20th century and was still menaced by nuclear war.
Francis presided at a service in St. Peter's Basilica in which he entrusted the protection of all humanity, ""especially Russia and Ukraine,"" to Mary, who Christians believe is the Mother of God and who can intercede with him in heaven.
At about the same time, thousands of bishops in cathedrals and chapels around the world were reading the same prayer in local languages, resulting in one of the most precisely coordinated global Church event in living memory.
In a separate homily before reciting the prayer, Francis spoke of ""scenes of death"" in which ""bombs are destroying the homes of many of our defenceless Ukrainian brothers and sisters"" and of ""a cruel and senseless war that threatens our world"".
Both the Ukrainian and Russian ambassadors to the Vatican attended, sitting on separate sides of the aisle.
Since Russia invaded its neighbour on Feb. 24 in what it calls a ""special military operation"", the pope has implicitly criticised Moscow, strongly condemning what he has called an ""unjustified aggression"" and denouncing ""atrocities,"" but he had not mentioned Russia by name. 
He used the words Russia and Russians on Friday, albeit as part of a prayer and a homily.
""We have forgotten the lesson learned from the tragedies of the last century, the sacrifice of the millions who fell in two world wars ... we have closed ourselves in nationalist interests,"" the pope said in the prayer, whose formal title was ""An Act of Consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary"".
The act denounced the stockpiling of weapons, the destruction of the environment, greed and the spread of abortion. It asked Mary to ""eliminate hatred and the thirst for revenge, and teach us forgiveness, free us from war, protect our world from the menace of nuclear weapons"".
Archbishop Visvaldas Kulbokas, the Vatican ambassador who has remained in Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion last month, said before Friday's event he would read the prayer from a makeshift altar in a kitchen in a safe room in the embassy in Kyiv.
LINK WITH FATIMA
In the Portuguese town of Fatima, papal envoy Cardinal Konrad Krajewski, one of the pope's closest aides, read the same prayer near the spot where Mary is said to have appeared repeatedly in 1917 to three shepherd children.
The link with Fatima is essential to understanding the religious and political significance of Friday's consecration.
The Church says that in the apparition of July 13, 1917, Mary asked that Russia be consecrated to her, otherwise it would ""spread her errors throughout the world, causing wars and persecutions of the Church"" and that ""various nations will be annihilated"".
After the 1917 Russian revolution and during the Cold War between the West and the Soviet Union, the ""Message of Fatima"" became a rallying point for anti-communism in Christianity. 

Similar acts of consecration of the world were performed by past popes in 1942, 1952, 1964, 1981, 1982 and 1984.
The pope's decision to carry out Friday's consecration was welcomed by some Church traditionalists who generally oppose Francis. They say some or all of the previous consecrations may not have been valid because they did not adhere precisely to Mary's instructions to the visionary children.

Rmeishi, who is in the ninth grade, helps his family by working at his father's car repair garage in the capital Sanaa and hopes later to have a trade job as a mechanic, plumber or electrician.
""When I first started my education, when I first went to school, all I saw was war ... It affected my schooling, my work, it affected everyone,"" he said at the garage, where he washed and polished a blue sedan and fixed a bumper.
""We've wasted enough years of our lives. I hope the war will stop and that we will live in peace and security.""
The war between the Iran-aligned Houthi group and a coalition led by Saudi Arabia, which enters its eight year on Saturday, has killed tens of thousands of people and left 19 million people reliant on food assistance.
Some 22 million need support to access health services, 8.5 million children require education support and 16 million need help accessing potable water, according to the United Nations.
Fighting has displaced some 4 million people inside Yemen.
""We are lost, people are lost, it's as if we are buried underground,"" said Abdullah Hamzeh at Darwan camp near Sanaa. ""My children and I are destitute, we have no income, nothing. We pray to God that this war will stop across all of Yemen.""
Yemen's economy has collapsed and the flow of goods into the import-dependent country has been severely hindered by coalition restrictions on areas held by the Houthis, who ousted the Saudi-backed government from Sanaa in late 2014.

The United Nations has warned that the world's largest humanitarian operation in Yemen will be further scaled back, including food and health assistance, after a pledging drive raised less than a third of the $4.27 billion sought for 2022.
""Please don't forget the people of Yemen. We need your support as the international community, we need you to be active in the peace process,"" said Sami Fakhouri, head of the Yemen delegation to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, referring to U.N.-led peace efforts.

PRZEMYSL, Poland (Reuters) -Ukrainian refugee Viktoria Lysykh had one message for world leaders after she crossed the border into Poland on Friday: ""I want the war to end as soon as possible ... In what way exactly? By any means.""
The 35-year-old arrived in Przemysl railway station with her teenage daughter and their two pet cats, as U.S President Joe Biden was preparing to visit the same frontier region to discuss the conflict with his Polish counterpart.
Asked what she hoped the high-level meeting would achieve, Lysykh laughed. The best hope was that the conflict would end ""in the best way possible for Ukraine"". But above all, she just wanted to go back to her home in the Donetsk region.
""Let’s cease (fire) so that all of this will be over. In what way exactly this will be achieved doesn’t matter at all.""
It had taken Lysykh and her daughter 19 hours to get to the frontier. She was planning to travel to Warsaw and then on to Germany where she was hoping to find work - her background is in human resources with a sideline as a beautician. 
There were no friends or family waiting at their destination to take them in.
Around her in the station, more women and children kept arriving, loaded with bags. Around 32,500 refugees crossed into Poland on Thursday alone, border authorities said. 
'IF THEY CLOSED THE SKY'
In all, Poland has taken in more than 2.23 million people, according to Poland's border authority, more than half the refugees who fled Ukraine since Russia invaded. 
Poland's deputy education minister, Marzena Machalek, said on Friday around 700,000 Ukrainian children would be looking for places in local schools.
Biden was due to meet refugee organisations and sit down with Polish President Andrzej Duda in the town of Rzeszow, about 80 km (50 miles) from the station.
His visit comes a day after he and other Western leaders put on a show of unity against what Russia calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. 
At an unprecedented triple summit in Brussels, NATO announced plans for new combat units in four eastern European countries near Ukraine, while the United States and Britain increased aid and expanded sanctions.
Biden annouced more plans on Friday, saying the United States will supply more liquid natural gas to the European Union to help it cut its reliance on gas supplies from Russia.

Back at Przemysl, a 52-year-old refugee called Alla said there was only one thing that would stop the fighting quickly - something that Western powers have repeatedly ruled out - an NATO-enforced no-fly zone over Ukrainian territory.
""If they closed the sky, then they would stop bombing our cities ... and then the war would end fast,"" she said as she waited to get on another train deeper into Poland.

SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korea's resumption of long-range missile tests, including a flight of its largest-ever weapon, puts it closer than ever to having a reliable way of delivering multiple nuclear warheads anywhere in the United States, analysts say.
North Korea reported its latest launch was the Hwasong-17, a huge new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), fired on Thursday in a test that leader Kim Jong Un said was designed to demonstrate the might of its nuclear force and deter any U.S. military moves.
It was the first full-scale ICBM test launch since 2017. There were two launches in February and March that U.S. officials said were preliminary tests of the Hwasong-17.
Some analysts said that discrepancies in imagery released by North Korea suggested that it may be hiding details about the launch, and South Korean media have reported that officials are examining whether the missile was in fact a Hwasong-17.
With a range that the Japanese government said probably exceeds 15,000 km (9,320 miles), the missile fired on Thursday could strike targets anywhere in the world outside of a few countries in South America and parts of Antarctica.
That range, and its massive size, suggest North Korea plans to tip it with multiple warheads that could hit several targets or deploy decoys to confuse defenders, analysts say. North Korea's smaller Hwasong-15 ICBM, tested in 2017, can reach any part of the United States, but cannot carry as large a payload.
""Since there aren't any good targets farther away, this missile is likely about carrying more weight — in the form of multiple nuclear warheads,"" said Melissa Hanham, a researcher at Stanford University's Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC) in California. ""This makes U.S. ballistic missile defence even more difficult to achieve."" 
Along with other new weapons such as hypersonic missiles, smaller nuclear warheads and drones, North Korean leader Kim has made deployment of a 15,000 km-range ICBM with multiple warheads a goal.
""The offensive arithmetic will be in their favour soon; they may be able to keep up with advances in American defences,"" said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 
U.S. officials have predicted such advancements, and last year selected  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) and  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC) to compete to build a Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) designed to shoot down missiles from ""rogue nations"" such as North Korea and Iran, said Thomas Karako, the director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).
""This (new missile) gives North Korea more options,"" he said, noting that the longer range could also allow it to be fired at the United States using more indirect flight paths, potentially confusing defenders.
South Korean president-elect Yoon Suk-yeol has vowed to boost missile defences to counter North Korean weapons, and has suggested that developing a preemptive strike capability may be the only way to prevent a missile attack.
'CREDIBLE DETERRENCE'
The ""lofted"" tests North Korea has conducted, which send missiles high into space rather than far away, help confirm some elements of the system, such as full engine burns and staging. But other elements, such as accuracy and the survivability of the reentry vehicles that would carry a nuclear warhead, remain less verifiable in such tests, said Joseph Dempsey, a defence researcher at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. 
""Typically there would be dozens of partial and full flight tests through a full spectrum of operational parameters before a system is accepted and mass produced for service,"" he said, noting that North Korea faces diplomatic and geographical constraints on long-range tests. ""However, even limited successful tests can still provide enough minimal credible deterrence value.""
For instance, lofted tests expose reentry vehicles to much more heat and stress than a normal attack trajectory, meaning they might not survive or perform as designed. North Korea said it fired Thursday's missile ""in a vertical launch mode"" to ensure the safety of neighbouring countries. 
Rachel Minyoung Lee, with the Washington-based 38 North programme that monitors North Korea, said Pyongyang's goal seems to be to strengthen its leverage so it can turn denuclearization talks into nuclear-reduction talks. 
""The message of the North Korean readout of yesterday’s ICBM launch is clear: North Korea will continue to develop its nuclear arsenal,"" she said. 
A MISSILE THAT'S TOO BIG?
The Hwasong-17 had already been unveiled at military parades and defence expos, giving experts a good idea of what to expect.
Thursday's launch showed for the first time, however, that the Hwasong-17 was launched directly from its massive transporter, erector, launcher (TEL) vehicle, which has 11 axles.
Previous North Korean ICBMs were transported and raised by such vehicles, but then usually fired from detachable platforms. TELs make it easer to conceal missiles until they are deployed for use, but Panda said the Hwasong-17 is so large there could be serious concerns about its operational practicality.

""There's a reason that no other country has ever decided to deploy a liquid-fuelled missile that’s this big on a road-mobile launcher: it’s unsafe and operationally unwieldy,"" Panda said, while noting North Korea seems to accept the risk. ""A silo, which might make more sense for a missile this size, would be strategically worse for the North Koreans given its vulnerability to prompt preemption.""
The next step for North Korea would be building solid-fuel missiles, which are more stable and can be launched with almost no warning or preparation time.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Academy Awards, Hollywood's annual red-carpet celebration of the movies, takes place on Sunday. Here are five things to watch during the ceremony, which will be broadcast live in the United States on ABC.
SHOW SHAKEUP
After record-low TV ratings last year, producers are testing new ways to try and boost viewership. For the first time, hosting duties will be shared by three women: comedians Amy Schumer, Regina Hall and Wanda Sykes. In another twist, results of a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) poll of favorite movie and scene will be revealed. Winners of eight categories including production design and sound will be announced before the live telecast starts. Their speeches will be edited into the broadcast, a move to help wrap up the festivities within three hours.
STREAMING BATTLE
No streaming service has ever won the film industry's top prize, the best picture statuette. That is likely to change on Sunday, if awards watchers are correct. Most see a two-way race between online video pioneer Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV+, the streaming service run by the iPhone maker. Netflix's gothic Western ""The Power of the Dog"" landed 12 nominations, more than any other film. But Apple's ""CODA,"" about a deaf family with a hearing daughter who wants to pursue a career in music, gained momentum with wins at the Screen Actors Guild Awards and the Producers Guild Awards. 
DIRECTOR FACE-OFF
Jane Campion could become the third woman in the Oscars' 94-year-history to win best director, for ""Power of the Dog."" She is the only woman to have been nominated in the category twice. Campion received her first nod for the 1993 film ""The Piano,"" but lost out to Steven Spielberg and ""Schindler's List."" Spielberg is competing again this year with ""West Side Story."" A Campion win would make for back-to-back victories for women, after ""Nomadland"" director Chloe Zhao took the trophy last year.
MOMENT FOR UKRAINE
While the show's overall mood is meant to be celebratory, the telecast will acknowledge Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Producers say they want to offer an escape from the world's troubles but also feel they need to recognize the turmoil. ""You don’t go into a show like this and not be aware of that and not find a way to respectfully acknowledge where we are,"" producer Will Packer said.
MOST UNPREDICTABLE RACE

Any of the five contenders for best actress could win the statuette, awards experts say. Some give the edge to Jessica Chastain for her portrayal of TV evangelist Tammy Faye Bakker. Kristen Stewart, known for playing lovestruck vampire Bella in the ""Twilight"" saga, also is in the mix for her portrayal of Princess Diana in ""Spencer.""
The two are competing against Penelope Cruz for Spanish-language film ""Parallel Mothers,"" Nicole Kidman's portrayal of Lucille Ball (NYSE:BLL) in ""Being the Ricardos,"" and Olivia Colman for ""The Lost Daughter."" The latter three actresses already have an Oscar.

(Reuters) - Italy broke English hearts last July as they won the European Championship final but after failing to qualify for the World Cup for the second straight tournament they have left fans thinking their Wembley triumph was a flash in the pan. 
For a country who have won the World Cup four times, Italy's recent record is a national embarrassment. 
Since lifting their fourth World Cup trophy in 2006, they have not played a knockout game in the showpiece event, having only won one group stage match at the finals in that time. 
Their recent World Cup record is even more distressing.
A shock 1-0 defeat at home to low ranking North Macedonia on Thursday in their World Cup playoff semi-final ensured they have not reached the finals of the tournament since 2014.
That is now two successive failures to reach the World Cup, either side of the Euro 2020 triumph.
Coming second to Switzerland in their qualifying group, consigning Italy to the playoffs, caused uproar at home. The reaction to the playoff loss will be vitriolic to say the least.
""It's hard to say something right now, I don't know what to say,"" coach Roberto Mancini told reporters. 
""Last summer was the most beautiful joy, now comes the greatest disappointment. It is not easy to think of other things, I am very sorry for the boys: I love them much more tonight than in July.
""I am the coach, I am the first responsible, the boys are not. They have a great future, they are strong players for the future of the national team. We did not deserve this defeat.""
Italy had 32 shots at goal to North Macedonia's five but it was not as if visiting goalkeeper Stole Dimitrievski had the game of his life. He did not have a difficult save to make and the home side not scoring was down to their own wastefulness. 
North Macedonia coach Blagoja Milevski could see the irony of their last-gasp victory.
""We won Italian style against the Italians, a goal with two shots on target,"" he told reporters. ""I'm very happy for this victory, I'm proud for these guys.""

North Macedonia, who have never qualified for the World Cup, will face Portugal next Tuesday for a place in Qatar but, no matter what happens in that final playoff, they will always remember their trip to defeat the might of Italy in Palermo. 
For the Azzurri, however, it is very much back to square one, 10 months on from one of their finest hours.

DONGYIN/NANGAN, Taiwan (Reuters) - Lin Jih-shou was brewing tea last month in his popular breakfast joint when he heard the buzz of a plane – a rare sound on the remote Taiwanese-held island of Dongyin near China's coast, which does not have an airport.
Lin, 64, rushed outside, but only saw the shadow of what the government later described as a small, propeller-driven Chinese aircraft that most likely was testing Taiwan's military response.
It was a stark reminder to residents of Dongyin and Taiwan's other islands off China's coast of the threat from their huge neighbour, which considers Taipei's democratically elected government illegitimate and Taiwan a rogue province to be taken by force if needed.
The Matsu islands were regularly bombarded by China at the height of the Cold War, and the history of conflict has focused minds on Russia's invasion of Ukraine and whether the same fate may befall them. 
""When we watch Russia and Ukraine fighting, our hearts hurt,"" Lin told Reuters. ""War is too scary. There's no need."" 
Taiwan has raised its alert level since the invasion, but has not reported any signs of imminent attack.
Held by Taiwan since the defeated Republic of China government fled to Taipei in 1949 after losing the Chinese civil war, Matsu would probably be an immediate target for Beijing in a conflict, especially Dongyin's missile base.
Yet even with China's increased military pressure in recent years, the archipelago has seen trendy businesses and a nascent art scene spring up.
On the main island of Nangan, former military brothels and underground bunkers house exhibits that opened last month as part of the inaugural Matsu Biennial art festival. 
""It's a way to rebrand and retell the stories of Matsu,"" said Lii Wen, who established the local branch of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party in 2020. 
Taiwan's outlying islands, long known as military strongholds, can be reframed as ""a frontline of democracy,"" Lii said, as a Ukrainian flag fluttered outside his office window. Although their regional contexts differ, Lii said, Taiwan stands in solidarity with Ukraine as a smaller democracy facing potential invasion.
BUNKERS AND WINE EVENINGS
Dongyin native Tsai Pei-yuan, born in 1993, the year after Matsu's strict military rule ended, is part of a generation for whom war feels distant. Two years ago, Tsai and two former classmates co-founded Salty Island Studio, a cafe and community hub that has hosted arts workshops and plays.
""More urgent is trying to preserve our culture, which is disappearing,"" Tsai said before a wine-tasting event last week.
The Ukraine war is a common topic of conversation for some - including jokes about where to hide if China invades.
""When we explore strongholds, we ask, if a war really starts, which nearby stronghold would we run to?"" said Chung Jing-yei, 26, who manages Nangan's Xiwei Peninsula restaurant. 
Chung said it was only after she moved to Nangan that she understood why so many here want to maintain the status quo.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Donald Trump on Thursday sued his rival in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Hillary Clinton, and several other Democrats, alleging that they tried to rig that election by tying his campaign to Russia.
The lawsuit covers a long list of grievances the Republican former president repeatedly aired during his four years in the White House after beating Clinton, and comes as he continues to falsely claim that his 2020 election defeat by Democratic President Joe Biden was the result of widespread fraud.
""Acting in concert, the Defendants maliciously conspired to weave a false narrative that their Republican opponent, Donald J. Trump, was colluding with a hostile foreign sovereignty,"" the former president alleged in a 108-page lawsuit filed in a federal court in Florida.
The suit alleges ""racketeering"" and a ""conspiracy to commit injurious falsehood,"" among other claims.
A Clinton representative did not respond to a request for comment.
The suit seeks compensatory and punitive damages. Trump said he was ""forced to incur expenses in an amount to be determined at trial, but known to be in excess of twenty-four million dollars ($24,000,000) and continuing to accrue, in the form of defense costs, legal fees, and related expenses.""
Jeff Grell, a lawyer who specializes in racketeering cases, said Trump may have waited too long in bringing his racketeering claims. Civil racketeering claims are governed by a four-year statute of limitations, Grell said, but there is usually a big dispute about when that four-year period begins to run.
Grell said defendants may also argue various defenses, such as that Trump’s lawsuit ignores the immunity granted to government agents, the lawsuit doesn’t set forth a pattern of racketeering — which is required for liability — or the lawsuit seeks to chill the exercise of free speech.
Such defenses are usually resolved only after protracted litigation, Grell said.
The defendants in Trump's lawsuit include Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer.
A dossier written by Steele, which was circulated to the FBI and media outlets before the November 2016 election, set out unproven assertions that Russia had embarrassing information about Trump and some of his Republican campaign's advisers and that Moscow was working behind the scenes to defeat Clinton.
A 966-page report issued by a Republican-led U.S. Senate committee in 2020 concluded that Russia used Republican political operative Paul Manafort and the WikiLeaks website to try to help Trump win the 2016 election.
Manafort worked on Trump's presidential campaign for five months in 2016.
Russia’s alleged election interference, which Moscow denies, sparked a two-year-long U.S. investigation headed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

In 2019, Mueller released an exhaustive report that detailed numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign but did not charge any Trump associate with a criminal conspiracy.
Mueller said in his report that ""the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.”

""The Russian ambassador was here yesterday making a lot of noise about how Mexico and Russia are so close. This, sorry, can never happen. It can never happen,"" U.S. Ambassador Ken Salazar said in remarks at Mexico's lower house of Congress on Thursday.
""We have to be in solidarity with Ukraine and against Russia,"" he said, before invoking the history of World War II.
""I remember very well that during the Second World War there was no distance between Mexico and the United States, both were united against what Hitler was doing,"" he added.
In May 1942, Mexico's Congress approved a formal resolution of war against the Axis powers, about half a year after the United States declared war on Germany.
Salazar's comments came after Russia's ambassador to Mexico, Viktor Koronelli, addressed lawmakers at a newly inaugurated ""Mexico-Russia friendship committee"" on Wednesday.
""On the orders of Uncle Sam, Mexico will never answer 'Yes, Sir'"" Koronelli said, drawing applause from some legislators.
During his appearance, Russia's ambassador repeated his government's position that it is conducting a ""special military operation"" to ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine, whose president is Jewish.
""Russia did not begin this war, it is finishing it,"" Koronelli said.
Ukraine and Western allies call this a baseless pretext for a war of choice that has raised fears of wider conflict in Europe.
Ukraine's ambassador to Mexico Oksana Dramaretska earlier this month urged Mexican lawmakers to support international sanctions and other efforts to isolate Russia.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sought to remain neutral in the Ukraine conflict.
While supporting a United Nations vote urging Russia to withdraw its forces from Ukraine, his government has also criticized Europe for sending arms to other countries.

BRUSSELS/LVIV/MARIUPOL, Ukraine (Reuters) - Western leaders piled on military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine on Thursday and denounced Moscow's invasion of its neighbour as ""barbarism"" as thousands in besieged cities sheltered underground from Russian bombardment. 
At an unprecedented triple summit in Brussels, transatlantic alliance NATO, G7 rich nations and European leaders addressed the continent's worst conflict since the 1990s Balkans wars.
NATO announced plans for new combat units in four eastern European countries near Ukraine, while the United States and Britain increased aid and expanded sanctions to new targets, including a woman who London said was the stepdaughter of Russia's foreign minister.
""The single most important thing is for us to stay unified and the world continue to focus on what a brute this guy is and all the innocent people's lives that are being lost and ruined,"" Biden told reporters in Brussels, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
""Putin has already crossed the red line into barbarism,"" added British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. 
The European Union was set to unveil steps to wean itself off Russian energy, something likely to drive up fuel costs even further around the continent. Moscow supplies 40% of the EU's collective gas needs and more than a quarter of its oil imports.
The measures stopped short of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's calls for a full boycott of Russian energy and a no-fly zone over Ukraine where Moscow's bombs are wreaking havoc.
Responding to Thursday's show of unity in Brussels, Moscow said the West had itself to blame for the war by arming the ""Kyiv regime"".
The Russian invasion unleashed on Feb. 24. has killed thousands of people, sent 3.6 million abroad, smashed cities and driven more than half of Ukraine's children from their homes, according to the United Nations. 
'TURNED TO DUST'
""A beautiful Mariupol used to be and suddenly it was turned into dust,"" lamented 83-year-old Raisa Kairat in the besieged southern port that has become a wasteland. 
In Mariupol, which lies between Russian-annexed Crimea and eastern areas held by Russian-backed separatists, thousands are in basements with scant water, food, medicine or power, seeking shelter from heavy Russian bombardment.
In one part captured by Russian troops, a patch of grass between blasted buildings has become a makeshift graveyard. Freshly dug mounds are marked with plastic flowers and crosses made from broken window frames.
""It could have been me,"" sobbed Viktoria as she buried her 73-year-old stepfather Leonid, killed when the car ferrying him to hospital was blown up. 
In a month of fighting, Ukraine has fended off what many analysts had anticipated would be a quick Russian victory.
So far, Moscow has failed to capture any major city. Despite relentless shelling by Russia, its armoured columns have barely moved in weeks, stalled near the capital Kyiv and besieging cities in the east. 
They have taken heavy casualties and are low on supplies, and U.S. officials told Reuters that Russia is suffering high failure rates for some of its precision-guided missiles.
Ukraine says it is now shifting to the offensive and has pushed back Russian forces, including north of Kyiv. Its armed forces said they repulsed five Russian attacks in the country's east on Thursday, killing up to 130 soldiers. Reuters was unable to verify this. 
Ukraine also said its forces had destroyed the Russian landing ship the ""Orsk"" at the Russian-occupied port of Berdyansk.
Video footage, which Reuters confirmed was from Berdyansk, showed smoke rising from a blaze at a dock and the flash of an explosion. Russian officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Kremlin accuses NATO of an ""hysterical and inadequate"" understanding of events in Ukraine, a former Soviet Republic linked since the 9th century when Kyiv became the capital of the ancient state of Rus. 
Putin says NATO's eastern expansion threatened Russia's security and divided it from Ukraine. 
RUSSIA ISOLATED AGAIN AT U.N.
Ukraine's armed forces chief of staff said on Thursday Russia was still trying to resume offensives to capture the cities of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Mariupol and Kharkiv.
In Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, hundreds have hunkered down inside metro stations deep underground to avoid Russian missile strikes and near-daily shelling.
One woman sheltering in the metro, Natalia Shaposhnik, said she knew Russians who did not believe that civilians have been shelled, despite the carnage of the past four weeks.
""I wrote to them (that) I've been sheltering with my child in the metro for a month and they don't believe me. They say, 'It is your own fault, you are to blame, it is you, you, you,'"" she said.
At the U.N., almost three-quarters of the General Assembly demanded aid access in Ukraine and criticized Russia for the ""dire"" humanitarian situation - the second time the body has overwhelmingly isolated Moscow over the invasion.
Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a Putin ally, posted on social media that Chechen fighters had captured the main administrative building in Mariupol and raised their flag there. His account could not be confirmed independently.
In the Russian-held part of the city, trucks arrived with food supplies in boxes bearing the ""Z"" symbol of what Russia calls its ""special operation"". Hundreds of people, many elderly, lined up as men in Russian emergencies ministry uniforms distributed the boxes. 

""We are planning on leaving but it's very difficult at the moment,"" said one woman there, Alexandra, whose diabetic husband slipped into a coma and died before the aid arrived. He is buried in a flowerbed.
""I can't leave my husband in a flowerbed ... And then we have nowhere to go.""

(Reuters) - Arizona, Oklahoma and Kentucky passed bills on Thursday that would ban transgender youth from participating in girls' sports, the latest in a flurry of state legislation by Republicans on a heated election year issue.
In addition to the Republican-sponsored ""Save Women's Sports Act"", Arizona lawmakers passed legislation that would prohibit physicians from providing gender-affirming surgery to minors. Both bills are now headed to the desk of Governor Doug Ducey, also a Republican. Arizona passed a third bill, which would ban abortions after 15 weeks of gestation.
The votes largely fell along party lines.
""Why would we be legislating bullying against children who want to ... participate in sports?,"" Democratic Representative Kelli Butler said in an emotional speech on Thursday. ""That's not the country that I know and that I am proud to be a part of.""
A bill with the same ""Save Women's Sports Act"" title passed in the Oklahoma Legislature on Thursday.
In Kentucky, lawmakers passed SB 83, which would ban transgender girls from participating in girls sports from sixth grade through college. The bill now goes to Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a Democrat. Beshear's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Democrats have generally supported rights for LGBTQ+ people and opposed restrictions on participation in sports teams for transgender students.
Supporters of these bans argue they are needed to ensure transgender athletes do not have an unfair advantage. Opponents of the bans, including advocates for transgender people and organizations like the Women's Sports Foundation, say that such measures are discriminatory, and they advocate for the inclusion of transgender students in school sports.
Governors in states including Texas, Alabama, Mississippi and Iowa have already signed into law bills that ban transgender girls from competing in girls' sports. 

Similar bills were vetoed by the governors of Utah and Indiana this week, signaling the reluctance of some Republican leaders to align with the broader party that sees the issue as a winning strategy to attract voters ahead of U.S. congressional elections in November.
Republican lawmakers in both states said earlier this week they planned to override the governors' vetoes.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -NATO promised Kyiv new military support and assigned more troops to the alliance's eastern flank while London and Washington stepped up sanctions on Moscow during a trio of summits on Thursday aimed at showing Western unity against Russia's war in Ukraine.
NATO leaders meeting in Brussels agreed to help Ukraine protect itself against any chemical, biological or nuclear attacks, and a U.S. official said allies were working to provide Kyiv with anti-ship missiles.
""The single most important thing is for us to stay unified and the world continue to focus on what a brute this guy is and all the innocent people's lives that are being lost and ruined,"" U.S. President Joe Biden told a news conference, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
""We have to stay fully, totally, thoroughly united."" 
The United States promised to supply the EU with 15 billion cubic metres more of liquefied natural gas this year than had been planned before, sources told Reuters, as the European bloc seeks to quickly curb its reliance on Russian fossil fuels.
However, support pledges by leaders from countries representing more than half of the world's GDP fell short of satisfying Ukraine's pleas for much more arms and tighter sanctions, including an embargo on Russian energy. 
Russia supplies 40% of the EU's gas needs and more than a quarter of its oil imports. Those most dependent on this supply - in particular Germany - are reluctant to take a step that would have a major economic impact.
Speaking to 27 EU leaders via a video call on Thursday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy thanked them for sanctions against Russia but said they came too late to prevent Putin from invading on Feb.24.
""Now we are discussing Ukraine's membership in the European Union. At least here, I beg you, don't be late,"" Zelenskiy said.
He called out Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban for maintaining close ties with Putin as Russia was shelling Ukrainian cities and hoped key sceptics of EU enlargement - Germany, France and the Netherlands - would change tack.
In a move that made Europe's dilemma worse, Putin said ""unfriendly"" countries must start paying for energy supplies in roubles, which would prop up the battered Russian currency.
Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa said ""nobody will pay in roubles"" and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen rejected what she called ""blackmail"".
""BARBARISM""
Ukraine is a former Soviet republic whose aspirations to join the EU and NATO drew Moscow's ire. Putin says his ""special operation"" is aimed at destroying Ukraine's military capabilities and capturing what Russia regards as dangerous nationalists there.
The invasion has killed thousands and driven a quarter of Ukraine's 44 million people from their homes. Russian bombs have hit residential areas, schools and hospitals in Ukrainian cities including Kharkiv and the besieged Azov Sea port of Mariupol.
""Putin has already crossed the red line into barbarism,"" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said as London unveiled restrictions on Gazprombank and Alfa Bank. ""The harder our sanctions ... the more we can do to help Ukraine.""
Canada and Australia also stepped up sanctions on Russia on Thursday as the war entered its second month. But the EU lacked the unanimous support needed to impose more punitive measures, and was struggling to implement those already agreed. 
NATO turned down pleas by Kyiv to defend Ukraine's skies by imposing a no-fly zone and said again it will not send troops to Ukraine for fear of being dragged into a full-on military confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia.
NATO leaders said in a joint statement they were ""united and resolute in our determination to oppose Russia's aggression, aid the government and the people of Ukraine, and defend the security of all allies."" 
French President Emmanuel Macron said the world faced an ""unprecedented food crisis"" that will be even worse in 12 to 18 months as Ukraine, a major grower of wheat, barley, corn and sunflower, will not be able to sow crops.
NATO, which has already beefed up its eastern flank to 40,000 troops spread from the Baltic to the Black Sea, agreed to set up new combat units in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia.

The alliance also warned China should ""abstain from supporting Russia's war effort in any way, and to refrain from any action that helps Russia circumvent sanctions."" The EU would raise that when it holds a summit with China on Apr.1.
Biden said China understood its economic future was more closely tied to the West than to Russia, after warning Beijing it could face consequences for aiding Moscow's war.

In addition, Russian national Igor Aleksandrovich Michurin and North Korean national Ri Sung Chol were also sanctioned, the State Department said.
The sanctions announcement came on the same day North Korea said it tested a new, powerful type of intercontinental ballistic missile.

The United States also sanctioned Zhengzhou Nanbei Instrument Equipment Co Ltd for supplying Syria with equipment controlled by a chemical and biological weapons nonproliferation regime known as the Australia Group.

499,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 07:01PM ET</span>",,,,,,"SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korea test-fired its massive Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) for the first time on Thursday, demonstrating the capabilities of a weapon potentially able to deliver a nuclear warhead to anywhere in the United States.
It came after officials in Seoul and Washington said launches on Feb. 27 and March 5 involved parts of the Hwasong-17 ICBM system, likely in preparation for a full test like the one on Thursday.
Here is what we know the Hwasong-17, which analysts have called a ""monster missile"":
The Hwasong-17 flew for 67.5 minutes to a range of 1,090 km (681 miles) and a maximum altitude of 6,248.5 km (3,905 miles) and precisely hit a target in the sea, state news agency KCNA reported. Those numbers are similar to data reported by Japan and South Korea and are further and longer than North Korea's last ICBM test in 2017, when it launched a Hwasong-15 missile that flew for 53 minutes to an altitude of about 4,475 km and range of 950 km.
Unlike any of North Korea's previous ICBM tests, the Hwasong-17 was launched directly from a transporter, erector, launcher (TEL) vehicle, photos by state media showed. The Hwasong-17, which has been shown on a TEL with 11 axles, is the largest road-mobile, liquid-fuelled ICBM in the world, analysts said.
Its diameter is estimated to be between 2.4 and 2.5 metres, and its total mass, when fully fuelled, is likely somewhere between 80,000 and 110,000 kg, according to 38 North, a U.S.-based programme that monitors North Korea.
North Korea first unveiled the previously unseen ICBM at an unprecedented pre-dawn military parade in October 2020, with analysts noting it appeared ""considerably larger"" than the Hwasong-15. It was displayed a second time at a defence exhibition in Pyongyang in October 2021. After examining photos of the exhibit, analysts concluded the official designation of this large ICBM is most likely ""Hwasong-17"", not Hwasong-16.
It is unclear whether the Feb. 27 and March 5 test-fires used all or part of the two-stage missile. Some analysts say the tests may have involved only one stage.

The Hwasong-17's size has prompted analysts to speculate that it will be designed to carry multiple warheads and decoys to better penetrate missile defences.
Some observers said that the satellite technology that North Korea claimed to have tested in the Feb. 27 and March 5 launches could also be used for a multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) system, potentially allowing a single missile to drop nuclear warheads on different targets.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Legislation removing ""most favored nation"" trade status for Russia over the invasion of Ukraine was delayed in the U.S. Senate at least until next week, after some Republicans raised concerns that its human rights provisions might be too broad.
The bill was blocked despite lawmakers' insistence that they wanted to show a united front in supporting the government in Kyiv, a month after Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine.
It is expected to pass next week, although the delay stymied efforts by President Joe Biden's fellow Democrats to pass it in time for his meetings on Thursday with allies in Europe.
Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer asked for unanimous consent to quickly approve the measure, which was overwhelmingly passed by the House of Representatives a week earlier. The bill would remove Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) status for Russia and its ally Belarus, paving the way for higher tariffs on imports from the two countries.
Republican Senator Rand Paul refused to allow a vote on Thursday, which under Senate rules delayed the matter at least until next week.
Paul said he was concerned that an expansion of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act included in the PNTR measure - which has the act address ""serious"" rights violations rather than ""gross"" ones - might give too much power to the president.

Senator Mike Crapo, the top Republican on the Finance Committee, which handles trade matters, had objected to a quick vote earlier this week because he - and some other Republicans - wanted it to include a ban on imports of Russian oil and gas. Democrats and Republicans overcame that issue by agreeing to a separate vote on an energy bill, also expected next week.
The trade bill passed the House by a 424-to-8 last week. It passed the energy bill on March 9.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. House of Representatives committee probing the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol said on Thursday it was moving toward holding Peter Navarro, a former trade adviser to ex-President Donald Trump, and Daniel Scavino, who was a Trump deputy chief of staff, in contempt of Congress for not complying with subpoenas.
The Select Committee said it would hold a business meeting on Monday to vote on a report recommending the full House cite them for contempt of Congress and refer them for federal prosecution. 
Trump has urged associates not to cooperate with the committee, calling the Democratic-led investigation politically motivated and arguing that his communications are protected by executive privilege, although many legal experts have said that legal principle does not apply to former presidents.
The committee announced on Feb. 9 that it had subpoenaed Navarro, a key player in Trump's effort to overturn his defeat by Democratic President Joe Biden in the 2020 election.
Biden's administration said in a letter on Feb. 28 that it was denying executive privilege to Navarro, saying it was not in the national interest.
Navarro has said in media interviews and in his book that he helped coordinate an effort - ""the Green Bay Sweep"" - to halt certification of Biden's victory and keep Trump in power.
Scavino was subpoenaed in September. The committee said he was a witness to Trump's activities on the day of the assault of the seat of U.S. government by thousands of the defeated president's supporters.
Neither man could be reached for comment.
If the Jan. 6 Select Committee approves the contempt of Congress report, the matter would be referred to a vote in the full Democratic-controlled House.
The House has already approved criminal referrals for two others who defied the Jan. 6 panel's subpoenas - Steve Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist, and Mark Meadows, a former House member who was one of Trump's White House chiefs of staff.

Bannon faces federal charges for refusing to cooperate with the committee and declining to produce documents.
The House voted on Meadows in December, but the Justice Department has not yet announced whether it will take action.

KHARKIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - In a Ukrainian city battered by bombs since the start of Russia's invasion, Natalia Shaposhnik and her daughter Veronika live in a blue and yellow train parked in a metro station deep underground. 
For four long weeks, Shaposhnik and hundreds like her have hunkered down inside the station in the north of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city. 
With destroyed or heavily damaged buildings on almost every block, the streets were eerily quiet and empty above ground on Thursday. 
Down in the station, families crowded together, most of them from the city's northern outskirts which have suffered near-daily shelling. 
Women and children slept side by side on cold concrete floors, or set up home in warmer train carriages divided by curtains into smaller family rooms. 
They go out only to walk their dogs or to get a fresh breath of air, a small respite from the dank humidity underground. 
""It's not better than home but it is liveable,"" said Shaposhnik, 36, who used to work in a pet shop before the war. 
Even underground, the war is ever-present. 
On Thursday, a Russian missile hit a metro station two stops away from where Shaposhnik lives with her daughter, killing and wounding several people. 
Outside, while a crew cleaned up the shrapnel from the site, a car crammed with wounded Ukrainian soldiers screeched past. 
A month on from the start of the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has cast the war as an existential battle not only for his country but for all of Europe.
Russia refers to the invasion as a ""special military operation"" and says its forces do not target civilians.

Shaposhnik said she still knew Russians who did not believe that civilians have been shelled, despite the carnage of the past four weeks. 
""I wrote to them (that) I've been sheltering with my child in the metro for a month and they don't believe me. They say 'it is your own fault, you are to blame, it is you, you, you,"" she said.

BRUSSELS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States plans to accept up to 100,000 Ukrainians fleeing Russia's invasion and is pledging $1 billion in new humanitarian aid, the Biden administration said on Thursday after a month of bombardments touched off Europe's fastest-moving refugee crisis since the end of World War Two.
The announcement coincided with U.S. President Joe Biden's meeting with European leaders in Brussels to coordinate the Western response to the crisis.
More than 3.5 million people have fled since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, putting a strain on the neighboring European countries receiving them. 
U.S. lawmakers and advocates have urged Biden to do more to help those seeking refuge in the United States. 
In the first two weeks of March, seven Ukrainian refugees were resettled in the United States, internal U.S. State Department data seen by Reuters shows. 
Some Ukrainians have traveled to Mexico to seek U.S. asylum at the southwest border.
A senior Biden official said the administration still expected many Ukrainians to choose to remain in Europe close to their home country but added the U.S. commitment to receive more people would relieve some pressure on European nations currently hosting the bulk of refugees fleeing the conflict, which Russia calls a ""special military operation."" 
""We recognize that some number of Ukrainians who have fled may wish to come to the United States temporarily,"" the official told reporters on the condition of anonymity. 
The Biden administration said in a statement it would use ""the full range of legal pathways"" to bring Ukrainians to the United States, including the U.S. refugee resettlement program, which provides a path to citizenship.
As part of the effort, Ukrainians may enter through existing visa avenues and through a relief program known as ""humanitarian parole,"" which allows people into the country on an emergency basis, the senior administration official said. The Biden administration said it will focus on Ukrainians with family members in the United States.
Reuters reported details of the plans earlier this week. 
'LOTS OF QUESTIONS'
Before the crisis erupted in Ukraine, Biden launched the largest U.S. resettlement effort since the Vietnam War by accepting about 80,000 Afghans - many arriving in a mass airlift operation - after U.S. troops left Afghanistan following 20 years of war.
In contrast to the Afghan evacuation however, the 100,000 Ukrainians would not necessarily be allowed into the United States all at once or even within the current fiscal year, which stretches until the end of September, the U.S. official said.
About 355,000 Ukrainian immigrants live in the United States, according to data analyzed by the Migration Policy Institute (MPI), a Washington-based think tank.
Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst with MPI, said that she welcomed the new U.S. commitments, but that ""there are lots of questions"" about how much, and how quickly, they could help.
A Democrat, Biden set a goal to resettle 125,000 refugees this fiscal year, which began last October, a massive jump from former President Donald Trump, a Republican who slashed refugee levels. But amid COVID-19 delays and other challenges, only around 6,500 refugees from around the world have been admitted, far below Biden's goal.
For Ukrainians who have relatives in the United States, the administration will seek to speed up processing of family-based visas for permanent residency.

But placing Ukrainians through these legal pathways risks adding to an already ballooning backlog of hundreds of thousands of unprocessed visa applications, Gelatt said.
The humanitarian parole program, another route the administration could use for Ukrainians, does not provide permanent status in the United States, meaning Ukrainians entering that way would face an uncertain future.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration on Thursday rolled out a sweeping new regulation that aims to speed up asylum processing and deportations at the U.S.-Mexico border, amid a record number of migrants seeking to enter the United States.
The announcement of the new rule came as U.S. officials are debating whether to end a separate COVID-19-era policy that has blocked most asylum claims at the border. The asylum overhaul could provide a faster way to process border crossers if the COVID order is ended.
The final asylum rule, which will go into effect in late May, will authorize asylum officers to accept or reject migrants' claims for protection soon after they cross the border, in an effort to resolve them in months rather than years by largely bypassing backlogged U.S. immigration courts.
Democratic President Joe Biden's administration says changes to the asylum system are needed to humanely deal with the rising number of attempted border crossings, which have hit record highs and fueled attacks from Republicans aiming to take control of Congress in the November midterm elections. 
Both immigration hawks and pro-immigrant advocacy groups criticized the new policy on Thursday, raising the specter of future legal challenges. 
Most migrants caught at the southwestern border come from Mexico and Central America, but an increasing number are arriving from farther places and seeking refuge, including in recent weeks Ukrainians fleeing Russia's invasion of their country, an action that Moscow calls a ""special military operation.""
Under the new rule, which is being issued jointly by the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice, more migrants, including families, will be placed in a process known as ""expedited removal"" to resolve cases more quickly. 
It will not apply to unaccompanied children. 
The fast-track process will aim to resolve cases within 90 days. While migrants denied asylum will get another chance to make their case before an immigration judge, those cases will also be expedited with a goal of resolving them quickly.
""The current system for handling asylum claims at our borders has long needed repair,"" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement.
Immigrant advocate Eleanor Acer, senior director for refugee protection at Human Rights First, said the new rule ""risks sacrificing accurate decision-making for its narrative of speed."" At the same time, restrictionist groups say the rule will do nothing to discourage higher levels of illegal immigration.
A U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) official who briefed reporters on Wednesday under condition of anonymity, said the new system will be phased in gradually and initially be applied only to a small number of migrants.
The Biden administration said in an earlier draft of the measure that it would need to hire about 2,000 additional asylum officers and support personnel, more than double the number working now.
The USCIS official who briefed reporters did not give details about the status of additional hiring or funding.

For now, Biden has kept a controversial order known as Title 42, which was put in place in March 2020 by his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump. It allows U.S. authorities to quickly expel most migrants caught crossing the border to Mexico or other countries to limit the spread of COVID. 
The Biden administration is leaning toward ending the order in the wake of recent court decisions that complicate its implementation, but no final decision has been made with a looming deadline next week to renew, modify or terminate it.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron brought a map to NATO on Thursday to show just how much his troops were doing to support the security of his allies and explain how France could be counted on to show solidarity.
Riding high in polls just three weeks before a presidential election, the French candidate-president, has been able to put aside the nitty gritty of French political campaigning to focus almost solely on the war in Ukraine and its impact on the global economy. 
Macron, who has spared no effort to mediate between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, entered the presidential election race just a month before the first round on April 10 and has kept the number of campaign events to a minimum.
He has faced a little criticism in recent days with some voters saying he was focusing too much on Ukraine and not enough on France.
But on Thursday with the global attention on an unprecedented summit of transatlantic alliance NATO, G7 rich nations and European leaders to address the continent's biggest military crisis since the 1990s Balkans wars, Macron was keen to underscore his commander-in-chief status and said France would adapt to the new strategic stakes.
It is rare for leaders to bring props to demonstrate what they are doing, but like a professor giving a lecture, Macron turned to a map in a digital slideshow, gesturing with his hand.
""From the north to the south of the eastern NATO flank, the map that's here enables you to see all our current commitments,"" he said, breaking down France's military activity from drills in Norway to its new presence in Romania, and aerial policing missions in Estonia to the aircraft carrier launching monitoring missions from the eastern Mediterranean.
Macron wanted to send a message. He would not be rash. Asked by reporters about fears of future Russian chemical weapons use in Ukraine, he remained prudent.
He would not set red lines that could not be backed up with action as had been the case when he ordered air strikes on Syrian targets in 2018 after a suspected chemical attack.
France's word depended on it, he said. 
On delivering weapons to Ukraine, his responsibility, he said was not to deliver tanks and warplanes that would lead to war with Russia, but to continue NATO's existing military support that did not aim to ""wage war,"" but bring a ceasefire and a negotiation.
Macron hob knobbed with leaders. Handshakes, smiles and a warm exchange with Italy's Mario Draghi as Britain's Boris Johnson looked on by himself as they prepared for a NATO family photo.

He leaned over resting his hand on Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan's shoulder as the two chatted jovially - something unthinkable just a year ago when the two leaders were trading barbs almost on a daily basis.
When asked by a Romanian reporter about France's presence in his country, Macron smiled, asking for the map to be brought out again.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A group of Georgia voters on Thursday asked state officials to block Republican U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene from running for reelection, alleging she is unfit for office because of her support of rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol.
In a legal challenge filed with the Georgia Secretary of State, the voters claim Greene has violated a provision of the U.S. Constitution known as the ""Insurrectionist Disqualification Clause.""
The clause, passed after the 19th-century U.S. Civil War, prohibits politicians from running for Congress if they have engaged in ""insurrection or rebellion"" against the United States, or ""given aid or comfort"" to the nation's enemies.
The Georgia voters are represented by Free Speech For People, a Texas-based advocacy group that brought a similar challenge to Republican congressman Madison Cawthorn's qualifications for office.
A federal judge dismissed the Cawthorn case on March 4, but Free Speech for People has urged North Carolina officials to appeal that ruling, and has filed its own emergency appeal. 
Greene said in a statement that she opposes all forms of political violence.
""I’ve never encouraged political violence and never will,"" she said.
Greene has downplayed and justified the Jan. 6, 2021, attack, in which supporters of Donald Trump stormed the Capitol, battling with police and sending lawmakers running for their lives after a fiery speech by Trump near the White House repeated his false claims that his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud.
""Jan. 6 was just a riot at the Capitol and if you think about what our Declaration of Independence says, it says to overthrow tyrants,"" Greene said during a radio program in October.
The legal challenge will be heard by an administrative law judge. Greene could also ask a federal judge to step in and block the challenge.
""After taking the oath to defend and protect the Constitution, before, on, and after Jan. 6, 2021, Greene voluntarily aided and engaged in an insurrection to obstruct the peaceful transfer of presidential power,"" the lawsuit states.
Some legal experts have expressed skepticism of Free Speech for People’s arguments.

Derek Muller, a law professor at the University of Iowa, said it would be unconstitutional for Georgia election officials to take Greene off the ballot. The Constitution does not give states the power to assess a congressional candidate’s eligibility for office, reserving that power for Congress, he said.
""Georgia has no jurisdiction to assess a congressional candidate’s eligibility today,"" Muller said in an email. ""Even if Ms. Greene were an insurrectionist, Congress has the authority to lift that bar, which it could do at any time before she presents her credentials to Congress next year if she were reelected.""

A news conference after meetings with NATO leaders veered into U.S. politics when Biden was asked about European concerns that ""a figure like your predecessor, maybe even your predecessor himself"" could take office and undo U.S. and NATO efforts to address Russian aggression in Ukraine.
""The next election - I'd be very fortunate to have that same man running against me,"" said the Democratic president, who defeated Trump in the 2020 election.
The quip came after a long answer that included why he decided to run for president in 2020 after Trump's tepid response to 2017 far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Biden, who has worked hard to rebuild ties with European and other allies that were frayed during the Trump administration, said the next election was a long way off and that he was focused on making sure Democrats do well in congressional elections in November.
""But it's not an illogical question for someone to ask,"" he said, especially after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters. 
""If we sat and watched the doors of the Bundestag broken down and police officers killed, and hundreds of people storming in,"" Biden said, ""Imagine that we saw that happening in the British parliament. How would we feel? 
As is his wont, Biden did not say Trump's name, referring him as ""that gentlemen you mentioned"" or something similar.
Democratic political advisers close to Biden have been expressing the same sentiment for months, seeing Trump as one of the weaker contenders among hypothetical candidates in a head-to-head contest with Biden.

Trump has not announced his candidacy for 2024, which would require him to set up a separate fundraising account for his campaign, but he regularly hints at his political rallies that he intends to run for president again.
A Trump representative did not immediately return a request for comment.

509,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 03:26PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Russians have rushed to stock up on anti-depressants, sleeping pills and contraceptives among other products since the conflict in Ukraine began, data released on Thursday showed, with people buying a month's worth of medicine in just two weeks.
Although official opinion polls suggest most Russians support President Vladimir Putin's decision to send tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine, social media, interviews and anecdotal data suggest many Russians have been distressed by the severity of the sanctions imposed on Moscow by the West to try to force it to withdraw its forces. 
Many foreign brands have announced they are suspending their operations or quitting Russia, the rouble's value against the dollar has slumped dramatically, and prices for many everyday products have soared since Feb. 24 when Putin announced what he called ""a special operation"" in Ukraine.
""I myself take L-thyroxine as I have issues with my thyroid gland so I'm taking it daily and I worry about it,"" Valentina, a Moscow resident, said. 
""That's why I bought a supply of it for a couple of months in advance as I'm worried if I will be able to find it in pharmacies later. People are asking for it everywhere.""
Sales data gathered by analytical company DSM Group for the daily Vedomosti newspaper showed on Thursday that Russians had bought 270.5 million medicinal items in pharmacies from Feb. 28 until March 13 for 98.6 billion roubles ($1.04 billion).
That was almost comparable to the sales data for the entire month of January when Russians bought 288 million items in pharmacies for 100 billion roubles. 
The latest data, which did not name specific brands, showed an upsurge in demand for foreign-produced pharmaceuticals with demand for Russian-made products growing too. 
In particular, it showed sharply increased demand for anti-depressants, sleeping pills, insulin, cancer and heart drugs, hormones and contraceptives. 
""It was fear,"" Sergei Shulyak, general director of DSM Group, the company that gathered the data, told Reuters. 
""The first fear was that everything could get more expensive and the second fear was that medicines they need won't be available in some time. Those fears moved people. They stood in lines at pharmacies and bought everything."" 
Shulyak, who said what he called ""hysteria"" had taken hold, said there was now a temporary shortage of some medicines, but said he expected the situation to stabilise in time with Russian manufacturers still able to produce generic drugs and many foreign producers continuing to supply Russia even if their products were now being sold at a higher price. 
He warned however that worsening ties with the West meant some Russian drug producers were having problems sourcing ingredients they needed to make their products. 
Some Russians said they were unfazed by the panic.

""There might be some (shortages) especially if the medicine is imported, but I think it will all come back because politics is politics, economics is economics,"" said Vladimir, a Moscow resident. ""They (the drug manufacturers) all need to sell, they all need to gain profit, so it’ll all be back.""

(Reuters) -New York Mayor Eric Adams said on Thursday he was lifting the city's COVID-19 vaccine mandate for professional athletes and performers, allowing unvaccinated Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving to play at home and lifting a cloud ahead of Major League Baseball's opening day. 
Adams said he signed an order exempting New York City-based athletes and performers from the city's private employer vaccine mandate imposed by former Mayor Bill de Blasio. That mandate requires private-sector workers to show proof of vaccination. 
""We are doing it because the city has to function,"" he said during a news conference at Citi Field, home to the New York Mets. ""New York City is at a low risk environment so today we take a another step in the city's economic recovery."" 
The announcement comes two days after Adams made masks optional for children aged 2 to 4 in school and daycare earlier this week.
In January, at the height of the Omicron variant-driven COVID-19 surge, New York City recorded a seven-day positivity rate of 20% - meaning one-in-five people tested for COVID had the virus. That rate has drastically fallen and stood at 1.4% this week, State of New York data showed.
The city's vaccine mandate remains in place for police officers. The union representing New York City's 36,000 officers has sued the city, calling the vaccine mandate ""arbitrary and capricious.""
""If the mandate isn't necessary for famous people, then it's not necessary for the cops who are protecting our city in the middle of a crime crisis,"" the union's president, Patrick Lynch, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Thursday.
Irving, a seven-time National Basketball Association All-Star who is unvaccinated, sat out the first two months of the current season. The city's vaccine mandate prevented him from playing in home games. On Jan. 5, Irving played his first road game of the season against the Indiana Pacers. 
Adams, who took office in January, kept the mandate in place despite complaints that the athletes could play in other cities and practice with their teams outside the city. 
Unvaccinated performers will also be able to once again take the stage at venues like Madison Square Garden and Broadway. They have been unable to do so since the mandate was put into place. 

The loosening of the restrictions comes in time for Major League Baseball's opening day on April 7 after a lockout forced a brief postponement. Some prominent New York baseball players such as Yankees slugger Aaron Judge have been evasive about their vaccine status.
The New York Yankees will play their home opener on April 7 while the New York Mets will welcome back fans on April 15.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House has set up a team of experts to plan how the United States could respond should Russia use weapons of mass destruction - chemical, biological or nuclear - during its invasion of Ukraine, senior administration officials said on Thursday.
Russia has repeatedly raised the prospect of using nuclear weapons as it struggles to overcome Ukraine's military during the month-old war that the Russian government calls a ""special operation."" This week, the Kremlin said such weapons would only be used in the case of an ""existential threat.""
U.S. officials have warned that Russia's accusations that Ukraine might use chemical weapons are a lie, and also an indication Moscow may resort to their use, given past precedent.
President Joe Biden said on Thursday that if Russia were to use chemical weapons in its invasion of Ukraine, the United States would respond.
""We would respond, we would respond if he uses it. The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use,"" Biden said at a news conference in Brussels. 
The White House National Security Council sent an internal memo to agencies on Feb. 28 to create a strategy group to examine major geopolitical shifts that are occurring as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, officials said. A second group, known internally as the ""Tiger Team,"" is looking at what the next three months look like. 
The strategy group is working ""to monitor and mitigate risks, while considering how to advance and defend U.S. interests,"" one U.S. official said.
The teams are making contingency plans for various scenarios including Russia's potential use of chemical or biological weapons; the targeting of U.S. security convoys; disruptions to global food supply chains; and the continued response to the growing refugee crisis, the official said.
The teams are also looking at the possible use of nuclear weapons by Russia, the official said.
The official would not speculate on how the United States might respond should Russia use weapons of mass destruction, but have made clear there would be a response.
Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said on CNN that it is incumbent on the United States to think about contingencies.
""We haven't seen any indication that the Russians are prepared to use weapons of mass destruction inside Ukraine. If that were to happen there would be a significant response,"" from both the United States and the international community, Kirby said.
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in Brussels on Thursday that there are ongoing concerns Russia may be trying to create a pretext for its own actions by accusing Ukraine and its allies of using chemical weapons. Echoing U.S. officials, he said the accusations are a pretext for Russia to do the same.
White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Tuesday that President Joe Biden, in Brussels for urgent talks with NATO and European leaders, would discuss the possible use of nuclear weapons by Russia.

State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters on Wednesday that Biden would also discuss chemical and biological weapons with the allies.
""We've tried to be very clear about the gravity of the use of any such chemical weapons. These are agents that should never be employed, and certainly not on the battlefield, as we are concerned Russia might,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After U.S. President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory, his future policy chief for the Indo-Pacific region said the new administration would have to decide quickly its approach to North Korea and its nuclear and missile programs.
Delay during the Obama administration saw ""provocative"" North Korean steps ""that basically headed off any possibility of engagement,"" Kurt Campbell said. 
High-profile summits between former President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un produced little.
Yet Biden left North Korea entirely out of his maiden foreign policy speech in February 2021 and hours after his first news conference as president the following month, North Korea launched a new tactical missile, highlighting its relentless military advances.
At that time, Biden agreed with a questioner in saying that North Korea was the top foreign policy issues he faced, yet it was another month before he settled on a strategy that kept the door open to diplomacy but rejected the idea of offering the sanctions relief Pyongyang sought before it took steps to dismantle its nuclear weapons program.
North Korea called this evidence of ""hostile"" U.S. intent and this year embarked upon an unprecedented spate of missile testing, culminating with what appears to have been its largest ever intercontinental ballistic missile launch on Thursday.
The return to testing of missiles capable of hitting the United States and Kim's vow to develop a system with multiple warheads capable of evading U.S. missile defenses presents a fresh major headache for Biden at a time when he is consumed by countering Russia's invasion of Ukraine and prepares for challenging mid-term elections in November.
But responding to the first launch of an ICBM since 2017 will be far more difficult than it was then, with the world powers that are capable of imposing new sanctions on North Korea at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), as they did after the last ICBM tests, at odds over Ukraine.
After his ICBM tests in 2017, North Korea's Kim launched into an unprecedented period of engagement with Trump, which ultimately did nothing to roll back Pyongyang's weapons programs.
""The Biden administration ... had the chance to try to start off on a more productive foot with the North Koreans,"" said Jenny Town of the North Korea project, 38 North.
Progress could have been made in confidence-building steps, including towards declaring an end to the 1950-53 Korean War and clearing obstacles for humanitarian aid, that should have been dealt with when relations were warming under Trump.
""But now - the moment is gone,"" Town said. ""And with the U.N. Security Council effectively paralyzed, the tools we have - even to build off-ramps to escalation, are much more limited.""
""We're not in a good spot ... this was entirely predictable,"" said Sue Mi Terry, a former CIA Korea analyst now with Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank (CSIS), adding that there could be worse to come in terms of North Korean tests. 
""This is ... the perfect time because the whole world is distracted and there's going to be no real consequences,"" she said. ""What is UNSC going to do? Is Russia going to help, is China going to help?"" 
WORRY OVER BOMB TESTS
A particular worry is that Kim might also resume nuclear bomb tests for the first time since 2017.
Victor Cha, a former White House North Korea expert now with CSIS, said satellite imagery had shown renewed activity at North Korea's main nuclear testing site at Punggye-ri. While it was not yet possible to determine exactly what that implied, ""any activity there is not a good sign,"" he said.
Matt Pottinger, who served as Trump's deputy national security adviser, told a Hoover Institution event on Thursday that North Korea would have been emboldened by the Biden administration's ""appeasement"" of Iran over its nuclear program.
Former Obama administration officials close to the current administration defended its approach.
Daniel Russel, Obama's top diplomat for East Asia, said there were no good options for dealing with North Korea and that Trump's ""ill-advised"" summits with Kim in 2018 and 2019 had ""eased pressure on North Korea without restraining its nuclear and missile programs.""
""In fact, the ICBM just launched was surely developed and produced while Kim and then-president Trump were exchanging 'love notes,'"" he said, referring to the letters between them.

Abraham Denmark, the senior Pentagon official for East Asia under Obama, argued that Biden's efforts to strengthen U.S. alliances and its leadership of the international response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, meant ""deterrence against North Korean aggression is far stronger today.""
He said Kim's calculations were not only driven by Washington, and the demonstration of a more credible ICBM capability could be aimed signaling strength and resolve in response to incoming South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol, who has declared his intention to adopt a much harder line against Pyongyang and strengthen Seoul's U.S. alliance.

Speaking to reporters in Brussels following a NATO summit, Erdogan said the resolutions adopted by the alliance should not be perceived as a threat to Russia or any third country, but that they should be viewed as deterrance.

NATO member Turkey shares a martime border with Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea, has good ties with both and has offered to mediate the conflict. Erdogan said Turkey's main goal as part of its mediation efforts was to bring together the Ukrainian and Russian presidents for talks.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) -Ukraine is using facial recognition software to identify the bodies of Russian soldiers killed in combat and to trace their families to inform them of their deaths, Ukraine's vice prime minister told Reuters.
Reuters exclusively reported that Ukraine's Ministry of Defense this month began using technology from Clearview AI, a New York-based facial recognition provider that finds images on the web that match faces from uploaded photos. It was not clear at that time how the technology would be used.
Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's vice prime minister who also runs the ministry of digital transformation, told Reuters Ukraine had been using Clearview AI software to find the social media accounts of dead Russian soldiers. 
From there, authorities are messaging relatives to make arrangements to collect the body, he said. 
""As a courtesy to the mothers of those soldiers, we are disseminating this information over social media to at least let families know that they they've lost their sons and to then enable them to come to collect their bodies,"" Fedorov said in an interview, speaking via a translator. 
Fedorov declined to specify the number of bodies identified through facial recognition but he said the percentage of recognized individuals claimed by families has been ""high."" Reuters was unable to independently confirm this. 
In response to a request for comment on Ukraine's use of Clearview, a Kremlin spokesperson said: ""We have no knowledge of this. There are too many fakes coming out of Ukraine."" The spokesman did not provide further details.
Ukraine's military has said some 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed since Russia invaded on Feb 24. Russia has not updated its casualty figures since March 2, when it said 498 soldiers had been killed in what it describes as a ""special military operation"" to demilitarize Ukraine. 
Asked about the recovery of soldiers' bodies from Ukraine, the Kremlin spokesman said the question of casualties from the military operation was the competence of the defence ministry. Russia's defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Opponents of facial recognition, including civil rights groups, have decried Ukraine's adoption of Clearview, citing the possibility of misidentification. 
Clearview is battling a lawsuit in U.S. federal court in Chicago filed by consumers under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. The ongoing case concerns whether the company's gathering of images from the internet violated privacy law.
Clearview says its actions have been legal. It says its face matches should only be a starting point in investigations.
Fedorov said Ukraine was not using the technology to identify its own troops killed in battle. He did not specify why.
Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs did not respond to requests for comment. It has been overseeing the country's Look For Your Own project, a Telegram channel where it posts images of unidentified captured or killed Russian soldiers and invites claims from relatives.
RELATIVES CAN SUBMIT CLAIMS
The Ukrainian government has an online form https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfNcHV6cob4f8QHc90QnpAihMsioOOroSQWNAVHCmwDelHL8w/viewform where Russian relatives can submit a claim to collect a body. Fedorov did not provide details of how the bodies are being returned to families and Reuters could not independently determine that. 
Clearview, which offered its service free of charge to Ukraine after the Russian invasion, has said its search engine includes over 2 billion images from VKontakte, a popular Russian social media service.
VKontakte did not respond to a request for comment.
Facial recognition is just one of many tools Ukraine has adopted for free as Western businesses come to its aid, Fedorov said. For instance, his ministry is now using cloud services from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) to store ""critical data,"" he said, without elaborating. 
Amazon declined to comment on Fedorov's remarks.
Richard Bassed, head of the forensic medicine department at Monash University in Australia, said fingerprints, dental records and DNA remain the most common ways of confirming someone's identity. 
Obtaining pre-death samples of such data from enemy fighters is challenging, though, opening the door to innovative techniques such as facial recognition.

But clouded eyes and injured and expressionless faces potentially make facial recognition unreliable on the dead, said Bassed, who has been researching the technology. 
In the United States, the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System said it has not adopted automated facial recognition because the technology is not currently generally accepted in the forensic community.

BRUSSELS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States and its allies on Thursday ramped up pressure on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, as Washington imposed fresh sanctions on dozens of Russian defense companies, hundreds of members of its parliament and the chief executive of the country's largest bank.
The U.S. Treasury Department also issued guidance on its website warning that gold-related transactions involving Russia may be sanctionable by U.S. authorities, a move aimed at stopping Russia from evading existing sanctions.
""Our purpose here is to methodically remove the benefits and privileges Russia once enjoyed as a participant in the international economic order,"" a senior administration official said, speaking on condition they not be named.
The United States and its allies have imposed several rounds of sanctions, including targeting the country's largest lenders and President Vladimir Putin, since Russian forces invaded Ukraine a month ago in the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two.
Moscow calls the assault a ""special operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" its neighbor.
Among the new sanctions targets are more than 40 defense companies, including state-owned Tactical Missiles Corp and 28 firms to which it is linked, as well as its general director, the Treasury said in a statement.
The Treasury said Washington's action aligned with similar measures taken by the EU, the United Kingdom and Canada. 
The Treasury said the conglomerate, which Britain has already hit with sanctions, produces naval systems and weapons that Russia is using against Ukraine, including the Kh-31, a high-speed airborne guided missile that has been employed extensively in Moscow’s offensive.
Other firms on the new list include manufacturers of ammunition for the Russian military, civilian and military helicopters, and drones that the Treasury said originally were designed for surveillance but have been ""repurposed"" and used to attack Ukrainian forces.
The Treasury also slapped sanctions on 328 members of the Duma, Russia's parliament, and Herman Gref, the head of Russia's largest lender, Sberbank, who the Treasury said was a close Putin associate.
The United States said last month that U.S. banks must sever their correspondent banking ties - which allow banks to make payments between one another and move money around the globe - with Sberbank, but did not freeze its assets.
The United States on Thursday also targeted 17 board members of Sovcombank, which is also under U.S. sanctions, and Gennady Timchenko, a longtime ally of Putin, his companies and family members.
The official said the United States warned Putin that it would face swift and severe consequences if he invaded Ukraine and they have delivered on that threat. The official noted that the country is facing punishing inflation and economic pain that will push it out of the world’s top 20 economies.
“Russia will soon face an acute shortage of ideas, talent and technology to compete in the 21st century, and Putin will be left with a strategic failure of his own making,” the official said.

U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said earlier this week the United States would consult with allies about Russia's inclusion in the G20 group of the world's largest economies. 
The sanctions and their economic consequences could make that discussion easier by effectively making Moscow ineligible because of its shrinking economy.

PRZEMYSL, Poland (Reuters) -Ukrainian refugees in Poland urged Western powers on Thursday to do more to protect the country from Russian bombardment as leaders met in Brussels for unprecedented summits of NATO, G7 and the European Union.
Echoing President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's repeated calls for a no-fly zone over Ukraine - where thousands of people have been killed - many said they were scared for family left behind. 
""We ask for protection from (Russia) bombing us from the sky,"" said Svetlana, from Mykolaiv, standing in Poland's Przemysl railway station, not far from the Ukrainian border.
""And help us not only with equipment but with peace forces and professional soldiers,"" said the 55-year-old, who was returning home with her son to rejoin her parents and older son after initially seeking refuge in Poland and Germany.
President Zelenskiy said he expected ""serious steps"" from the Brussels meetings to help Kyiv fight Russia's month-old invasion, which has driven a quarter of Ukraine's population of 44 million from their homes.
More than 3.6 million people have fled the country since the invasion began, with the majority seeking safety in Poland.
Zoriana-Mariya Kruk, 31, fled with her daughter Eva from Chervonohrad in western Ukraine to the safety of the Benedictine Sisters Monastery in Jaroslaw, southern Poland, where she now attends pre-school.
""Constant air raid alarms, sirens, picking up your children at 2, 3 a.m... interrupting their sleep, and going with them to the basement,"" Kruk said, describing the situation in her home town. ""No one knows how that night will end... Nobody knows where a rocket could hit.""
Education Minister Przemyslaw Czarnek told the Onet news website on Thursday that there were around 115,000 Ukrainian children in Polish schools.
Western leaders have promised to step up support for Ukraine, but NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg repeated that the alliance will not send troops or planes to Ukraine.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said a no-fly zone above Ukraine would mean air war between NATO and Russia, saying escalation must be avoided.
The Kremlin said most NATO member states suffered from an ""hysterical and inadequate"" understanding of what is going on in Ukraine.
Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his troops into Ukraine on what he calls a ""special military operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Kyiv and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war. 
THOUGHTS OF HOME
Przemysl station became an important entry into Poland in the first weeks of the invasion, its halls and corridors bustling with refugees, volunteers and members of the public offering lifts to other European countries.
However, the numbers making the border crossing have steadily waned and the atmosphere in the station on Thursday was calm.
Poland's Border Guard said that on Wednesday, around 30,000 people crossed over from Ukraine, a decrease of 2.5% compared to the previous day.
In Romania, 8,910 people crossed, a 4.1% drop, border police data showed. Many people in frontline EU states have offered accommodation to refugees.
Romania's government said late on Wednesday it will reimburse Romanians who are taking in refugees 20 lei ($4.44) per day for food and 50 lei per day for accommodation. 
Meanwhile the Czech Republic approved compensation for those opening their homes to refugees of 3,000 Czech crowns ($133.55)per month per person, up to a maximum of 12,000 crowns per household.
Many of the 2.2 million people who have fled to Poland since Russia's invasion began on Feb. 24 have ties to a large Ukrainian diaspora - family or friends, with whom they can seek shelter.
Nela Kot, 66, from Chernihiv said she was travelling to stay with a daughter in either Denmark or Austria, but missed her home despite a ""catastrophic"" situation in the heavily bombed city where she said there was no electricity or gas.
""We want (Western partners) to close (the) sky,"" she said, adding ""I want to go home. I see my home in my dreams every night."" 
""I planted seedlings already in the soil. My flowers were growing as never before,"" she said as she broke down in tears.

LONDON/LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - The props were simple, the message was clear. In a video address to the nation this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy held up his smartphone to the camera and started a timer app while an air raid siren blared.
""It lasted 20 seconds,"" Zelenskiy said, after the wailing subsided. ""And we hear it for hours, days, weeks. Our people... instantly take their children, help the elderly, and go to the shelters... to survive, from Russian missiles, bombs.""
Sitting at his desk, unshaven and in his now trademark green shirt, Zelenskiy had in a few short sentences reminded 44 million Ukrainians that he was going through what they were, while renewing pressure on NATO to impose a no-fly zone.
While keeping the world engaged could get harder over time, for now that ability to communicate is making a difference.
His approval ratings at home have soared as Russia's invasion of Ukraine enters its second month, and he has rallied the nation around the flag as thousands of civilians take up arms.
Abroad he appears no less popular, as Western powers supply Ukraine with weapons and aid, take in millions of refugees and tighten sanctions around Russia.
For those who have worked closely with him, the 44-year-old's handling of the war so far is not totally surprising.
Iuliia Mendel, Zelenskiy's spokesperson during the first two years of his presidency from 2019-2021, told Reuters that the former actor put a lot of time and effort into his speeches. He is also quick to adapt.
""Now he can just take his telephone and make a selfie video, not caring much about the lighting and how he looks and that he has not shaved probably,"" she said.
The more informal setting brought him closer to people, ""because when everybody is suffering so much it would be really strange if... he tries to look official.""
Zelenskiy would often come up with a specific message or metaphor that he wanted to include in his addresses, according to Mendel, and looked for what would resonate most with a particular audience.
And so, as he hones his role as the face of Ukraine's resistance, he has used a mix of social media savvy, impassioned speeches and a virtual ""tour"" of the world's parliaments to try to prevent international outrage at Moscow from dissipating.
""He'll be aware that the world moves on. The world gets tired,"" Alastair Campbell, who was spokesman to former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, told Reuters.
""He knows that you've got to keep finding new ways to keep this thing right at the centre of the global public debate and on his terms. And I think that's what he's done very well so far, but it gets harder the longer you go on.""
TIGHTENING CONTROL
As the war drags on, Zelenskiy is tightening his control over messaging at home.
Under martial law, his security and defence council temporarily banned Russia-friendly political parties, one of which holds a sizeable number of seats in parliament and which has in the past accused him of silencing the opposition.
He has also effectively shut down private TV channels by unifying coverage around one state station.
Ukraine has had a varied media scene, although major TV channels were owned by business groups that promoted competing political interests.
Zelenskiy faced some criticism from political opponents before the war for imposing sanctions on TV channels connected to opposition figures.
Now the unified TV news platform broadcasts speeches and interviews by Zelenskiy, selected state officials and regional mayors who address the plight of cities under Russian attack.
One of his main modes of communication abroad has been to address national parliaments, from Washington to Tokyo, via video link from Kyiv.
Zelenskiy's message has sometimes been blunt.
In his address to the U.S. Congress, Zelenskiy played a video showing Russian bombs falling on Ukraine, grieving families, bloodied children on hospital beds and corpses on the streets and laid into graves.
Zelenskiy then singled out U.S. President Joe Biden: ""You are the leader of the nation, of your great nation. I wish you to be the leader of the world. Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace.""
His demand that NATO members impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine has been dismissed by some diplomats as impractical, because they say it risks dragging the alliance into direct confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia.
When addressing Israel's Knesset, Zelenskiy, who is Jewish and lost family members in the Holocaust, compared Russia's war to Nazi Germany's killings of Jews while asking Israel for its Iron Dome defence system to protect Ukrainian cities.
The reference sparked a backlash and the Israeli government did not accede to Ukraine's request.
On the eve of the one-month anniversary an impassioned Zelenskiy - speaking, unusually, in English - used his nightly video to bypass the world's political leaders and appeal directly to their people.
Casting the war as an existential battle not only for Ukraine but for Europe, he urged them to protest what he called Moscow's ""war against freedom"".
'SPEAKING FROM THE HEART'
For Campbell, Zelenskiy's ""sense of authenticity"" makes him an effective communicator.
""You really feel this is a guy who is speaking from the heart all the time, but without being too emotional,"" he said.
The president invoked playwright William Shakespeare and speeches of World War Two leader Winston Churchill while speaking to British lawmakers and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr while addressing the U.S. Congress.
Addressing the Japanese National Diet on Wednesday, he referred to Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear disaster and the prospect of Russia waging chemical warfare – resonant in Japan which suffered the Tokyo subway sarin attack in 1995 and the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011.
A former comedian who once played a fictional president in a popular TV series before entering politics, Zelenskiy has suddenly been thrust into a very different role.
When Reuters first interviewed him as a candidate in 2019, it was backstage at a comedy competition he was compering. Three years on, he spoke to Reuters in March in a city under attack, protected by armed soldiers in rooms dotted with sandbags.
But some elements of his messaging have remained constant.
Ever since he ran for president as a political outsider in 2019, Zelenskiy has used social media and videos to get through to voters using plain language.
Upon entering office, he took with him people from the TV and media world as officials and advisers. One of those close to him declined to comment when Reuters asked about his communications strategy.
Kyrylo Tymoshenko, now deputy head of Zelenskiy's office, founded a company that produced political campaign adverts. Also in his entourage in Kyiv are his powerful chief of staff Andriy Yermak, Prime Minister Denys Shmygal, close adviser Mykhailo Podolyak and David Arakhamia, who heads the presidential party's faction in parliament.
A video in which he introduced his team early on in the conflict has been viewed nearly 15 million times on Instagram.
'EVERYMAN' PRESIDENT
So far, Zelenskiy's messaging is working at home. According to the Rating research group, the president's approval rating in Ukraine has trebled to 91% from December, while 93% of Ukrainians believe they will win the war.
It has brought round Ukrainians like Tetiana Popova, a member of Ukraine's Council on Freedom of Speech and Protection of Journalists.
""He is what I would call an 'everyman' - this was his advantage from the very beginning,"" said Popova, who was a deputy minister under Zelenskiy's predecessor.
Popova recalls her house shaking from Russian shelling while her nine-year-old slept. In a panic, she sent her child into Poland and remained in Ukraine, and immediately felt calmer once she saw Zelenskiy speaking on television.
""I believed that we can, we will endure, we will succeed. This thought came to me because the President is in Kyiv.""
Outgunned by a larger Russian army, Zelenskiy has struck a balance between persuading Western allies of the need to equip Ukraine's military with air defences and missiles while convincing Ukrainians that their country will win the war.

Such messaging – Ukraine is smaller and needs help but will also win - is reflected in posters and signs that have appeared on the streets of Lviv. 
One reads ""DAVID vs GOLIATH"" above a map showing tiny defiant Ukraine and vast Russia, adding: ""Do you remember what happened?""

518,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 04:37AM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) -WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange married his long-term partner Stella Moris inside a British high-security prison on Wednesday at a small ceremony attended by just four guests, two official witnesses and two guards. 
Assange is being held in jail while U.S. authorities seek his extradition to face trial on 18 counts relating to WikiLeaks' release of vast troves of confidential U.S. military records and diplomatic cables more than a decade ago.
""I am very happy and very sad. I love Julian with all my heart, and I wish he were here,"" Moris said outside the gates of Belmarsh prison following the ceremony. 
The 50-year-old Australian, who denies any wrongdoing, has been in the southeast London jail since 2019, and before that was holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in the British capital for seven years. 
While living at the embassy he fathered two children with Moris, a lawyer more than a decade his junior, whom he met in 2011 when she started work on his legal team. Their relationship began in 2015.
The registrar-led nuptials took place during visiting hours at the prison, where some of Britain's most notorious criminals have served sentences, including child murderer Ian Huntley. Afterwards, the guests were asked to leave immediately.
For the occasion, Moris wore a lilac satin wedding dress and Assange a kilt - a nod to his family ties to Scotland - which were created by British fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, who has campaigned against his extradition. 
The bridal dress featured an inscription of a personal message from Westwood, and the long veil was embroidered with words such as ""valiant"", ""relentless"" and ""free enduring love"".
""To me, Julian is a pure soul and a freedom fighter,"" Westwood said. 
Outside the jail, Moris cut a wedding cake and gave a speech to supporters who had gathered for the occasion.

""You know what we are going through is cruel and inhuman,"" she said. ""The love that we have for each other carries us through this situation and any other that will come. He is the most amazing person in the world. He is wonderful and he should be free.""
Assange suffered a blow earlier this month when he was denied permission to launch an appeal at Britain's Supreme Court against a decision to extradite him. However, he could still challenge the government's ratification of the extradition.

519,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 04:26AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Myanmar's junta chief created a special command a day after last year's coup that was solely responsible for deployment and operations of troops in urban areas, and authorised lethal attacks on unarmed civilians, human rights investigators said.
The group Fortify Rights and Yale Law School's Schell Center said after a joint investigation the junta leadership deployed snipers to kill protesters to instil fear, while soldiers were instructed to commit crimes and given a ""fieldcraft"" manual that contained no guidance on rules of war. 
The investigators, in a 193-page report released on Thursday, analysed leaked documents and 128 testimonies from various sources including survivors, medical workers, witnesses and former military and police personnel, about the turmoil in Myanmar in the six months after the coup on Feb. 1 last year.
They said they had obtained and verified internal memos to police ordering them to arbitrarily arrest protesters, activists and members of the ousted ruling party, and cited testimony from victims of torture and other abuses.
""All individuals responsible for these crimes should be sanctioned and prosecuted,"" said Matthew Smith, head of Fortify Rights and co-author of the report, which recommends members of the United Nations push for a global arms embargo on Myanmar and international legal action against its generals. 
A spokesman for Myanmar's military did not immediately respond to calls seeking comment on the report's findings. 
Fortify Rights is an independent non-profit organisation based in Southeast Asia and founded in 2013, funded by donations from Europe, Asia and the United States, including from private foundations. It has carried out extensive work on Myanmar. 
The Schell Center was set up at Yale Law School in 1989 for law students and graduates to specialise in international human rights and to assist human rights organisations. 
The investigation will add to global pressure on the military to halt its crackdown on opponents and the use of air strikes and shelling in civilian areas. 
It comes a week after a U.N. report concluded that the Myanmar army was responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The junta has yet to respond but has previously dismissed accusations of atrocities as foreign interference based on falsehoods. 
The report, called ""Nowhere is Safe"", also identified 61 military and police commanders who the researchers said should be investigated for crimes against humanity, helped by information from security sources about the chain of command. 
Among those were six active-duty army personnel, including a colonel and two majors.
The researchers said they established locations of more than 1,000 military units at the time of the crackdown, which they said could help prosecutors geo-locate perpetrators of crimes. 

Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing's new ""special command"" in the capital Naypyitaw was run by four of his top generals, it said, with no others authorised to take decisions on operations by troops deployed in towns and cities.
""Without a concerted effort to stop ongoing atrocities and to hold the junta accountable for the crimes it has committed to date, the junta will undoubtedly continue to persecute its opponents, murder civilians, and devastate the social, health, and economic wellbeing of Myanmar,"" said Roger Polack, a visiting fellow at the Schell Center and co-author of the report.

KABUL (Reuters) -The Taliban on Wednesday backtracked on their announcement that high schools would open for girls, saying they would remain closed until a plan was drawn up in accordance with Islamic law for them to reopen.
The u-turn took many by surprise, leaving students in tears and drawing condemnation from humanitarian agencies, rights groups and diplomats at a time when the Taliban administration is seeking international recognition.
Teachers and students from three high schools around the capital Kabul said girls had returned in excitement to campuses on Wednesday morning, but were ordered to go home. They said many students left in tears. 
""We all became totally hopeless when the principal told us, she was also crying,"" said a student, not being named for security reasons.
The last time the Taliban ruled Afghanistan, from 1996 to 2001, they banned female education and most employment. 
The international community has made the education of girls a key demand for any future recognition of the Taliban administration, which took over the country in August as foreign forces withdrew. 
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the Taliban's decision was ""a profound disappointment and deeply damaging for Afghanistan.""
""The denial of education not only violates the equal rights of women and girls to education,"" Guterres said in a statement. ""I urge the Taliban de facto authorities to open schools for all students without any further delay.""
The Ministry of Education had announced last week that schools for all students, including girls, would open around the country on Wednesday after months of restrictions on education for high school-aged girls. 
On Tuesday evening a Ministry of Education spokesman released a video congratulating all students on their returning to class.
However, on Wednesday, a Ministry of Education notice said schools for girls would be closed until a plan was drawn up in accordance with Islamic law and Afghan culture, according to Bakhtar News, a government news agency.
Suhail Shaheen, a senior Taliban member based in Doha, said the postponed opening of girls' schools was due to a technical issue and the Ministry of Education was working on standardised uniforms for students around the country. 
""We hope the uniform issue is resolved and finalised as soon as possible,"" he said.
Sixteen-year-old Khadija went to school on Wednesday having stayed up all night in excitement after seven months at home. But just minutes after lining up with her classmates for a welcoming speech, the school's assistant manager instead approached the students, crying, and broke the news they had to leave.
""We couldn't believe we face such conditions... it was like a mourning day. Everyone was crying and hugging each other,"" she said.
Returning home, she unpacked her books from her bag and tried to imagine how she could stay motivated, by teaching younger children in her neighbourhood to help her remember her lessons. Still, she said the disappointment was hard to overcome.
""I would like to be a doctor in the future but for now I have no hope, I am like a dead body,"" she said.
Local media broadcast footage of girls holding a protest in Kabul.
Many in the international community condemned the decision with the U.N.'s special envoy for Afghanistan formally conveying the organisation's ""grave concern and disappointment"" to Taliban officials, according to a U.N. statement.

The Taliban is seeking to run the country according to its interpretation of Islamic law while at the same time accessing billions of dollars in aid that it desperately needs to stave off widespread poverty.
""For the sake of the country's future and its relations with the international community, I would urge the Taliban to live up to their commitments to their people,"" U.S. Special Envoy for Afghanistan, Tom West, said in a tweet.

SEOUL (Reuters) -Former South Korean President Park Geun-hye left hospital on Thursday three months after she was released from prison where she spent nearly five years following a conviction on corruption charges.
Park, 70, became the country's first democratically elected leader to be forced from office when the Constitutional Court upheld a parliament vote in 2017 to impeach her over a scandal that also landed the chiefs of two conglomerates, Samsung (KS:005930) and Lotte, in jail. 
""As president, I tried to work hard for the country and the people but there are many dreams that were not achieved,"" Park, dressed in a dark navy coat and holding a purse, told hundreds of cheering supporters after arriving at her home in the southeastern city of Daegu.
""But those dreams are tasks for others,"" Park said, signalling no intention of returning to the political fray. ""I will provide support so that talented people can contribute to the development of my hometown of Daegu and the country.""
Park is the daughter of former dictator Park Chung-hee and her imprisonment divided a country in which old Cold War rivalry between right and left still shapes politics. 
An unidentified object was thrown at Park shortly after she began delivering her televised remarks from a podium but she smiled and thanked the crowd.
""I am extremely grateful that so many people came to warmly greet me even though I had numerous shortcomings and disappointed you,"" she said.
The Supreme Court last year upheld Park's sentence of 20 years in prison for colluding with a friend, who was also jailed, to receive millions of dollars from the companies, mostly to fund her friend's family and non-profit groups.
Outgoing President Moon Jae-in, who heads a liberal administration, granted Park a special pardon in December, citing her deteriorating health and his hopes to move past the ""unfortunate history"" and promote national unity.
Earlier, as Park left the Samsung Medical Centre in Seoul, she told some 40 supporters that her health had improved. Dozens of officials who served in her administration and her conservative political party also gathered to offer their best wishes.
Park then visited her father's grave before heading home.
Park's release comes days after a presidential election won by conservative candidate Yoon Suk-yeol.
President-elect Yoon, who was in involved in the investigation of the corruption charges against Park when he served as prosecutor-general, said during the election campaign that he was sorry about what happened to her.

On Thursday, he said he hoped to meet her and would invite her to his inauguration in May. 
Moon's office said he had sent Park an orchid and wished her well.

Close to 7 million Ukrainians have been internally displaced in the one month of war, with one in three of them suffering from a chronic health condition, according to the global health agency.
Pressure has been mounting on medical professionals and volunteers from Ukraine and abroad to keep the country's healthcare system going, since the start of the Russian invasion.
The conflict, which began on Feb. 24, has caused more than 3.6 million refugees to flee Ukraine and already led to the unprecedented isolation of Russia's economy due to sanctions.
Limited access to medicines, healthcare facilities and staff in Ukraine is further pressuring ongoing treatments of chronic conditions, the WHO said, adding that half of the country's pharmacies were thought to be closed.
The war has also impacted COVID-19 vaccinations and routine immunizations in Ukraine, the health agency said.

Between Feb. 24 and March 15 COVID-19 vaccines were administered to 175,000 people, compared with at least 50,000 vaccinations per day before the Russian invasion, according to the WHO.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control last week said refugees from Ukraine should be offered a full course of COVID-19 vaccines and booster doses, if they do not have proof of prior inoculation.

(Reuters) - Billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott donated $275 million to women's healthcare provider Planned Parenthood, the largest gift from a single donor in the organization's more than 100-year history, Planned Parenthood said on Wednesday. 
The donation, which is part of Scott's pledge to give away the majority of her wealth, was made to Planned Parenthood's national office and 21 regional affiliates.
Scott, who is now married to Dan Jewett, a Seattle science teacher, received a 4% stake in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) as part of her divorce from Amazon founder and billionaire Jeff Bezos. 
Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions and other healthcare services at its clinics around the country, is at the forefront of the political battle over abortion rights playing out in U.S. state legislatures and courts. 
Abortion access in the United States is on the decline as Republican-led states pass ever tighter restrictions on the procedure, including a near-total ban on abortions in Texas that has withstood legal challenges. 
The conservative-leaning U.S. Supreme Court seems likely to overhaul constitutional protections for abortion this spring.
The court has signaled its willingness to reinstate a ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy in Mississippi. That would contradict the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade case that established the right to have an abortion before the fetus is viable, which is around 24 weeks. 
""We are incredibly grateful for Ms. Scott’s extraordinary philanthropic investment in Planned Parenthood, as a critical part of the public health infrastructure,"" Planned Parenthood Chief Executive Alexis McGill Johnson said in a statement.
""This funding will support our efforts to advance health equity by eliminating racial and structural barriers for our patients in the communities where Planned Parenthood works.""
In a Medium post on Wednesday, Scott said she had donated more than $3.8 billion to 465 non-profit organizations, including Planned Parenthood, since last June. 
""Our team’s focus over these last nine months has included some new areas, but as always our aim has been to support the needs of underrepresented people from groups of all kinds. The cause of equity has no sides,"" she wrote.
On Tuesday, Habitat for Humanity announced that Scott had donated $436 million, which will go toward the organization's efforts to boost affordable housing and Black homeownership.

Scott was worth about $49 billion as of Wednesday, according to Forbes.

LVIV/KHARKIV, Ukraine/ BRUSSELS, March 23 (Reuters) - Russian forces bombed areas of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Wednesday and U.S. President Joe Biden arrived in Brussels for a series of summit meetings on the war while NATO's chief said the alliance was bolstering battle groups in Eastern Europe.
NATO, G7 and EU summits will on Thursday discuss the conflict, which began on Feb. 24 and has caused more than 3.6 million refugees to flee the country and already led to the unprecedented isolation of Russia's economy.
Responding to a slew of sanctions that have already frozen assets and hit individuals and firms, President Vladimir Putin said Moscow planned to switch gas sales made to ""unfriendly"" countries to roubles, alarming international markets.
Biden's visit could also shine light on a dispute with European allies, some of whom are heavily reliant on Russian oil and gas, over whether to impose further energy sanctions.
The issue has been a ""substantial"" topic and the subject of ""intense back and forth"" in recent days, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters.
The U.S. plans to announce more sanctions on political figures and oligarchs, he said.
Biden will start his visit by meeting NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who on Wednesday said the alliance will boost its forces in Eastern Europe by deploying four new battle groups - in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia. ""I expect leaders will agree to strengthen NATO's posture in all domains,"" he said.
Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation” that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities.
The West says this a baseless pretext for an unprovoked war.
And in a sign of disquiet at home, a veteran aide to Putin, Anatoly Chubais, resigned over the war and has left Russia with no intention to return, two sources said. He becomes the first senior official to break with the Kremlin since the incursion.
Although the Kremlin says its operation is going to plan, Russian forces have taken heavy losses, got stuck on most fronts and face supply problems. They have turned to siege tactics and bombardments, causing huge destruction and many civilian deaths.
Kyiv's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, told reporters on Wednesday that 264 civilians in the city had been killed by Russian attacks. He later said that one person was killed and two wounded on Wednesday when shells hit a shopping centre parking lot in a northern part of Kyiv.
Russia has denied targeting civilians.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Wednesday night called on people all over the world to take to the streets on Thursday, four weeks since Russia invaded, to demand an end to the war.
""Come from your offices, your homes, your schools and universities, come in the name of peace, come with Ukrainian symbols to support Ukraine, to support freedom, to support life,"" he said in an English-language video address.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States has assessed that members of Russia's forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine.
Blinken said there had been ""numerous credible reports of indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting civilians, as well as other atrocities"", specifying attacks in the besieged southeastern city of Mariupol. 
'UNFRIENDLY' COUNTRIES
As Western leaders prepared to meet, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would push for an increase in defensive lethal aid to Ukraine.
The first U.S. shipment from a new, $800 million arms package for Ukraine authorized last week will start flying out in the next day or so, a senior defence official said. 
Putin's announcement that Russia would switch certain gas sales to roubles sent European futures soaring on concerns the switch would exacerbate an energy crunch and jam up deals that run to hundreds of millions of dollars every day.
Russian gas accounts for some 40% of Europe's total gas consumption.
Moscow has drawn up a list of ""unfriendly"" countries which corresponds to those that imposed sanctions. They include the United States, European Union members, Britain and Japan, among others.
""The changes will only affect the currency of payment, which will be changed to Russian roubles,"" said Putin.
And as an information battle also rages, a Russian regulator has blocked Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s news aggregator Google News, saying it allows access to what it calls fake material about the military operation, Interfax news agency said.
Google was not immediately available for comment.
Earlier the company said it will not help websites, apps and YouTube channels sell ads alongside content that it deems exploits, dismisses or condones the conflict. 
SMOKE AND FLAMES
The war has driven a quarter of Ukraine's 44 million people from their homes, according to United Nations agencies.
A total of 4,554 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Wednesday, a senior official said, considerably fewer than managed to escape the previous day.
Worst hit has been Mariupol, where hundreds of thousands of people have been sheltering since the war's early days, under constant bombardment and with food, water and heating supplies cut.

Satellite photographs from commercial firm Maxar showed massive destruction of what was once a city of 400,000 people, with columns of smoke rising from residential apartment buildings in flames.
While Russia was pressing hard in the south and east, British military intelligence said the entire battlefield across northern Ukraine - which includes armoured columns that once threatened Kyiv - was now static.

Albright, 84, died of cancer, her family announced.
Below are quotes from current and former leaders on her passing.
U.S. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: ""Madeleine Albright was a force. Hers were the hands that turned the tide of history ... When I think of Madeleine, I will always remember her fervent faith that 'America is the indispensable nation.'""
CZECH PRIME MINISTER PETR FIALA: ""Few of the world’s leaders did so much for our country as Madeleine Albright. Born in Czechoslovakia, she left the dictatorship which sought the lives of her family. She got a chance in the free world, made the best of it. Thank you. We’ll never forget you.""
FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON AND FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON: ""Hillary and I are profoundly saddened by the passing of Albright. She was one of the finest Secretaries of State, an outstanding UN Ambassador, a brilliant professor, and an extraordinary human being."" 
U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD: ""She was a trailblazer and a luminary ... She left an indelible mark on the world and on the United Nations. Our country and our United Nations are stronger for her service.""
FORMER BRITISH PRIME MINISTER TONY BLAIR: ""Madeleine was one of the most remarkable people I ever had the privilege to work with. She had the sharpest of brains, the most lively conscience and the deepest compassion for humanity.""
U.S. SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL: ""You didn’t have to share every one of Secretary Albright’s policy views to appreciate her dedicated leadership on behalf of our nation ... 
Secretary Albright understood keenly that the United States of America is a global power with global interests and global responsibilities and must act accordingly.""
FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: ""It's because of people like Madeleine that the story of America is, ultimately, one of hope - an upward journey."" 

FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH: ""She lived out the American dream and helped others realize it ... She served with distinction as a foreign-born foreign minister who understood firsthand the importance of free societies for peace in our world.""
GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, SCHOOL OF FOREIGN SERVICE DEAN JOEL HELLMAN: ""Albright combined a scholar’s appreciation for the arc of history, an immigrant’s recognition of the great promise of America, a woman’s understanding of what it means to shatter glass ceilings, and a seasoned diplomat’s ability to disarm her opponents with wit, charm, and grace.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden landed in Brussels on Wednesday in the middle of a dispute with European allies over whether to impose further energy sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.
Russia supplies about 40% of the natural gas Europe uses, making it difficult for several European nations to ban Russian energy imports as the United States has. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia will seek payment in roubles for gas sales to ""unfriendly"" countries, a move that sent European gas prices soaring on concerns it would exacerbate the region's energy crunch. 
Moscow's list of unfriendly countries corresponds to those that imposed sanctions and include the United States, European Union members, Britain and Japan, among others. 
Reducing Europe's reliance on Russian energy has been a ""substantial"" topic and the subject of ""intense back and forth"" in recent days, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on an Air Force One flight to Brussels. 
Sullivan said Biden would have some news to announce on the topic on Friday with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen on Friday. 
On Thursday, Biden will attend an emergency NATO summit, meet with G7 leaders and address the 27 leaders of the European Union at a session of the European Council.
Biden will later visit Warsaw for consultations with Polish President Andrzej Duda.
Sullivan said G7 leaders will also agree on Thursday to coordinate on sanctions enforcement and plan to issue a statement.
A French presidency official noted that the European Union collectively trades more with Russia than the United States does and is more sensitive to sanctions against Russia.
""Americans have sanctioned Russian gas and oil, which is easier for them since they are producers. We will see what President Biden proposes tomorrow as extra effort,"" the official told Reuters.
Sullivan said Biden will announce a U.S. package of Russia-related sanctions on political figures and oligarchs on Thursday.
Sources say some of the sanctions are expected to be targeted against members of the Russian lower house of parliament, the Duma. 
The leaders will also discuss China. Biden had warned Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday not to provide material support to Russia in its war against Ukraine.
Sullivan said the United States has yet to see evidence of Beijing sending aid to Moscow.
""But it's something we're watching every day,"" he said.
Western leaders have grown increasingly concerned that Putin will use chemical weapons or otherwise escalate tactics four weeks into an invasion where his troops have failed to capture a single major Ukrainian city.
Leaving the White House on Wednesday, Biden said Russia's use of chemical weapons in Ukraine is a ""real threat.""
Sullivan said Biden will coordinate on the next phase of military assistance to Ukraine.
Sullivan also said Biden will discuss with allies in Brussels ""how to deal with the rhetoric and commentary on potential use of nuclear weapons"" by Russia. The United States has not changed its nuclear posture, he said. 
In recent days, Russia and Western governments have traded accusations over the possibility of a chemical weapons attack in Ukraine without producing evidence to back their concerns.

Biden has vowed not to engage in direct conflict with Russia but has pledged the United States will defend all NATO territory. He has ordered more U.S. troops to NATO's eastern flank to reassure edgy allies.
During his visit to Poland, a NATO member, Biden will visit U.S. troops and meet with experts involved in the humanitarian response to helping hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians who have fled their country and those who remain.

ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) -The Biden administration, seeking to deter China from aiding sanctions-hit Russia, on Wednesday warned Beijing not to take advantage of business opportunities created by sanctions, help Moscow evade export controls or process its banned financial transactions. 
White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters that G7 countries would soon announce a unified response to make sure Russia cannot evade Western sanctions imposed over its invasion of Ukraine with the help of China or any other country. 
Speaking aboard Air Force One en route to Brussels where President Joe Biden will attend an emergency NATO summit, Sullivan said, ""That's not specifically about China, but it will apply to every significant economy and the decisions that any of those economies take to try, in an intentional and active way, to undermine or weaken the sanctions that we put in place.""
He said the U.S. government has conveyed this message to China and that, ""We expect similar communication by European Union and individual European countries.""
After Biden had a video call with Chinese President Xi Jinping last week, Beijing condemned the sanctions on Russia. It said ""sweeping and indiscriminate sanctions would only make the people suffer"" and should not be ""further escalated.""
U.S. export restrictions are intended to block Russian access to critical goods such as commercial electronics, computers and aircraft parts.
Washington is concerned that China could help Russia ""backfill"" and access these products by violating trade restrictions. The U.S. government has tools to ensure that can't happen, Sullivan added.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told Reuters on Wednesday that the United States would punish any companies that violate the export controls on goods like semiconductors.

In terms of payments, Sullivan said, the United States and its G7 allies will respond to ""systematic efforts, industrial-scale efforts to try to reorient the settlement of financial payments.""
China has not condemned Russia's action in Ukraine, though it has expressed deep concern about the war.

(Reuters) - Russia held a funeral service for the deputy commander of its Black Sea Fleet in annexed Crimea on Wednesday, the latest in what Ukraine says is a string of high-ranking Russian military casualties since Moscow invaded on Feb. 24. 
Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak on Sunday named six Russian generals who he said had been killed in Ukraine along with dozens of colonels and other officers. 
Russia's Defence Ministry has not confirmed any of those casualties. It has not revised its troop casualties since March 2, a week into the war, when it said that 498 of its soldiers had died. Ukraine puts the figure at 15,600.
Reuters could not independently verify most of Ukraine's claims, but some have been confirmed from Russian sources. 
Local Russian government in the southern port of Novorossiysk confirmed the death on Feb. 28 of Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky in a statement on its website. It said he had served in Syria, the North Caucasus and Abkhazia.
On Wednesday, hundreds converged in the Crimean city of Sevastopol to attend a funeral service with a gun salute for Andrei Paliy, a first rank captain and the deputy commander of Russia's Black Sea Fleet.
Konrad Muzyka, director of the Poland-based Rochan consultancy, said the Ukrainian estimates of Russian high-ranking casualties were plausible, but they were difficult to verify and the actual figure was probably smaller.
""Even if we are talking about two generals, that's a big deal,"" he said. ""We're not only talking about generals, we're also talking about colonels who are of course also really high in the organisation.""
He said such casualties suggested Russia didn't have a good understanding of Ukrainian artillery positions and Ukraine was having success in pinpointing the location of senior Russian officers, possibly via their mobile phone signals.
'TOO MANY COLONELS, TOO FEW CORPORALS' 
A senior foreign diplomat in Moscow told Reuters: ""For me what is important is the reported heavy casualties at colonel and above, the backbone of the Russian army, not just generals,"" 
The diplomat said the Russian army was heavily centralised and hierarchical, and lacking in empowered Western-style junior officers. ""There are too many colonels, too few corporals. So what happens is tasks requiring resolution, which in the West would be resolved at much lower levels, get passed up the chain for decision,"" the source said. 
The diplomat said that the hierarchical structure drew senior officers to the front to sort out problems or revitalise the effort, leaving them vulnerable to attack. 
""Centralisation of command and control, lack of dispersal, and paucity of secure communication also puts them in locations where they can be identified and picked off by Ukrainian UAVs,"" the diplomat said, referring to unmanned drones. 

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people, displaced nearly 10 million and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States.
Russia says its ""special military operation"" was necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Moscow had to defend against the ""genocide"" of Russian speakers by Ukraine. Ukraine has dismissed those claims.

Griner, an Olympic gold medalist and All-Star player, has been detained in a Russian prison during a time of heightened tensions between the United States and Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. 
The State Department has been pushing Russian authorities for access to the sports star.
""Within the past couple hours, an official from our embassy has been granted consular access to Brittney Griner,"" Price said in an interview with CNN.
""Our official found Brittney Griner to be in good condition and we will continue to do everything we can to see to it that she is treated fairly throughout this ordeal.""
The WNBA said last week it was working with the U.S. government to get Griner freed after the TASS news agency said her detention for possession of vape cartridges containing hash oil was extended until May 19.
The WNBA said it continued to work with government officials and others to get her home safely. ""This continues to be a complex situation that is extremely difficult for Brittney, her family and all who are hoping for a swift resolution,"" it said in a statement Wednesday.
Griner, 31, won Olympic gold medals with the U.S. national teams in 2016 and 2021 and is a seven-time All-Star. She plays center for the Phoenix Mercury and plays in Russia during the WNBA's winter off-season.
It was not clear exactly when Griner was detained, but it was announced after Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, which dramatically worsened relations between Washington and Moscow.
TASS said the Khimkinsky court of the Moscow region ruled to detain Griner.

The Russian Customs Service said this month that a player was detained in February after arriving at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport on a flight from New York.
A scan of the player's luggage revealed cartridges containing ""liquid with hashish oil"", and a criminal case has been opened carrying a possible sentence of five to 10 years in prison, the customs service said.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin plans to attend the next G20 summit in Indonesia later this year and received valuable backing from Beijing on Wednesday in a pushback to suggestions by some members that Russia could be barred from the group.
The United States and its Western allies are assessing whether Russia should remain within the Group of Twenty major economies following its invasion of Ukraine, sources involved in the discussions told Reuters.
But any move to exclude Russia would probably be vetoed by others in the group, raising the prospect of some countries instead skipping G20 meetings, the sources said. 
Russia's ambassador to Indonesia, which currently holds the rotating G20 chair, said Putin intended to travel to the Indonesian resort island of Bali for the G20 summit in November.
""It will depend on many, many things, including the COVID situation, which is getting better. So far, his intention is... he wants to,"" Ambassador Lyudmila Vorobieva told a news conference. 
Asked about suggestions Russia could be kicked out of the G20, she said it was a forum to discuss economic issues and not a crisis like Ukraine. 
""Of course expulsion of Russia from this kind of forum will not help these economic problems to be resolved. On the contrary, without Russia it would be difficult to do so."" 
China, which has not condemned Russia's invasion and criticised Western sanctions, defended Moscow on Wednesday, calling Russia an ""important member"" of the G20.
The G20 is a group that needs to find answers to critical issues, such as economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said. 
""No member has the right to remove another country as a member. The G20 should implement real multilateralism, strengthen unity and cooperation,"" he told a news briefing.
Indonesia's foreign ministry declined to comment on calls for Russia to be excluded from the G20.
Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 on what he calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" the country. Ukraine and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war of aggression. 
'BUSY WITH SOMETHING ELSE'
Russia is facing an onslaught of international sanctions led by Western countries aiming at isolating it from the global economy, including shutting it out of the SWIFT global bank messaging system and restricting dealings by its central bank.
On Tuesday, Poland said it had suggested to U.S. commerce officials that it replace Russia within the G20 group and that the suggestion had received a ""positive response"".
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said G20 members would have to decide but the issue was not a priority now.
""When it comes to the question of how to proceed with the WTO (World Trade Organization) and the G20, it is imperative to discuss this question with the countries that are involved and not to decide individually,"" Scholz said.
""It is quite clear that we are busy with something else than coming together in such meetings. We urgently need a ceasefire.""
Russia's participation in the G20 is almost certain to be discussed on Thursday, when U.S. President Joe Biden meets allies in Brussels.
""We believe that it cannot be business as usual for Russia in international institutions and in the international community,"" U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters.
A European Union source separately confirmed the discussions about Russia's status at G20 meetings.

""It has been made very clear to Indonesia that Russia’s presence at forthcoming ministerial meetings would be highly problematic for European countries,"" said the source, adding there was, however, no clear process for excluding a country.
Indonesia's deputy central bank governor, Dody Budi Waluyo, said on Monday Jakarta's position was one of neutrality and it would use its G20 leadership to try to resolve problems, but Russia had a ""strong commitment"" to attend and other members could not forbid it from doing so.

Russia said the accusations were baseless.
Relations between Russia and Central European countries that once formed part of its sphere of influence have long been fraught but the invasion of Ukraine has significantly increased fear and suspicion about Moscow's intentions.
""In total, 45 people with varying diplomatic status... were ordered to leave the territory of the Republic of Poland within 5 days,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Lukasz Jasina told a news conference.
One person had been given 48 hours to leave, he added. 
""Russia is our neighbour, it will not disappear from the map of Europe, but the aggression towards Ukraine proves that it is an unfriendly state, and even hostile to Poland.""
The 45 diplomats being expelled represented around half of those currently working at the embassy, he said.
Earlier, Special Services Spokesman Stanislaw Zaryn told reporters that 45 people had been identified by Poland's Internal Security Agency as working for Russian intelligence.
The Russian ambassador to Warsaw was summoned to the foreign ministry. Afterwards, he said that there is no basis for the accusations made against the officials. 
""They will have to go. This is a sovereign decision by the Polish side and they have the right to their own decision,"" Ambassador Sergey Andreev told reporters outside the ministry.

Russia also has the right to take further steps, Andreev added, without going into detail about what those might be. 
Poland's decision to expel the diplomats follows similar decisions in the Baltic states and Bulgaria.

A retiree in his 60s who asked that his full name not be used, Zhang had driven with his son on Tuesday from the southern city of Shenzhen. 
""I hope the country can thoroughly investigate this matter and find out whether it is the manufacturer's fault or a maintenance problem,"" he told Reuters on Wednesday.
""I came with my son and planned to stay until the matter is sorted out and take his ashes back. But this depends on the work of the government,"" he said.
Dozens of family members congregated at the heavily-secured checkpoint leading to the site in Teng county in southern China's Guangxi region in pairs or small groups on Wednesday. Some arrived in government convoys, accompanied by officials.
Zhang's nephew, in his 40s and surnamed Sun, lived in the eastern city of Nanjing with his wife and two sons. He worked in water conservation and had been on a business trip when the China Eastern jet crashed on its way from Kunming in the southwest to the coastal metropolis of Guangzhou.
Most of the jet appears to have disintegrated upon impact, and no survivors have been found.
""To start with... I just felt shocked about the news,"" Zhang recalled during a break in heavy rain that disrupted search efforts, speaking slowly and holding back tears.
As he spoke to reporters, Zhang tried to give them lunchboxes provided by officials, saying they looked hungry.
""About half an hour later, I found out that someone from my family was on this plane, you can imagine how we feel,"" he said. 
""Such a big disaster, the whole country feels hurt,"" he said of hearing the news of Monday afternoon's accident, China's first deadly airline crash in over a decade.

KINGSTON (Reuters) -Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate arrived in Jamaica on Tuesday as part of a week-long Caribbean tour, hours after activists protested to demand reparations for slavery amid growing scrutiny of the British Empire's colonial legacy.
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrived in Belize on Saturday to start the tour that coincides with Queen Elizabeth's 70th year on the throne, and will conclude it over the weekend with a visit to The Bahamas.
They were received by Jamaican foreign affairs minister Kamina Johnson-Smith and Defense Force Chief Antonette Wemyss Gorman at Kingston's Norman Manley airport. They then left to meet Governor General Patrick Allen, who represents the British crown in Jamaica.
Earlier, dozens of people gathered outside the British High Commission in Kingston, singing traditional Rastafarian songs and holding banners with the phrase ""seh yuh sorry"" - a local patois phrase that urged Britain to apologize.
""There are historical wrongs and they need to be addressed,"" said Dr. Rosalea Hamilton, an economist and activist who helped organize the rally where demonstrators read out 60 reasons for reparations. Jamaica celebrates 60 years of independence in August. 
""Part of the conversation is how we begin a new dispensation and (discussion) of actions for the new generation,"" said Hamilton, dressed in a T-shirt printed with the phrase ""seh yuh sorry."" 
The royal visits to Caribbean nations are seen as an effort to convince other former British colonies - including Belize and The Bahamas - to stay on as ""realms"" of the British monarchy amid a rising regional movement towards republicanism.
'WHAT ARE THEY DOING FOR JAMAICA?'
Dance hall singer Beenie Man in an interview with Good Morning Britain questioned the royal visit and expressed skepticism about the queen, saying ""What are they doing for Jamaica? They're not doing anything for us."" 
One Jamaican judge, Hugh Small, this month burned his ceremonial British judicial wigs in a symbolic protest of the fact that a London-based tribunal called Privy Council continues to be Jamaica's highest court of appeals.
William and Kate are scheduled to participate in a ""sports activity"" and a ""cultural activity"" on Tuesday as part of the tour that wraps up on Thursday, according to a preliminary agenda seen by Reuters.
The couple had to change their itinerary in Belize following a protest by a few dozen indigenous villagers upset that the couple's helicopter was given permission to land on a soccer field without prior consultation. 
Marlene Malahoo Forte, who was Jamaica's attorney general until January, in December told the local newspaper Jamaica Observer that she had received instructions from Prime Minister Andrew Holness to reform the constitution to become a republic.
That process would require a referendum, per Jamaica's constitution, making it more complicated than in smaller Barbados - which was able to make the change via an act of parliament.
The government last year announced plans to ask Britain for compensation for forcibly transporting an estimated 600,000 Africans to work on sugar cane and banana plantations that created fortunes for British slave holders.

Jamaica lawmaker Mike Henry has proposed reparations package of 7.6 billion pounds ($10 billion).
He has said the figure is derived from a 20 million pound payment that Britain's government made in 1837 to compensate slave owners in British colonies for the emancipation of enslaved people following the 1833 abolition of slavery.

537,"<span>Mar 23, 2022 04:30AM ET</span>",,,,,,"TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan is considering extending compulsory military service beyond four months, Defence Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng said on Wednesday, as the war in Ukraine renewed discussion about how best to respond to China's military pressure.
Taiwan has been gradually shifting from a conscript military to a volunteer-dominated professional force, but China's growing assertiveness towards the island it claims as its own, as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, have prompted debate about how to boost defence.
Answering lawmakers' questions in parliament, Chiu said a proposal to extend military service was still under consideration and there would ""definitely"" be a plan put forward this year. 
""We must consider the enemy situation and our defensive operations in terms of military strength,"" he said.
Any changes would not come into effect until a year after they were proposed, Chiu added.
Previous governments under the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the main opposition Kuomintang cut compulsory service for men from more than two years to the current four months to please younger voters as tension eased between Taipei and Beijing. 
But China has stepped up its military activities near the island over the past two years or so, seeking to press it to accept its sovereignty claims.
Taiwan's presidential office said in a statement later on Wednesday that the defence ministry was considering everyone's views, but nothing had been finalised.
Training content must be reformed so those undergoing military service are able to effectively respond to the needs of modern warfare, and to strengthen the armed forces' concept of ""asymmetric warfare"", it added.
President Tsai Ing-wen is overseeing a broad modernisation programme, championing the idea of ""asymmetric warfare"", to make the island's forces more mobile, agile and harder to attack.
Taiwan's military is dwarfed by that of China's, but strategists hope superior training could help give it the edge in a conflict. The government is also working on a programme to reform reservist training.
New weapons are important too.

Lee Shih-chiang, head of the ministry's strategic planning department, speaking at the same session as Chiu, said he expected the first batch of U.S.-made MQ-9 Reaper drones, which can be armed with missiles and operate at long range, will enter service with Taiwan by 2025. 
China does not recognise Taiwan's democratically elected government or any claims of Taiwanese sovereignty and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under Chinese control.

A dark funnel cloud touched down in the city and plowed through neighborhoods, pictures on social media showed, with damage reported in the communities off Arabi, Gretna and St. Bernard Parish. 
St. Bernard Parish President Guy McInnis told media at least one person was killed.
The Washington Post, citing a spokesman for McInnis, said the person killed was a 26-year-old man who first responders found outside his home in the Arabi neighborhood.
Some other residents had been hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, the spokesman told the Post, but there was no official tally of the number of casualties.
""We had five or six houses totally demolished. There were people in the homes, so far everyone is accounted for,"" McInnis said on WDSU television.
St Bernard Parish Sheriff Jimmy Pohlmann told news site NOLA.com he had reports of some people trapped.
In Arabi, the tornado blew off roofs and knocked over trees and utility poles, NOLA.com reported.
A video posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) by Fox8 television showed firefighters near a house in Arabi with no roof and its walls toppled over.
Much of southern Louisiana is still recovering from Hurricane Ida, a fierce Category 4 storm that came ashore last August, devastating rural communities to the south of New Orleans and killing more than 100 people in the South and Caribbean.
The majority Black city of New Orleans, known for its jazz, Cajun-influenced cuisine and history as a major slave port, is still traumatized by 2005's Hurricane Katrina, one of the largest and most powerful storms in U.S. history, which killed at least 1,800 people.
Tuesday's tornado struck a day after twisters destroyed homes and injured people elsewhere in the region.
Power was reported out for more than 17,346 customers in Louisiana, 25,923 in Texas and more than 11,646 in Mississippi, according to the poweroutage.us website. 
Some 8,000 customers in New Orleans had no electricity, utility provider Atmos Energy (NYSE:ATO) told NOLA.com. 
The storm front brought heavy rain and powerful winds to Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. National Weather Service forecasters had earlier warned that some 5 million people in the region could see dangerous weather.

""This is the typical time of the year for these events to unfold. Spring-time is prime for severe weather,"" said Roger Erickson, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Lake Charles, Louisiana.
School districts across the region canceled classes and Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge closed its campus for the day.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin intends to attend a G20 summit being hosted by Indonesia later this year, Russia's ambassador in Jakarta said on Wednesday, following calls by some members for the country to be barred from the group.
""Not only G20, many organisations are trying to expel Russia....the reaction of the West is absolutely disproportional,"" ambassador Lyudmila Vorobieva told a news conference on Wednesday. 

The United States and its Western allies are assessing whether Russia should remain within the Group of Twenty (G20) grouping of major economies following its invasion of Ukraine, sources involved in the discussions told Reuters.

LVIV/KYIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Intense Russian air strikes are turning besieged Mariupol into the ""ashes of a dead land"", the city council said on Tuesday, as the United States and Europe planned more sanctions to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. 
Street fighting and bombardments raged in Mariupol, Ukrainian officials said, a day after it rejected an ultimatum from Russia to surrender. Hundreds of thousands are believed to be trapped inside buildings, with no access to food, water, power or heat.
Russian forces and Russian-backed separatist units had taken about half of the port city, normally home to around 400,000 people, Russia's RIA news agency said, citing a separatist leader.
Street fighting was taking place in the city, and both civilians and Ukrainian troops were coming under Russian fire, said regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko.
""There is nothing left there,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video address to Italy's parliament.
Mariupol Deputy Mayor Sergei Orlov told CNN the city was under a full blockade and had received no humanitarian aid.
""The city is under continuous bombing, from 50 bombs to 100 bombs Russian aircraft drops each day... A lot of death, a lot of crying, a lot of awful war crimes,"" Orlov said.
Mariupol has become the focus of the war that erupted on Feb. 24 when Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his troops over the border on what he calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise Ukraine and replace its pro-Western leadership.
It lies on the Sea of Azov and its capture would allow Russia to link areas in the east held by pro-Russian separatists with the Crimean peninsula, annexed by Moscow in 2014.
Putin's 27-day long incursion into Ukraine has forced more than 3.5 million to flee, brought the unprecedented isolation of Russia's economy, and raised fears of wider conflict in the West unthought-of for decades.
Western nations plan to heap more economic pressure on the Kremlin. 
U.S. President Joe Biden will join allies in applying additional sanctions and tightening existing ones during his trip to Europe this week, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday.
The trip will also include an announcement on joint action to enhance energy security in Europe, which is highly reliant on Russian gas, and Biden will show solidarity with Ukraine's neighbour, Poland, with a visit to Warsaw. 
Having failed to seize the capital Kyiv or any other major city with a swift offensive, Russia is waging a war of attrition that has reduced some urban areas to rubble and prompted Western concern that the conflict could escalate, even to a nuclear war.
Russia's security policy dictates that the country would only use such weapons if its very existence were threatened, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN on Tuesday. 
""If it is an existential threat for our country, then it (the nuclear arsenal) can be used in accordance with our concept,"" he said.
Earlier he said ""no one"" had ever thought the operation in Ukraine would take just a couple of days and the campaign was going to plan, TASS news agency reported.
'HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE' 
The United Nations human rights office in Geneva said on Tuesday it had recorded 953 civilian deaths and 1,557 injured since the invasion. The Kremlin denies targeting civilians. 
Western officials said Russian forces were stalled around Kyiv but making some progress in the south and east. Ukrainian fighters are repelling Russian troops in some places but cannot roll them back, they said.
A Reuters team that reached a Russian-seized part of Mariupol on Sunday described a wasteland of charred apartment blocks and bodies wrapped in blankets lying by a road.
Ukraine says Russian shells, bombs and missiles have struck a theatre, an art school and other public buildings, burying hundreds of women and children sheltering in cellars.
Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk, speaking on Ukrainian television on Tuesday, demanded the opening of a humanitarian corridor for civilians. She said at least 100,000 people wanted to leave Mariupol but could not.
Referring to Russia's earlier demand that the city surrender by dawn on Monday, Vereshchuk said: ""Our military are defending Mariupol heroically. We did not accept the ultimatum. They offered capitulation under a white flag.""
Kyiv accused Moscow of deporting residents of Mariupol and separatist-held areas of Ukraine to Russia. This includes the ""forcible transfer"" of 2,389 children to Russia from the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said.
Moscow denies forcing people to leave, saying it is taking in refugees.
In Kherson, a city under Russian control, Ukrainian officials said Moscow's forces were preventing supplies from reaching civilians. 
""Kherson's 300k citizens face a humanitarian catastrophe owing to the Russian army's blockade,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Russia did not immediately comment on the situation in Kherson.
Zelenskiy warned the crisis in Ukraine, one of the world's biggest grain exporters, would bring famine elsewhere. 
""How can we sow (crops) under the strikes of Russian artillery?"" he told Italian lawmakers.

In an address overnight, he also drew attention to the death of Boris Romanchenko, 96, who survived three Nazi concentration camps during World War Two but was killed when his apartment block in besieged Kharkiv was shelled last week.
In killing Romanchenko, ""Putin managed to 'accomplish' what even Hitler couldn't,"" Ukraine's Defence Ministry said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States on Tuesday named former senior diplomat Joseph Yun to lead languishing talks with three tiny but strategically important Pacific Island countries, a signal that countering China remains a U.S. priority despite Russia's war in Ukraine.
The State Department confirmed the appointment of Yun, who served as U.S. special envoy for North Korea under former U.S. presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump, in response to queries from Reuters.
""In light of the critical nature of these complex negotiations, President Biden is appointing Ambassador Joseph Yun as Special Presidential Envoy for Compact Negotiations,"" a statement from the department said.
""We are currently engaged in negotiating amendments to certain provisions of the Compacts of Free Association with the FAS, and completing the negotiations is a priority for this Administration,"" the statement said, referring to the islands collectively called the Freely Associated States.
The COFA negotiations govern U.S. economic assistance for the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), and Palau. 
Provisions in the compacts are set to expire in 2023 for the first countries and in 2024 for Palau. Renewal talks began during the Trump administration, but sources familiar with the process say there have been no substantive engagements with U.S. officials since December 2020.
China, meanwhile, has made economic overtures to the Pacific Islands countries focusing on tourism and trade and appears keen to establish a military foothold in the region.
The RMI's ambassador to Washington told Reuters in February talks had stalled because of the U.S. failure to appoint a negotiator authorized by President Joe Biden to discuss key issues, including remuneration for the legacy of massive U.S. nuclear testing on the islands, the presence U.S. military bases, and climate-change mitigation.
On Tuesday, the ambassador, Gerald Zackios, told Reuters the RMI welcomed Yun’s appointment, “and looks forward to the resumption of these important discussions.”
He said the RMI was keen to discuss key priorities, including economic, nuclear and climate issues and the Kwajalein Atoll, which is home to a U.S. ballistic missile test site.
Yun, who handled highly sensitive negotiations over North Korea's nuclear weapons programs, should help resolve that impasse.
""I look forward to working with our FAS partners to make the relationship even better going forward,"" he told Reuters, adding that he was ""honored"" to be given the responsibility.
Since leaving government, Yun has worked as an adviser to the Asia Group, a business consultancy set up by Kurt Campbell, the White House policy coordinator for the Indo-Pacific.
Critics say delays in renewing provisions in the compacts are a significant lapse given China's efforts to make economic inroads in three countries that give the United States an unparalleled military foothold in the region.
The RMI and Palau are also among the few remaining states to formally recognize Taiwan diplomatically rather than Beijing, while the FSM has relations with China and has joined its Belt and Road Initiative, a global scheme through which Beijing has sought to extend its influence with infrastructure and other investments.
U.S. officials have said they are confident Russia's actions in Ukraine will not divert from U.S. Indo-Pacific goals, but experts note that past geopolitical crises have derailed previous U.S. efforts to refocus on Asia.
""It shows they remain committed to their Indo-Pacific plans despite Ukraine,"" a source with knowledge of Yun's appointment said.
A 2019 Rand Corp report called the FAS ""a power projection superhighway running through the heart of the North Pacific into Asia"" and said the compacts provide the U.S. military with sole and unfettered access to the islands' lands, waters and airspace.

But island representatives say financial support has not kept pace with U.S. obligations, particularly given the nuclear legacy in the Marshall Islands, where the U.S. military conducted 67 nuclear weapons tests from 1946 to 1958.
Islanders are still plagued by health and environmental effects, but Washington says all legal claims over the issue were resolved under its previous compact with the country.

(Reuters) - Utah Governor Spencer Cox on Tuesday vetoed a Republican-backed bill that would ban transgender girls from participating in girls' sports in schools, calling it a flawed measure with serious legal and financial risks.
The veto came a day after another Republican governor, Eric Holcomb of Indiana, halted a similar bill passed by that state's legislature. 
The two governors' actions are at odds with steps taken in a number of other Republican-led states where transgender rights have become a lightning rod in a broader U.S. culture war over sexuality and gender identity.
Governors in states including Texas, Alabama, Mississippi and Iowa have signed into law bills that ban trans girls from competing in girls' sports.
In a letter explaining his veto, Cox said the Utah measure would invite lawsuits that would ""likely bankrupt the Utah High School Athletic Association and result in millions of dollars in legal fees for local school districts.""
He said he favored a measure that would protect ""the integrity of women’s sports"" while also allowing some participation by transgender youth, noting the state currently has only four transgender students playing high school sports.
""Rarely has so much fear and anger been directed at so few,"" Cox wrote
""I don't understand what they are going through or why they feel the way they do. But I want them to live,"" he added, citing the high rates of trans youth reporting suicidality.
Holcomb in Indiana also cited likely court challenges as a reason for his veto.
Republican lawmakers in both states on Tuesday said they would try to override the governors' vetoes. Leaders of the Utah Legislature said they would convene on Friday for a veto override session.
""We have been listening to our constituents, talking with experts and we feel it's important to make decisions now that protect athletes and ensure women are not edged out of their sport,"" Utah state Senate President J. Stuart Adams said in a statement.

The Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people, praised Cox for rejecting what it called ""discriminatory legislation.""
""He’s shown that he sees the humanity of the transgender youth targeted by this legislation – something governors in states like South Dakota and Iowa have refused to do,"" Cathryn Oakley, the group's state legislative director and senior counsel, said in a statement.

LISBON (Reuters) -A series of multiple small earthquakes that have been rattling a mid-Atlantic Portuguese island for three days could trigger a stronger tremor or a volcanic eruption, experts said on Tuesday, as authorities urged people not to travel there.
The number of earthquakes recorded on the volcanic island of Sao Jorge, in the Azores archipelago, since Saturday afternoon has increased to around 1,800 from an earlier figure of 1,329, said Rui Marques, head of the region's CIVISA seismo-volcanic surveillance centre.
Only 94 of the 1,800 earthquakes, with a magnitude of between 1.7 to 3.3, registered so far have been felt by the population, Marques told Lusa news agency. 
Sao Jorge, one of nine islands which make up the Azores, is home to around 8,400 people and is part of the archipelago's central group, which includes the popular tourist destinations of Faial and Pico, which are also volcanic.
The series of small quakes, known as a swarm and which have caused no damage so far, were reported along the island's volcanic fissure of Manadas, which last erupted in 1808.
Sao Jorge's municipalities have activated emergency plans as a precaution.
""All scenarios are on the table,"" Marques told Antena 1 radio station. ""On one hand, we could see an earthquake of greater magnitude that can cause some destruction. ... On the other hand, we have the scenario of an eruption.""
'SEISMIC CRISIS'
Marques urged inhabitants to remain vigilant, although he said the earthquakes were of tectonic origin, referring to movement of the Earth's tectonic plates, rather than volcanic.
""We should not treat this as a purely tectonic crisis but as a seismic crisis that is taking place in an active volcanic system,"" Marques said.
CIVISA set up two additional seismic monitoring stations on the island and deployed a team to measure soil gases, an indicator of volcanic activity. Levels seemed normal so far, Marques said.
The Civil Protection authority said earlier on Tuesday it was working with other entities to prepare a response in case a big earthquake or eruption took place.

In a separate statement on Tuesday evening, it advised people to avoid all but essential travel to the lush green island to ensure authorities face no ""additional constraints"" if they need to help the local population. 
The sudden increase in seismic activity is reminiscent of the earthquake swarms detected prior to the eruption of the Cumbre Vieja volcano on Spain's La Palma island last year, some 1,400 km (870 miles) southeast of the Azores.

All private-sector workers in New York City must show proof that they have been vaccinated against COVID-19, a mandate that encompasses athletes in the United States' biggest sports market. 
The rules could soon impact players in Major League Baseball (MLB), with Opening Day set for April 7 after a lockout forced a brief postponement. 
The New York Yankees' home opener is April 7 while the New York Mets will welcome back fans on April 15.
""In New York no matter what you do, this is 8.8 million people and 30 million opinions, so you're never going to satisfy New Yorkers,"" said Adams. ""You must go with the logic, your heart and the science.""
Adams announced on Tuesday that masks would be optional for children aged 2-4 in school and daycare as of April 4, provided the city remains a ""low-risk environment"" with respect to COVID-19.
He was unmoved, however, by potential criticism of the vaccine mandate with respect to professional sports, telling reporters the city would slowly evaluate its COVID-19 requirements.

""We're going to do it layer by layer and each layer we peel back, we're going to do an analysis: Are we okay?"" said Adams.
""Baseball, basketball, businesses, all of those things - they have to wait until that layer comes.""

545,"<span>Mar 22, 2022 05:21PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a proclamation on Tuesday acknowledging Emma Weyant as the winner of a women's college swimming event after her recent loss to a transgender athlete and accused the NCAA of destroying opportunities for women.
Lia Thomas beat Sarasota native Weyant by 1.75 seconds in the 500-yard freestyle last Thursday in Atlanta to become the first transgender National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) champion in Division I history.
But in the eyes of DeSantis, a Donald Trump ally who is widely seen as a leading presidential contender in 2024, it is University of Virginia freshman and Olympic silver medallist Weyant who is the deserved winner of the event.
""She had the fastest time of any woman in college athletics,"" DeSantis said of Weyant during a news conference.
""Now the NCAA is basically taking efforts to destroy women's athletics, they're trying to undermine the integrity of the competition and they're crowning somebody else the women's champion and we think that's wrong.""
The NCAA did not immediately respond when asked to comment.
Transgender rights have long been a controversial and politically divisive issue in the United States from sports to serving in the military and even what bathrooms people are allowed to use.
The NCAA Board of Governors in January voted in support of a sport-by-sport approach to transgender participation that it said ""preserves opportunity for transgender student-athletes while balancing fairness ... for all who compete.""
In February, USA Swimming unveiled a new policy to allow transgender athletes to compete in elite events by setting out criteria that aims to mitigate any unfair advantages.
The issue gained some level of urgency given the emergence of Thomas, who competed on the University of Pennsylvania men's team for three years before transitioning and moving to the women's team and setting multiple program records.
According to DeSantis, the NCAA is making a mockery of its championship given the organisation's stance on transgender athletes' participation.

""We need to stop allowing organisations like the NCAA to perpetuate frauds of the public. And that's exactly what they are doing,"" said DeSantis.
""They are putting ideology ahead of opportunity for women athletes and I think that there are just some people that are afraid to speak out and say what they are doing, but that is what they are doing.""

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russia traded accusations with the United States and Britain at the United Nations on Tuesday over the possibility of a chemical weapons attack in Ukraine, but none produced any evidence to back their concerns. 
The comments were made by diplomats to reporters after Russia raised the issue of an ammonia leak in Ukraine's besieged northeastern city of Sumy - blaming ""Ukrainian radical nationalist groups"" - during a closed-door U.N. Security Council meeting. The accusation was rejected by Britain and the United States.
Russia's deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy said Russian troops ""have never planned or carried out strikes against any Ukrainian facilities where toxic substances are stored or produced."" 
""It is clear that the Ukrainian nationalist authorities, encouraged by the Western countries will stop at nothing to intimidate its own people and stage false flag attacks to accuse Russia,"" Polyanskiy said. 
It was the third time Russia raised the issue of biological or chemical weapons since it began what it calls a ""special military operation"" on Feb. 24 to ""demilitarize"" Ukraine. The West and Ukraine reject that as a false pretext to invade a democratic country.
""It's hard not to conclude - given their record in the UK, in Russia against Alexei Navalny, given what we've seen in Syria - that this might well be a prelude to the Russians themselves creating some sort of false flag chemical weapons attack,"" Britain's U.N. Ambassador Barbara  Woodward  (NASDAQ:WWD) told reporters. 
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield dismissed Russia's accusations as ""ludicrous.""
""Our concern is that this is a precursor for Russia's plans to use chemical weapons,"" she said.
A senior U.S. defense official said on Tuesday that the United States has not yet seen any concrete indications of an imminent Russian chemical or biological weapons attack in Ukraine but is closely monitoring intelligence.
President Joe Biden said on Monday, without providing evidence, that Russia's false accusations that Kyiv has biological and chemical weapons illustrate that Russian President Vladimir Putin is considering using them himself in Ukraine.

Polyanskiy likened the situation in Ukraine to Syria, where he said chemical attacks by ""terrorist groups"" were blamed on the Russian-backed Syrian government.
A joint United Nations and Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) inquiry found the Syrian government used the nerve agent sarin and had several times used chlorine as a weapon. It also blamed Islamic State for mustard gas use.

547,"<span>Mar 22, 2022 04:02PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - A Russian court found jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny guilty of large-scale fraud and contempt of court on Tuesday, a move likely to extend by years the time that President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critic spends in jail. 
Navalny is already serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence at a prison camp east of Moscow for parole violations related to charges he says were fabricated to thwart his political ambitions.
In the latest criminal case against him, which he has also dismissed as politically motivated, he could have up to 13 years added to that sentence.
A gaunt Navalny stood beside his lawyers in a room filled with prison security officers as the judge read out the accusations against him. The 45-year-old seemed unfazed, looking down as he flipped through court documents. 
Prosecutors had asked the court to send him to a maximum-security penal colony for 13 years on charges of fraud and contempt of court. A ruling is expected later on Tuesday.
Judge Margarita Kotova said Navalny had committed a criminal offence by publicly insulting the court and she confirmed he had pleaded not guilty to the fraud charges.
Washington condemned what it called a ""sham trial"" and said the court's verdict was part of efforts by Moscow to suppress dissenting voices since its invasion of Ukraine last month.
'DISTURBING'
""This disturbing decision ... is another example of the Russian government’s widening crackdown on dissent and freedom of expression, which is intended to hide the Kremlin’s brutal ... and unprovoked war against Ukraine,” U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Tuesday.
President Putin sent his troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what he calls a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine and replace its pro-Western leadership.
Navalny was jailed last year when he returned to Russia after receiving medical treatment in Germany following a poison attack with a Soviet-era nerve agent during a visit to Siberia in 2020. Navalny blamed Putin for the attack.
The Kremlin said it had seen no evidence that Navalny was poisoned and denied any Russian involvement if he was.
After the last court hearing on his case on March 15, Navalny struck a typically defiant tone, writing via Instagram: ""If the prison term is the price of my human right to say things that need to be said ... then they can ask for 113 years. I will not renounce my words or deeds.""

Russian authorities have cast Navalny and his supporters as subversives determined to destabilise Russia with backing from the West. Many of Navalny's allies have fled Russia rather than face restrictions or jail at home.
Navalny's opposition movement has been labelled ""extremist"" and has been shut down, though his supporters continue to use social media to express their political stance, including their opposition to Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russia is seeking to blunt Western-led efforts at the United Nations to further isolate Moscow for invading Ukraine, with the Security Council and General Assembly gearing up to vote this week on competing measures on Ukraine's humanitarian crisis.
A diplomatic tit-for-tat has been escalating at the world body since Russia launched what it calls a ""special military operation"" on Feb. 24 to destroy Ukraine's military infrastructure. 
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday blasted Russia's ""absurd war,"" warning that ""continuing the war in Ukraine is morally unacceptable, politically indefensible and militarily nonsensical.""
The 193-member U.N. General Assembly is faced with rival draft resolutions - both demanding aid access and the protection of civilians, medical personnel, and aid workers in Ukraine. But only one text, written by Ukraine and its allies and due to be voted on this week, criticizes Russia's role in creating the crisis.
The second draft from South Africa makes no mention of Russia and it was not immediately clear when it could face a vote. In remarks accompanying its proposal, seen by Reuters, South Africa argued: ""It remains crucial to find consensus on humanitarian matters. Diverting the focus on other matters will lead to divisions and a failure to get agreement on outcomes.""
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said last week he would resist calls to condemn Russia, blaming NATO for stirring the conflict.
Britain's U.N. Ambassador Barbara  Woodward  (NASDAQ:WWD) told reporters on Tuesday that discussions were underway with South Africa on how ""we can come to a text that would command widespread support across the General Assembly without having to have two votes."" 
Ukraine and its allies are looking to improve on the 141 yes votes cast to adopt a March 2 General Assembly resolution that deplored Russia's ""aggression"" against Ukraine and demanded it withdraw. Russia, Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea and Syria voted no, while 35 states - including China - abstained.
""We're still hoping to get the same numbers that isolated Russia the last time around,"" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told reporters on Tuesday.
'UNCONSCIONABLE' 
Amid the competing draft resolutions, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric stressed on Tuesday that what would be most useful would be unity: ""This organization is at its strongest when it speaks with one voice.""
General Assembly resolutions are nonbinding, but they carry political weight. The March 2 vote illustrated Russia's international isolation over its invasion of Ukraine. While Russia is a veto power in the 15-member Security Council, no one country can block a General Assembly resolution.
South Africa's move at the General Assembly is similar to a text proposed by Russia in the Security Council last week. South Africa's deputy U.N. Ambassador Xolisa Mfundiso Mabhongo said the draft General Assembly resolution was ""a purely South African initiative. It is not inspired by Russia.""
Russia has asked the Security Council to vote on its draft proposal on Wednesday, but diplomats say it is set to fail, with most of the body likely to abstain because it makes no reference to Russia's role. 
Russia's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy on Tuesday described Moscow's draft as aiming to help humanitarian aid groups ""without any politicization.""

""It is absolutely unconscionable for Russia to think that they can put forward a humanitarian resolution,"" said Thomas-Greenfield, describing it as ""like the arsonist calling for the neighbors to help him put out the fire that he started.""
Moscow scrapped a planned Security Council vote last Friday after accusing Western countries of an ""unprecedented pressure"" campaign against the measure. The United States rejected Russia's allegation.

Police identified the attacker as an Arab citizen of Israel, a former high school teacher who had been imprisoned over alleged links to Islamic State.
Police spokesman Eli Levy said ""a civilian took the initiative and shot and killed"" the knife-wielding assailant, a confrontation on a busy city street that later played out in videos filmed by onlookers and broadcast on Israeli television.
Tensions have been on the rise in Israel and the Palestinian territories as the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, in April this year, approaches - a period when violence has erupted in the past.
In a statement, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said Israeli security forces were exercising ""maximum vigilance"" in the wake of the attack.
Washington strongly condemned the ""abhorrent ... terrorist attack,"" U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said, offering condolences to the victims and their families.
""We stand ready to provide support to the Israeli government's efforts to investigate this heinous crime,"" Price said at a regular press briefing.
The Magen David Adom ambulance service and police said three women and a man were killed by the assailant, who rammed his car into one victim and stabbed others at a petrol station and at an outdoor shopping centre. At least two other people were wounded.

It was the highest death toll in a single attack against Israelis since 2017, when a Palestinian rammed his truck into a group of soldiers visiting a Jerusalem promenade, killing four of them. He was shot dead.
Several Palestinian stabbing attacks have occurred in East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank in recent weeks, with some of the suspected assailants shot dead by Israeli forces.

LONDON (Reuters) -A Russian newspaper has accused hackers of planting fake news on its website after a report appeared there for more than six hours saying nearly 10,000 Russian soldiers had been killed in Ukraine.
An article on the site of tabloid paper Komsomolskaya Pravda, captured by a web archive tool, quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying 9,861 Russian servicemen have been killed and 16,153 wounded in what Moscow calls its special military operation in Ukraine.
Those figures had been removed from a version of the same article visible on the website on Tuesday.
Instead, an advisory said: ""On March 21, access to the administrator interface was hacked on the Komsomolskaya Pravda website and a fake insert was made in this publication about the situation around the special operation in Ukraine. The inaccurate information was immediately removed.""
If the figures were true, the Russian death toll from the 27-day-old war in Ukraine would equate to about two-thirds of the estimated 15,000 servicemen who died during the 10-year Soviet occupation of Afghanistan from 1979. 
Russia has not officially updated its casualty figures since stating on March 2 that 498 servicemen had been killed and 1,597 wounded. Since then its offensive has run into further heavy resistance from Ukraine's army and volunteer defence forces.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call on Tuesday that he had no information on casualty numbers. He declined to comment on the website incident, saying it was a question for the newspaper.
Alexander Gamov, a Kremlin correspondent for the paper, said on the same call that its website had been hacked and fake information had appeared there for several minutes.
A search using the non-profit Internet Archive's Wayback Machine (archive.org) showed the figures had been visible on the Komsomolskaya Pravda website for six hours and 35 minutes between 1213 GMT and 1848 GMT on Monday. 
The records show the article was then briefly inaccessible before reappearing at 1939 GMT without the casualty numbers.
Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak, referring to the alleged figure of 9,861 Russian deaths, wrote on Telegram: ""This is only the beginning of the realisation of their national catastrophe. Because in the real world there are almost twice as many as Russians killed.""
It was not possible to independently verify any of the purported casualty claims.
Komsomsolskya Pravda is among Russian media which have loyally followed President Vladimir Putin's line that Moscow is pursuing a special operation in Ukraine to demilitarise and ""denazify"" the country - an argument rejected by Ukraine and the West as a false pretext to invade a democratic country.

The incident marked the second time that media loyal to the Kremlin's line on the war have struggled to stay on message.
Last week, an editor at Channel One state TV news appeared live in the studio for several seconds shouting anti-war slogans and holding a ""NO WAR"" poster during an evening news show. The woman, Marina Ovsyannikova, was fined 30,000 roubles ($280) by a court, after the Kremlin denounced her protest as ""hooliganism"".

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. federal prosecutors warned on Tuesday there is still a chance they could bring additional criminal charges in their case against the Proud Boys over their roles in storming the U.S. Capitol last year, in a failed bid to block Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's election victory.
""We did indicate the possibility of a third"" superseding indictment, prosecutor Luke Jones said during a virtual hearing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
""We obviously can't speak for the grand jury or know exactly how things will transpire, but we also don't want to hide the ball.""
Tuesday's hearing came a few weeks after a grand jury returned a second superseding indictment charging former Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio for the first time with conspiracy in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.
Tarrio was added as a defendant along with other Proud Boy members Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs, Charles Donohoe, Zachary Rehl and Dominic Pezzola. 
They now face charges of conspiring to block Congress from certifying Biden's election win, among other things.
Several of those members were arraigned on the new charges on Tuesday, though Tarrio's lawyer asked for a weeklong postponement. 
A new date for Tarrio's arraignment was scheduled for March 30. Last week, a U.S. magistrate judge in Miami ordered that Tarrio should remain detained pending trial.
Federal prosecutors on Tuesday also indicated they would like to postpone the May 18 trial date for the case, in light of recent developments. In their filing, they also cited the possibility of a third superseding indictment, ""based in part on evidence seized on March 8, 2022.""

The filing said this could lead to charges against new defendants and/or additional charges against the current defendants.
U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly said he wanted to hold off setting a new trial date for now, and some defense attorneys expressed concern it will be hard to schedule a new date - especially if more people are charged in the case.

LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukraine's president said on Tuesday there was ""nothing left"" of the city of Mariupol after weeks of Russian bombardment, and Kyiv appealed to Moscow to allow the evacuation of at least 100,000 people who want to leave. 
Ukraine has issued increasingly dire warnings about the situation in the encircled southern port city, where officials say residents are without food, medicine, power or running water.
Officials said 300,000 civilians were also running out of food in the occupied southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, highlighting what an international aid official said was the breakdown of Ukraine's humanitarian system. 
""There is nothing left there. Only ruins,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said of Mariupol, which has a peacetime population of 400,000, in a video address to the Italian parliament. 
As he was speaking, the city council said Russian forces had dropped two large bombs on Mariupol but gave no details of casualties or damage. Reuters could not independently verify the report. Russia did not immediately comment on it. 
""Once again it is clear that the occupiers are not interested in the city of Mariupol. They want to level it to the ground and make it the ashes of a dead land,"" the council said.
Russia denies targeting civilians and blames Ukraine for the repeated failure to establish safe passage for civilians out of Mariupol. Ukraine defied an ultimatum for the city to surrender by dawn on Monday as a condition for Russian forces to let civilians leave safely.
""We demand the opening of a humanitarian corridor for civilians,"" Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Ukrainian television. 
She later added: ""There are at least 100,000 people who want to leave Mariupol but cannot.""
Vereshchuk said that unless a safe corridor was created and buses were allowed in to evacuate them, they would have to walk from 10 to 20 km (six to 12 miles) to reach relative safety - a risky journey if there is no ceasefire.
She and other Ukrainian officials said Russian forces were also preventing humanitarian supplies reaching civilians in Kherson, a city they control.
""Kherson’s 300k citizens face a humanitarian catastrophe owing to the Russian army’s blockade. Food and medical supplies have almost run out, yet Russia refuses to open humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Russia did not immediately comment on the situation in Kherson.
HUMANITARIAN SYSTEM 'BROKEN DOWN'
Steve Gordon, humanitarian response adviser at international aid agency Mercy Corps, expressed concern about the vulnerability of supply chains in Ukraine. 
""We know that most municipalities in areas seeing the most intense fighting don’t have more than 3-4 days worth of essentials like food,"" Gordon, who is in Ukraine, said in a statement issued by Mercy Corps. 
""The reality is that right now the humanitarian system is entirely broken down.""
Only a few thousand civilians have managed to flee Mariupol, including a convoy of cars witnessed by Mercy Corps.
""Some have belongings strapped to the roof but many have nothing and you can tell people had to leave everything behind,"" Gordon said. 

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" to disarm the country and protect it from ""Nazis"". The West calls this a false pretext for an unprovoked war.
Capturing Mariupol would help Russian forces secure a land corridor to the Crimea peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. (This story is refiled to add dropped first name of president in paragraph 4)

WARSAW/BUCHAREST (Reuters) -More than 3.5 million people have fled abroad from the war in Ukraine, United Nations data showed on Tuesday, leaving Eastern Europe scrambling to provide them with care, schools and jobs even as daily numbers crossing borders ease. 
The millions who have left Ukraine since Russia's invasion began have made their way on foot, by rail, bus or car to neighbouring countries such as Poland and Romania before some travel on across Europe. Most, however, have not done so.
While fewer have crossed borders over the past week, the scale of the task of providing homes to those seeking safety in the European Union is becoming increasingly apparent, above all in Eastern and Central Europe.
Poland, home to the biggest Ukrainian Diaspora in the region even before the war, has taken in more than 2.1 million people and while some plan to head elsewhere, the influx has left public services struggling to cope. 
""The number of children of refugees from Ukraine in Polish schools is increasing by about 10,000 per day,"" Minister of Education Przemyslaw Czarnek told public radio, saying 85,000 children had enrolled in Polish schools.
Czarnek said authorities were organising courses in basic Polish for Ukrainian teachers so they could be employed in local schools and teach preparatory classes for Ukrainian children before entering the school system.
With men of conscription age obliged to remain in Ukraine, the exodus has consisted primarily of women and children, many wanting to stay in countries near Ukraine to be closer to loved ones left behind. 
In a video posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski said 10,000 Ukrainian students had enrolled in Warsaw schools and that a variety of options, including Ukrainian online classes, were needed to avoid a collapse of the city's education system.
""We will be flexible, we will act, because we want all those young people who are in Warsaw to be able to study, whichever option they choose,"" he said.
More than 500,000 people have fled to Romania, the second most after Poland. Authorities there are trying to accurately size up the task at hand while seeking to recruit Ukrainian teachers from among the refugees.
Cosmina Simiean Nicolescu, head of Bucharest's social assistance unit, said 60 Ukrainian children had begun classes there this week while many private kindergartens and schools had welcomed refugees.
With refugee numbers nearing breaking point in parts of Eastern Europe, Nicolescu said refugees were returning to Romania in the hope of finding a less difficult situation.
""There are people we have personally put on trains to go to the west who we see back at the train station,"" she said.
NEW REALITY
The needs of those fleeing shelling and missile attacks across war-torn Ukraine, bearing harrowing memories and the pain of separation from family, stretch well beyond education.
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has organised psychological first aid training near the Polish border with Ukraine to help volunteers provide care for the many struggling mentally.
Paloma Cuchi, the World Health Organization's representative in Poland, estimated 30,000 of those reaching the country suffered from severe mental problems while half a million needed mental health support due to the conflict.
""Children have been travelling for days without proper food, without proper water, they are tired, worried,"" she said.
Barbara Slowinska, a school psychologist, said staff at elementary school number 26 in Gdynia, Poland were working hard to overcome language difficulties and help the 60 children who had arrived from Ukraine integrate.
""We try to talk a lot with the children, as much as we can,"" she said, adding that adjusting to new surroundings was the paramount concern.
""They don't speak about traumatic experiences. We ought to rather calm them down with regard to their current reality in Poland,"" Slowinska said.
""That time will come, but that lies ahead. For now they need to come to terms with the reality."" 
While border crossings such as Medyka in eastern Poland and Isaccea in northeast Romania have grown less busy, officials are wary that any intensification of the fighting in Ukraine could trigger a new influx.

The head of the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR), Filippo Grandi, said on Sunday the war had uprooted 10 million people, most of them still displaced within Ukraine rather than abroad.
Russia denies targeting civilians, describing its actions as a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and Western allies call this a baseless pretext for Russia's invasion of a democratic country.

Siddiqui, a Pulitzer Prize winner, was embedded with Afghan special forces when killed on July 16 during a failed attempt by government troops to retake Spin Boldak, a town near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, from the Taliban.
New Delhi-based lawyer Avi Singh told an online news conference that Siddiqui's parents were seeking legal action against six leaders, and other unidentified commanders of the Taliban, at the Hague-based ICC on the grounds that the group targeted and killed their son because he was a photojournalist and an Indian national.
Two Taliban spokesmen did not respond to calls and messages from Reuters seeking comment.
Siddiqui was based in New Delhi and had travelled to Afghanistan to cover the Taliban campaign to retake the country as the United States and its allies were withdrawing forces to end their 20-year-long war there.
Siddiqui, 38, was ""illegally detained, tortured and killed by the Taliban, and his body was mutilated"", Singh and his family said in a statement issued before the news conference.
""These acts and this killing constitutes not only a murder, but a crime against humanity and a war crime.""
A commander of Afghanistan's erstwhile Special Operations Corps that had hosted Siddiqui said the photojournalist was mistakenly left behind with two commandos when soldiers withdrew from Spin Boldak amid fierce fighting with the Taliban.
The Taliban denied that they captured and executed Siddiqui.
Reuters said Siddiqui was a valued colleague.
""We are deeply saddened by the loss of our colleague Danish Siddiqui. Danish was an outstanding journalist and a much-loved colleague. We are continuing to honour his memory,"" said a spokesperson for  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI), the parent company of Reuters News.
Afghan security officials and Indian government officials had told Reuters that, based on photos, intelligence and an examination of Siddiqui's body, his body was mutilated while in Taliban custody after his death. 

In August, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid denied reports that Siddiqui was captured and executed, rejecting the assertions of the Afghan security forces and Indian government officials as ""completely wrong"".
Reuters has previously reported that it ""was unable to independently determine if the Taliban deliberately killed Siddiqui or desecrated his body.""

(Reuters) -Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday that it would not be possible to negotiate an end to the war in his country without meeting Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin.
Zelenskiy told European public television networks such a meeting could discuss the future of occupied Ukrainian territory, but more time would be required to resolve the issue.
He also repeated his acknowledgement made earlier this month that Ukraine could not now secure NATO membership.
""I believe that until such time as we have a meeting with the president of the Russian Federation...you cannot truly understand what they are prepared to do in order to stop the war and what they are prepared to do if we are not ready for this or that compromise,"" Zelenskiy said in the interview.
Zelenskiy has sought a meeting with Putin for nearly a year, but the Russian leader has refused and instead demanded the Ukrainian president resolve his country's ""civil war"" with separatist territories linked to Moscow.
Since Russian troops poured into Ukraine last month, Zelenskiy has issued increasingly urgent calls for talks to end the fighting.
Last week he called for a meeting quickly so that Russia could ""limit the losses caused by its mistakes"".
'COMPROMISE MUST BE FOUND'
Russia's assault on Ukraine has killed thousands and driven almost a quarter of Ukraine's 44 million people from their homes. Germany predicted the refugee number could reach as high as 10 million in coming weeks.
""I am ready at a meeting with the president of Russia to raise the issue of occupied territories, but I am certain that a solution will not come at this meeting,"" Zelenskiy said in his interview.
He said several conditions would need to be met before such matters could be dealt with, namely, a cease-fire, the withdrawal of troops and security guarantees.

""If people are trying to stop a war, there is a cease-fire and troops are withdrawn. The presidents meet, reach an agreement on withdrawing troops and there are security guarantees of one sort or another,"" he said. ""Compromises must be found, one way or another of guaranteeing our security.""
Zelenskiy said Ukraine is well aware it cannot be admitted into NATO now. NATO member states, Zelenskiy said, ""understand that they do not want to fight with Russia and therefore cannot take us in...we have to reconcile ourselves to that and say 'ok, other guarantees'.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States formally determined that Myanmar's army committed genocide and crimes against humanity in its violence against the Rohingya minority, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday, warning that as long as a military junta was in power nobody in the country would be safe.
Announcing the decision, which was first reported by Reuters on Sunday, Blinken said the attacks against Rohingya were ""widespread and systematic"" and that evidence pointed to a clear intent to destroy the mainly Muslim minority.
The determination could bolster efforts to hold the Myanmar generals accountable and help prevent further atrocities, U.S. officials believe. Activists welcomed the move, but called for concrete actions like tougher sanctions on the junta.
In his speech at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, the top American diplomat read out tragic and chilling accounts of victims, who had been shot in the head, raped and tortured.
Myanmar's armed forces launched a military operation in 2017 that forced at least 730,000 Rohingya from their homes and into neighboring Bangladesh. In 2021, Myanmar's military seized power in a coup.
""Since the coup, we have seen the Burmese military use many of the same tactics. Only now the military is targeting anyone in Burma it sees as opposing or undermining its repressive rule,"" Blinken said.
""For those who did not realize it before the coup, the brutal violence unleashed by the military since February 2021 has made clear that no one in Burma will be safe from atrocities so long as it is in power,"" he added.
Myanmar's state-run MRTV on Tuesday said the foreign ministry strongly condemned and rejected Blinken's determination, which it said was based on false information and was an attempt to interfere in its domestic affairs. 
Days after U.S. President Joe Biden took office, Myanmar generals led by Commander in Chief Min Aung Hlaing seized power on Feb. 1, 2021, after complaining of fraud in a November 2020 general election won by democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi's party. Election monitoring groups found no evidence of mass fraud.
The armed forces crushed an uprising against their coup, killing more than 1,600 people and detaining nearly 10,000, including civilian leaders such as Suu Kyi, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an advocacy group, and setting off an insurgency.
Blinken's recognition comes after two earlier State Department examinations failed to produce a determination on the atrocities, which U.S. officials had only referred to as ""ethnic cleansing"" until now. 
""There is no doubt that being allowed to get away with genocide of the Rohingya encouraged the military to think it could get away with holding a coup as well,"" said Tun Khin, a Rohingya activist who heads the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK and attended Blinken's address. 
""Accountability for Rohingya genocide will not just help protect the Rohingya, it will help protect all the people of Burma.”
FEW REAL CONSEQUENCES
In response to the coup, the United States and Western allies sanctioned the junta and its business interests, but have been unable to persuade the generals to restore civilian rule after they received military and diplomatic support from Russia and China.
Advocates say Monday's declaration, which does not automatically unleash any punitive measures but carries political weight, could help judicial efforts worldwide to hold the junta accountable, but say more action needs to follow.
Washington should work through U.N. bodies to push for accountability while also extending sanctions to target the foreign currency reserves Myanmar's junta gathers from oil and gas revenues, said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch.
""The Myanmar military will continue to commit atrocities so long as other governments fail to impose measures to hold them accountable,"" Sifton said.
Blinken on Monday announced $1 million in new funding for a U.N. investigation on Myanmar and said the United States has shared information with Gambia connected to its case at the International Court of Justice, where it has accused Myanmar of genocide.
Monday's announcement comes after more than four years of examinations by the State Department, including a 2018 report prepared with outside lawyers that surveyed more than 1,000 Rohingya refugees living in Bangladesh.
Three-quarters of those surveyed had witnessed the military kill someone and more than half witnessed acts of sexual violence, Blinken said, adding the findings ""demonstrate that these abuses were not isolated cases.""

Blinken also recalled the experience of his stepfather, Samuel Pisar, who was sent to the Nazis' first concentration camp at Dachau a dozen years after it was built - an example of how the groundwork for genocide is laid over years or even decades.
An exhibit at the museum showed how Rohingya had their rights and citizenship ""methodically stripped away"" over many years, Blinken said.

U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday told businesses to do more to protect themselves against possible cyber attacks by Russia, warning there was ""evolving intelligence"" that Moscow was exploring options on that front. 
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters: ""The Russian Federation, unlike many Western countries, including the United States, does not engage in state-level banditry.""
Russia has previously rejected similar allegations, including accusations that it was responsible for hacks on Ukrainian banking and government websites in February.
Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) on Tuesday said the U.S. Department of Defense has not suffered any cyberattacks, adding that U.S. officials were open with American business leaders at Monday's meeting about the likely risk to corporations.
""We haven't seen anything affect our infrastructure or critical U.S government infrastructure,"" he told MNSBC. ""We wanted to make sure that leaders knew and were aware that the Russians would probably try this kind of tactic going forward.""
Important U.S. companies that provide critical infrastructure should improve their cyber defenses, but there was ""no certainty"" such an attack would occur, senior White House cybersecurity official Anne Neuberger said on Monday. 
Russian Deputy Industry and Trade Minister Vasiliy Shpak suggested Russia create a division of cyber troops to combat increased threats, in which developers could hone their skills and demonstrate their patriotism. 
""After this, I hope, they will think 10 times before leaving their motherland in pursuit of easy money in foreign companies,"" the RIA news agency quoted Shpak as saying on Tuesday.
The cybersecurity arm of the telecoms firm Rostelecom has said efforts to disrupt the operations of company websites have intensified this month.

Rostelecom Chief Executive Mikhail Oseevskiy said attacks on Russian websites were continuing and becoming more varied. 
""We understand what the risks are and how they can be mitigated,"" Interfax quoted him as saying.

(Reuters) - He survived the Nazi Buchenwald concentration camp during World War II. He survived the Dora-Mittelbau concentration camp in the same war. And the Bergen-Belsen camp.
Last week, Boris Romanchenko, a 96-year-old Holocaust survivor, was killed when shelling hit his ordinary flat in the war-ravaged Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. 
""It is with horror that we report the violent death of Boris Romanchenko in the war in Ukraine,"" the memorial for the Buchenwald survivors said on Monday in a statement. 
The multi-storey apartment building where Romanchenko lived was shelled and caught on fire,"" said the statement.
Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, has been under heavy fire from Russian artillery throughout the invasion, which Russian President Vladimir Putin calls a ""special military operation"" necessary to disarm and ""denazify"" its neighbour.
""Please think about how many things he has come through,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Monday.
""But (he) was killed by a Russian strike, which hit an ordinary Kharkiv multi-storey building. With each day of this war, it becomes more obvious what denazification means to them.""
Romanchenko was born on Jan. 20, 1926, in Bondari, near the city of Sumy according to the statement from the Buchenwald memorial. 
He was deported to Dortmund in 1942, where he had to do forced mining labour. After an unsuccessful escape attempt, he was sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp in 1943, where more than 53,000 people were killed during World War II. 
He was then sent to Peenemünde on the Baltic Sea island of Usedom, where he worked as a forced labourer on the V2 rocket programme, the Dora-Mittelbau concentration camp and the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, the statement said.
""The horrific death of Boris Romanchenko shows how threatening the war in Ukraine is for the concentration camp survivors,"" the memorial said in the statement.

LVIV/KYIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukraine's military warned the public on Tuesday of more indiscriminate Russian shelling from bogged-down Russian troops, and U.S. President Joe Biden issued his strongest warning yet that Russia is considering using chemical weapons.
Amid the devastation caused by Russia's unceasing bombardment of Ukrainian cities, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy highlighted the death of a 96-year-old survivor of Nazi concentration camps, killed in his flat by shelling in Kharkiv.
Nearly four weeks into their invasion, Russian troops have failed to capture any major Ukrainian city and have been halted on nearly all fronts, but are hammering residential districts with artillery, missiles and air strikes.
Russian forces were expected to continue to attack critical infrastructure with ""high-precision weapons and indiscriminate munitions”, Ukraine's armed forces said in a statement.
Russia has been saying in recent weeks that Ukraine might possess chemical or biological weapons. Biden said those accusations were not merely false, but a sign that President Vladimir Putin might be planning to use such weapons himself.
""Now he's talking about new false flags he's setting up including, asserting that we in America have biological as well as chemical weapons in Europe, simply not true,"" Biden said at a business event on Monday. ""They are also suggesting that Ukraine has biological and chemical weapons in Ukraine. That's a clear sign he's considering using both of those.""
Putin calls the war, the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two, a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine and protect it from ""Nazis"". The West calls that a false pretext for an unprovoked war of aggression.
In an address overnight, Zelenskiy drew attention to the death of Boris Romanchenko, a Holocaust survivor killed when his flat in besieged Kharkiv was shelled last week.
""Please think about how many things he has come through,"" said Zelenskiy. ""But (he) was killed by a Russian strike, which hit an ordinary Kharkiv multi-storey building. With each day of this war, it becomes more obvious what 'denazification' means to them.""

BIDEN TRIP TO EUROPE
Biden is due to travel to Europe this week for meetings with allied leaders to discuss tighter sanctions on Russia, on top of the unprecedented financial penalties already announced. he discussed Russia's ""brutal"" tactics in a call with European leaders on Monday, the White House said.
Russia's siege and bombardment of Ukrainian cities, in particular the southern port of Mariupol which has been encircled for weeks, is increasing pressure for action.
Sanctions have banished Russia from international commerce to a degree never before visited on such a large economy. But an exception has largely been carved out for Russian energy exports to Europe, its biggest oil and gas customer.
EU foreign ministers on Monday disagreed on whether and how to include energy in sanctions, with Germany saying the bloc was too dependent on Russian oil to impose an embargo.
NO SURRENDER
The conflict has forced nearly a quarter of Ukraine's 44 million people from their homes, including more than 3.5 million refugees who have fled the country, half of them children, in one of the fastest exoduses ever recorded.
The city of Kharkiv came under increased artillery fire overnight, regional governor Oleh Synyehubov said in televised comments. The governor of the Zaporizhzhia region said buses evacuating civilians from front-line areas were hit by shelling on Monday and four children were wounded.
Serhiy Gaidai, governor of Luhansk, one of two eastern regions that Russia demands Ukraine cede to pro-Russian separatists, said the entire region was now being shelled.
""We are continuing to evacuate people for as long as we can,"" he said. ""We see that ... the Russians' only goal is to destroy Ukraine.""
On Monday, Ukraine rejected a Russian ultimatum to surrender Mariupol, where hundreds of thousands of civilians have been trapped under constant bombardment, with no access to food, heat, power or water for weeks.

A part of Mariupol now held by Russian forces, reached by Reuters on Sunday, was an eerie wasteland. Several bodies wrapped in blankets lay by a road. Windows were blasted out and walls were charred black. People who came out of basements sat on benches amid the debris, bundled up in coats.
A group of men were digging a grave in a patch of grass by the roadside.

Russia and Japan have not formally ended World War Two hostilities because of their standoff over islands, seized by the Soviet Union at the end of World War Two, just off Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido.
The islands are known in Russia as the Kurils and in Japan as the Northern Territories.
Japan has imposed sanctions on 76 individuals, seven banks and 12 other bodies in Russia, most recently on Friday, and included defence officials and its state-owned arms exporter, Rosoboronexport.
Russia would not continue negotiations with Japan on a peace treaty ""under current conditions"", its foreign ministry said on Monday, citing Japan's ""openly unfriendly positions and attempts to damage the interests of our country"".
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said he strongly opposed Russia's decision, calling it ""unfair"" and ""completely unacceptable"".
""This entire situation has been created by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and Russia's response to push this onto Japan-Russia relations is extremely unfair and completely unacceptable,"" he said, adding that Japan's attitude towards seeking a peace treaty was unchanged and it had protested against the Russian decision.
""Japan must resolutely continue to sanction Russia in cooperation with the rest of the world,"" he said.
Kishida, asked later about economic cooperation with Russia, said Japan valued any opportunity to secure an inexpensive energy supply - a reference to energy projects in Sakhalin, after withdrawals by Shell (LON:RDSa) and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM).
Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said Japan had lodged a protest with Russia's ambassador to Japan, and later Japan's vice foreign minister summoned the ambassador, Mikhail Galuzin, to the ministry to lodge a protest.
Galuzin was later quoted by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper as saying that given the situation regarding recent ""unfriendly actions"", Russia had no intention of continuing negotiations.
Japan last week also announced plans to revoke Russia's most-favoured nation trade status and ban imports of certain products.
Last year, President Vladimir Putin said that both Tokyo and Moscow wanted good relations and that it was absurd they had not reached a peace agreement.

In 2020, Russia's constitution was amended to bar handing over territory to a foreign power.
Russia has also withdrawn from talks with Japan about joint business projects on the Kuril islands and ended visa-free travel for Japanese citizens, its foreign ministry said.

MARIUPOL/LVIV/KYIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukraine said on Monday it would not obey ultimatums from Russia after Moscow demanded it stop defending besieged Mariupol, where hundreds of thousands of civilians are suffering through Russian bombardments laying waste to their city.
Mariupol has become a focal point of Russia's assault on Ukraine, but attacks were also reported to have intensified on the country's second city Kharkiv on Monday.
The conflict has driven almost a quarter of Ukraine's 44 million people from their homes, and Germany predicted the refugee number could reach as high as 10 million in coming weeks.
Europe said Russia was using refugees as a tool and that it was prepared to take more action on top of existing sanctions to isolate Russia from global finances and trade.
Russia's military had ordered residents of Mariupol to surrender by 5 a.m. local time on Monday, saying those who did so could leave, while those who stayed would be handed to tribunals run by Moscow-backed separatists.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's government responded that it would never bow to ultimatums and said cities such as the capital Kyiv, Mariupol and Kharkiv would always defy occupation.
""There can be no question of any surrender"" in Mariupol, said Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.
Russia's invasion, now in its fourth week, has largely stalled, failing to capture any major city, but causing massive destruction to residential areas.
Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov that was home to 400,000 people, has run short of food, medicine, power and water. Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said its ""heroic defenders"" had helped thwart Russia elsewhere.
A part of Mariupol now held by Russian forces, reached by Reuters on Sunday, was an eerie wasteland. Several bodies lay by the road, wrapped in blankets. Windows were blasted out and walls were charred black. People who came out of basements sat on benches amid the debris, bundled up in coats. 
Some, though, are managing to escape.
A total of 8,057 people were safely evacuated on Monday through seven humanitarian corridors from towns and cities under fire, said Vereshchuk. Among those brought to safety were 3,007 residents of Mariupol. 
U.S.-RUSSIA WAR OF WORDS
Russia calls the war, the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two, a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine and protect it from ""Nazis"".
The West calls this a false pretext for an unprovoked war of aggression by President Vladimir Putin.
President Joe Biden told businesses to be alert for possible cyber attacks by Russia and do more to protect themselves.
""It’s part of Russia’s playbook,"" he said in a statement.
""My administration is reiterating those warnings based on evolving intelligence that the Russian government is exploring options for potential cyberattacks.""
There was no immediate reply from the Kremlin to a request for comment from Reuters out of hours on Monday.
Russia has previously rejected similar allegations including that it was responsible for hacks on Ukrainian banking and government websites in February.
In response to Biden last week calling Putin a ""war criminal,"" Russia's foreign ministry said on Monday it had summoned U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan.
""Such statements from the American president, unworthy of a statesman of such high rank, put Russian-American relations on the verge of rupture,"" it said.
Deputy U.S. Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, in an interview on MSNBC, said Russia's reaction ""just shows how desperate President Putin is becoming."" 
KHARKIV INTENSIFICATION
The conflict continues to rage in a number of locations. 
The eastern cities of Kharkiv, Sumy and Chernihiv have also been hard hit by Russia's tactic of pounding urban areas with artillery as its troops have done before in Syria and Chechnya.
On Monday night, a witness in Kharkiv said she saw people on the roofs of apartment buildings dropping grenades or similar ordnance onto the streets.
A second witness, outside the city, reported hearing more intense explosions than on any day since Russian troops began attacking last month.
Reuters could not immediately verify the accounts.
In Kyiv, six bodies were laid on the pavement by a shopping mall struck overnight by Russian shelling. Emergency services combed wreckage to the sound of distant artillery fire.
Firefighters put out small blazes around the building, hunting for survivors. Ukraine said at least eight people died. 
Russia said the centre was being used as a weapons store. Ukraine said there were no strategic military objects in the area. Neither report could be independently verified.
Officials imposed a day-and-a-half curfew in the capital from Monday night, citing the likelihood of more shelling. Britain said there was heavy fighting to the north but that Ukrainian forces had fought off an advance and most Russian forces were more than 25 km (15 miles) from the city centre.
Ukrainian officials hope that Moscow, having failed to secure a quick victory, will cut its losses and negotiate a withdrawal. Both sides hinted last week at progress in talks on a formula which would include some kind of ""neutrality"" for Ukraine, though details were scarce.
West of Mariupol, the governor of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region said shelling had hit buses evacuating civilians from front line areas and four children were wounded in separate incidents that he blamed on Russia. Reuters could not confirm the report independently. Moscow denies targeting civilians.

Biden discussed Russia's ""brutal tactics"" in Ukraine with European leaders on Monday and Britain said they reaffirmed their commitment to support Ukraine militarily, diplomatically and economically.
But European Union foreign ministers disagreed on whether and how to include energy in sanctions, with Germany saying the bloc was too dependent on Russian oil to declare an embargo.

VIENNA (Reuters) - The remaining members of the one shift of technical staff who had been on duty at Chernobyl's radioactive waste facilities since Russian forces seized the site last month have been relieved, the U.N. nuclear watchdog said on Monday.
For more than three weeks the Ukraine facilities, next to the now-defunct power plant that in 1986 was the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster, were operated by a single shift of staff that happened to be on duty when Russian forces took control on Feb. 24. All had been unable to leave until Sunday.
For weeks the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been saying the situation, which meant that the staff on duty were exhausted and working under extreme pressure, posed a growing risk to the site's safety and called for them to be rotated out.
""Ukraine's regulatory authority said about half of the outgoing shift of technical staff left the site of the 1986 accident yesterday and the rest followed today, with the exception of thirteen staff members who declined to rotate,"" the IAEA said in a statement.
The Ukrainian regulator said most of the Ukrainian guards who have also been there since it was seized remained at the site, the IAEA added. The agency said last week that there were 211 technical staff and guards at the site, without breaking that number down further.
The departing technical staff have been replaced by Ukrainian colleagues who like them are based in the nearby town of Slavutych, the IAEA said, citing the Ukrainian regulator.

""The new work shift ... includes two supervisors instead of the usual one to ensure that there is back-up available on the site, the regulator said,"" according to the IAEA statement.
The IAEA added, also citing the Ukrainian regulator, that an agreement had been reached on how to organize staff rotations.

(Reuters) - At least two tornadoes tore through north and central Texas on Monday, destroying homes and businesses, knocking out power and injuring at least several people.
Multiple homes were damaged or left in ruins in Round Rock, Texas, a city of around 120,000 people about 20 miles from Austin, after a tornado touched down there, officials said. 
""We could see a funnel on the south side of Round Rock,"" That funnel continued through the south side of the city,"" Police Chief Allen Banks told an evening news conference.
Banks said buildings in and around the city had suffered ""extreme structural damage"" but that only minor injuries had been reported. The twister also caused a gas leak that was subsequently stopped, he said. 
A family of three people was rescued from the rubble of their home in the town of Bowie, Texas, roughly 90 miles northwest of Dallas, after a tornado touched down there, the local NBC affiliate reported. One woman was hospitalized.
Multiple other structures were damaged in and around Bowie, NBC 5 reported, including a gas plant off Highway 59 south of the city. There were no immediate reports of fires or leaks from the plant. 
A high school in Jacksboro, some 35 miles southeast of Bowie, was also hit by a possible tornado, according to the station. The roof of the school's gym collapsed but no students were reported hurt. 

The National Weather Service warned that the storm system that spawned the twisters could bring strong winds, hail and the potential for more tornadoes in Texas and Oklahoma on Tuesday. 
The system also carried the danger of flooding in southern states, including Lousiana and Mississippi,the weather service said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Russia's false accusations that Kyiv has biological and chemical weapons illustrate that Russian President Vladimir Putin is considering using them himself in his war against Ukraine, U.S. President Joe Biden said on Monday, without citing evidence.
Putin's ""back is against the wall and now he's talking about new false flags he's setting up including, asserting that we in America have biological as well as chemical weapons in Europe, simply not true,"" Biden said at a Business Roundtable event.
""They are also suggesting that Ukraine has biological and chemical weapons in Ukraine. That's a clear sign he's considering using both of those.""
The Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The remarks echoed prior comments by officials in Washington and allied countries, who have accused Russia of spreading an unproven claim that Ukraine had a biological weapons program as a possible prelude to potentially launching its own biological or chemical attacks.
Russia's defense ministry has accused Kyiv, without providing evidence, of planning a chemical attack against its own people in order to accuse Moscow of using chemical weapons in the invasion of Ukraine that began on Feb. 24.
Earlier this month, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan spoke with Nikolay Patrushev, secretary of Russia's Security Council, warning him of consequences for ""any possible Russian decision to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine."" The White House did not specify what those consequences would be.
Biden also said Russia used a hypersonic missile to destroy a weapons depot on Saturday ""because it’s the only thing they can get through with absolute certainty.""
An administration official clarified Monday evening that Biden was confirming Russia's use of such an advanced missile, but noted that the impact of the attack was unknown. One senior U.S. defense official had earlier raised questions about the legitimacy of the Russian account. [L2N2VO18C]

Russia's invasion, which it calls a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine, has largely stalled, failing to capture any major city, but causing massive destruction to residential areas.
Ukraine said on Monday it would not obey ultimatums from Russia after Moscow demanded it stop defending besieged Mariupol, where hundreds of thousands of civilians are suffering through Russian bombardments.

Biden said last week that Putin was a ""war criminal"" for sending tens of thousands of troops to invade Ukraine and targeting civilians.
""Such statements from the American president, unworthy of a statesman of such high rank, put Russian-American relations on the verge of rupture,"" the ministry said in a statement. 
The Kremlin earlier described the comments as ""personal insults"" against Putin.
The ministry also told Sullivan that hostile actions against Russia would receive a ""decisive and firm response.""
State Department spokesman Ned Price confirmed that Sullivan met with Russian officials. But he declined to say whether the U.S. envoy told them that the United States stands behind the accusation Biden levelled at Putin.
Price told a news briefing that the United States believes it is important to maintain communication channels with Russia especially ""during times of conflict.""
""We have sought to maintain a diplomatic presence in Moscow"" and the United States wants Russia to keep a similar presence in Washington, he continued.
Russia's actions ""call into question whether they, too, welcome these same open lines of communications,"" Price said.
Deputy U.S. Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, in an interview on MSNBC, said Russia's reported statement ""just shows how desperate President Putin is becoming."" 
Sullivan in the meeting repeated a demand that the United States be given consular access to American citizens detained in Russia, including those in pretrial detention, Price said.

He said Russia has barred U.S. diplomats from meeting those Americans for months in violation of international law.
Russia has detained at least three Americans, including WNBA star Brittney Griner, who was arrested earlier this month at a Moscow-area airport and accused of transporting drugs.

LONDON (Reuters) -Aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe accused Britain and Iran on Monday of treating her like a political pawn, saying it should not have taken six years for London to secure her release from detention in Tehran.
Appearing at a news conference in parliament in London, the 44-year-old said she would always be haunted by her time in prison but would slowly work to rebuild her life with her daughter, 7, and husband away from the spotlight.
Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who holds both British and Iranian citizenship, returned to Britain last week from Iran, where she was held for six years after being convicted of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment.
She returned alongside another dual national, Anoosheh Ashoori, after London resolved what it called a parallel issue - repaying to Tehran a 400 million pound ($526 million) debt dating back to 1979 for the purchase of military tanks that were never delivered.
Zaghari-Ratcliffe said she had been told shortly after her arrest that the Iranians wanted ""something off the Brits"", and she could not understand why it had taken six years, and five different foreign secretaries, for it to be resolved.
""I mean, how many foreign secretaries does it take for someone to come home? Five?"" she asked. ""What's happened now should have happened six years ago.""
A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said all foreign ministers had worked hard to secure her release.
""The government, including the prime minister, was committed to securing Nazanin's release as soon as possible. It was always entirely in Iran's gift to release detained dual nationals,"" he told reporters.
""All the foreign secretaries who have taken on this role have worked hard with officials to secure the release. It has been extremely complicated, it has been very difficult work.""
FAMOUS FOR A WEEK 
Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested by Revolutionary Guards at Tehran airport on April 3, 2016, while trying to return to Britain with her then 22-month-old daughter Gabriella from an Iranian New Year's trip to see her parents.
Her family and her employer, the  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Foundation, denied the charge against her. The Thomson Reuters Foundation is a charity that operates independently of Thomson Reuters and its news subsidiary Reuters.
""I have been a pawn in the hands of the two governments over the past six years,"" she said. Zaghari-Ratcliffe thanked her family, friends and journalists for keeping her case in the spotlight, and said she was determined not to hold a grudge for the rest of her life. 
She added that she only believed she was going home when she finally stepped on to the plane.

""Gabriella told me on the phone one day when I was in Iran, 'Mummy you do realise that you are very famous, and then it's me, and then it's daddy',"" she said, adding that she told her daughter it would be better to have a ""normal"" life.
""And she said, 'Oh you're not going to be famous forever. Maximum a week'."" ($1 = 0.7612 pounds)

ON BOARD THE SUPPLY SHIP ELBE, Latvia (Reuters) - Hours after Russian missiles first struck Ukrainian cities on Feb. 24, German naval commander Terje Schmitt-Eliassen received notice to sail five warships under his command to the former Soviet Republic of Latvia to help protect the most vulnerable part of NATO's eastern flank. 
The hasty dispatch was part of Germany's scramble to send ""everything that can swim out to sea,"" as the navy's top boss phrased it, to defend an area military strategists have long deemed the weakest point for the alliance. The vessels' sudden departure demonstrated how NATO, and Germany, were propelled by Russia's invasion into a new reality and face what officials, diplomats, intelligence officials and security sources agree is the most serious threat to the alliance's collective security since the Cold War.
Schmitt-Eliassen, who is based in the German Baltic port of Kiel, spoke to Reuters on the flight deck of the supply ship Elbe. Moored next to it, within sight of the church towers of the Latvian capital Riga, were a Latvian and a Lithuanian ship, and vessels and sailors from nations including Denmark, Belgium and Estonia were due to join the group later. 
A total of 12 NATO warships with some 600 sailors on board are due to start a mine-clearing operation in the coming days.
On Feb. 16, when intelligence showed an invasion was imminent, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called the current era a ""new normal.""
It looks a lot like a return to the past. Founded in 1949 to defend against the Soviet threat, the NATO alliance is facing a return to mechanised warfare, a huge increase in defence spending, and potentially a new Iron Curtain falling across Europe. After struggling to find a new post-Cold War role, countering terrorism following the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States in 2001 and a humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, NATO is back defending against its original nemesis. 
But there's a difference. China, which split with the Soviet Union during the Cold War, has refused to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation."" And the old Cold War blueprints no longer work, as NATO has expanded east since the 1990s, bringing in former Soviet states – including the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia in 2004. 
In early February, China and Russia issued a powerful joint statement rejecting NATO's expansion in Europe and challenging the Western-led international order. 
Direct confrontation between NATO and Russia could touch off a global conflict. 
""We have reached a turning point,"" said retired German general Hans-Lothar Domroese, who led one of the highest NATO commands in the Dutch town of Brunssum until 2016. 
""We have China and Russia acting in concert now, boldly challenging the United States for global leadership ... In the past, we have been saying deterrence works. Now we have to ask ourselves: Is deterrence enough?""
This is underscored by Schmitt-Eliassen's mission – a regular exercise that was brought forward by Russia's invasion.
The issue is access. Before the Soviet Union was dissolved, NATO could have moved to contain the Soviet Union by blocking the western entrance of the Baltic Sea. That would seal in the Soviet Union's Baltic Fleet to prevent it from reaching the North Sea where its warships could attack U.S. supply convoys.
Today, NATO's and Russia's roles have been reversed: An emboldened Moscow could encircle NATO's new Baltic members, and cut them off from the alliance. If a new Iron Curtain is to fall, NATO needs to ensure its members are not behind it (see map https://tmsnrt.rs/3tnekaO).
The three tiny countries, with a combined population of some six million people, have a single overland link to the alliance's main territory. A corridor of some 65 km (40 miles) is squeezed between the heavily armed Russian exclave of Kaliningrad on the west and Belarus on the east. 
So Schmitt-Eliassen's goal is to keep the waterway open, as a supply line also for non-NATO states Finland and Sweden. Millions of tons of old mines, ammunition and chemical weapons are believed to lie on the bed of the shallow Baltic Sea, a legacy of two World Wars.
Mines – whether old and unexploded or freshly laid – can have an impact beyond destruction, Schmitt-Eliassen said. A mine sighting, or rumoured sighting, can close harbours for days while the area is swept. If that happens in the Baltic, there's a risk ""the supermarket shelves will remain empty.""
Even commercial ships can become a military factor in the narrow western entrance to the Baltic, he said, referring to scenarios such as the March 2021 incident when the Ever Given container ship blocked traffic through the Suez Canal for days.
""You cannot blame anybody for this (kind of incident), it is not attributable,"" the chief of the German navy, vice-admiral Jan Christian Kaack, told Reuters.
NEXT TARGET?
Crucial for the Baltics is the land link between Kaliningrad and Belarus. Called the Suwalki Gap, its seizure would cut the Baltic states off. 
""Putin could quickly seize the Suwalki Gap,"" said Domroese, the retired German general, adding this will not happen today or tomorrow, ""but it could happen in a few years."" 
Putin's recent actions have not all been predictable. He put Russia's nuclear forces on high alert on Feb. 28, with rhetoric that Stoltenberg told Reuters is ""dangerous, it's reckless.""
The Kremlin did not respond to a request for comment. Putin says Russia's concerns expressed over three decades about NATO's expansion were dismissed by the West, and post-Soviet Russia was humiliated after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union.
He says NATO, as an instrument of the United States, was building up its military on Ukraine's territory in a way that threatened Russia.
On March 11, Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told Putin the West was beefing up military forces close to Russia's Western borders. Putin asked Shoigu to prepare a report on how to respond.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelinskiy has warned that the Baltic states will be Russia's next target. The Baltic Sea is a large and busy shipping market for containers and other cargo, connecting Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Russia with the rest of the world. 
It ""has gone from being a normal peaceful area, to an area where you tread carefully,"" said Peter Sand, chief analyst at the air and ocean freight rate benchmarking platform Xeneta. With demand and logistics disrupted, the fees shippers pay to move cargoes from Hamburg to Saint Petersburg and Kaliningrad are down 15% since the invasion, according to Xeneta data.
For almost 25 years, the West believed Russia could be tamed by diplomacy and trade to maintain stability and security in Europe. In 1997, NATO and Russia signed a ""founding act"" that was designed to build trust and limit both sides' force presence in eastern Europe. 
The alliance also sought to build a partnership with Russia, which took part in NATO exercises in the Baltic as recently as 2012, according to retired U.S. Admiral James Foggo, who commanded U.S. and NATO fleets in Europe for almost a decade until 2020.
After Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, NATO created small, multinational combat units in Poland and the three Baltic states, which serve as a forward presence to deter Moscow. But the force numbers are designed not to violate the ""founding act,"" which has hindered NATO's ability to move troops into the Baltics and Poland on a permanent basis.
""We all thought that there wouldn't be an enemy anymore,"" Admiral Rob Bauer, the chairman of NATO's military committee, told Reuters. ""We now are confronted with a nation that is showing that it is aggressive, that it has forces that we thought were not going to be used anymore.""
While the numbers are changing all the time, the number of troops under the command of NATO Supreme Allied Commander in Europe (SACEUR) Tod Wolters has more than doubled since Russia's invasion, to around 40,000, according to NATO diplomats and officials. 
NATO allies have also moved five aircraft carriers into European waters, in Norway and the Mediterranean, increased the number of warplanes in the air in NATO airspace and more than doubled the size of the combat units in the Baltics and Poland. Host nation forces number some 290,000 in the region, but mainly under national control.
GERMANY'S MOMENT
The biggest shift in NATO's ""new normal,"" diplomats, former officials and experts say, is Germany's reversal of a decades-long policy of low defence spending. Held back by guilt over its wartime past and resulting pacifism among its population, Germany resisted pressure from the United States to increase this to a NATO target of 2% of economic output. France and Britain both meet the goal, but Germany's defence spending was only 1.5% in 2021.
With ageing equipment and personnel shortages, Berlin had been seen for decades as a weak partner because of its reluctance to send troops to combat operations. 
But on Feb. 27, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Berlin would now meet the 2% target - and promised a 100 billion euros ($110 billion) injection into the military.
Germany has been concerned by Moscow's presence in the Baltic Sea for a while. After Russia's annexation of Crimea, Berlin forged an alliance of the western navies on the Baltic Sea.
""We simply had to take note of the fact that - whether we like it or not - we are the 900 pound gorilla in the ring,"" said navy chief Kaack. ""The way we look up to the United States as a smaller partner, that's how our partners here look at us."" 
Soon after Russia's invasion, Berlin announced it would buy 35  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) F-35 fighter jets from the United States to replace its ageing Tornado fleet. 
NO MORE CONSTRAINTS
The United States is also moving more military equipment into Europe, including vehicles and weapons to Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Poland that could be used immediately by newly arriving U.S. troops, rather than waiting weeks for tanks and trucks to be shipped from U.S. bases.
Douglas Lute, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, told Reuters that NATO's ""new normal"" should be a step up from what the alliance agreed after Crimea. It is likely to be set down in writing in NATO's official master strategy document, known as its ""Strategic Concept,"" which will be agreed at the next NATO summit in Madrid in June.
""You'll see a push forward of combat capability to both reassure eastern allies and to make an even more prominent deterrence message to Russia,"" Lute said.
He said NATO's existing multinational combat units in the Baltics and Poland – originally some 5,000 troops in total - should be significantly increased in size. He said he expected ""more sophisticated air defence systems postured forward,"" including Patriot and other systems in the Baltics and Poland.
And he expects more U.S. weapons and military equipment to be pre-positioned in Europe. More NATO troops could be stationed in Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Hungary.
The U.S. delegation to NATO declined to comment. Its envoy, Julianne Smith, said on March 15 the alliance was making commitments to ""have more force posture in Central and Eastern Europe and develop new policy tools.""
But – just as in the Cold War – NATO will need to keep communicating with Russia to avoid risking accidents with potentially devastating consequences.

""NATO has some responsibility to do more than just trying to keep Russia out,"" said Adam Thomson, a former British ambassador to NATO and now director of the European Leadership Network think tank in London. ""It's about the management of an unavoidable strategic instability.""

571,"<span>Mar 21, 2022 01:08PM ET</span>","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's bid to drive a wedge between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin over the Ukraine war will be a key topic of discussion this week when Biden travels to Brussels for talks with European leaders.
The United States and its allies will discuss providing weaponry and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and the Ukrainian refugee crisis at an extraordinary NATO summit, meeting of the Group of Seven economies, and a European Council summit on Thursday. 
But after his inconclusive talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday, Biden also plans to coordinate a response to Beijing if it provides material support to Russia's invasion of Ukraine with European leaders, U.S. administration officials say. 
""During his visit to Brussels, President Biden will coordinate with our EU partners on all aspects of our response to President Putin’s unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine, and this includes the concerns we share with the EU if China provides material support to Russia,"" said a senior Biden administration official.
The success of close coordination on economic sanctions, export controls and trade measures imposed on Russia have brought Europe and the United States closer together, a second senior U.S. official said. These democratic leaders have growing concerns about China's potential role in the conflict.
""The challenges that we face ... are the same ones the Europeans face. And so I really do think that there is ... an inflection point here in many ways,"" the second official said. 
European nations and the United States have been working behind the scenes for weeks to try to convince Chinese officials not to back Putin's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special operation,"" and to push Putin for a cease fire. The war has killed hundreds of civilians, destroyed towns and displaced millions. 
The Chinese ambassador to the United States, Qin Gang, told CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday that China was not sending arms or financial assistance to Russia. However, he and other Chinese officials have publicly rejected a push to change course, claiming China is on the right side of history.
Some diplomats and analysts see signs that Beijing is shifting. Recent statements from Beijing have called for a cease fire, and emphasized the war's cost to the global economy, one European official noted, a split from Russia's position. 
In the year since Biden took office, Xi has shown no sign of buckling to various U.S. demands, and has been using closer ties with Russia as a counterweight against pressures exerted on China by the West.

Xi has rejected investigations into the origin of the coronavirus in Wuhan, China, in 2019. He has refused to pressure North Korea to rein in its nuclear weapons program and rejected criticism of Chinese treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang. He has raised tensions with Taiwan and continued a quest to dominate the South China Sea.
However, China's close economic ties to Group of Seven wealthy democracies, which buy about one-third of its exports, could provide leverage in the bid to distance Xi from Putin.

Police are investigating 12 gatherings held at Downing Street after an internal inquiry found Johnson's staff had enjoyed alcohol-fuelled parties, with the British leader attending a few of the events himself.
""Detectives investigating allegations of breaches of Covid-19 regulations in Downing Street and Whitehall have begun to interview people, as witnesses, as part of their ongoing enquiries,"" the Met said in a statement.
The police said over 100 questionnaires had been sent out as part of the investigation, with initial responses helping to identify further individuals who had now also been sent questionnaires.
Johnson is among those to have received a questionnaire about the gatherings, which took place at time many people could not attend funerals or say farewell to loved ones dying in hospital due to strict COVID-19 lockdown rules.
The revelations sparked widespread anger, and some politicians in the prime minister's own party joined the opposition in calling for him to quit. 
However, as focus has shifted to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, some, such as the Conservative leader in Scotland Douglas Ross, have withdrawn that call, saying the focus should be on the war.

The police said it had not yet referred any individuals for a fixed penalty notice, which would be issued to people deemed to have broken COVID rules.
It said that the investigation was proceeding as quickly as possible but gave no time frame for its completion.

GENEVA (Reuters) -A U.N. human rights expert called on North Korea on Monday to release tens of thousands of people believed to languish in political prison camps, while urging regional and world powers to raise such issues with Pyongyang alongside nuclear concerns.
Tomas Ojea Quintana said that a landmark U.N. investigation in 2014 had found that up to 120,000 people were held in the camps and that he continued to receive allegations about them.
""I have heard accounts that...the system, the political regime in North Korea, would not survive without the existence of political prison camps,"" Ojea Quintana told a news briefing. 
Noting that there were occasional amnesties for prisoners, he added: ""I really urge the leadership to continue to release prisoners especially those most vulnerable and ultimately of course I call for the dismantlement of these facilities.""
Ojea Quintana said that North Korea's system of 'kwanliso' or political prison camps, constituted crimes against humanity - a charge Pyongyang has rejected - and called for perpetrators to face justice.
North Korea, which has repeatedly denied the existence of political prison camps, did not take the floor at the debate. It has previously accused Western powers of using criticism of human rights as part of a hostile policy towards it.
""Authorities in North Korea need to know they have to respond sooner or later for crimes being committed,"" Ojea Quintana said. ""In some political prisoner camps the prisons are being used for forced labour in coal mines and other kinds of mines."" 
FOODS SHORTAGES
Earlier, addressing the Human Rights Council, he urged North Korea to reopen its borders to aid workers and food imports, saying that its further self-isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic may have left many facing ""hunger and starvation.""
Some 40% of its population lack adequate food supplies, he said, adding: ""Now with the country still in the grip of strict COVID-19 measures, there are serious concerns that the most vulnerable segments of the population may be facing hunger and starvation."" 
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has not reported any COVID-19 cases and has imposed strict anti-virus measures since the onset of the pandemic two years ago, including border closures and domestic travel curbs.
Foreign aid agencies and embassies largely left the country after the restrictions made it hard to maintain a presence there. 
""We remain deeply concerned about the DPRK’s systematic, widespread human rights violations, including torture, enslavement, and arbitrary imprisonment,"" U.S. diplomat Daniel Murphy told the council.

North Korea does not recognise Ojea Quintana's mandate as U.N. special rapporteur for human rights in DPRK.
North Korea appeared to have fired a short-range multiple rocket launcher on Sunday, South Korea's military said, amid heightened military tensions on the peninsula after a spate of larger missile launches by the nuclear-armed North.

WARSAW/PRZEMYSL, Poland (Reuters) - Hundreds of Ukrainians waited in front of Poland's national stadium to register for work permits on Monday as governments and businesses across central Europe sought to help refugees who have fled Russia's invasion find jobs and school places.
Poland has taken in the largest number of refugees, some 2.1 million, since the start of the war on Feb. 24. Its pre-war Ukrainian community of around 1.5 million had already represented the region's largest.
Tatiana Shmaliy stood in line with friends at the stadium in Warsaw where the national soccer team plays, seeking documents that will allow them to work until they can return home. 
""People have been very good about accommodating us but finding work is difficult. We are looking for any job,"" said Shmaliy, who works as a beautician in her home town of Vinnitsya in central-western Ukraine.
Most Ukrainians fleeing the war have passed through border points into Poland, Slovakia, Romania and Hungary, all members of the European Union, U.N. refugee agency data shows.
Border authorities reported that the number of refugees crossing into the EU continued to ebb on Monday, though they warned of a further surge in arrivals if the fighting escalates.
'BE PREPARED'
""In recent days there has been a decline in people who come to Poland,"" Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Paweł Szefernaker said in a radio interview.
""But we know that due to Russia's aggression, another wave of refugees may come to us at any moment and we must be prepared.""
The U.N. refugee agency says some 10 million Ukrainians - in a total population of around 45 million - have been displaced by the war, including 3.4 million - mostly women and children - who have fled abroad, mostly to EU member states.
The EU's migration commissioner, Ylva Johansson, warned on Monday of risks that some refugee children could be trafficked. Ukraine has a high number of orphans and children born through surrogate mothers who have not been picked up by their parents, she said. 
Schools around the region have begun integrating Ukrainian children in classes and companies have sought to offer work to new arrivals but many refugees do not speak the local languages.
In Romania, where more than 500,000 Ukrainians have fled, a large recruiting platform has introduced a ""Ukrainian friendly jobs"" tag on its online platform and allows companies to post positions free of charge. 
Ukrainians who have fled to the Czech Republic can be hired without a work permit from Monday as long as they have a special visa. The Interior Ministry has issued more than 205,000 such visas in a country now hosting some 270,000 refugees.
Russian forces advancing on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv from the northeast have stalled, British intelligence said on Monday, as Ukraine rejected Moscow's calls for defenders to lay down their arms in the besieged city of Mariupol.
Moscow says its ""special military operation"" aims to disarm Ukraine and rid it of dangerous nationalists. The West say President Vladimir Putin launched an aggressive war of choice against a democratic state that posed no threat to Russia. 

Speaking after arriving at the Medyka crossing, Poland's busiest along the country's some 500-km (310-mile) border with Ukraine, refugees on Monday told of bombings and aerial attacks as they fled but vowed to return home as soon as possible.
""I will work for a while and then we'll see,"" said Natasha, 46, who came from Ukraine's Poltava region. ""And when it's quiet... I will go back to Ukraine. We'll build Ukraine back, what else can we do? My son and my husband stayed there.""

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A German politician who mobilized a protest against a now-sanctioned Russian resident of his resort town has attracted a following, but also angry emails and a threatening phone call.
This mirrors Germany's ambivalence to becoming a sanctuary for wealth in a culture that cherishes privacy but that critics say has allowed the mega-rich to squirrel away assets in secrecy.
And while Britain, France, Italy and Spain have seized yachts and other property since Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent imposition of sanctions on influential Russians, Germany appears to have sat on its hands.
""For years, Germany has been a magnet for dirty money from all over the world. For too long, we did not look closely enough, and now we are suffering the consequences,"" Lisa Paus, a member of Germany's parliament, said.
A government task force to enforce sanctions is just getting off the ground.
Germany's uneasy relationship with oligarchs has shone an uncomfortable spotlight on the Bavarian lakeside community around Tegernsee, where locals and officials say at least three homes belong to Uzbekistan-born businessman Alisher Usmanov.
Usmanov, who has interests in mining and telecommunications and a net worth that Britain estimates at more than $18 billion, was described by the European Union as a ""pro-Kremlin oligarch with particularly close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin"" when it imposed sanctions on him.
His holding company USM, whose website describes Usmanov as an entrepreneur, investor and ""one of the world's most generous philanthropists"", did not respond to requests for comment. Two other companies he owns did not respond.
Thomas Tomaschek, a member of the council of Rottach-Egern on Tegernsee's southern tip, this month called a demonstration to say Usmanov was no longer welcome, even though restaurants, carpenters and hoteliers had profited from his presence.
The event attracted 300 people, representing prominent members of all parties in a town of 5,000, but also a backlash.
Tomaschek says he received an email saying ""shame on you"" for demonstrating ""against a Russian who clearly lives as a private person in Rottach-Egern"". Another wrote: ""Should anyone who has shaken Putin's hand be deprived of assets in Germany?""
A caller screamed ""Nazi pig"" down the phone, prompting him to file a complaint and to remove an axe for chopping wood from his doorstep in case someone violent appeared. The local police confirmed it was investigating.

'SAFE HAVEN'
Angry grass roots activists are now drawing attention to Germany's impotence when it comes to seizing assets.
Mathis Lohaus, a researcher at Freie Universitaet Berlin who focuses on corruption, is outraged that no one had seized a superyacht that the United States says is owned by Usmanov and has been berthed in the port of Hamburg.
Lohaus said he took to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) to express his frustration when Germany failed to seize the ship, which has an indoor pool, two helipads and is valued at more than $600 million.
""The whole history of Germany over the last few years has been one of unenthusiastic enforcement,"" Lohaus said.
There has been no confiscation of the yacht, a spokesperson for Hamburg's economics ministry said last week.
Meanwhile, a prominent campaign group against financial crime recently launched a petition addressed to German finance minister Christian Lindner demanding action.
""Germany offers them all a safe haven for their dirty money. This has to stop now!"" the Finanzwende petition reads. The finance ministry said in an emailed response to Reuters that it has been working on measures to clamp down. 
Graphic: Suspicious transactions: https://graphics.reuters.com/UKRAINE-CRISIS/dwvkrlodxpm/chart.png 
Part of Germany's problem with enforcement has been bureaucracy, with responsibility spread across ministries. 
In an effort to address this, Germany last week said that it was forming a task force to oversee the implementation of sanctions across its finance, economy and interior ministries, as well as customs and police.
There are cultural and historical factors at play too. 
Hartmut Baeumer, a former judge and now chair of Transparency International Germany, said Germans are risk-averse when it comes to confronting legal issues, while a belief in strong protection of an individual's rights runs deep.
""We Germans are still working through the consequences of the Nazi era. The pendulum has swung very far in the direction of privacy and individual freedoms,"" Baeumer said.
'A BILLIONAIRES' PLACE'
German and international elites have long sought refuge in the rolling hills around Tegernsee, which sits between Munich and the Alps, and Rottach-Egern markets itself as home to Europe's first beauty farm and ""first-class and elegant"" hotels.
Last week the average price of homes in Rottach-Egern on a popular real-estate portal was more than 4 million euros, while the average taxpayer in the surrounding county pays 66% more income tax than those in the rest of Germany. 
""Tegernsee is a billionaires' place,"" one prominent local businessman said on condition of anonymity. 
Gerhard Hofmann, Rottach-Egern's city manager, said he had never witnessed such uproar in his native town.

Usmanov ""just wanted to have his peace"", Hofmann said, adding that the oligarch had helped the local economy by employing local architects and companies.
""As a town, we are neutral,"" he added.

PRAGUE/WARSAW (Reuters) - Officials in Central Europe voiced concern on Sunday that they were reaching capacity to comfortably house some of the nearly 3.5 million refugees who have fled Ukraine since Russia's invasion and are now camped in temporary accommodation.
Most of the Ukrainians have arrived at border points in Poland, Slovakia, Romania and Hungary, data compiled by the U.N. refugee agency shows, putting pressure on the European Union countries now attempting to shelter them.
Czech Interior Minister Vit Rakusan said the government would seek to extend a state of emergency to deal with the influx, with officials trying to relocate new arrivals to cities outside the capital Prague to ease the pressure.
""The Czech Republic is balancing on the edge of capacities where we are able to provide comfortable living conditions,"" Rakusan said during a television debate. ""Living in gyms, sleeping bags, or campsites is not good for life.""
The Czech parliament also approved three laws this week making it easier for Ukrainian refugees to access to work, health insurance, and allow schools to raise class capacities.
Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said seven humanitarian corridors would open on Sunday to enable civilians to leave frontline areas.
In Poland, whose Ukrainian community of around 1.5 million is the region's largest, refugees waited in line for a third day in front of the National Stadium temporarily turned into an administration office to register new arrivals.
More than 2 million Ukrainians have crossed into Poland since the invasion by Russia, which it says is a ""special operation"" aimed at demilitarising Ukraine, began on Feb. 24. Ukraine and the West say Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an aggressive war of choice.
Warsaw officials say this has increased the Polish capital's population of 1.8 million by 17%.
""We never know how many refugees will arrive,"" Warsaw city council spokeswoman Monika Beuth-Lutyk said. ""We have done everything we can and the next move is up to the government to implement a system and to build refugee towns.""
'PANIC STARTS'
At the Medyka crossing, Poland's busiest along the country's some 500-km (310-mile) border with Ukraine, aid groups were preparing for a surge of refugees if humanitarian corridors allowed Ukrainians in areas under siege to escape. 
An International Organization for Migration spokesman said that thousands of people have crossed daily at Medyka alone. 
""We don't know how many people and we don't know when they will arrive,"" the group's spokesman Jorge Galindo told Reuters. 
With men of conscription age obliged to stay and help defend Ukraine, mostly women and children have entered the EU.
Newly arriving refugees described panic during their escapes that included shelling and shooting overhead by Russian forces as they fled their cities and began long journeys to safety.

""Rockets started to fly,"" said Natalia Strelcova, who entered Poland with her cat after fleeing the Dnipro region.
""It becomes scary, panic starts, and you want to run away somewhere,"" Strelcova added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joseph Biden will travel to Poland on Friday to discuss the international response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine that has sparked a ""humanitarian and human rights crisis,"" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said late Sunday.
Biden will travel to Warsaw where he will hold a bilateral meeting with President Andrzej Duda, the White House said. Over 2 million refugees have entered Poland from Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, the Polish border guard said on Friday.
Biden's Poland trip will come a day after he meets in Brussels with NATO Allies, G7 Leaders and European Union Leaders to discuss international efforts to support Ukraine after Russia's invasion, the White House said.
The White House also said Biden will host a call Monday at 11 a.m. EST with President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom to discuss their coordinated responses to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
United Nations data showed as of Thursday about 3.2 million have fled abroad from Ukraine since last month, in what has become Europe's fastest growing refugee crisis since World War Two. The U.N. said some of the 2 million people entering Poland from Ukraine have moved on to other countries in the EU but the ""the majority are believed to be still in Poland.""

On Thursday, Biden will attend an emergency NATO Summit on Ukraine as well as a G7 meeting. He will also join a scheduled European Council Summit to discuss Ukraine ""including transatlantic efforts to impose economic costs on Russia, provide humanitarian support to those affected by the violence, and address other challenges related to the conflict,"" the White House said.
Earlier on Sunday, Psaki said Biden was not planning to visit Ukraine during his European trip this week.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration has formally determined that violence committed against the Rohingya minority by Myanmar's military amounts to genocide and crimes against humanity, U.S. officials told Reuters, a move that advocates say should bolster efforts to hold the junta that now runs Myanmar accountable.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken will announce the decision on Monday at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, U.S. officials said, which currently features an exhibit on the plight of the Rohingya. It comes nearly 14 months after he took office and pledged to conduct a new review of the violence. 
Myanmar's armed forces launched a military operation in 2017 that forced at least 730,000 of the mainly Muslim Rohingya from their homes and into neighboring Bangladesh, where they recounted killings, mass rape and arson. In 2021, Myanmar's military seized power in a coup.
U.S. officials and an outside law firm gathered evidence in an effort to acknowledge quickly the seriousness of the atrocities, but then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declined to make a determination. 
Blinken ordered his own ""legal and factual analysis,"" the U.S. officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity. The analysis concluded the Myanmar army is committing genocide and Washington believes the formal determination will increase international pressure to hold the junta accountable.
""It's going to make it harder for them to commit further abuses,"" said one senior State Department official. 
Officials in Myanmar's embassy in Washington and a junta spokesperson did not immediately respond to emails requesting comment on Sunday.
Myanmar's military has denied committing genocide against the Rohingya, who are denied citizenship in Myanmar, and said it was conducting an operation against terrorists in 2017. 
A U.N. fact-finding mission concluded in 2018 that the military's campaign included ""genocidal acts,"" but Washington referred at the time to the atrocities as ""ethnic cleansing,"" a term that has no legal definition under international criminal law.
""It's really signaling to the world and especially to victims and survivors within the Rohingya community and more broadly that the United States recognizes the gravity of what's happening,"" a second senior State Department official said of Blinken's announcement on Monday. 
A genocide determination does not automatically unleash punitive U.S. action. 
Since the Cold War, the State Department has formally used the term six times to describe massacres in Bosnia, Rwanda, Iraq and Darfur, the Islamic State's attacks on Yazidis and other minorities, and most recently last year, over China's treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslims. China denies the genocide claims.
Blinken will also announce $1 million of additional funding for the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar (IIMM), a United Nations body based in Geneva that is gathering evidence for potential future prosecutions.
""It's going to enhance our position as we try to build international support to try to prevent further atrocities and hold those accountable,"" the first U.S. official said.
U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who led a congressional delegation to Myanmar and Bangladesh in 2017, welcomed the move. 
""While this determination is long overdue, it is nevertheless a powerful and critically important step in holding this brutal regime to account,"" Merkley said in a statement.
FOCUS ON MILITARY 
Days after U.S. President Joe Biden took office, Myanmar generals led by Commander in Chief Min Aung Hlaing seized power on Feb. 1, 2021, after complaining of fraud in a November 2020 general election won by democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi's party. Election monitoring groups found no evidence of mass fraud.
The armed forces crushed an uprising against their coup, killing more than 1,600 people and detaining nearly 10,000, including civilian leaders such as Suu Kyi, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), a campaign group, and setting off an insurgency.
Reuters was unable to independently verify the figures from the AAPP. The junta has said the group's figures are exaggerated and that members of the security forces have also been killed in clashes with those opposing the coup. The junta has not provided its own figures.
In response to the coup, the United States and Western allies sanctioned the junta and its business interests, but have been unable to convince the generals to restore civilian rule after they received military and diplomatic support from Russia and China.
Blinken's recognition of genocide and crimes against humanity refers mainly to events in 2017, before last year's coup. The step comes after two State Department examinations - one initiated in 2018 and the other in 2020 - failed to produce a determination. 
Some former U.S. officials told Reuters those were missed opportunities to send a firm message to the Myanmar generals who later seized power. 
Activists believe a clear statement by the United States that genocide was committed could bolster efforts to hold the generals accountable, such as a case in the International Court of Justice where The Gambia has accused Myanmar of genocide, citing Myanmar's atrocities against the Rohingya in Rakhine state.
Myanmar has rejected the charge of genocide and urged the court's judges to drop the case. The junta says The Gambia is acting as a proxy for others and had no legal standing to file a case. 
The International Criminal Court (ICC), a separate court at The Hague, is also investigating the deportation of Rohingya from Myanmar, and the IIMM in Geneva is gathering evidence that could be used in future trials. 
Myanmar opposes the investigations and has refused to cooperate, asserting the ICC does not have jurisdiction and that its decision to launch a probe was swayed by ""charged narratives of harrowing personal tragedies which have nothing to do with the legal arguments in question.""
John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said Myanmar's military has faced ""few real consequences for its atrocities, whether against Rohingya or other ethnic minority groups in Myanmar."" 
As well as imposing more economic sanctions on the junta, the United States should press for a U.N. Security Council resolution that would refer all the military's alleged crimes to the International Criminal Court, Sifton said. If Russia and China veto a resolution, as is likely, Washington should lead action in the U.N. General Assembly, he said.
""Condemnations of Myanmar should be coupled with concrete actions,"" he said.
Before Blinken made the decision this month, officials debated whether blaming Myanmar's government - rather than specifically its military - for the atrocities could complicate U.S. support for the country's deposed democratic forces, according to a source familiar with the matter.
The State Department opted to pin the blame on the military, said the second senior department official. 
""It's not clear to what degree the civilian leadership had control over actions that were happening in Rakhine State and so that's where the determination ends at this point,"" said that official, who did not comment on the internal deliberation.
Suu Kyi, forced to share power with the generals, traveled to the International Court of Justice in 2019 to reject the genocide charges brought by The Gambia. 

She said the country would itself prosecute any soldiers found to have committed abuses, but maintained the alleged violations did not rise to the level of genocide, for which the specific intent to destroy a group has to be proven.
When they seized power, the generals put Suu Kyi on trial in nearly a dozen cases that could see her sentenced to more than 100 years in prison. She remains in detention.

LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Russian and Ukrainian forces fought for the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol on Sunday, where residents are trapped with little food, water and power, while Ukraine's president appealed to Israel for help in pushing back Russia's assault.
In the capital, Kyiv, shellfire hit several homes and a shopping centre in the Podil district late on Sunday, killing at least one person, the city's mayor said.
In his latest appeal for help from abroad, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy addressed the Israeli parliament by video link and questioned Israel's reluctance to sell its Iron Dome missile defence system to Ukraine.
""Everybody knows that your missile defence systems are the best... and that you can definitely help our people, save the lives of Ukrainians, of Ukrainian Jews,"" said Zelenskiy, who is of Jewish heritage.
Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has held numerous calls with both Zelenskiy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to try to end the conflict. 
Mariupol has suffered some of the heaviest bombardments since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. Many of its 400,000 residents remain trapped with little if any food, water and power.
Burying his neighbours in a makeshift grave by the roadside, a man who identified himself as Andrei said they had died not by shelling but of ailments, stress and cold after weeks without access to medical help.
Fighting continued inside the city on Sunday, regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said, without elaborating.
Russia called on Ukrainian forces in Mariupol to lay down their arms, saying a ""terrible humanitarian catastrophe"" was unfolding.
It said defenders who did so were guaranteed safe passage out of the city and humanitarian corridors would be opened from 1000 Moscow time (0700 GMT) on Monday.
Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said over 7,000 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Sunday, more than half of them from Mariupol. She said the government planned to send nearly 50 buses to Mariupol on Monday for further evacuations.
Russia and Ukraine have made agreements throughout the war on humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians, but have accused each other of frequent violations of those.
Mariupol city council said on Telegram on Saturday that several thousand residents had been ""deported"" to Russia over the past week. Russian news agencies said buses had carried hundreds of refugees from Mariupol to Russia in recent days.
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield told CNN the deportation accounts were ""disturbing"" and ""unconscionable"" if true, but said Washington had not yet confirmed them.
Russian forces bombed an art school on Saturday in which 400 residents were sheltering, but the number of casualties was not yet known, Mariupol's council said.
Reuters could not independently verify the claims. Russia denies targeting civilians.
On Saturday, Zelenskiy called the siege of Mariupol a war crime and ""a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come.""
Greece's consul general in Mariupol, the last EU diplomat to evacuate the city, said it was joining the ranks of places known for having been destroyed in wars.
""What I saw, I hope no one will ever see,"" he said.
FEW ADVANCES
Capturing Mariupol would help Russian forces secure a land corridor to the Crimea peninsula that Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. 
Putin says Russia's ""special operation"" is aimed at disarming Ukraine and rooting out dangerous nationalists. Western nations call it an aggressive war of choice and have imposed punishing sanctions aimed at crippling Russia's economy.
Ukraine and its Western backers say Russian ground forces have made few advances in the last week, concentrating instead on artillery and missile strikes.
Zelenskiy's adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said on Sunday there had been a relative lull over the past 24 hours, with ""practically no rocket strikes on cities"". He said front lines were ""practically frozen"".
Later on Sunday, however, Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko reported several explosions in the capital's Podil district and said rescue teams were putting out a large fire at the shopping centre. He said at least one person was killed.
Reuters was not able to immediately verify the report.
The U.N. human rights office said at least 902 civilians had been killed as of midnight Saturday, though the real toll was probably much higher. Ukrainian prosecutors said 112 children had been killed.
The U.N. refugee agency said 10 million Ukrainians have been displaced, including some 3.4 million who have fled to neighbouring countries such as Poland. Officials in the region said they were reaching capacity to comfortably house refugees. 
Russia said it had launched cruise missiles from ships in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea, as well as hypersonic missiles from Crimean airspace. Hypersonic missiles travel faster than five times the speed of sound and their speed, manoeuvrability and altitude make them difficult to intercept.
Russia deployed them for the first time in Ukraine on Saturday in a strike it said destroyed an underground depot for missiles and aircraft ammunition.
U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" program on Sunday Putin could have resorted to such weapons ""because he's trying to reestablish some momentum"", but said he didn't see them as a game-changer.
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu of Turkey, which like Israel has tried to mediate, said the sides were getting closer to agreement on ""critical"" issues.
Kyiv and Moscow reported some progress last week toward a political formula that would guarantee Ukraine's security, while keeping it outside NATO - a key Russian demand - though each side accused the other of dragging things out.

In the southern city of Kherson, video seen by Reuters showed dozens of protesters, some wrapped in Ukraine's blue-and-yellow flag, chanting ""Go home"" in Russian at two military vehicles with Russian markings. The vehicles turned and left.
""I want the war to be over, I want them (Russian forces) to leave Ukraine in peace,"" said Margarita Morozova, 87, who survived Nazi Germany's siege of Leningrad in World War Two and has lived in Kharkiv, eastern Ukraine, for the past 60 years.

(Reuters) - An off-duty police officer accused of placing his knee on the neck of a 12-year-old girl to restrain her after a school fight in Kenosha, Wisconsin, is under investigation and remains employed, the city's police department said in a statement.
The March 4 incident at Lincoln Middle School drew fresh public attention after the city's school district, which employed Shawn Guetschow as a part-time security guard when he was off duty from the city police force, publicly released video of it on Friday.
It comes the year after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who used a similar knee restraint on George Floyd as he cried ""I can't breathe,"" was convicted of murder and sentenced to 22-1/2 years in prison.
Guetschow resigned from his security guard post for the Kenosha Unified School District, but remains employed by the city police force, Kenosha Police Department said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
The district provided Reuters with surveillance video of the incident, showing two female students fighting in a lunch room before two adults intervened. One of the adults took one of the students to the ground, placing his knee on her neck while handcuffing her, the video showed. 
An attorney for the girl said during a news conference last week that it ""mirrored the same maneuver that Derek Chauvin used to murder George Floyd.""
Guetschow ""held her face against the floor, he positioned himself behind her, lifted his right leg, and pressed his knee down into the back of her neck,"" said Drew DeVinney, the attorney for the girl, who was identified only as ""Jerrel Perez's daughter."" 
She ""told him she couldn't breathe,"" DeVinney said, but ""the officer continued to push his knee into Jerrel's daughter's neck,"" adding that Guetschow eventually handcuffed and arrested her. 
According to U.S. media, Guetschow said he resigned from his role with the school system due to the ""mental and emotional strain"" the event has brought upon his family. Attempts to reach Guetschow for comment on Sunday were unsuccessful.
Kenosha has a troubled past with police using force.
In August 2020, a white Kenosha police officer shot a Black man several times in the back in front of his young children. That man, Jacob Blake, was left paralyzed from the waist down.
The incident sparked days of deadly protests against police brutality and racism in his hometown and across the United States. The officer was not charged in the incident.
In June, Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers signed into law a measure that bans police use of choke holds.
The school district, noting that DeVinney threatened legal action against the district, the officer and the police department, declined to comment on Sunday other than to say that Guetschow resigned from his school role on March 15.
Kenosha Police declined further comment on Sunday.
DeVinney did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Accounts that thousands of residents of Ukraine's besieged port city of Mariupol have been forcibly deported to Russia are ""disturbing"" and ""unconscionable"" if true, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said on Sunday.
Speaking on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Thomas-Greenfield said the United States had not yet confirmed the allegations made on Saturday by the Mariupol city council via its Telegram channel.
""I've only heard it. I can't confirm it,"" she said. ""But I can say it is disturbing. It is unconscionable for Russia to force Ukrainian citizens into Russia and put them in what will basically be concentration and prisoner camps.""
Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, igniting a conflict that has led to more than 900 civilian deaths and nearly 1,500 injuries as of March 19, according to the U.N. human rights office.
Mariupol, a key connection to the Black Sea, has been a target since the start of the war, which Russian President Vladimir Putin calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarize and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war of aggression.
The Mariupol city council also said Russian forces bombed an art school on Saturday in which 400 residents had taken shelter, but the number of casualties was not yet known.
Reuters could not independently verify the reports by the city council. The Russian Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment, but Russia denies targeting civilians.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on Saturday for comprehensive peace talks with Moscow. 
The United States supports those attempts, Thomas-Greenfield said on Sunday, adding that the negotiations ""seem to be one-sided,"" with little response from Russia.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will hold an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss the conflict and the response of the 30-member alliance.
Poland will formally submit a proposal for a peace-keeping mission in Ukraine at the meeting, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said last week. 
When asked about the Polish proposal, Thomas-Greenfield reiterated President Joe Biden's commitment to refrain from sending U.S. troops into Ukraine.
""Other NATO countries may decide that they want to put troops inside of Ukraine,"" she said. ""That will be a decision that they have to make.""
'TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN'
Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, speaking on CNN later on Sunday, said she would press NATO to strengthen its military capabilities in Eastern Europe and urge all member countries to devote at least 2% of their gross domestic product to defense.
Kallas said the allegations of Ukrainians deported to Russia were reminiscent of thousands of Estonians sent to Siberian labor camps in the 1940s.
""Right now we are in a different position, because we are NATO allies,"" she said. ""But we are trying to do everything we can to support and help Ukraine to fight this war."" 
Turkey is also attempting to mediate a ceasefire in Ukraine, which NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg praised during an interview on Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""
""Turkey is doing some real effort to try to facilitate, support talks between Russia and Ukraine,"" Stoltenberg said. ""It's far too early to say whether these talks can lead to any concrete outcome.""
Earlier this month, NATO rejected Ukrainian calls to set up a ""no-fly zone"" over Ukraine to help it protect its skies from Russian missiles and warplanes.

When asked on Sunday whether a no-fly zone would be considered if Russia used chemical weapons in Ukraine, Stoltenberg raised concerns that such a step could escalate the conflict.
""Our allies support Ukraine,"" he said. ""But at the same time it is extremely important we prevent this conflict from becoming a full-fledged war between NATO and Russia that will cause much more damage, much more death, destruction than what we are seeing now in Ukraine.""

TORONTO (Reuters) - As students in Canada's most populous province return to mask-free classes after two years on Monday, one Ontario school board is facing backlash for defying the province's decision to drop masks, potentially setting the stage for a clash on a contentious pandemic issue.
The mask mandate and other pandemic measures have become a lightning rod in Canada for an anti-government movement, sparking a three-week protest in capital Ottawa last month.
The Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board (HWDSB) voted against removing the mask mandate and proposed keeping students and teachers masked until April 15 to protect the medically vulnerable.
Ontario's remaining 30 public school boards are planning to follow the government order after Ontario Chief Medical Officer of Health Kieran Moore turned down requests from several other school boards to keep mask mandates.
Some Hamilton parents have criticized the board's decision, saying the policy is ""pointless"" and ""potentially unlawful."" HWDSB is home to some 50,000 students.
""My kids will not be wearing masks and they will be told to have the school call me if the school tries to force them to wear a mask,"" said Alyssa Vankleek, a Hamilton parent.
""My child was told by the provincial government it was safe to no longer wear a mask in most settings. The school board has no right to tell us otherwise,"" she added.
However, Dr. Armand Keating, clinician scientist and staff hematologist at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, pointed out that ""the increasing frequency of cases of the more transmissible BA.2 variant lends further support for a more cautious approach.""
HWDSB will find it challenging to enforce masking requirements once the mandate is lifted as Ontario schools do not have their own mask policies. Prohibiting a maskless student from attending school could be deemed a breach of the child's rights, according to the Ontario Education Act and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
'IT'S AN OVERREACH'
An exception to this rule, however, can be found in the Health Protection and Promotion Act, which gives the municipality's health officer power to override the provincial government's laws.
""They personally can't mandate it,"" said Miranda Butler, a Hamilton mother of two elementary school students. ""It's an overreach, especially if they don't have public health backing them,"" she added, noting that her kids will continue to wear masks anyway.
HWDSB declined to say how it plans to deal with students and teachers attending schools without masks.
Ontario's ministry of education is reviewing HWDSB's request to support its masking policy. Elizabeth Richardson, medical officer of health in the city of Hamilton, said Public Health Services will continue to collaborate with the province and local school board to ""help balance the risks of COVID-19 and the risks to the mental, emotional and physical health of children and their learning.""
The Elementary Teachers Federation of Ontario (ETFO) also opposes removing the mandate. Ontario Teachers Federation and Hamilton-Wentworth Elementary Teachers' Local did not responded to a request for comments.
""Ontarians have relied on public health officials to lead with a science- and evidence-based approach,"" said ETFO President Karen Brown. ""Unfortunately, it appears that a fast-approaching June election is influencing politicians’ decisions to lift COVID-19 safety measures,"" Brown added.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the decision is based on the chief medical officer's advice and encourages schools to stick with the province’s end date.
Ford's office did not offer an immediate comment when asked if the upcoming provincial election played a role.

STREPY-BRACQUEGNIES, Belgium (Reuters) - A car drove at high speed into a group of Belgian carnival performers who were preparing a parade early on Sunday, killing six people and seriously injuring 10 others, authorities said, saying the incident did not appear to be a militant attack. 
""At this stage, there are no elements to suggest that the attack had a terrorist motive,"" prosecutor Damien Verheyen told a news conference. Police denied media reports the car was involved in a high-speed chase.
The incident occurred in the southern Belgium village of Strepy-Bracquegnies at around 0400 GMT.
Jacques Gobert, mayor of the neighbouring town of La Louviere, said between 150-200 people were gathered to get ready for the annual folklore parade, involving costumes and drums, when the vehicle appeared.
""A speeding car drove into the crowd ... The driver then continued on his way,"" said Gobert.
The two people driving the car, which was later intercepted, were detained. Police said they were local people in their 30s and were not previously known to police. 

Belgium has sought to root out people suspected of militant links over the past seven years. A Brussels-based Islamic State cell was involved in attacks on Paris in 2015 that killed 130 people and on Brussels in 2016 in which 32 died. 
Ramming vehicles into crowds has become more common as a weapon used by militants in Europe and white supremacists in the United States because such attacks are inexpensive, easy to organise and hard for authorities to prevent, experts say.

With more than 33% of the vote counted on Sunday afternoon, a day after the nation went to the polls, data from East Timor's Technical Secretariat for Election Administration showed Ramos-Horta in the lead with 44.5%. 
The next closest was current president and former resistance fighter Guterres, with 24.1%, according to the election administration which is responsible for the official vote count.
Asia's youngest nation held its fifth presidential election since independence on Saturday, with the country's generation of independence leaders and former fighters dominating the list of 16 candidates.
As it approaches twenty years of independence after a brutal occupation by neighbouring Indonesia, East Timor has grappled with political instability and the need to diversify its oil and gas dependent economy.
Ramos-Horta, 72, has said he felt compelled to run after the incumbent president had ""exceeded his powers"" by refusing to swear in seven ministers following the 2018 parliamentary elections. 
The move sparked an ongoing political impasse in the country of 1.3 million.
After casting his ballot in the capital of Dili on Saturday, Guterres said he was optimistic about his chances. 

""Whoever runs must be ready to win and be ready to lose,"" he said, ""But I want to say I will win.""
If no candidate wins an outright majority, the vote will go to a second-round run off on April 19 between the top two candidates.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea appeared to have fired a short-range multiple rocket launcher on Sunday, South Korea's military said, amid heightened military tensions on the peninsula after a spate of larger missile launches by the nuclear-armed North.
While they garner much less attention than the massive intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), North Korea has displayed several new types of multiple launch rocket systems in recent years, adding to an already large arsenal of artillery and rockets ideal for potentially striking targets in the South.
""This morning there was firing in North Korea which is assumed to be multiple rocket launcher shots, and our military was monitoring the related situation and maintaining a readiness posture,"" South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement, without elaborating.
North Korea's military fired four shots around 7:20 a.m. (2220 GMT on Saturday) for about an hour toward its west coast from an unidentified location in South Pyongan Province, Yonhap news agency reported.
South Korea's National Security Council held an emergency vice-ministerial meeting over the launches.
Last year South Korea approved plans to pursue a $2.6-billion artillery interception system, similar to Israel's ""Iron Dome"", designed to protect against North Korea's arsenal of long-range guns and rockets.
About half of South Korea's 52 million people live in the capital Seoul and the surrounding areas, within range of the neighbour’s long-range guns and multiple rocket launchers.

Pyongyang has conducted an unusually high pace of missile launches this year.
South Korea and the United States warn that the North could resume test-firing its largest ICBMs for the first time since 2017 amid stalled denuclearisation talks. North Korea also appears to be preparing to launch a spy satellite, and new construction has been spotted at its shuttered nuclear test site.

""China will never accept any external coercion or pressure, and opposes any unfounded accusations and suspicions against China,"" Wang told reporters on Saturday evening, according to a statement published by his ministry on Sunday.
Wang's comments came after U.S. President Joe Biden warned his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on Friday of ""consequences"" if Beijing gave material support to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
During the video call, Xi told Biden the war in Ukraine must end as soon as possible and called on NATO nations to hold a dialogue with Moscow. He did not, however, assign blame to Russia, according to Beijing's statements about the call.
Wang said the most important message Xi sent was that China has always been a force for maintaining world peace. 
""We have always stood for maintaining peace and opposing war,"" Wang said, reiterating that China will make independent judgements.
""China's position is objective and fair, and is in line with the wishes of most countries. Time will prove that China's claims are on the right side of history.""
Also on Saturday, Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said that sanctions imposed by Western nations on Russia over Ukraine were increasingly ""outrageous"".
The United States and its European and Asian allies have imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia for the Feb. 24 invasion of its neighbour, which they call a war of aggression by President Vladimir Putin. He says he launched a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine.

While saying it recognises Ukraine's sovereignty, Beijing has repeatedly said that Russia has legitimate security concerns that should be addressed and urged a diplomatic solution to the conflict.

AMMAN/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Some Syrian paramilitary fighters say they are ready to deploy to Ukraine to fight in support of their ally Russia but have not yet received instructions to go, two of their commanders told Reuters.
Nabil Abdallah, a commander in the paramilitary National Defence Forces (NDF), said he was ready to use expertise in urban combat gained during the Syrian war to aid Russia, speaking to Reuters by phone from the Syrian town of Suqaylabiyah.
    ""Once we get instructions from the Syrian and Russian leadership, we will fight this righteous war,"" Abdallah said on March 14, four days after President Vladimir Putin gave a green light for 16,000 volunteers from the Middle East to deploy in Ukraine.     
""We don't fear this war and are ready for it once instructions come to go and join. We will show them what they never saw ... We will wage street wars and (apply) tactics we acquired during our battles that defeated the terrorists in Syria,"" he added.
The Kremlin referred Reuters' requests for comment to the Russian Defence Ministry. The ministry did not respond to a request for comment on whether Russia intended to issue instructions for NDF fighters to deploy or whether any NDF fighters had been recruited so far.
Reuters received no response to questions sent to the Syrian information ministry and the army via the information ministry on whether Syria intended to issue instructions for NDF fighters to deploy or whether any NDF fighters had been recruited so far. 
    Syria is Russia's closest ally in the Middle East, and Moscow's intervention in the Syrian war in 2015 proved decisive in helping President Bashar al-Assad defeat rebel forces in enclaves across much of the country.
    The NDF emerged from pro-Assad militias early in the Syrian war and fought in offensives that captured some of the rebel held enclaves, with Russian air support.
    Now largely demobilised, the NDF numbers in the tens of thousands, experts on Syria say, a potentially large pool of recruits for Russia if the Ukraine war drags on.
    'A JUST WAR'
    A second NDF commander, Simon Wakeel from the nearby town of Mharda, also told Reuters ""a lot of our people want to enlist to join our Russian brothers (and) allies, but we have not received any instructions from the leadership"".  
    ""We are auxiliary forces that fought alongside the army and with our Russian allies. We crushed the terrorists who waged the war in Syria,"" added Wakeel, who has been decorated by Russia and whose Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page includes images of church gatherings, men in military fatigues, and Assad.
On March 11, Putin told a meeting of Russia's Security Council that if people from the Middle East wanted to come to Ukraine of their own accord, and not for money, then Russia should help them ""get to the conflict zone"".    
    Putin's remarks came after Ukraine announced on March 3 that more than 16,000 foreigners had volunteered to fight on its side against Russia. Ukraine has established an ""international legion"" for people from abroad.
In Washington, U.S. Marine General Frank McKenzie, head of Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East, told a Senate hearing on March 15 the numbers of Syrians trying to head to Ukraine appeared to be a ""trickle"".
""We believe that out of Syria there are perhaps small, small -- very small -- groups of people trying to make their way to Ukraine,"" he said. ""Right now it's a very small, trickle.”
Two senior regional officials with close ties to the Syrian government and three sources close to the Syrian army have told Reuters that Russia has been seeking to tap Syrians with combat experience for Ukraine.
    The effort is being run out of a Russian air base at Hmeimein in Syria's Latakia province, they said, speaking on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The Russian defence ministry did not respond to Reuters' questions on whether the sources' accounts were accurate, on who was conducting the recruitment, or how it was progressing. The Syrian information ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for the government's assessment of the Russian recruitment drive.
Ukrainian military intelligence said 150 mercenaries were sent from Russia's Hmeimein air base in Syria to Russia on March 15 to take part in military actions against Ukraine, the Chief Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine said in response to questions from Reuters.
It said more than 30 fighters had returned to Hmeimein from Russia ""after being wounded in fighting with Ukrainian defenders"".
Ukrainian military intelligence said the recruits had been promised they would be used strictly in a policing role to maintain order in occupied territories, but recently information has begun to circulate among mercenaries about taking part directly in military actions against the Ukrainian army.
The Russian defence ministry and the Syrian information ministry didn't comment on the account from Ukrainian intelligence. 
'THE WORST DECISION'
In a video released on March 11, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine had ""information that Russian forces are bringing in mercenaries from different countries"", warning ""anyone who tries to join forces with the occupier in our Ukrainian lands -- this will be the worst decision of your life"". 
    The senior regional officials said the salary on offer to an ordinary recruit was around $1,000 a month, some 30 times more than a Syrian soldier's pay. Experienced fighters could get $2,000.
    The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based organisation that reports on Syria using sources on all sides of the conflict, said a monthly salary of 1,000 euros is on offer, along with compensation of 7,000 euros for the wounded and 15,000 euros paid to the families of fighters who die. It cited Syrian military sources for the information.
    No contracts had been issued, it said.
When asked by Reuters about reports of money being offered or paid to go to Ukraine, NDF commander Wakeel denied this and said ""we are volunteers in a righteous case"".
    Reuters could not independently verify the compensation details reported by the Observatory and the regional officials.

    At the March 11 meeting of the Russian Security Council, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said the volunteers from the Middle East were ready to fight alongside Russian-backed forces in the breakaway Donbass region of eastern Ukraine.
    ""Many of them we know – they helped in the struggle with (Islamic State) in the most difficult time, in the past 10 years,"" said Shoigu, in an apparent reference to the Syria conflict.

BELIZE CITY (Reuters) - Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate arrived in Belize on Saturday for a weeklong Caribbean tour that was marred by a local protest before it even began amid growing scrutiny of the British Empire's colonial ties to the region.
The arrival of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge coincides with the celebration of Queen Elizabeth's 70th year on the throne, and comes nearly four months after Barbados voted to become a republic, cutting ties with the monarchy but remaining part of the British-led Commonwealth of Nations.
Three miniature cannons fired a salute to the couple as their plane landed in Belize City before a military band played the national anthems of Belize and Britain at a welcoming ceremony that kept the media throng at a distance.
William inspected a guard of honor as the band played local creole song ""Ding Ding Wala,"" then drove off with his wife to meet Prime Minister John Briceno.
Afterwards, Briceno told Reuters the duke and duchess were ""excited to be here in Belize as we are delighted to have them,"" adding: ""We wish them a fruitful and memorable visit.""
The couple are due to stay in Belize, formerly British Honduras, until Tuesday morning. On the eve of their departure, an event planned for Sunday was scrapped when a few dozen villagers staged a protest.
Residents of Indian Creek, an indigenous Maya village in southern Belize, said they were upset that the royal couple's helicopter had been granted permission to land on a local soccer field without prior consultation.
The village is in a land dispute with Fauna & Flora International (FFI), a conservation group supported by the royal family, stirring discontent over colonial-era territorial settlements still contested by indigenous groups. 
A visit to a different site is being planned instead, Belize's government said. In a statement, Kensington Palace confirmed the schedule would be changed because of ""sensitive issues"" involving the Indian Creek community.
In a statement, FFI said it had purchased land at the nearby Boden Creek from private owners in December 2021, and that it would conserve and protect the area's wildlife while supporting the livelihoods and traditional rights of local people.
Without directly addressing the dispute, FFI said it bought the land to benefit the area's ecological integrity, resident communities and Belize as a whole, and pledged to maintain ""open and continuous dialogue"" with the local community.
After Belize, the duke and duchess are due to visit Jamaica and the Bahamas. Meetings and a variety of events are scheduled with politicians and a range of civic leaders.
Dickie Arbiter, Queen Elizabeth's press secretary from 1988 to 2000, described the tour as a goodwill visit that ought to give a temporary lift to the family's popularity.
Today, many people in former colonies see the monarchy as an anachronism that should be let go, he said. But he expected that little would change while Elizabeth remained on the throne.
""The royal family is pragmatic,"" he said. ""It knows it can't look at these countries as realm states forever and a day.""
POPULAR OPINION
Debates over colonial-era oppression, including possible reparations for the descendants of slaves in Jamaica, could push more countries to emulate Barbados' recent move.
Carolyn Cooper, a professor emerita at the University of the West Indies, said the royal couple's visit was unlikely to discourage Jamaica from opting for republic status.
""I think there is a groundswell of popular opinion against the monarchy,"" she said.
Some in Belize, which gained independence from Britain only in 1981, speak warmly about remaining in the fold.
""I believe it's a wonderful opportunity for them to appreciate the country's multiculturalism, natural attractions, and to enjoy our culinary practices,"" said Joseline Ramirez, a manager in the Cayo district of western Belize.
Others are less enthusiastic.

Alan Mckoy, a mechanic in Belize City, said he ""couldn't care less"" about the royal family.
""They are no better than any of us,"" he said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean president-elect Yoon Suk-yeol, breaking with decades of tradition, said on Sunday he will move the presidential office from the Blue House to the defence ministry compound, a step estimated to cost $40 million.
Yoon, who narrowly won a bitter March 9 election, had pledged to relocate the office to a more accessible place, and open the Blue House in Seoul to the public.
He also said on Sunday he would move his official residence to Hannam-dong, a neighbourhood that houses many business executives and diplomats.
Yoon's plans have met with mixed reactions from South Koreans, as even supporters urge Yoon to limit the inconvenience to people and businesses near the new locations. 
The Blue House move whipped up a fierce debate among feng shui experts after some rival Democratic Party officials accused Yoon of being influenced by masters of the ancient form of geomancy that originated in China. 
The defence ministry headquarters is in the Yongsan neighbourhood of the capital, next to a massive former U.S. military base that has largely closed down and moved to south of the city.
""It's difficult, but it's a decision I made for the future of the country,"" Yoon told a news conference. ""I earnestly ask the people to understand that this is not simply a relocation of the place but my determination to serve the people, work properly and keep my promise with the people.""
Feng shui masters have said the Blue House location was inauspicious. Four of the six presidents in the country's 25-year democratic history have been imprisoned or killed themselves after leaving office.
Yoon's team has dismissed any suggestions the move was influenced by such considerations, saying it would improve public access and communications with aides, and that the Blue House executive mansion had become a ""royal palace,"" isolated and enclosed by forests and tight security.
Outgoing President Moon Jae-in had also said he would find a new office but abandoned the plan for security and logistical reasons.

Yoon said the defence ministry compound is already well equipped with national security and command facilities, making it easy to transition there without compromising security or inconveniencing residents.
The Ministry of Economy and Finance estimates the move will cost 49.6 billion won ($40.1 million), including relocating the defence ministry and renovating both the new office and official residence.

About 20 dancers, with glistening bodies and graceful moves, received a thunderous applause from the packed auditorium at the London Coliseum theatre for the 'Dance for Ukraine' gala. 
""We have so many loved ones back home. We couldn't just sit idly at home and just watch news, we wanted to do something,"" Ivan Putrov, who is from Ukraine and organised the event with Romanian Alina Cojocaru, told Reuters.

The U.N. human rights office has said at least 847 civilians had been killed and 1,399 wounded in Ukraine as of Friday. More than 3.3 million refugees have fled Ukraine through its western border, with around 2 million more displaced inside the country. 
Some audience members were draped in the Ukrainian flag for the event, with dancers from many countries including Brazil, Italy and Britain providing glamour to the stage that was lit in shades of yellow and blue.
Katja Khaniukova from Ukraine and Natalia Osipova from Russia were among those who took part. There were also dancers from the United States, France, Japan and Argentina at the event, which the organisers said raised at least 140,000 pounds ($184,520.00) for the Disasters Emergency Committee's Ukraine appeal.

""Over the past week, several thousand Mariupol residents were deported onto the Russian territory,"" the council said in a statement on its Telegram channel late on Saturday. 
""The occupiers illegally took people from the Livoberezhniy district and from the shelter in the sports club building, where more than a thousand people (mostly women and children) were hiding from the constant bombing.""

Russia's Defence Ministry said busses carrying people it called refugees from Mariupol began to arrive to Russia on Tuesday, Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported last week. The ministry was not immediately available to comment on the Mariupol city council's claims.
Some 400,000 people have been trapped in Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov, for more than two weeks, sheltering from heavy bombardment that has severed central supplies of electricity, heating and water, according to local authorities.
The Russian TASS news agency reported on Saturday that 13 busses were moving to Russia, carrying more than 350 people, about 50 of whom were to be sent by rail to the Yaroslavl region and the rest to temporary transition centres in Taganrog, a port city in Russia's Rostov region. 
Russia's Defence Ministry said this month that Russia had prepared 200 busses to ""evacuate"" Mariupol citizens.
RIA Novosti agency, citing emergency services, reported last week that nearly 300,000 people, including some 60,000 children, have arrived in Russia from the Luhansk and Donbas regions, including from Mariupol, in recent weeks.
Russia's Defence Ministry said this month that more than 2.6 million people in Ukraine have asked to be evacuated.
Reuters could not immediately verify those reports. 

Mariupol, a key connection to the Black Sea, has been a target since the start of the war on Feb. 24, when Russian President Vladimir Putin launched what he calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war of aggression.
As Russia has sought to seize most of Ukraine's southern coast, Mariupol has assumed great importance, lying between the Russian-annexed peninsula of Crimea to the west and the Donetsk region to the east, which is partially controlled by pro-Russian separatists.

LVIV/ODESSA, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on Saturday for comprehensive peace talks with Moscow and also urged Switzerland to do more to crack down on Russian oligarchs who he said were helping wage war on his country with their money.
British intelligence warned that Russia, frustrated by its failure to achieve its objectives since it launched the invasion on Feb. 24, was now pursuing a strategy of attrition that could exacerbate the humanitarian crisis.
Russian forces have taken heavy losses and their advance has largely stalled since President Vladimir Putin launched the assault, with long columns of troops that bore down on Kyiv halted in the suburbs. 
But they have laid siege to cities, blasting urban areas to rubble, and in recent days have intensified missile attacks on scattered targets in western Ukraine, away from the main battlefields.
Zelenskiy, who makes frequent impassioned appeals to foreign audiences for help for his country, told an anti-war protest in Bern that Swiss banks were where the ""money of the people who unleashed this war"" lay and their accounts should be frozen.
Ukrainian cities ""are being destroyed on the orders of people who live in European, in beautiful Swiss towns, who enjoy property in your cities. It would really be good to strip them of this privilege,"" he said in an audio address.
Neutral Switzerland, which is not a member of the European Union, has fully adopted EU sanctions against Russian individuals and entities, including orders to freeze their wealth in Swiss banks.
The EU measures are part of a wider sanctions effort by Western nations, criticized by China, aimed at squeezing Russia's economy and starving its war machine.
In an address earlier on Saturday, Zelenskiy urged Moscow to hold peace talks now. 
""I want everyone to hear me now, especially in Moscow. The time has come for a meeting, it is time to talk,"" he said in a video address. ""The time has come to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine. Otherwise, Russia's losses will be such that it will take you several generations to recover.""
Britain's defense attache to the United States said British intelligence believes Russia has been taken aback by the Ukrainian resistance to its assault and has so far failed to achieve its original objectives. 
""Russia has been forced to change its operational approach and is now pursuing a strategy of attrition"" likely to involve the ""indiscriminate use of firepower resulting in increased civilian casualties,"" Air Vice Marshal Mick Smeath said in a statement.
Putin, who calls the action a ""special operation"" aimed at demilitarizing Ukraine and purging it of what he sees as dangerous nationalists, told a rally on Friday in Moscow that all the Kremlin's aims would be achieved.
On Saturday, Russia said its hypersonic missiles had destroyed a large underground depot for missiles and aircraft ammunition in the western Ivano-Frankivsk region. Hypersonic weapons can travel faster than five times the speed of sound, and the Interfax agency said it was the first time Russia had used them in Ukraine.
A spokesperson for the Ukrainian Air Force Command confirmed the attack, but said the Ukrainian side had no information on the type of missiles used. 
Ukraine’s defense ministry said in its late Saturday night update that Russian forces continued their offensive in the eastern Donetsk region, but Russian troops were forced to regroup in some areas in Ukraine’s south and additional reserves were deployed there. 
The ministry also said that the ""moral and psychological condition of the (Russian) personnel is low and deteriorating with each passing day of hostilities.""
The Ukrainian military command in charge of forces in two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine said they had fought off 10 attacks on Saturday, destroying a total of 28 tanks, armored personnel carriers and armored cars and killing more than 100 soldiers. Reuters was unable to independently corroborate the claim. 
The U.N. human rights office said at least 847 civilians had been killed and 1,399 wounded in Ukraine as of Friday, with the real figure likely much higher. The Ukrainian prosecutor general's office said 112 children were among the dead. Russia says it is not targeting civilians.
Kyiv authorities said on Saturday that 228 people had been killed in the capital since Russia's invasion began, including four children.
A further 912 people have been wounded, the Kyiv city administration said in a statement.
Reuters has not been able to independently confirm casualty figures.
'KNOW HOW TO FIGHT'
Ordinary Ukrainians have joined the effort to defend their country, such as at a training facility in Odessa, a picturesque, multicultural Black Sea port, where young urban professionals were learning about handling weapons and applying first aid.
""Every person should know how to fight, how to make medicine,"" said 26-year-old graphic designer Olga Moroz.
More than 3.3 million refugees have fled Ukraine through its western border, with around 2 more million displaced inside the country. Ukraine has evacuated 190,000 civilians from front-line areas via humanitarian corridors, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Saturday. 
""I'll go (to Germany) for three weeks but I hope I can go home after that,"" said Olga Pavlovska, a 28-year-old refugee in the Polish town of Przemysl, hoping Zelekskiy's calls for comprehensive peace talks will end the invasion. 
Hundreds of thousands have been trapped in the port city of Mariupol for more than two weeks with power, water and heat supplies cut off. Bodies amid the rubble are a common sight. Local officials say fighting has reached the city center and heavy shelling kept humanitarian aid from getting in.
About 600 residential buildings in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv have been destroyed and are unfit for habitation since the start of the Russian invasion, Kharkiv's regional governor Oleh Synyehubov said.
Rescue workers were still searching for survivors in a Mariupol theater that authorities say was flattened by Russian air strikes on Wednesday. Russia denies hitting the theater.
Interfax quoted Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as saying Moscow expected its operation in Ukraine to end with a signing of a comprehensive agreement on security issues, including Ukraine's neutral status.
Kyiv and Moscow reported some progress in talks this week toward a political formula that would guarantee Ukraine's security, while keeping it outside NATO, though both sides accused each other of dragging things out.

China has not condemned Russia's invasion, though it has expressed concern about the war.
Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said on Saturday that Western sanctions against Russia were getting ""more and more outrageous.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has informally raised with Turkey the unlikely possibility of sending its Russian-made S-400 missile defense systems to Ukraine to help it fight invading Russian forces, according to three sources familiar with the matter.
U.S. officials have floated the suggestion over the past month with their Turkish counterparts but no specific or formal request was made, the sources told Reuters. They said it also came up briefly during Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman's visit to Turkey earlier this month.
The Biden administration has been asking allies who have been using Russian made equipment and systems including S-300s and S-400s to consider transferring them to Ukraine as it tries to fend off a Russian invasion that began on Feb. 24.
The idea, which analysts said was sure to be shot down by Turkey, was part of a wider discussion between Sherman and Turkish officials about how the United States and its allies can do more to support Ukraine and on how to improve bilateral ties. 
The Turkish authorities have not commented on any U.S. suggestion or proposal relating to the transfer to Ukraine of Ankara's S-400 systems, which have been a point of long-standing contention between the two NATO allies.
Turkish foreign ministry officials were not immediately available for comment.
Turkish sources and analysts said any such suggestion would be a non-starter for Turkey, citing issues ranging from technical hurdles related to installing and operating the S-400s in Ukraine, to political concerns such as the blowback Ankara would likely face from Moscow.
Washington has repeatedly asked Ankara to get rid of the Russian-built surface-to-air missile batteries since the first delivery arrived in July 2019. The United States has imposed sanctions on a Turkey's defence industry and removed NATO member Turkey from the F-35 fighter jet programme as a result.
Ankara has said it was forced to opt for the S-400s because allies did not provide weapons on satisfactory terms.
U.S. officials are keen to seize this moment to draw Turkey back into Washington's orbit. Efforts to find ""creative"" ways to improve the strained relationship have accelerated in recent weeks, even though no specific proposal has so far gained traction, U.S. and Turkish sources have said.
""I think everyone knows that the S-400 has been a long standing issue and perhaps this is a moment when we can figure out a new way to solve this problem,"" Sherman told Turkish broadcaster Haberturk in an interview on March 5.
It was not clear what exactly she meant and the State Department has not answered questions about her comments. The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the suggestion made during her visit to Turkey.
The effort is also part of a wider bid by the Biden administration to respond to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's plea to help protect Ukraine's skies. Russian or Soviet-made air defense systems such as S-300s that other NATO allies have and S-400s are sought after.
One source familiar with U.S. thinking said Washington's floating of the possibility came as a result of the renewed effort to improve ties at a time when Ankara has been spooked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Turkish President Erdogan had not received a specific heads up from Russian President Vladimir Putin on his plans of a full-scale attack on Ukraine, another source familiar with the discussions said.
Turkey shares a maritime border with Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea and has good ties with both. It has said the invasion is unacceptable and voiced support for Ukraine, but has also opposed sanctions on Moscow while offering to mediate.

Ankara has carefully formulated its rhetoric not to offend Moscow, analysts say, with which it has close energy, defence and tourism ties. But Ankara has also sold military drones to Kyiv and signed a deal to co-produce more, angering the Kremlin. Turkey also opposes Russian policies in Syria and Libya, as well as its 2014 annexation of Crimea.
""Turkey has managed to walk on the razor's edge and a transfer of a Russian S-400 would certainly lead to severe Russian ire,"" said Aaron Stein, director of research at the Philadelphia-based Foreign Policy Research Institute. ""And for Erdogan, the S-400 has become a symbol of Turkish sovereignty, so trading it away wouldn't be all roses and flowers.""

596,"<span>Mar 19, 2022 07:55PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge ruled that a former county clerk from Kentucky knowingly violated the rights of same-sex couples by denying them marriage licenses in 2015, clearing the way for a jury trial seeking damages against her.
The ruling from U.S. District Judge David Bunning on Friday also denied a request for immunity from former Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis.
Davis thrust herself into the center of the U.S. culture wars on the issue of LGBTQ rights by denying the licenses in 2015, citing her religious beliefs. She briefly went to jail for contempt of court over her refusal and a deputy clerk in the eastern Kentucky county issued the licenses.
The two couples in the lawsuit had sought to marry in the immediate aftermath of the landmark 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision Obergefell v. Hodges. They sued Davis in 2015, alleging she had violated their constitutional rights.
In the Obergefell case, the highest court in the United States found that, under the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, states must grant same-sex marriages and recognize those of other states.
But Davis repeatedly refused to issue marriage licenses, despite a letter from the governor instructing all county clerks to issue the licenses and a legal opinion from the Rowan County attorney, which she had sought, advising that she had a legal requirement to do so.
""It is readily apparent that Obergefell recognizes Plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment right to marry. It is also readily apparent that Davis made a conscious decision to violate Plaintiffs' right,"" the judge ruled in a summary judgment.
With the essential facts in the case now settled, the two couples, David Ermold and David Moore in one case and James Yates and Will Smith in another, can proceed to jury trial to seek damages against Davis as an individual.
Davis had previously been granted sovereign immunity in her official capacity.
Liberty Counsel, a Christian organization representing Davis, said it would continue to argue she is not liable for damages because she is entitled to a religious accommodation granted by the state legislature and former Governor Matt Bevin.

The group's statement also noted that conservative justices on the U.S. Supreme Court could seek to revisit and overturn the Obergefell decision.
""This case raises serious First Amendment free exercise of religion claims and has a high potential of reaching the Supreme Court,"" Liberty Counsel founder and Chairman Mat Staver said in the statement.

597,"<span>Mar 19, 2022 03:46PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Russia's space agency on Saturday dismissed Western media reports suggesting Russian cosmonauts joining the International Space Station (ISS) had chosen to wear yellow suits with a blue trim in support of Ukraine.
""Sometimes yellow is just yellow,"" Roscosmos's press service said on its Telegram channel.
""The flight suits of the new crew are made in the colours of the emblem of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University, which all three cosmonauts graduated from ... To see the Ukrainian flag everywhere and in everything is crazy.""
Roscosmos Director-General Dmitry Rogozin was more acerbic, saying on his personal Telegram channel that Russian cosmonauts had no sympathy for Ukrainian nationalists.
In a live-streamed news conference from the ISS on Friday, veteran cosmonaut Oleg Artemyev, the mission commander, was asked about the suits.
""Every crew picks a colour that looks different. It was our turn to pick a colour,"" he said. ""The truth is, we had accumulated a lot of yellow fabric, so we needed to use it up. That's why we had to wear yellow flight suits.""
On Saturday evening, he was quoted on Roscosmos's Telegram channel as saying the suits had been made six months ago, and that the three cosmonauts had chosen the colours of their alma mater.
""Colour is just colour. It has nothing to do with Ukraine,"" he said. ""In these days, even though we are in space, we are together with our president and people!""
Russia invaded Ukraine, which has a blue and yellow flag, on Feb. 24. The ensuing fighting has killed thousands of people, devastated parts of cities and caused millions of Ukrainians to flee their homes, according to the United Nations.

Rogozin has suggested that U.S. sanctions imposed in response to the invasion could destroy ISS teamwork and lead to the space station falling out of orbit.
Officials at the U.S. space agency, NASA, have said U.S. and Russian crew members are aware of events on Earth but that their work has not been affected by geopolitical tensions.

TIJUANA, Mexico (Reuters) - Russians trying to enter the United States at the Mexican border are frustrated they are not getting in like Ukrainians are, despite leaving their homeland over the invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. officials have let dozens of Ukrainians through this week but Russians remain in limbo, prompting some to camp on the pavement alongside a barbed wire border fence, defying warnings from Mexican authorities to leave.
Irina Zolkina, a math teacher who left Moscow with her four children and her daughter's boyfriend, burst into tears when a U.S. border agent on Thursday took one look at her stack of Russian passports and shook his head, saying they would have to wait - soon after officials ushered in six Ukrainian men.
""There are so many years of fear that we're living in ... it's awful inside Russia too,"" she told Reuters in the Mexican border city of Tijuana opposite San Diego, California.
Zolkina showed Reuters a BBC video of her arrest for attending an anti-war protest on Feb. 24, the day Russia invaded Ukraine in what the Kremlin calls a ""special military operation"" that Western allies have denounced. 
She was released a few hours later and left Russia with her children the following week, she said, passing through Tashkent and Istanbul before reaching the Mexican beach resort of Cancun - a common jumping-off point for Russians heading to the U.S. border.
Over 3 million Ukrainians have become refugees, according to the United Nations, most of them in countries bordering Ukraine. Thousands of Russians have also left their country, according to media reports.
Some Ukrainians crossing in Tijuana have been granted permission to stay in the United States for a year.
When asked on Thursday about Ukrainians and Russians at the border, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the government was helping people fleeing Ukraine, and that other programs were being considered to expand humanitarian aid. 
The U.S.-Mexico border has been closed to most asylum seekers under a coronavirus pandemic policy.
A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, asked about current policy towards Russians, said the agency makes exceptions to the order on a case-by-case basis for ""particularly vulnerable individuals.""
'UNFAIR'
A couple of dozen other Russians have for several days wrapped themselves in thick blankets to sleep feet from the border wall, hoping U.S. officials will hear their pleas for protection.
""It's unfair that we can't get in,"" said Mark, 32, a restaurant manager who came from Moscow with his wife, flying to Mexico via Turkey and Germany in early March.
Both were arrested for three days last year after protesting in support of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, said Mark, who asked to withhold his last name. He said going back to Russia was not an option after new legislation that imposes up to 15 years in jail for actions found to discredit Russia's army. 
""This is our decision to be here and wait on the floor,"" Mark said, seated on a blanket while watching hundreds of tourists and U.S. citizens enter San Diego. ""If we leave this place, everyone will forget about this problem immediately.""
Between October 2021 and January, U.S. government data showed border officials encountered about 6,400 Russians, some of whom said they were dissidents and are now in the United States. The Russian Embassy said in a statement then that it had contacted U.S. authorities about those citizens.
In Tijuana last week, Mexican officials handed out flyers in Russian listing nearby migrant shelters and a letter saying Russians can request asylum but should not camp at the busy border.
Staying there ran ""the risk of the United States deciding to close the crossing for internal security reasons,"" said the letter signed by Tijuana migration director Enrique Lucero. 
Mexico's migration institute did not respond to a request for comment.
For now, the Russians are staying put.
Mikhail Shliachkov, 35, seated on a cot under a parasol to take cover from the glaring sun, said he resolved to go to Mexico with his wife the day after the invasion, fearing he would be called up to fight close relatives in Ukraine.
""I don't want to kill my brothers, you know?"" he said, showing a photo of his birth certificate that states his mother was born in Ukraine.
As the Russians wait, U.S. border officials have also turned away asylum seekers from Nigeria, Colombia, Honduras and Mexico, sparking complaints of unfair treatment.

""There's an element of racism by U.S. authorities,"" said Kevin Salgado, 19, a Mexican from the violent state of Michoacan, where he said his father and 16-year-old brother, both members of a community police, were killed. 
""Why are they letting the Ukrainians pass? ... Can someone explain to us?""

PRZEMYSL, Poland (Reuters) - Ukrainian mothers and their young children found shelter in an ornate theatre in the Polish border town of Przemysl on Saturday, where they were able to get some rest after their harrowing journey. 
For Tanya, a 34-year-old from Berdychiv in northern Ukraine, it was a relief to finally have some help with her five young children after their long trip to Poland. 
Tanya, who did not give her last name, had stayed in her home until it was no longer possible to shield her children from the war. 
""I tried to protect them from all of this. When the alarm sounded, I covered the windows with blankets so one couldn't hear it. My small ones made up a monster, the siren monster,"" she said. 
Her children ran around her as she stood inside the theatre, which is tucked inside the Polish city's Ukrainian cultural centre. There were about 50 refugees sleeping side by side under borrowed blankets on fold-out cots in the theatre. Children in colourful clothes danced and played on the stage flooded by theatre lights as their exhausted mothers chatted closely nearby. 
In a makeshift kindergarten next to the theatre, Olga Pavlovska from Kryvyi Rih in central Ukraine said she was relieved to finally be in a quiet place without air raids and sirens. 

""Here, we are at least safe. No air raid alerts, no turmoil,"" said Pavlovska, 28, as her two rambunctious sons chased each other around a table and knocked over a box of toys. 
""My child slept very badly the first night. He woke up a lot, cried a lot, but now everything is good. He slept very well, really very well. Right Vovka?"" she asked one of her sons.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis introduced a landmark reform on Saturday that will allow any baptised lay Catholic, including women, to head most Vatican departments under a new constitution for the Holy See's central administration.
For centuries, the departments have been headed by male clerics, usually cardinals or bishops, but that could change from June 5 when the new charter takes effect after more than nine years of work.
The 54-page constitution, called Praedicate Evangelium (Preach the Gospel), was released on the ninth anniversary of Francis' installation as pope in 2013, and replaces one issued in 1988 by Pope John Paul II.
Its preamble says the ""pope, bishops and other ordained ministers are not the only evangelisers in the Church"", adding that lay men and women ""should have roles of government and responsibility"" in the central administration, known as the Curia.
The principles section of the constitution says ""any member of the faithful can head a dicastery (Curia department) or organism"" if the pope decides they are qualified and appoints them.
Under the 1988 constitution, the departments - with a few exceptions - were to be headed by a cardinal or bishop and assisted by a secretary, experts and administrators.
The new constitution makes no distinction between lay men and lay women, though experts said at least two departments - the department for bishops and the department for clergy - will remain headed by men because only men can be priests in the Catholic Church.
The department for consecrated life, which is responsible for religious orders, could conceivably be headed by a nun in the future, the experts said. It is now led by a cardinal.
In an interview with Reuters in 2018, the pope said he had short-listed a woman to head a Vatican economic department, but she could not take the job for personal reasons.
ROLE OF LAITY 'ESSENTIAL'
The new constitution said the role of lay Catholics in governing roles in the Curia was ""essential"" because of their familiarity with family life and ""social reality"".
Francis also merged some offices, created a new one to oversee charity efforts, and set up a new order of importance.
The Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, which includes lay people and abuse victims, appears to have been given more institutional influence by being incorporated into the doctrinal department, which decides on sanctions for priests convicted of sexual abuse.
But one of the commission's original members, Marie Collins of Ireland, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) this could hurt its independence.
While the Secretariat of State kept its premier position as administrative, coordinating and diplomatic department, the centuries-old high status of the doctrinal office was placed below that of the department of evangelisation.
The pope will head the evangelisation office himself, highlighting the importance he gives to spreading and reviving the faith.
Francis has already named a number of lay people, among them women, to Vatican departments.
Last year, he for the first time named a woman to the number two position in the governorship of Vatican City, making Sister Raffaella Petrini the highest-ranking woman in the world's smallest state.
Also last year, he named Italian nun Sister Alessandra Smerilli to the interim position of secretary of the Vatican's development office, which deals with justice and peace issues.

In addition, Francis has named Nathalie Becquart, a French member of the Xaviere Missionary Sisters, as co-undersecretary of the Synod of Bishops, which prepares major meetings of world bishops held every few years.

ODESSA, Ukraine (Reuters) - A generation of Ukrainians who knew of war only from history books and the stories of their grandparents has been forced to prepare to fight, and some are choosing to do it with the partners they were building their lives with only weeks ago.
In a training centre in the southern city of Odessa, young urban professionals who might normally be choosing where to meet friends for a coffee learn about handling weapons and applying emergency first aid to battlefield wounds.
""Every person should know how to fight, how to make medicine, aid for your relatives or other people,"" said 26-year-old graphic designer Olga Moroz, training in civil defence alongside her boyfriend, 32-year-old sales manager Maxim Yavtushenko.
The couple, who had been planning their wedding in the summer, were at the dimly lit facility that provides basic training for 80 to 150 people a day, all seeking to have some kind of preparation for the day that Russian troops pressing closer to the city finally arrive.
Odessa, a picturesque Black Sea port that handles more than half of Ukraine's imports and exports, is seen as a major strategic and symbolic target for Russian forces. Russia invaded the country on Feb. 24 in what the Kremlin describes as a ""special military operation"".
Three weeks later, the capital Kyiv and key cities like Odessa are still unconquered, with Russian troops facing strong resistance from Ukrainian forces and defiant opposition from the civilian population. But some cities, such as the city of Mariupol east of Odessa, have faced days of bombardment. 
The reality of war has come as a shock to residents of Odessa, a vibrant city where design ateliers and coffee outlets specializing in single bean roasts mix with historic architecture and the looming cranes and rail yards of the port.
""To be honest it's really hard for us to understand that right now is a war,"" said 26-year-old internet marketing agency employee, Murager Sharipov. ""Now people are dying somewhere, people are dying and these are our people,"" he said.

Although the civil defence training offered in the centre is basic, Yavtushenko said it had helped prepare mentally for what might come.
""Ukraine is right now alone and people who right now are watching it need to understand the war is here, but it can be in your home, it may be with your friends and in your country.""

DILI (Reuters) -Polls have closed in East Timor after Asia's youngest nation held its fifth presidential election since independence on Saturday, with political stability and economic security at the forefront of voters' minds.
The 16 presidential hopefuls include former resistance fighter and incumbent President Francisco ""Lu Olo"" Guterres as well as independence figure and Nobel laureate Jose Ramos-Horta and a former Catholic priest.
While the nation's independence figures still dominate the field, for the first time there are also four female candidates, including Deputy Prime Minister Armanda Berta Dos Santos. 
""We must choose a new generation so that we can build this country,"" said Jorge Mendonca Soares, 42, after queuing patiently to vote at a polling booth in the capital of Dili on Saturday morning. 
A recent poll by the national university showed that Ramos-Horta, 72, former defence forces commander Lere Anan Timur, and the incumbent Guterres were the favourites.
At the time polls closed at 3 p.m. (0600 GMT), some would-be voters in the capital had been unable to cast ballots due to residency requirements.
""Many cannot vote because they are not registered in the data as residents from outside the city of Dili,"" João Ximenes, head of a voting station in Comoro, told Reuters. He added that two people had been arrested after a protest erupted at the polling station as a result.
Officials said it was not immediately clear how many people were affected by the rule.
Early indications of the frontrunners in the election are expected to emerge late on Saturday. If no candidate wins an outright majority, the vote will proceed to a run-off on April 19 between the top two contenders. 
Approaching twenty years since independence after the end of a brutal occupation by Indonesia, East Timor has for long spells struggled with political instability.
After elections in 2018, Guterres refused to swear in some ministers from the National Congress of the Reconstruction of East Timor (CNRT), a political party led by former Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao.
The ensuing political stalemate continues to this day.
Ramos-Horta, who is backed by Xanana's CNRT party, said earlier this week he was running because he felt the current president had ""exceeded his powers"".
Guterres told reporters after voting on Saturday: ""Whoever runs must be ready to win and be ready to lose ... But I want to say I will win.""
In East Timor's political system, the president appoints a government and has the power to veto ministers or dissolve parliament.
Economic diversification was a major issue in the election, as worries mount over the country's heavy dependence on dwindling supplies of oil and gas.
The role of young voters was also key, with an estimated 20% of voters reaching the voting age of 17 in the past five years and casting their ballots for the first time.
First-time voter Marco de Jesus, 17, said he felt nervous but relaxed after help from polling staff.

""I feel proud to have carried out my function as a voter,"" he said from outside a polling station on Dili's waterfront.
""I hope my choice can bring positive and useful change.""

603,"<span>Mar 19, 2022 07:11AM ET</span>","MARIUPOL, Ukraine (Reuters) - In Mariupol daily life is a series of harrowing escapes from bomb blasts and basic survival rituals, amid the rubble that lies everywhere.
Uncollected corpses wrapped in blankets, coats or any available covering lie in courtyards cleared of debris. Those killed are often buried in common graves.
All around are the blackened shells of the sprawling tower blocks typical of Soviet-era dwellings. Twisted metal on balconies, shattered windows, woods, metal and other wreckage scattered between buildings and in streets. 
Some 400,000 people have been trapped in the strategic port city on the Sea of Azov for more than two weeks, sheltering from heavy bombardment that has severed central supplies of electricity, heating and water, according to local authorities. 
Russia's defence ministry said on Friday that its forces were ""tightening the noose"" around Mariupol and that fighting had reached the city centre.
With no running water or heating, women crouch around make-shift barbecues to cook whatever food they can find. As spring approaches, there is no longer any snow to melt for drinking water.
Residents say no one expected this in post-Soviet Ukraine -- an unrelenting onslaught from what was once thought of as a ""fraternal"" Russia -- though some have lived through other upheavals that jolted the country back under Soviet rule.
""She had a Russian passport, Russian citizenship, lots of medals,"" said a downcast Alexander, 57, gesturing toward the place in the open where the body of his wife's mother lies for now.
""My mother-in-law was born in 1936. She survived through the siege of Leningrad,"" he said, referring to the 900-day Nazi encirclement of the city now known as St. Petersburg. ""She was an honoured worker of fish farming in the Russian Federation. So that is where she is.""
Officials in Mariupol say 2,500 people have died since Russian forces poured across the Ukrainian border on Feb. 24. 
Donetsk region governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Friday that around 35,000 had managed to leave the city in recent days, many on foot or in convoys of private cars during the rare moments when Russian shelling subsides.
Those left occasionally verge on despair -- the cold and the anxiety taking their toll.
""I feel terrible. I don't want to blame anyone, but I'm disgusted and scared. And I'm cold,"" said one woman, Olga, who wore a pink hat under a hoodie and a big coat. ""I just don't have any words. I wasn't ready for my life to become like this.""
Russia denies targeting civilians and has accused Kyiv of using them as human shields, something Ukrainian officials deny.
Mariupol is seen as a strategic prize for the Russian invaders to create a bridge between Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014, and two separatist enclaves in eastern Ukraine.
A maternity hospital was bombed last week, sending patients fleeing into the street. A theatre used to shelter families forced from their homes was also struck - despite the word ""children"" being written outside in letters big enough to be read by pilots.
A sense of solidarity among residents fearing for their lives has taken hold. Strangers take in other strangers.
""We spent two days in the basement. She couldn't move. I thought she wouldn't survive,"" said one middle-aged resident, gesturing to her elderly mother.
""Then we managed to leave the basement. This is the first time I have seen these people. But they sheltered us. And here we are sitting here, covered in blankets. It's very cold here. We just want to go home.""
Children, look on, uncomprehending.
""Don't worry, my little darling. Everything will be all right,"" said one unsmiling young mother, hugging her two school-age children.

Out in the courtyard, groups of men milled about aimlessly, surveying the shattered buildings.
And around them lay the bodies. The only identifying markers are scraps of paper, appended to makeshift crosses, each bearing a name and a date of birth and death. And no indication when they will be collected.

(Reuters) -Three Russian cosmonauts arrived safely at the International Space Station (ISS) on Friday, docking their Soyuz capsule with the outpost for a mission that continues a 20-year shared Russian-U.S. presence in orbit despite tensions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The arrival of the latest cosmonaut team - warmly welcomed by four Americans, two Russians and a German crewmate already aboard - came a day after the European Space Agency (ESA) announced it had suspended a joint robotic rover mission to Mars with Russia due to the Ukraine conflict.
The rendezvous with the space station capped a flight of three hours and 10 minutes following liftoff of the Soyuz spacecraft from Russia's Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
""Congratulations on the successful docking,"" a voice from Russia's mission control said moments later, according to an English translator speaking during a live NASA webcast of the event.
Link-up of the space vehicles took place as the Soyuz and space station flew some 250 miles (400 km) above eastern Kazakhstan, a NASA commentator said.
About 2-1/2 hours later, after the passageway between the station and Soyuz was pressurized, two sets of hatches were opened and the three smiling Soyuz astronauts, dressed in yellow flight suits, floated head-first, one by one, into the ISS.
They were greeted warmly with hugs and handshakes by all seven existing space station occupants who were waiting for them on the other side of the short corridor. 
The Soyuz team, just beginning a science mission set to last 6-1/2 months, was led by commander Oleg Artemyev, accompanied spaceflight rookies Denis Matveev and Sergey Korsakov.
They will be replacing three current ISS crew members scheduled to fly back to Earth on March 30 - cosmonauts Pyotr Dubrov and Anton Shkaplerov and U.S. astronaut Mark Vande Hei.
Vande Hei will have logged a NASA record-breaking 355 days in orbit by the time he returns to Kazakhstan aboard a Soyuz capsule with his two cosmonaut colleagues.
Remaining aboard the space station with the newcomers until the next rotation in a couple of months are three NASA astronauts - Tom Marshburn, Raja Chari and Kayla Barron - and German crewmate Matthias Maurer of the European Space Agency.
Those four crew members arrived together in November aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon craft launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida to begin a six-month stint in orbit.
Launched in 1998, the research platform has been continuously occupied since November 2000 while operated by a U.S.-Russian-led partnership including Canada, Japan and 11 European countries.
According to NASA, Friday's arrival marked the first time a spacecraft docked to the station's newly added Prichal module, a spherical-shaped unit launched to ISS and attached to the outpost's Russian segment in November 2021.
COLLABORATION TESTED
The durability of U.S.-Russian collaboration in space is being tested by heightened antagonism between the two former Cold War adversaries over Russia's three-week-old invasion of Ukraine.
As part of U.S. economic sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin's government last month, U.S. President Joe Biden ordered high-tech export restrictions against Moscow that he said were designed to ""degrade"" Russia's aerospace industry, including its space program. 
Dmitry Rogozin, director-general of Russian space agency Roscosmos, then lashed out in a series of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) posts suggesting the U.S. sanctions could ""destroy"" ISS teamwork and lead to the space station falling out of orbit.
A week later, Rogozin announced that Russia would stop supplying or servicing Russian-made rocket engines used by two U.S. aerospace NASA suppliers, suggesting U.S. astronauts could use ""broomsticks"" to get to orbit.
At about the same time, Russia said it ceased joint ISS research with Germany and forced the cancellation of a British satellite launch from Baikonur.
The Roscosmos chief also said last month that Russia was suspending its cooperation with European launch operations at the European Spaceport in French Guiana.
On Thursday, the ESA announced that it would be impossible to continue cooperating with Russia on the ExoMars mission, which had called for a Russian rocket to launch a European-made rover to Mars later this year. Rogozin responded by saying Russia would start work on its own Mars mission. 

The space station was born in part from a foreign policy initiative to improve American-Russian relations following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Cold War hostility that spurred the original U.S.-Soviet space race.
Rogozin's recent actions have prompted some in the U.S. space industry to rethink the NASA-Roscosmos partnership. NASA officials have said that U.S. and Russian ISS crew members, while aware of events on Earth, were still working together professionally and that geopolitical tensions had not infected the space station.

DIPLOMACY
* Biden warned China's Xi of ""consequences"", which the White House said could include sanctions, if Beijing gave material support to Russia's invasion. Both sides called for a diplomatic solution to the crisis in its fourth week.
* Ukraine expects progress on its EU membership bid within months, Zelenskiy said after a call with the head of EU executive, Ursula von der Leyen.
FIGHTING 
* As the prolonged assault has reduced much of Mariupol to rubble, Ukraine's defence ministry said it had ""temporarily"" lost access to the Azov Sea, which connects to the Black Sea and would be a major loss for Ukraine.
* ""Russian forces have made minimal progress this week,"" Britain said. It said Russian attempts to surround Kyiv and Mykolaiv have been pushed back while heavy Russian shelling of encircled cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol continued.
CIVILIAN TOLL
* The U.N. rights office reported 816 confirmed civilian deaths. Kyiv officials said 222 people had been killed in the capital, including 60 civilians and four children.
* Ukraine's food supply chains are breaking down and the conflict is leading to ""collateral hunger"" around the world, the U.N. food aid agency warned.
* Border crossings from Ukraine have slowed but could rise again if conditions in the west of the country worsen, the U.N refugee agency said. The U.N. says 3.27 million have fled, with 2 million displaced inside the country.
ECONOMY AND MARKETS
* Roman Abramovich transferred a company to a director of Chelsea Football Club the day Russia invaded Ukraine, corporate filings seen by Reuters showed. It was the second time the Russian tycoon, who is trying to sell the English soccer team, moved assets to a close associate before Britain and the EU imposed sanctions on him.
* Moscow averted a debt default with interest payments on two dollar bonds but faces a busy payment schedule in coming weeks.

QUOTES
""I want everyone to hear me now, especially in Moscow. The time has come for a meeting, it is time to talk... Otherwise, Russia's losses will be such that it will take you several generations to recover,"" Zelenskiy said in a video address.

Tapachula, a city on the border with Guatemala, has been the site of previous clashes between authorities and migrants who are waiting for papers to be able to freely travel through the country.
The INM said some of its staff members were hurt in a ""violent eruption"" caused by ""pseudo-leaders"" among migrants. Some of the INM's facilities were also damaged, it said in a statement. 

Operations were suspended until further notice because the safety of its property and staff could not be assured, the INM said.
Every year, hundreds of thousands of mostly Central American migrants flee violence and poverty but must wait for permits to cross Mexico and reach the United States, or responses to their asylum requests to stay in Mexico.

China says Taiwan, which it views as a breakaway province to be brought back to the fold, by force if necessary, is the most sensitive and important issue in its relations with the United States.
Washington, which is seeking Beijing's help in restoring peace in Ukraine after Russia's Feb. 24 invasion, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taipei but is Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier.
""Some individuals in the United States are sending the wrong signals to pro-independence forces in Taiwan, and that's very dangerous,"" Xi told Biden on a video call. 
""If the Taiwan issue is not handled properly, it will have a subversive impact on the relationship between the two countries.""
China sailed its aircraft carrier Shandong through the Taiwan Strait, shadowed by a U.S. destroyer, on Friday, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters, just hours before the Chinese and U.S. presidents were due to talk.
A White House statement said Biden reiterated in the call with Xi that U.S. policy on Taiwan has not changed, and emphasized that Washington ""continues to oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo.""
China has over the past two years stepped up its military activity near the island to assert its sovereignty claims. 
""(We) hope the U.S. side will pay adequate attention"" to the issue, Xi told Biden.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry expressed thanks to Biden for his ""emphasis on maintaining the status quo of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, as well as his firm support for Taiwan's security"".
It called on China to take concrete actions and condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Taiwan, which rejects China's sovereignty claims, has joined in Western-led sanctions against Russia and sent humanitarian aid for Ukrainian refugees.

Xi also told Biden that the war in Ukraine must end as soon as possible, according to Chinese state media.
All parties should jointly support the Russia-Ukraine dialogue while the United States and NATO should also conduct talks with Russia to solve the ""crux"" of the Ukraine crisis, Xi said.

The 88-year-old congressman died while traveling home to Alaska, his office said.
""Don Young's legacy as a fighter for the state will live on, as will his fundamental goodness and honor. We will miss him dearly,"" the statement said.
His office did not give the cause of death. The Anchorage Daily News reported that Young lost consciousness on a flight from Los Angeles to Seattle and could not be resuscitated. The newspaper report cited Jack Ferguson, who had served as Young's chief of staff.
Young was Alaska's only member in the House of Representatives. The longest-serving member of the current U.S. Congress, according to his website, he represented Alaska for 25 terms and last year he filed to enter this November's election.
""I'm incredibly saddened to hear of the passing of Don Young,"" U.S. Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 2 Republican in the House, said in a statement.
""He was a passionate champion of his home state of Alaska, but he was also a mentor who, as the Dean of the House, had more institutional knowledge of Congress than anyone I know,"" Scalise said.
U.S. Representative Dean Phillips, a Democrat from Minnesota, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR): ""His fiercely independent voice for Alaska and one of a kind wit and character will be missed.""
Young was born in California in 1933 and moved to Alaska in 1959, shortly after statehood.

In Congress, he was known for directing billions of dollars of federal money to Alaska, the largest state in the country but with one of the smallest populations. 
In late 2020, Young was diagnosed with COVID-19 after he had earlier ridiculed the disease as a ""beer virus.""

Assad met Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan who ""stressed that Syria is a fundamental pillar of Arab security, and that the UAE is keen to strengthen cooperation with it"", Emirati state news agency (WAM) reported. 
Assad's only trips outside Syria during the war have been to Iran and Russia, close allies whose military support helped him turn the tide against opponents who had been backed by governments including U.S.-allied Gulf states. 
A video posted by WAM showed Assad smiling as he stood alongside Sheikh Mohammed in front of the Syrian and Emirati flags, as well as gesticulating and smiling during talks.
The United States has opposed efforts to normalise ties with Assad or rehabilitate him until progress is made towards a political solution to the conflict, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people since spiralling out of an uprising against Assad.
Washington expressed concern in November when the UAE foreign minister visited Damascus and met Assad.
But Washington has eroded its political capital with both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi by not heeding their concerns about regional rival Iran, ending its support for their war in Yemen and slapping conditions on U.S. weapons sales to the Gulf states. 
WAM said the sides emphasized ""the preservation of the territorial integrity of Syria and the withdrawal of foreign forces"" from the fragmented country where Russia, Iran, Turkey and the United States all have a military presence.
They also discussed political and humanitarian support for Syria and its people to reach a peaceful solution to all the challenges it faces, WAM reported.
WAM said Sheikh Mohammed ""expressed his wishes that this visit will pave the way for goodness, peace and stability to prevail in Syria and the entire region"". Assad briefed him on the latest developments in Syria, it said.
Assad was seen off by Sheikh Mohammed at the airport.
Assad also met Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the Syrian presidency said in a statement. 
The meetings marked the latest in a series of diplomatic overtures that point to a shift underway in the Middle East where several Arab countries are reviving ties with Assad.

Signs of rapprochement between Assad and Arab states grew last year, including a phone call with King Abdullah of Jordan, another U.S. ally.
Analysts say political and economic considerations loom large for Arab states that are seeking closer ties with Assad, including how to counter the influence of Iran and Turkey.

610,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 07:51PM ET</span>","KYIV/LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Russia said its forces were ""tightening the noose"" around the besieged Ukrainian port of Mariupol on Friday and concern grew over mass civilian casualties as the United States again warned China against aiding Moscow in its invasion.
Russia's advance in Ukraine has largely stalled, and its troops, frustrated by fierce Ukrainian resistance, have blasted residential areas to rubble. On Friday, missiles landed near Lviv, a western city where thousands have fled for refuge. 
In Mariupol, the scene of heavy bombardment, officials estimated 80% of the city's homes had been damaged and that 1,000 people may still be trapped in makeshift bomb shelters beneath a destroyed theatre.
Nearly 5,000 Ukrainians were evacuated from Mariupol on Friday, officials said, and residents reported seeing dead bodies along the roadside as they fled the city.
""We were careful and didn't want the children to see the bodies, so we tried to shield their eyes,"" said Nick Osychenko, the CEO of a Mariupol TV station who fled the city with six members of his family. 
""We were nervous the whole journey. It was frightening, just frightening.""
Ukraine said it had rescued 130 people from the basement of a Mariupol theatre that was flattened by Russian strikes two days ago. Russia denied hitting the theatre and says it does not target civilians.
China is the one big power that has yet to condemn Russia's assault, and Washington fears Beijing may be considering giving Moscow financial and military support, something that both Russia and China deny.
In a video call that lasted around two hours, U.S. President Joe Biden warned China's President Xi Jinping on Friday of ""implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia"" in Ukraine, the White House said. 
The White House later said that sanctioning Beijing, the world's largest exporter, was an option, though it did not detail what constituted material support.
Chinese state media quoted Xi as saying: ""The Ukraine crisis is something that we don't want to see,"" adding that the call was requested by the U.S. side.
NATO should hold talks with Russia to resolve the factors behind the conflict, Chinese state media quoted Xi as saying, without assigning blame to Russia for the invasion.
'STARVATION'
The mayor of Mariupol confirmed to the BBC that fighting had reached the centre of the city, where some 400,000 people have been trapped for over two weeks, sheltering from bombardment that has cut electricity, heating and water supply.
Regional Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said around 35,000 people had managed to leave the city in recent days, many on foot or in convoys of private cars, but near-constant shelling was preventing humanitarian aid from getting in.
Oksana Zalavska, 42, fled Mariupol two days ago after staying in an overcrowded bomb shelter where adults ate one tiny meal a day as rations were low.
""Now I know everything about starvation in 2022,"" she said.
French President Emmanuel Macron told Putin he was extremely concerned about the situation in Mariupol while the Kremlin said it was doing everything possible to protect civilians.
Jakob Kern, emergency coordinator for the crisis at the U.N. World Food Programme (WFP), said Ukraine's ""food supply chain is falling apart"" with insecurity and fear of attack hindering the movement of goods. 
WFP buys nearly half of its wheat from Ukraine to feed people in global crisis zones, and Kern said the war could cause ""collateral hunger"" in poor countries worldwide.
PUTIN RALLY
At the start of the fourth week of Putin's attempt to subdue what he calls an artificial state undeserving of nationhood, Ukraine's elected government is still standing and Russian forces have not captured a single big city.
With Russia looking to regain the initiative, three missiles landed at an airport near Lviv, a western city where hundreds of thousands thought they had found refuge far from Ukraine's battlefields.
Putin promised tens of thousands of people waving Russian flags at a soccer stadium in Moscow that the ""special operation"" would succeed.
""We know what we need to do, how to do it and at what cost. And we will absolutely accomplish all of our plans,"" Putin said, adding that, when needed, Russian soldiers ""shield each other from bullets with their bodies like brothers"".
Russian troops have taken heavy losses while assaulting urban areas, sending more than 3 million refugees fleeing over Ukraine's western border.
Ukraine said its troops had prevented Russia from making any fresh advances on Friday and the Russians had problems with food, fuel and communications. Britain said Russian forces had made minimal progress this week.
Russia has been intensively shelling eastern Ukrainian cities, especially Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol, and there have been nightly deadly missile attacks on Kyiv, where Ukrainian forces have halted troop columns outside the city.
Debris from a missile blew a large crater in the ground in the middle of a residential block where a school was also located in northern Kyiv, shattering hundreds of windows and leaving debris scattered around the complex.
At least one person was killed, emergency services said. Kyiv's mayor said 19 people were injured including four children.
""This is a war crime by Putin,"" said Lyudmila Nikolaenko, visiting her son, who lived in one of the apartments hit. ""They say they aren't hitting regular people, they say we are firing at ourselves.""

Kyiv and Moscow reported progress in talks this week towards a political formula that would guarantee Ukraine security protection outside of the NATO alliance.
But Ukraine said the need for an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of Russian troops remained unchanged, and both sides accused each other on Friday of dragging out the talks.

611,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 07:47PM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) -Russian President Vladimir Putin justified the invasion of Ukraine before a packed soccer stadium on Friday but coverage of his speech on state television was unexpectedly interrupted by what the Kremlin said was a technical problem with a server.
Speaking on a stage at the centre of Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium, Putin promised to tens of thousands of people waving Russian flags and chanting ""Russia, Russia, Russia"" that all of the Kremlin's aims would be achieved.
""We know what we need to do, how to do it and at what cost. And we will absolutely accomplish all of our plans,"" Putin, 69, told the rally from a stage decked out with slogans such as ""For a world without Nazism"" and ""For our president"".
Many of the Russian slogans used at the rally incorporated the ""Z"" symbol that Russian forces have used as a motif in Ukraine. One read ""Za Putina"" - ""for Putin"".
Dressed in a turtleneck and coat, Putin said the soldiers fighting in what Russia calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine had demonstrated the unity of Russia. 
""Shoulder to shoulder, they help each other, support each other and when needed they shield each other from bullets with their bodies like brothers. Such unity we have not had for a long time,"" Putin said.
As he was talking, state television briefly cut away from his speech mid-sentence and showed earlier pre-recorded footage of patriotic songs, but he later appeared back on state television. 
RIA news agency cited Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying a technical fault on a server was the reason state television had suddenly cut away from Putin.
It was not immediately clear why the server issue led to such an abrupt and unusual interruption.
THUNDERSTORMS 
Putin says the operation in Ukraine was necessary because the United States was using the country to threaten Russia and Russia had to defend against the ""genocide"" of Russian-speaking people by Ukraine.
Ukraine says it is fighting for its existence and that Putin's claims of genocide are nonsense. The West says claims it wants to rip Russia apart are fiction.
Before Putin spoke, Russia's stirring national anthem, with the words ""Russia is our sacred state"" boomed out across the stands of the stadium used in the 2018 Soccer World Cup along with more modern pop hits such as ""Made in the U.S.S.R."".
Putin's favourite Russian band, Lyube, sang patriotic songs about war, sacrifice and the honour of those fighting for Russia. 
Pan-Slavist poetry by Fyodor Tyutchev, whose verses warned Russians that they would always be considered slaves of the Enlightenment by Europeans, was read out.
Russia has lost any illusions about ever relying on the West and Moscow will never accept a world order dominated by the United States which is acting like a sheriff seeking to call all the shots in a saloon bar, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said.

Putin, speaking as U.S. President Joe Biden talked with Chinese President Xi Jinping by telephone about the Ukraine crisis, quoted Russia's 18th century naval commander, Fyodor Ushakov.
""He once said that these thunderstorms will bring Russia glory,"" Putin said. ""That is the way it was then, that is the way it is now and it will always be that way.""

WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden warned Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Friday of 'consequences' if Beijing gave material support to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the White House said, while both sides stressed the need for a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
While the White House did not detail what those consequences could be, or how the U.S. would define ""material support"", press secretary Jen Psaki indicated China's massive trade flows could be impacted. 
""Sanctions are certainly one tool in the tool box,"" Psaki told a regular news briefing when asked whether China, the world's largest exporter, could face trade tariffs or sanctions.
Speaking after a nearly two-hour video call between Biden and Xi, Psaki said the United States would communicate any consequences directly to Beijing ""with our European partners and counterparts.""
In the call, which came at a time of deepening acrimony between the world's two biggest powers, Biden detailed efforts of the United States and its allies to respond to the invasion of Ukraine, including by imposing costs on Russia.
""He described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians,"" the White House said in statement, adding that Biden ""underscored his support for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis.""
A senior U.S. official briefing reporters on the call said Biden communicated that Beijing would face consequences not just from the United States but the wider world.
""The president really wasn't making specific requests of China,"" the official said. ""I think our view is that China will make its own decisions.""
China's foreign ministry said Xi told Biden the war in Ukraine must end as soon as possible and called on NATO nations to hold a dialogue with Moscow. He did not, however, assign blame to Russia for the invasion, based on Beijing's statements about the call.
""The top priorities now are to continue dialogue and negotiations, avoid civilian casualties, prevent a humanitarian crisis, cease fighting and end the war as soon as possible,"" Xi said.
Xi advocated Russia-Ukraine dialogue and negotiations, and suggested Washington and NATO conduct talks with Russia to solve the ""crux"" of the Ukraine crisis and resolve the security concerns of both Russia and Ukraine.
""The Ukraine crisis is something that we don't want to see,"" Chinese state media quoted Xi saying in the call, which it said was requested by the U.S. side.
Xi warned against sanctions.
""Sweeping and indiscriminate sanctions would only make the people suffer. If further escalated, they could trigger serious crises in global economy and trade, finance, energy, food, and industrial and supply chains, crippling the already languishing world economy and causing irrevocable losses,"" the ministry quoted him as saying.
On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington was concerned China was considering directly assisting Russia with military equipment for use in Ukraine, something Beijing has denied.
Washington is also worried that China could help Russia circumvent Western economic sanctions. 
Targeting Beijing with the sort of extensive economic sanctions already imposed on Russia would have potentially dire consequences for the United States and the world, given that China is the world's second-largest economy and the largest exporter.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, now in its fourth week, has killed hundreds of civilians, reduced city areas to rubble and sparked a humanitarian crisis as millions flee the country.
China has refused to condemn Russia's action in Ukraine or call it an invasion.
Russia fired missiles at an airport near Lviv on Friday, a city where hundreds of thousands had sought refuge far from Ukraine's battlefields, as Moscow tries to regain the initiative in its stalled campaign against Ukraine, which it calls a special military operation. 
U.S.-CHINA TENSIONS 
Ukraine has added a new front in a U.S.-Chinese relationship already at its worst level in decades, further deflating Biden's initial hopes of easing a wide range of disputes by using a personal connection with Xi that predates his term in office. 
Biden has been anxious to avoid a new ""Cold War"" with China, seeking instead to define the relationship as one of competitive coexistence, but China's ""no-limits"" strategic partnership with Russia announced last month and its stance on Ukraine has called that into question.
Ahead of the call, a Chinese aircraft carrier sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait on Friday. The USS Ralph Johnson, an Arleigh Burke guided missile destroyer, shadowed the carrier at least partly on its route.

China claims Taiwan as its own, and has stepped up its military activity near the islands, alarming Taipei and Washington amid concerns that Beijing might follow Russia's example and use force. 
While saying it recognizes Ukraine's sovereignty, Beijing has repeatedly said that Russia has legitimate security concerns that should be addressed and urged a diplomatic solution to the conflict.

Some 400,000 people have been trapped in the strategic port city for over two weeks, sheltering from heavy bombardment that has severed central supplies of electricity, heating and water, according to local authorities.
Russia denies bombing residential areas or targeting civilians. 
Speaking on national television, Donetsk region governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said around 35,000 had managed to leave the city in recent days, many leaving on foot or in convoys of private cars. 
""The way out of blockaded Mariupol begins with residents getting out either on foot or in their own transport,"" Kyrylenko said, adding that some cars were leaving without enough fuel to reach the nearest villages or towns.
He said near-constant shelling was preventing the authorities from opening humanitarian corridors to supply aid and food to the city and to evacuate women, children and those most in need.

Russia and Ukraine have traded blame for the failure of the corridors.
The city council warned Mariupol was running out of its last reserves of food and water last Sunday and has said it is unable to properly treat or tally casualties from the shelling. The Ukrainian authorities estimate over 2,500 residents have been killed in Mariupol since the start of the war on Feb. 24.

""I've seen nothing which suggests that the original intent of Putin has significantly altered,"" the official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""Therefore ... the difference between what was planned, what is being executed is at the moment one of timing, and they have failed to achieve their objectives in the time that they set out in their original objectives and their original plan.
""I've seen no evidence yet that the overall intent has changed.""
More than three weeks after launching its invasion, in what Moscow calls a ""special operation"", the Russian advance has stalled and failed to capture a single big city.
The Western official said Russian forces could sustain bombardments on Ukrainian cities by increasingly using unguided missiles as they moved towards a strategy of attrition.
""Their ability to use that sort of scale of artillery, whilst not infinite, is really, really significant,"" the official said.
""There is an enormous amount of artillery ammunition which the Russian forces hold, and it may be a logistical challenge for them to get all of it in place. 

""But if they're able to bring those supplies forward, then they could mount that sort of artillery bombardment for a very, very considerable period of time.""
Asked whether Ramzan Kadyrov, a Putin ally and the leader of Russia's Chechnya region, was in Ukraine as he had said on his Telegram social media channel, the official said it was assessed that he was still in Grozny.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - NASA's next-generation moon rocket began a highly anticipated, slow-motion journey out of its assembly plant en route to the launch pad in Florida on Thursday for a final round of tests in the coming weeks that will determine how soon the spacecraft can fly.
Rollout of the 32-story-tall Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and its Orion crew capsule marks a key milestone in U.S. plans for renewed lunar exploration after years of setbacks, and the public's first glimpse of a space vehicle more than a decade in development.
The process of moving the 5.75-million-pound SLS-Orion spacecraft out of its Kennedy Space Center Vehicle Assembly Building began shortly after 5:30 p.m. EDT (2130 GMT) under clear skies at Cape Canaveral. A nearly full moon rose about 90 minutes later.
The SLS-Orion, which cost some $37 billion to develop including ground systems, constitutes the backbone of the NASA's Artemis program, aimed at returning astronauts to the moon and establishing a long-term lunar colony as a precursor to eventual human exploration of Mars. 
The megarocket - standing taller than the Statue of Liberty - was being slowly trundled to Launch Pad 39B atop an enormous tractor-crawler roughly the size of a baseball diamond, creeping at less than a mile per hour on a 4-mile (6.5-km) journey expected to take about 11 hours. The crawler is operated by a 25-person crew.
The spectacle was carried live on NASA Television and the space agency's website. A band from the University of Central Florida played the National Anthem as the rollout began in front of throngs of employees and other onlookers gathered outside to watch the event.
""Ladies and gentlemen, the world's most powerful rocket, right here,"" NASA chief Bill Nelson told the crowd, gesturing toward the spacecraft minutes after the rollout started. ""Humanity will soon embark on a new era of exploration.""
Among those in the crowd was former astronaut Tom Stafford, who orbited the moon as commander of Apollo 10 in 1969, NASA said in its webcast.
The rollout, paving the way for NASA's uncrewed Artemis I mission around the moon and back, was delayed last month by a series of technical hurdles the space agency said it has since resolved as teams readied the rocket for the launch pad.
DRESS REHEARSAL FOR LAUNCH
Once secured at the pad, the SLS-Orion ship is to be prepared for a critical pre-flight test called a ""wet dress rehearsal,"" which will begin on April 3 and take about two days to complete. 
Engineers plan to fully load the SLS core fuel tanks with super-cooled liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant and conduct a simulated launch countdown - stopping seconds before the rocket's four R-25 engines would ignite - in a top-to-bottom evaluation of the entire system.
The outcome will determine when NASA will attempt its first launch of the rocket and capsule combination, a mission designated Artemis I. 
The U.S. Apollo program sent six manned missions to the moon from 1969 to 1972, the only crewed spaceflights yet to reach the lunar surface. Artemis, named for the twin sister of Apollo in Greek mythology, seeks to land the first woman and the first person of color on the moon, among others.
But NASA has several steps to take before it gets there, starting with a successful Artemis I flight, planned as an uncrewed journey 40,000 miles (64,374 km) beyond the moon and back. 
The Orion capsule will carry a simulated crew of three - a male mannequin named ""Commander Moonikin Campos,"" in honor of the late NASA engineer Arturo Campos, who played a key role in bringing Apollo 13 back to Earth after an in-flight accident, and two female mannequins. All will be fitted with sensors to measure radiation levels.
NASA has said it was reviewing potential Artemis I launch windows in April and May, but the timeline could slip depending on results of the dress rehearsal.
Eight or nine days after those tests are completed and the propellant is drained from the rocket, the ship will be rolled back to the assembly building to await the setting of a launch date.
NASA announced in November that it would aim to achieve its first human lunar landing of Artemis as early as 2025, preceded by an a crewed Artemis flight around the moon and back in 2024.
Both of those missions, and others to follow, will be flown to space by the SLS, which surpasses the Apollo-era Saturn V as the world's largest, most powerful launch vehicle, and the first exploration-class rocket built by NASA for human spaceflight since Saturn V.

Nelson also called Artemis an ""economic engine"" that in 2019 alone generated $14 billion in commerce and supported 70,000 U.S. jobs.

China claims democratically ruled Taiwan as its own territory, and has over the past two years stepped up its military activity near the island to assert its sovereignty claims, alarming Taipei and Washington.
A source with direct knowledge of the matter, who was not authorised to speak to the media and spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the carrier Shandong sailed close to the Taiwan-controlled island of Kinmen, which sits directly opposite the Chinese city of Xiamen.
""Around 10:30 a.m. the CV-17 appeared around 30 nautical miles to the southwest of Kinmen, and was photographed by a passenger on a civilian flight,"" the source said, referring to the Shandong's official service number.
The USS Ralph Johnson, an Arleigh Burke guided missile destroyer, shadowed the carrier at least partly on its route. The Shandong did not have aircraft on its deck and sailed north through the strait, the source added.
Taiwan also sent warships to keep an eye on the situation, the source said.
Taiwan's Defence Ministry, in a brief statement, confirmed the passage of the Shandong but gave no details other than to say its forces have a ""full grasp"" of what China's ships and aircraft do in the Taiwan Strait.
U.S. Navy spokesperson Lt. Mark Langford said the Ralph Johnson had ""conducted a routine Taiwan Strait transit March 17 (local time) through international waters in accordance with international law"". He did not elaborate.
Chinese Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian referred questions to the Defence Ministry - which did not respond to a request for comment - but said the Shandong has a ""routine training schedule"". 
""We should not associate this with the communication between the heads of state of China and the United States. You may think it is too sensitive. What is sensitive is you, not the Taiwan Strait,"" Zhao told reporters in Beijing.
'PROVOCATIVE' TIMING
The sailing happened about 12 hours before U.S. President Joe Biden is due to speak to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.
The source described the timing of the Shandong's movement so close to that call as ""provocative"" and that it was unusual it sailed during daylight hours, with previous missions happening at night.
Last April, China's navy said a carrier group, lead by the Liaoning, the country's first aircraft carrier put into active service, was carrying out routine drills in the waters near Taiwan.
Taiwan is already in a heightened state of alert due to the Ukraine war, wary of China taking advantage of the situation to make a move of its own, though there have been no signs Beijing is about to mount any kind of military strike.
Lo Chih-cheng, a senior lawmaker from Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party called the Shandong's transit a ""very provocative message"" when countries in the region are already alarmed by the war in Ukraine and hours before the Biden-Xi call. 
""Tensions across the Taiwan Strait won't rise sharply because of this, but it will likely cause neighbouring countries to raise their military alert level,"" he told Reuters.
China says Taiwan is the most sensitive and important issue in its relations with the United States. Washington has no formal diplomatic ties with Taipei, but is Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier.
Taiwan rejects China's sovereignty claims and has repeatedly vows to defend its freedom and democracy.
Kuo Yu-jen, a security expert at Taiwan's National Sun Yat-sen University, said the Shandong was likely to be on its way up to northern China for next month's celebrations marking the founding of China's navy.
""It was carrying no aircraft and had no frigates"" accompanying, he added. 
The Shandong is China's newest aircraft carrier, commissioned in 2019. 

In December 2019, shortly before presidential and parliamentary elections in Taiwan, it sailed through the Taiwan Strait, a move condemned by Taiwan as attempted intimidation.
Taiwan's air force also scrambles aircraft almost daily to see off Chinese warplanes flying into Taiwan's air defence identification zone, mostly to the southwestern part of the strait at the top end of the South China Sea.

617,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 12:50AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Russia accused Canada on Thursday of childishly annotating a letter it sent at the United Nations seeking support for its draft resolution on providing aid access and civilian protection in Ukraine, which Ottawa reacted to with pointed comments.
In a spat on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Canada's UN mission added multiple remarks to the March 16 missive from Russia's U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia.
The U.N. Security Council will no longer vote on Friday on the draft resolution.
Diplomats said it would have failed with most of the 15-member council likely to abstain from a vote on it because it did not address accountability or acknowledge Russia's invasion of Ukraine or push for an end to the fighting or a withdrawal of Russian troops.
In the spat on Twitter, Canada's UN mission annotated one part of the Russian letter that read: ""Like other members of the international community, we are gravely concerned about its deterioration.""
Canada's UN mission crossed out the first few words and changed the rest to read: ""We are not gravely concerned about its deterioration,"" and inserted at the end ""because we are the primary cause."" 
In a later section, Canada asked: ""Do you think the UN membership actually believes this?"" On the final page Canada suggested part of an alternative end: ""We want you to know just how little we care about the human life we have destroyed."" 
Dmitry Polyanskiy, first deputy permanent representative of Russia to the United Nations, hit back on Thursday:
""Thank you @CanadaONU for this kindergarten-level Russophobic libel!"" he wrote on Twitter. 
""It only shows that your diplomatic skills and good manners are at lowest ebb and gives an idea why your country’s bid for a non-permanent seat in #SecurityCouncil was voted down twice in 20yrs by UN membership,"" Polyanskiy said, adding a thumbs-down emoji. 

Relations between Russia and several Western nations continue to plummet to new lows since the Kremlin launched its invasion of Ukraine.
Russian President Vladimir Putin says he is engaged in a ""special military operation.""

(Reuters) -Australia's competition watchdog filed a lawsuit against Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) owner Meta Platforms on Friday, alleging the social media giant failed to prevent scammers using its platform to promote fake ads featuring well-known people.
The advertisements, which endorsed investment in cryptocurrency or money-making schemes, could have misled Facebook users into believing they were promoted by famous Australians, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) said.
The lawsuit filed in the Federal Court also alleges Facebook ""aided and abetted or was knowingly concerned in false or misleading conduct and representations by the advertisers,"" the ACCC said in a statement.
""The essence of our case is that Meta is responsible for these ads that it publishes on its platform,"" ACCC Chair Rod Sims said. ""It is alleged that Meta was aware ... scam ads were being displayed on Facebook but did not take sufficient steps to address the issue.""
Meta said any ads that scammed people out of money or misled users violated its policies and the company uses technology to detect and block such posts, adding it had ""cooperated with the ACCC's investigation into this matter to date.""
""We will review the recent filing by the ACCC and intend to defend the proceedings,"" a Meta spokesperson said in an emailed statement, declining to comment further as the case was before court. 
The ACCC said the ads used images of several Australian business leaders, TV hosts and politicians and contained links to fake media articles that included quotes attributed to the personalities.
Users who signed up were contacted by scammers to convince them to deposit funds into the fake schemes, the regulator said.
""We are aware of a consumer who lost more than A$650,000 ($480,000) due to one of these scams ... this is disgraceful,"" Sims said. 
Australian iron ore magnate Andrew Forrest, chairman of Fortescue Metals Group (OTC:FSUGY), launched criminal proceedings against Facebook last month over scam ads, including ones using his image to promote cryptocurrency schemes.

The corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), usually handles financial fraud complaints against companies. The ACCC, which is seeking financial penalties, said it was given temporary powers to file the lawsuit. 
Facebook earlier this week announced a programme to help train Australian political candidates and influencers on cyber security to stop the spread of potential misinformation during campaigning for the country's upcoming federal election.

KYIV/LVIV/WASHINGTON, Ukraine (Reuters) -As Russian troops appeared to stall in their advance on Ukrainian cities, the United States voiced concern on Thursday that China might assist Moscow with military equipment as the war entered its fourth week. 
Ukraine's capital Kyiv came under renewed Russian shelling as rescuers in the besieged port of Mariupol dug survivors from the rubble of bombed buildings. Officials from the two countries met again for peace talks but said their positions remained far apart. 
Western sources and Ukrainian officials said Russia's assault has faltered since its troops invaded on Feb. 24, further dashing Moscow's expectations of a swift victory and the removal of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's government. 
Despite battleground setbacks and punitive sanctions by the West, Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown little sign of relenting. His government says it is counting on China to help Russia withstand blows to its economy. 
The United States, which this week announced $800 million in new military aid to Kyiv, is concerned that Beijing is ""considering directly assisting Russia with military equipment to use in Ukraine,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. 
President Joe Biden will make clear to China's President Xi Jiping in a call Friday that Beijing ""will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia's aggression, and we will not hesitate to impose costs,"" Blinken told reporters. 
China has refused to condemn Russia's action in Ukraine or call it an invasion. It says it recognises Ukraine's sovereignty but that Russia has legitimate security concerns that should be addressed.
While the United States says it wants to avoid direct confrontation with Russia, Chinese military aid to Moscow would pit Washington and Beijing -- the world's two biggest powers -- on opposite sides of the largest assault on a European state since World War Two.
SIDES FAR APART
The war has settled into a grinding pattern of sieges of cities, with Ukrainian officials reporting Russian attacks on schools, hospitals and cultural facilities.
The United Nations human rights office in Geneva said it had recorded 2,032 civilian casualties so far in Ukraine - 780 killed and 1,252 injured. 
Some 3.2 million civilians, mostly women and children, have now fled to neighbouring countries, the United Nations said. A Ukrainian official said some 3,810 people were evacuated through humanitarian corridors on Thursday, a far smaller number than Wednesday. 
A fourth straight day of talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators took place by videolink, but the Kremlin said an agreement had yet to be reached.
""Our delegation is putting in colossal effort,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. ""Our delegation... is ready to work around the clock - but unfortunately we don't see such zeal from the Ukrainian side.""
Moscow has previously said it was close to agreeing to a formula that would keep Ukraine neutral, one of its demands.
Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the negotiations were complicated. ""The positions of the parties are different. For us, fundamental issues are inviolable,"" he said.
Ukraine has said it is willing to negotiate an end to the war but will not surrender or accept Russian ultimatums. It is sticking to its core position that it retain sovereignty over areas occupied since 2014 by Russian and pro-Russian forces.
Kyiv and its Western allies say Russia launched the war to subjugate a neighbour Putin calls an artificial state. Moscow says it is carrying out a ""special operation"" to disarm Ukraine.
Ukraine's Zelenskiy addressed the German Bundestag by video link on Thursday, pulling no punches in a speech that invoked the Holocaust and the Berlin Wall, and seemed intended to shame pro-Russian politicians in Germany, Moscow's main energy buyer.
""Every year politicians repeat 'never again',"" said Zelenskiy, who is of Jewish heritage, citing a slogan used to mark the Holocaust.
""And now we see that these words are simply worthless. In Europe a people is being destroyed, they are trying to destroy everything that is dear to us, what we live for.""
DIGGING FOR SURVIVORS
The Russians have failed to capture a major city in the face of spirited resistance from Ukrainian forces protecting residential areas under daily bombardment.
Rescuers in Mariupol, a southern port city, dug survivors from the rubble of a theatre that officials said had been hit by an air strike on Wednesday as civilians took shelter there from bombardments. Russia denies striking the theatre.
Mariupol has suffered the worst humanitarian catastrophe of the war, with hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped in basements with no food, water or power. City officials say they are still not able to estimate the number of casualties from the theatre. 
""Yesterday and today, despite continuous shelling, rubble is being cleared as much as is possible and people are being rescued. Information about victims is still being clarified,"" the city council said in a statement. 
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said the allegation that Russia had bombed the theatre was a lie, and that ""Russia's armed forces don't bomb towns and cities"".
At the United Nations, diplomats said the Security Council will no longer vote on Friday on a Russian-drafted call for aid access and civilian protection in Ukraine as Russia's U.N. envoy accused Western countries of a pressure campaign against the measure.
The World Health Organization said on Thursday it has verified 43 attacks on healthcare facilities in Ukraine that have killed 12 people and injured dozens more, including health workers. 
""In any conflict, attacks on healthcare are a violation of international humanitarian law,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the U.N. Security Council, without specifying who was to blame for the attacks.
BLOODY SHEET
Northeastern and northwestern suburbs of Kyiv have suffered heavy damage but the capital itself has held firm, under a curfew and subjected to deadly rocket attacks nightly.
A building in Kyiv's Darnytsky district was extensively damaged. As residents cleared glass, a man knelt weeping by the body of a woman covered in a bloody sheet.
Ukrainian Defence Ministry spokesperson Oleksandr Motuzyanyk said Russian forces had made no significant advances around Kyiv in the past 24-48 hours and had resorted to ""chaotic"" shelling.
""The Ukrainian armed forces are making every effort to stop the enemy attacking from that area,"" he told a press briefing in Kyiv. He said several residential buildings had been damaged by downed missiles, causing civilian deaths.
""This is a war crime,"" he said, but gave no exact numbers.
British military intelligence said on Thursday that Russia's invasion has largely stalled on all fronts, with Russian forces suffering heavy losses and making minimal progress on land, sea or air in recent days.
Viacheslav Chaus, governor of the region centred on the frontline northern city of Chernihiv, said 53 civilians had been killed there in the past 24 hours. The toll could not be independently verified.

One of those killed in Chernihiv was a U.S. citizen, Jimmy Hill, who was gunned down while waiting in a bread line, his family said.
""His body was found in the street,"" his sister wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).

(Reuters) -Mark Meadows, who served as former Republican President Donald Trump's chief of staff and has echoed his false claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election, is being investigated in North Carolina over his voter registration, state authorities said on Thursday.
North Carolina's State Bureau of Investigation was assigned to lead the probe after a district attorney referred the matter to the state Department of Justice Special Prosecutions Section, department spokeswoman Nazneen Ahmed said in an email.
The investigation is in response to claims that Meadows, who represented North Carolina in Congress from 2013 until joining the Trump administration in 2020, registered to vote in September 2020 at an address he did not reside at, own or visit, the News & Observer newspaper reported, adding that the State Board of Elections is conducting a joint investigation.
""We have asked the SBI to investigate and at the conclusion of the investigation, we'll review their findings,"" Ahmed said.
The elections board could not be immediately reached for comment.
In North Carolina, voters must live in the county where they are registering and have resided there for at least 30 days prior to the election date, according to the state elections board website.
The New Yorker magazine first reported the voter registration allegations earlier this month. The outlet, quoting the director of the Macon County Board of Elections, said Meadows was registered at an address in the county and voted absentee in the 2020 general election.
Meadows is currently registered to vote at the same North Carolina address, according to the state elections board's online database.

Reuters sought comment from Meadows at the Conservative Partnership Institute, an organization that helps elect conservatives to office where Meadows now serves as partner, but was unable to immediately reach him.
Meadows is also the subject of contempt charges by a congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, in which Trump and his supporters sought to stop the certification of now-President Joe Biden's election victory.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) -The U.N. Security Council will no longer vote on Friday on a Russian-drafted call for aid access and civilian protection in Ukraine as Russia's U.N. envoy accused Western countries of a campaign of ""unprecedented pressure"" against the measure.
Diplomats said the Russian move would have failed with most of the 15-member council likely to abstain from a vote on the draft resolution because it did not address accountability or acknowledge Russia's invasion of its neighbor nor did it push for an end to the fighting or a withdrawal of Russian troops.
""Many colleagues from many delegations tell us about unprecedented pressure by Western partners, that their arms are being twisted, including blackmail and threats,"" Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said on Thursday.
Speaking at a council meeting on Ukraine's humanitarian situation, requested by Western council members, Nebenzia said: ""We do understand how difficult it is for those countries to withstand this kind of onslaught.""
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield told Reuters after the meeting: ""The only people who do arm-twisting around here are the Russians and they have to if they want to get anybody to support them.""
Nebenzia said that Russia had instead requested the council meet on Friday - when the vote had been scheduled - to discuss ""U.S. bio-laboratories in Ukraine using the new documents we obtained in the course of the special military operation.""
At a U.N. Security Council meeting on the same issue last week, also requested by Russia, Thomas Greenfield said the there are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories supported by the United States. The United Nations also said it had no evidence Ukraine had a biological weapons program.
Russia refers to its invasion of Ukraine as a ""special military operation"" targeting Ukraine's military infrastructure. Moscow denies attacking civilians. 
The U.N. human rights agency has recorded 726 deaths, including 52 children, and 1,174 people injured, including 63 children, between Feb. 24 and March 15, U.N. political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the Security Council on Thursday. The ""actual number is likely much higher,"" she said, without specifying who was to blame. 
""Most of these casualties were caused by the use in populated areas of explosive weapons with a wide impact area. Hundreds of residential buildings have been damaged or destroyed, as have hospitals and schools,"" DiCarlo said.
""The magnitude of civilian casualties and the destruction of civilian infrastructure in Ukraine cannot be denied. This demands a thorough investigation and accountability,"" she said.

The World Health Organization has verified 43 attacks on healthcare in Ukraine that have killed 12 people and injured dozens more, including health workers, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the Security Council.

PRZEMYSL, Poland/BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Thousands more refugees crossed into Eastern Europe on Thursday, many hoping that peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv may end the war soon, though more people were expected to flee in the days ahead.
As the conflict in Ukraine entered its fourth week, about 3.2 million have fled abroad, United Nations data showed on Thursday, in what has become Europe's fastest growing refugee crisis since World War Two.
While the numbers arriving in the frontline states - Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Moldova - have slowed in recent days, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said he expected a ""bigger wave"" next week.
""The war is not subsiding, but spreading; and as it spreads, there is the risk that next week will see the arrival of more people in Hungary, presenting us with a huge challenge,"" he said in a video posted on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page late on Wednesday.
""They are not only fleeing from areas threatened by war, but also from war zones themselves.""
One of them was Alla Klochko from Mirnohrod in Donetsk, the region in eastern Ukraine that separatists have declared an independent republic but is contested by Kyiv and is at the centre of fierce fighting between Ukraine and Russia. 
The 31-year-old was hoping she could stay near Warsaw, find work and enrol her eight-year-old daughter Alisa, who loves playing the piano, in a Polish school. 
""I hope that, if our delegation reaches an agreement and at the end there will be peace, I hope that Ukraine will not lose our part of the territory, our Donetsk, because Donetsk region is Ukrainian,"" she said.
""We are a part of Ukraine, have always been and hope that this will stay like that,"" she said from Przemysl train station, a transit hub near the Ukrainian border. ""We speak Russian, but we are Ukrainians.""
GO WEST
The European Union is offering collective protection to Ukrainians and many already have been moving further west. Collective protection of refugees is a measure that removes the need for individual asylum applications. 
In Germany, close to 190,000 people have registered with authorities so far. In Spain that number is 4,500, and in Norway, which is not in the EU but is also granting collective protection, 2,000.
""Volunteers say they don't know if we have a train to Berlin today,"" said Nastia Chemerys from Kyiv, speaking at Warsaw station where technical problems were causing delays on the Polish train network.
""Five, six days ago I left Kyiv ... It's very dangerous. When I left Kyiv, after two days, near my home, one house was fired (at).""
Amid the unrelenting fighting, both Ukraine and Russia have spoken of progress in their bilateral talks. 
Ukrainian officials have said they think Russia is running out of troops to keep fighting and could soon come to terms with its failure to topple the Ukrainian government. Moscow has said it is close to agreeing a formula that would keep Ukraine neutral, long one of its demands.
""I hope that this will end soon. Everybody says that it has to … I don't know,"" said Ekaterina Herman, 27, who arrived in Poland late on Wednesday with her two-year-old.
""I am planning to come back to Ukraine.""
Meanwhile, refugees across the region were trying to establish some kind of normality.
At a supermarket-turned-shelter in Rzeszow, south-eastern Poland, volunteers and children played tug-of-war, drew tattoos and made drawings, with the Beverly Hills Cop movie soundtrack blasting on the speakers.
In Romania, at the Siret border crossing with Ukraine, women with babies, toddlers and older children continued to arrive, while Romanian firefighters and volunteers welcomed them and carried their luggage to buses transporting them onwards. 

The United Nations is basing its relief plans on four million refugees but has said the figure would likely rise. The European Union is expecting five million to arrive.
Since the start of the invasion on Feb. 24, 282,000 people have fled to Hungary, 270,000 to the Czech Republic and 491,000 to Romania, with the most refugees -- 1.97 million -- in Poland, according to government and UN data.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday said he agrees with President Joe Biden that war crimes have been committed in Ukraine and U.S. experts were gathering evidence to prove it. 
Biden told reporters a day earlier that he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin was a ""war criminal"" but the White House later said no formal determination had been made on potential violations of international law since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.
""Personally, I agree,"" Blinken said in a news conference at the State Department.
""Intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime,"" Blinken said, adding that he finds it ""difficult to conclude that the Russians are doing otherwise"" after the destruction over the past few weeks.
The Kremlin called Biden's comment ""unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric."" Moscow says it is conducting a ""special military operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" its neighbor and has rejected claims of targeting civilians. 
Blinken recounted recent incidents of Russia bombing hospitals, schools and a theater where civilians were sheltering, and said they were part of ""a long list of attacks on civilian, not military, locations across Ukraine.""
Washington's new Ambassador at Large for Global Criminal Justice Beth Van Schaack, who was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, would lead State Department efforts aimed at ""documenting and evaluating potential war crimes being committed in Ukraine,"" Blinken said.

""We'll make sure that our findings help international efforts to investigate war crimes and hold those responsible accountable,"" Blinken said.

President Vladimir Putin issued a venomous warning to ""traitors"" on Wednesday, saying the West would try to use them as a fifth column to destroy Russia, but that Russians would be quickly able to tell the ""patriots from the scum"".
Within hours of Putin's speech, Dmitry Ivanov, a Moscow-based activist, said his mother found a graffiti message on the door to their apartment landing: ""Don't betray the motherland Dima"". 
The graffiti bore several of the ""Z"" signs used to drum up support for what Moscow calls its ""special military operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" Ukraine. The motif is from markings on Russia's armoured vehicles and tanks.
Ivanov, who has protested against the war, said he had no idea who was behind the graffiti, but that he knew of at least three other people, including activists and a journalist, whose doors had been defaced in the same way on Wednesday evening. 
""I don't know their aims: to frighten, not to frighten, or just to spoil your mood. It's hard to scare us with such actions: we're used to this kind of attention,"" the 22-year-old told Reuters. 
""It's possible this action was to complement Putin's speech, I think that's possible. Especially considering how shoddily, and cheaply these markings were done. It was done in a hurry,"" he said.
Thousands of people have been detained across Russia since the Kremlin launched its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.
""SELF-CLEANSING""
Putin, in his comments to government ministers on Wednesday, said Russians would spit out traitors ""like gnats"", and society would be the better for it.
""I am convinced that this natural and necessary self-cleansing of society will only strengthen our country, our solidarity, cohesion and readiness to meet any challenge,"" he said.
Asked about the remarks on Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said many people were showing themselves to be traitors.
""They are vanishing from our lives themselves. Some people are leaving their posts, some are leaving their active work life, some leave the country and move to other countries. That is how this cleansing happens,"" he said.
After Putin spoke, the Investigative Committee, a law enforcement body, announced the name of the first person, a food blogger, under investigation for spreading ""false information"" about Russia's army on her blog. 
That crime is now punishable by up to 15 years in jail after Russia adopted a law on March 4 following a ripple of protest activity against the invasion.
In an interview with Reuters, Veronika Belotserkovskaya who lives in southern France said that despite being apolitical she was not surprised she had been singled out as she likely fitted the image of a person whom the average Russian might loathe. 
""You know, there's this fat spoilt woman living on the Cote D'Azur, in Provence, or in Italy, who makes foie gras and eats lobsters, who also dares to blather on from over there... I have all of these qualities that the average person would see as disgusting,"" she said.
After Putin spoke on Wednesday, a senior member of the ruling United Russia party called for the immediate sacking of former deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich from his position as head of a foundation that promotes economic innovation.

Dvorkovich, who now heads the International Chess Federation, condemned the war in comments to Western media. 
""He has made his choice,"" said the parliamentarian, Andrei Turchak. ""This is nothing but the very national betrayal, the behaviour of the fifth column, which the president spoke about today.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An Iraq war veteran who allegedly formed a militia he dubbed the ""Proud Boys of North Texas"" pleaded guilty on Thursday to a single count of assaulting or resisting police, a charge related to the storming of the U.S. Capitol in an effort to block Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's election.
The plea from Lucas Denney, 44, of Texas, marked an abrupt shift in the case. Earlier this week, prosecutors had signaled they supported his emergency request to release him from jail and drop criminal charges because they had violated his rights to a speedy trial by failing to secure an indictment until about three months after his December 2021 arrest.
In a surprise move, Denney opted to withdraw his emergency request to have the case dismissed, and pleaded guilty instead.
He did so even as federal prosecutors warned in a virtual hearing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that they had not ruled out filing additional criminal charges against him in the future.
After that revelation, U.S. District Court Judge Randolph Moss urged Denney to briefly take a recess and confer with his lawyers. After the recess, Denney said he had not changed his mind, and admitted to intentionally hitting a police officer with a pole as the officer was protecting the Capitol grounds.
""It was a plastic pole. It was like a PVC tube,"" Denney said.
Denney is one of more than 775 people facing charges for their role in attacking the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
The government's criminal complaint alleges that before the attack, Denney and a co-conspirator who also faced charges discussed organizing a militia to go to Washington, D.C.
""The 6th is going to be bigger than the last rally. I can’t tell you everything I know over media here but it’s gonna be big,"" Denney allegedly wrote in a message.
""We will need linking up with proud boys though. I’ve been in contact with a few different chapters.""
The complaint says that after Denney arrived at the U.S. Capitol, he started grabbing metal barricades and trying to pull them from police, screaming ""Who ya'll protecting?""

Investigators said that after a police officer sprayed crowd control spray, Denney grabbed a metal pole and tried to swing it at the officer. He eventually managed to make his way into the lower west terrace of the Capitol, where the crowd pushed back against police riot shields while screaming ""Heave-ho!""
In a court filing earlier this week, prosecutors urged the judge to sentence Denney to a prison term somewhere between 57 to 71 months, while Denney's lawyers are asking for a range of 41 to 51 months.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden will hold a call on Friday with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, as Washington warned China was considering military support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a step that would dramatically widen the gulf between Beijing and Western governments.
The call, first announced by the White House on Thursday, comes at a pivotal moment in U.S.-China relations and in Ukraine, where heavily outnumbered local forces have prevented Moscow from capturing any of the country's biggest cities so far. 
The Biden administration has issued public and private warnings that Beijing would face dire consequences if it provides material support to Russian President Vladimir Putin's war.
""President Biden will be speaking to President Xi tomorrow and will make clear that China will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia's aggression, and we will not hesitate to impose costs,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told a news briefing.
Blinken said China had a responsibility to use its influence with Putin and to defend international rules, but that it appeared Beijing was ""moving in the opposite direction.""
""We're concerned that they're considering directly assisting Russia with military equipment to use in Ukraine,"" he said, officially confirming for the first time reports earlier in the week that U.S. officials believed China had signaled its willingness to provide Moscow with such support.
Blinken did not elaborate on what the costs might be to China, and Washington has not yet offered evidence of the claim that China has signaled a willingness to help Russia. Moscow has denied asking China for military assistance, and China's foreign ministry has called the idea ""disinformation.""
Western nations have been sending military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki characterized the call as ""an opportunity for President Biden to assess where President Xi stands."" 
""The fact that China has not denounced what Russia is doing, absence of denunciation by China of what Russia is doing in and of itself speaks volumes,"" Psaki said. 
China's official Xinhua news agency said the call would happen in the evening Beijing time. 
Asked which side requested the call, a U.S. administration official said it was mutually agreed in a Rome meeting on Monday, where national security adviser Jake Sullivan held seven hours of talks with Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi. 
U.S. officials described those talks as ""tough"" and are still debating how to react if Xi gives Putin military or economic aid.
Putin's invasion of Ukraine, which is in its fourth week, has killed hundreds of civilians, reduced cities to rubble and sparked a humanitarian crisis as millions flee the country. 
Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said this week the country was counting on China to help it withstand the blow to its economy from massive Western sanctions aimed at isolating Russia's economy from the rest of the world. 
China has refused to condemn Russia's action in Ukraine or call it an invasion, and it has censored online content in China that is pro-West or unfavorable to Russia. Beijing, while saying it recognizes Ukraine sovereignty, has also said Russia has legitimate security concerns that should be addressed. 
""We have seen China basically give tacit approval to what Russia is doing by refusing to join sanctions, by blaming the West and the United States for the assistance we've given Ukraine, by claiming they wanted to see a peaceful outcome, but essentially doing nothing to achieve it,"" one senior U.S. defense official told Reuters before the call was announced.
Blinken on Wednesday said China's refusal to criticize the invasion was completely incompatible with its professed recognition of the U.N. Charter underscoring the sovereignty of nations.
'YOU CAN'T GO BACK' 
Biden and Xi, who spent considerable time together before they came to lead their respective countries, have yet to meet face to face since Biden took office last year. But the call will mark their fourth interaction since then, the most recent a November video conference.
Washington has sought to define the relationship as one of competitive coexistence, but China's ""no-limits"" strategic partnership with Russia announced last month and its stance on Ukraine has called that into question. 
Targeting Beijing with the sort of extensive economic sanctions imposed on Russia would have potentially dire consequences for the U.S. and global economies as well, given that China is the world's second largest economy and largest exporter. 
Evan Medeiros, an Asia specialist in the Obama administration, said during a webinar hosted by the German Marshall Fund of the United States that the Biden administration appeared to be trying to convey to Xi that China was at risk of crossing thresholds that would do irreversible damage to U.S.-China relations. 

""Not only are the costs very, very high from crossing those thresholds - providing military assistance, joint disinformation campaigns - but ... once you cross them, you can't go back,"" he said.
""The message to the Chinese right now is basically there are a variety of futures for the relationship. Some very dark, some more moderate,"" said Medeiros.

627,"<span>Mar 17, 2022 02:32PM ET</span>","BERLIN (Reuters) -Invoking the fall of the Berlin Wall, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday urged German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to tear down what he called a wall between ""free and unfree"" Europe and stop the war in Ukraine.
Speaking to the Bundestag by videolink, Zelenskiy appealed to Scholz to restore freedom to Ukraine, tapping Germany's collective memory with reference to the historic 1948-1949 Berlin Airlift and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
Zelenskiy described a new wall ""in the middle of Europe between freedom and unfreedom"", which he said Germany had helped build, isolating Ukraine with its business ties to Russia and its previous support for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
""And this wall is getting bigger with every bomb that falls on Ukraine, with every decision that is not taken,"" he added.
Asked about Zelenskiy's speech, Scholz said that Germany has been extending military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine and it was engaged in diplomatic efforts to stop the war. 
""It is also clear to me that Ukraine and its president must decide and will decide for themselves what is good for them and what isn't,"" Scholz said during a news conference. ""They don't need wrong advice from other countries about what to do and what not to do. It is about their country and their future.""
Germany last month halted the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea pipeline project, designed to double the flow of Russian gas directly to Germany.
Recalling former U.S. President Ronald Reagan's appeal to Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, to tear down the Berlin Wall, Zelenskiy told German lawmakers: ""That's what I say to you dear Chancellor Scholz: destroy this wall.""
""Give Germany the leadership role that it has earned so that your descendants are proud of you. Support freedom, support Ukraine, stop this war, help us to stop this war,"" he added.

Lawmakers in the Bundestag welcomed Zelenskiy with a standing ovation and the chamber's vice president, Katrin Goering-Eckardt, told him: ""Your country has chosen democracy, and that's what (Russian President) Vladimir Putin fears."" 
She said Putin was trying to deny Ukraine's right to exist, adding: ""But he has already failed with that.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - A powerful earthquake off Japan's northeast coast left thousands of homes without water and power on Thursday and forced factories to suspend operations, adding to supply chain woes for makers of smartphones, electronics and automobiles worldwide.
The magnitude 7.4 tremblor struck just before midnight on Wednesday east of the Fukushima prefecture, the same area that suffered Japan's biggest quake 11 years ago.
At least two people died and 161 were injured in the latest quake, according to government spokesman Hirokazu Matsuno, whereas thousands perished in the 2011 disaster, when a magnitude 9.1 magnitude quake also triggered a tsunami and caused a meltdown at a nuclear power plant.
There were no abnormalities reported at any nuclear power plants this time, though authorities said a fire alarm had been triggered at a turbine building at the plant crippled in 2011. 
The quake still caused havoc for industry, however.
Chipmaker Renesas Electronics Corp a major supplier of automotive chips, suspended production at two semiconductor plants and partially stopped output at a third. 
Among them was its Naka plant in Ibaraki prefecture just north of Tokyo, which supplies semiconductors to auto companies worldwide. Chip shortages caused by COVID-19-related disruption have already forced many auto firms to cut back production.
Electronic components maker Murata Manufacturing also halted operations at its factories, as one of them making smartphone parts had a fire following the quake.
 Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group Corp halted production at two factories in Miyagi prefecture and a third factory in Yamagata prefecture. The facilities produce storage media, laser diodes and image sensors.
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp said it would restart work at reduced capacity at two factories on Thursday night, after operations were suspended as soon as the quake struck.
Japan's biggest refiner, Eneos Corp, shut its Sendai refinery including the 145,000 barrel-per-day crude distillation unit (CDU).
Authorities indefinitely suspended a Shinkansen bullet train service, and closed at least one major highway to the region for safety checks.
BAD MEMORIES
Parts of building facades tumbled into streets in some areas of Fukushima. Television footage showed a steep tiled roof crumpled over a parked, crushed car and workers examining cracked highways.
""This one felt different (to the 2011 quake), it was huge. I had to hang on to something to stay upright,"" said Aoi Hoshino, who owns a bar in Fukushima.
One of her customers shrugged off the initial tremors, but when the biggest one hit he stood up and shouted, ""This is a big one!"" she recalled, though the only damage in her bar were broken cups and picture frames.
About 300 km (186 miles) south of Fukushima, areas of the capital Tokyo lost power for nearly three hours following quake.
An earlier tsunami warning for the northeast coast was lifted and power was fully restored to the capital by the early hours of Thursday, although people in some parts of Fukushima were still waiting for electricity by the early evening. 
Matsuno said the Self-Defense Forces were delivering water to communities whose water systems were damaged, and residents of one town in Fukushima queued to fill plastic tanks.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said that the government would be on high alert for the possibility of further strong tremors over the next two to three days.
The quake stuck at 11:36 p.m. local time (1400 GMT) just off the coast of Fukushima prefecture at a depth of 60 kilometres, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.
Commemorated across the country less than a week ago, the 2011 quake was magnitude 9.1, and along with the tsunami left some 18,000 dead.

The latest quake, however, revived lingering concerns over nuclear safety, posing a potential challenge to Kishida's drive to restart the idled nuclear plants.

WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) -The Biden administration made a carefully orchestrated gamble this week, issuing a series of public and private threats to Beijing that it will face consequences if it supports Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
The strategy was capped by a tense, seven-hour meeting in Rome on Monday between U.S. President Joe Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi. 
Having fired loud diplomatic salvos at Beijing, Biden administration officials are still debating the next steps to take to ensure China does not help Russia evade Western sanctions or supply weapons to Moscow as casualties mount in Ukraine. 
One result of the Rome meeting was announced on Thursday - Chinese President Xi Jinping will speak with Biden on Friday about ""managing the competition between our two countries as well as Russia's war against Ukraine,"" the White House said. 
It is not likely to be an easy conversation. 
Beijing was combative in the Rome talks, people briefed on the interactions say. One U.S.-based person briefed on the meeting described Chinese officials' response as ""tough"" and ""offensive."" Another said simply that the talks did not go well. 
Washington is now sorting through a host of unanswered questions, including where any ""red line"" regarding Ukraine that China would need to cross to trigger a U.S. response is, and what exactly that response would be, administration officials say.
The Biden administration is waiting to see what China does before deciding on a course of action. ""We're going to be watching closely,"" said White House spokesperson Jen Psaki on Monday. A senior U.S. official said they would be looking at what military, economic, or other support is being provided to Russia.
The United States on Monday told allies in NATO and several Asian countries that China had signaled its willingness to provide military and economic aid to Russia to support its war in Ukraine, an accusation that China denies. 
Sullivan had warned before the talks that China would ""absolutely"" face consequences if it helped Moscow evade sweeping sanctions over Ukraine.
China, which announced a ""no limits"" strategic partnership with Russia in February, may find it hard to change course and back down after a threat was made public, said Kevin Gallagher, who leads the Global Development Policy Center at Boston University.
""This wasn't a good strategic move,"" he said. ""Like the United States, China has a domestic constituency."" 
He Weiwen, senior fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Beijing's Renmin University said: ""The U.S. has an intention to crackdown on China, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict provides a reason for it to do so,"" describing the U.S. warnings as ""blackmail."" 
Sources in the Biden administration and diplomats in Washington and Europe say Western countries had been sending private warnings to Beijing about China's support for Russian President Vladimir Putin for weeks before the Rome meeting. 
Russia has denied asking China for military assistance, and China warned this week of ""false information,"" in apparent reference to U.S. statements. 
""China firmly opposes any words and deeds that spread false information and distort and smear China's position,"" Yang said, according to the official Xinhua news agency. Beijing's official newspaper, the People's Daily, carried a column noting the inaccurate U.S. intelligence that led to the Iraq invasion. 
Some U.S. allies also quietly questioned the intelligence Washington was relying upon regarding the Russian and Chinese conversations, several European diplomatic sources said.
SANCTIONS DISCUSSIONS NOT ADVANCED
Discussions between the United States and its military allies of any coordinated sanctions that could apply to Beijing are not advanced, according to one person involved in those conversations. 
A move to sanction China over Ukraine would have potentially dire consequences, not just for China, but for the U.S. and global economies, analysts say.
China trades vastly more with the United States and its NATO than it does with Russia, and the Chinese economy relies heavily on international markets and capital. However, the talks between Sullivan and Yang did not focus on trade, one U.S. official noted.
Biden entered office regarding China as the key foreign policy challenge of the era, one that required a more hardline defense of democratic values against autocratic competitors. 
But Biden hoped that his candid personal relationship with China's leader could defuse the likelihood of a Cold War or a direct military clash between the world's current superpower and its rising superpower, including over the status of Taiwan.

""China is either going to side with Russia and reinforce the sense that it has joined an 'axis of autocracy,' or it is going to put significant space between Moscow and Beijing and demonstrate that it genuinely cares about preserving even a basic relationship with the rest of the world,"" said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
""If it turns down this opportunity, it's not clear to me there will be a next time to meet and set aside differences. The ball is entirely in Beijing's court.""

ATLANTA (Reuters) -Americans protesting anti-Asian violence gathered in Atlanta and other U.S. cities on Wednesday to mark one year since a mass shooting of women of Asian heritage in Atlanta-area spas that awakened the nation to a spike in hate incidents against the community.
Advocates organized events in a dozen cities including Houston, Detroit, and San Francisco, to raise awareness about the growing risk of violence against people of Asian descent, accentuated in recent days by the brutal beating of a woman in New York.
In Atlanta on Wednesday, about 200 people assembled inside a freight depot, some holding signs with the slogans such as ""We will not be silent"" and ""Asians deserve justice."" The event marked the anniversary of the fatal shooting of eight people, including six Asian women, at three spas in the area.
Robert Peterson, the son of Yong Ae Yue, one of the victims, spoke briefly at the gathering. As a son of a Black father and a Korean mother, he said he has long known about the prevalence of racism in America. 
""It is important to call this what it is, a crime that is racially motivated,"" he said. ""My mother was an Asian woman who was targeted because of who she was.""
""As we stand together, let's send a message: this is unacceptable. This will not be tolerated.""
While police initially said that the gunman, who was white, was driven to violence by his sex addiction, many saw misogyny and racial bias as likely triggers behind the massacre, which came as anti-Asian hate crimes were rising across the United States. Experts have said the COVID-19 pandemic, which originated in China, was prompting people to lash out against Asian-Americans.
The scapegoating of Chinese people for the pandemic, especially by former President Donald Trump, is partly to blame for the rise in violence, said Sung Yeon Choimorrow, executive director of the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum, a nonprofit advocacy group.
While Asian Americans were targets of racial violence well before the pandemic, now they are more willing to speak up about their experiences, with the Atlanta shootings serving as a catalyst for people to listen, she said in an interview.
""Nothing had galvanized the country like the Atlanta spa shootings did,"" she said. ""It opened this space up for us to step in and be able to explain why this happened.""
President Joe Biden said in a statement on Wednesday the shootings had forced Americans to ""reckon with our nation's long legacy of anti-Asian sentiment and gender-based violence"" as he highlighted the COVID-⁠19 Hate Crimes Act enacted last year, a bill aimed at combating violence against Asian Americans.
At the Atlanta event, Stacey Abrams, a Black woman who is a Democratic candidate for governor of Georgia, drew parallels between the discrimination historically faced by Asian Americans and Black people, whose rights were restricted under Jim Crow laws that persisted into the 1960s.
""My father grew up in the Jim Crow South. What happened here was an echo of that,"" Abrams told the crowd in Atlanta. ""We are all here because we must remember. We must tell Asian stories because those are the stories of America.""
The ""Break The Silence - Justice for Asian Women"" rallies on Wednesday were held to commemorate the lives taken in the Atlanta shootings: Paul Andre Michels, 54; Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33; Daoyou Feng, 44; Yong Ae Yue, 63; Xiaojie Tan, 49; Hyun Jung Grant, 51; Suncha Kim, 69; and Soon Chung Park, 74.
A total of 10,905 hate incidents targeting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders were reported between March 19, 2020, and Dec. 31, 2021, according to research released this month by the nonprofit group Stop AAPI Hate. The majority of incidents concerned women and 16% involved physical assault, the group found.
A separate report by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, showed that hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders rose 164% in the first quarter of 2021 compared with the same period in 2020.

The threat was highlighted by an unprovoked assault in Yonkers, New York, where police said a woman of Asian descent was punched more than 125 times last week and stomped on by a man who called her an anti-Asian slur. It was one of a series of high-profile attacks on Asians in New York and elsewhere in recent months. 
Also on Wednesday, a 25-year-old New York man was indicted in the murder of a young woman of Korean descent in her Chinatown apartment. The defendant followed the woman into her building and stabbed her dozens of times, police said.

ANJEKY BEANATARA, Madagascar (Reuters) - With precious few trees left to slow the wind in this once fertile corner of southern Madagascar, red sand is blowing everywhere: onto fields, villages and roads, and into the eyes of children waiting for food aid parcels.
Four years of drought, the worst in decades, along with deforestation caused by people burning or cutting down trees to make charcoal or to open up land for farming, have transformed the area into a dust bowl.
""There's nothing to harvest. That's why we have nothing to eat and we're starving,"" said mother-of-seven Tarira, standing at a remote World Food Programme (WFP) post near Anjeky Beanatara, where children are checked for signs of malnutrition and given food.
More than a million people in southern Madagascar currently need food handouts from the WFP, a United Nations agency.
Tarira had brought her four-year-old son Avoraza, who has been struggling to put on weight, to collect sachets of a peanut-based product known as Plumpy, used to treat malnourished children.
""There are seven, so there wasn't enough food. The Plumpy wasn't enough for him,"" she said, holding Avoraza by his thin arm.
(Open https://reut.rs/3KQ90Tj to see a picture package)
Like many others in the region, Tarira and her family have sometimes been reduced to eating a type of cactus known locally as raketa, which grows wild but provides little nutritional value and gives stomach pains, she said.
The world's fourth largest island and one of its most diverse ecosystems, with thousands of endemic species of plants and animals such as lemurs, Madagascar projects the image of a lush natural paradise. But in parts of it, such as its far southern regions, the reality on the ground has changed.
""We used to call Madagascar the green island, but sadly now it is more of a red island,"" said Soja Lahimaro Tsimandilatse, governor of the southern Androy region. 
PRAYING FOR RAIN
The food crisis in the south built up over a period of years and has interconnected causes including drought, deforestation, environmental damage, poverty, COVID-19 and population growth, according to local authorities and aid organisations.
With a population of 30 million, Madagascar has always known extreme weather events, but scientists say these will likely increase in frequency and severity as human-induced climate change pushes temperatures higher.
The United Nations' IPCC climate change panel says increased aridity is already being observed in Madagascar and forecasts that droughts will increase. At the height of the food crisis in the south, the WFP warned the island was at risk of seeing ""the world's first climate change famine"".
A study by international research collective World Weather Attribution said models indicated a small shift toward more droughts caused by climate change in southern Madagascar, but said natural variability was the main cause for the second one-in-135-year dry event since 1992.
Theodore Mbainaissem, who runs WFP operations in the worst-hit areas in southern Madagascar, said once-regular weather patterns had changed beyond recognition in recent years and elders in the villages could no longer figure out the best time to plant or harvest.
Mbainaissem said that after months of intervention by the WFP, other aid organisations and the local authorities, the worst of the food crisis was over. He said rates of severe malnutrition among children had dropped from about 30% a few months ago to about 5% now.
""When you look in the villages, you see children running left and right. That wasn't the case before,"" he said.
Communities and aid groups are already trying to move past the emergency phase and focus on forward-looking projects, such as a large-scale effort in the coastal town of Faux Cap to stabilise sand dunes by planting.
But in rural areas where people live in dire poverty, some of the trends that contributed to the crisis are still present.
For recently married Felix Fitiavantsoa, 20, who was burning down a wooded area to start cultivating it, the long-term consequences of deforestation were a secondary concern. 

His urgent need was to grow food to feed his young wife, and his main worry was whether it would finally rain so he could get started.
""If there's no rain, I don't know what we'll do. We'll pray to God,"" he said.

BRIZE NORTON, England (Reuters) -British-Iranian aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and dual national Anoosheh Ashoori arrived in Britain from Iran on Thursday, ending an ordeal during which they became a bargaining chip in Iran's talks with the West over its nuclear programme.
They arrived at the British military airbase of Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, shortly after 1 a.m. local time, after flying back via a brief stopover in Oman. They walked off the plane together and smiled and waved as they entered an airport building.
""It has been a really difficult 48 hours,"" British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said shortly after Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Ashoori arrived at the base. ""The expectation was that they would be released but we weren't sure right until the last minute so it's been very emotional but also a really happy moment for the families."" 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson celebrated the pair's release on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) earlier in the day.
""I am very pleased to confirm that the unfair detention of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori in Iran has ended today, and they will now return to the UK,"" Johnson said in a tweet.
Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband Richard said the long ordeal appeared to finally be over. ""It's just a relief, the idea that we can go back to being a normal family, that we don't have to keep fighting, that this long journey is almost over,"" he told Reuters outside his London home before his wife landed. 
A statement from Ashoori's family thanked everyone who had worked towards his release. ""1,672 days ago our family's foundations were rocked when our father and husband was unjustly detained and taken away from us. 
""Now, we can look forward to rebuilding those same foundations with our cornerstone back in place."" 
Antonio Zappulla, CEO of Zaghari-Ratcliffe's employer, the  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Foundation, said her release was ""a ray of light and hope"" at a time when the world was in turmoil. The foundation is a charity that operates independently of Thomson Reuters and its news subsidiary Reuters.
In February, as months of talks on reviving a 2015 nuclear deal inched closer to an agreement, Iran, which holds a dozen Western dual nationals, said it was ready for a prisoner swap in return for the unblocking of frozen assets and release of Iranians held in Western jails.
The nuclear talks were close to an agreement 11 days ago until last-minute Russian demands for sweeping guarantees that would have hollowed out sanctions imposed following its invasion of Ukraine threw the negotiations off track. 
Russia now appears to have narrowed its demands to cover only work linked to the nuclear deal, leaving a small number of issues to be resolved between Washington and Tehran, diplomats say.
Separately, Britain said detained Iranian-American environmentalist Morad Tahbaz, who also holds British citizenship, had been released on furlough on Wednesday.
TANK DEBT
Iran's semi-official Fars news agency said Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Ashoori were freed after Britain repaid a historic debt. 
Iran's clerical rulers say Britain owed Iran 400 million pounds ($520 mln) that Iran's former monarch, the Shah, paid up front for 1,750 Chieftain tanks and other vehicles, almost none of which were delivered after the Islamic Revolution of 1979 toppled the U.S.-backed leader.
Truss said Britain had been looking at ways to pay the debt.
""We have the deepest admiration for the resolve, courage and determination Nazanin, Anoosheh and Morad, and their families, have shown. They have faced hardship that no family should ever experience and this is a moment of great relief,"" she said in a statement.
""In parallel, we have also settled the IMS debt, as we said we would,"" she added, referring to the debt for military equipment. She said the debt had been settled in full in compliance with international sanctions on Iran and the funds would be ring-fenced for buying ""humanitarian goods.""
Iran's top diplomat Hossein Amirabdollahian on Wednesday said Britain had paid its debt a few days ago, denying any links between the payment and the release of the prisoners. 
ILL-FATED VISIT
Zaghari-Ratcliffe's protracted difficulties began with her arrest by Revolutionary Guards at Tehran airport on April 3, 2016, while trying to return to Britain with her then 22-month-old daughter Gabriella from an Iranian new year's visit with her parents.
She was later convicted by an Iranian court of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment. Her family and the foundation denied the charge.

Ashoori was sentenced to 10 years in jail in 2019 for spying for Israel's Mossad and two years for ""acquiring illegitimate wealth"", according to Iran's judiciary.
The Thomson Reuters Foundation said that Zaghari-Ratcliffe had travelled to Iran in a personal capacity and had not been doing work in Iran.

PRAGUE/KYIV (Reuters) -When headlines flashed on Tuesday morning that the leaders of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia were on a train to Kyiv for talks with the Ukrainian president, it was news to some members of their immediate families.
The trip to a city under siege, where Ukraine's military is fighting invading Russian forces just a few kilometres from the periphery, was hastily arranged and known only to a few people.
Public pronouncements by the leaders and by a participant and a diplomatic source who spoke privately point to an arduous and risky diplomatic mission that underlined the sense of urgency among European countries to end the war.
While other European leaders were informed of the proposed journey during a summit in Versailles last Friday, only a small number of countries were directly involved.
The three that eventually took part are deeply suspicious of how Moscow views nations once under its influence before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, concerns that have been heightened by its invasion of Ukraine that began on Feb. 24.
More than 3 million people have also fled Ukraine in the last three weeks, nearly 2 million of them into neighbouring Poland.
Asked about the danger involved, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala told reporters on Wednesday after his return from Ukraine that he believed it was worth the risk.
""There are situations where you have to decide for yourself, and I made the decision I made,"" the 57-year-old said.
""I was not alone, I had colleagues - the prime ministers, I had colleagues from my team and from the security service who were willing to complete the trip with me.""
He told his wife about his plans, but asked her not to tell his mother or three children.
""They found out about it when it was published.""
With him in Kyiv were Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, Slovenian counterpart Janez Jansa and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, powerful leader of Poland's ruling party.
They travelled on a special train from Poland's eastern border into Ukraine on Tuesday morning. By the time the trip became public, they were on their way to the capital.
A social media post on Wednesday showed Fiala in a flak jacket and helmet, looking at a mobile phone and standing between two beds in a narrow, rudimentary sleeping compartment.
It was not clear whether Russia knew of the visit.
Fiala posted on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page that the international community was informed of it via international bodies like the United Nations.
Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pawel Jablonski said the participants did not discuss it directly with Moscow in advance.
""We would like to have somebody credible to discuss things with in Russia but Russia is no longer a reasonable partner for any discussions,"" he said on Wednesday.
The Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it had been made aware of Tuesday's mission and had agreed to provide safe passage.
LONG WAIT, NO LIGHTS
A European diplomatic source said the plan was first mentioned to Charles Michel, European Council president, on the sidelines of the Versailles summit.
Morawiecki then let Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen know on Monday that they intended to travel the following day, according to a EU official. There was no European mandate.
It is not clear who else was approached to join them. French President Emmanuel Macron was not asked, according to the diplomat, and nor was German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a spokesman said.
Slovakian Prime Minister Eduard Heger consulted his security services about it, a government spokeswoman said, but was strongly advised not to go.
On the morning the four politicians and their small entourage of advisers and security personnel crossed into Ukraine, at least five people had been killed in air strikes and shelling of Kyiv as Russia's assault intensified.
The city's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, declared a 35-hour curfew from Tuesday evening, saying that the capital was facing a ""dangerous moment"".
Thousands of people have been killed in the conflict. Russia calls its actions a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine, a charge Kyiv rejects as a false pretext to invade.
One participant in the mission, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the visit, said the train journey took some 10 hours and that darkness had fallen by the time they reached Kyiv.
The delegation was taken in vans through largely empty streets to the presidential palace, where they waited for around four hours to see President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. They were not allowed their mobile phones during this period.
After the meeting, which lasted about 2.5 hours, they addressed a small group of reporters before departing back for Europe, and the participant said they probably got around three hours' sleep during the whole journey.
According to a Reuters witness, at the palace sandbags were piled up at various points and heavily armed Ukrainian security personnel escorted the delegation with flashlights along darkened corridors to avoid making the building a target.
Dressed casually, the leaders gave a press conference in which they expressed support for Ukraine's push to join the European Union and admiration for the country's resilience.
""The main message of our mission is to say you are not alone. Europe stands with your country,"" Fiala said.
DAMNED IF YOU DO...
While the mission had many admirers, some EU sources said it raised eyebrows among some member states who worried that a major incident involving the delegation could have dragged them closer into direct confrontation with Russia.
Polish state media, which broadly supports Kaczynski's PiS party, and Morawiecki himself have drawn parallels between the Kyiv mission and a trip made by Kaczynski's late twin brother Lech to Georgia in 2008 during tensions with Russia.
Lech Kaczynski, then Poland's president, came under fire near a breakaway Georgian province backed by Moscow, and lashed out against what he called Russian ""imperialism"".
""There's always another step. If you allow imperialists, there are always more countries in line,"" the president's aide told Polish television at the time.
Lech Kaczynski died when his plane crashed in thick fog over western Russia in 2010.
Radek Sikorski, a European parliamentarian for the main Polish opposition party Civic Platform, criticised Jaroslaw Kaczynski's participation in the Ukraine mission, saying on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that it smacked of a PR stunt.
Slovakian premier Heger's defence minister, Jaroslav Nad, took to Facebook to defend his leader's decision not to join the trip, after a media backlash.
""I stand behind ... Heger and say repeatedly that this was the right decision,"" he wrote.
It is unclear whether the mission will have a significant impact on the war. Kaczynski proposed sending an international peacekeeping mission to Ukraine, but the idea does not appear to have gained immediate traction in talks between Kyiv and Moscow.

The symbolism of the trip, however, was not lost on Zelenskiy, who has vowed to repel the Russians and urged the West to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine.
Noting that many ambassadors had left Kyiv, he said the visiting leaders were ""not afraid of anything.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - It is unclear if the apparent failure of a missile launch on Wednesday dealt a lasting blow to North Korea’s plans, but analysts say failures are an important part of any development programme and in the North’s case, have often hinted at progress in more indigenous designs. 
South Korea's military said a presumed ballistic missile exploded in mid-air shortly after it was test-fired from the international airport near Pyongyang on Wednesday morning. North Korea has not commented on or publicly acknowledged the reports.
The apparent accident would be an unwelcome setback - and potentially dangerous to anyone in the path of falling debris - but analysts said missile engineers can often learn as much from failures as successes, and the test further underscores progress North Korea is making amid stalled international efforts to curb its ballistic missile and nuclear weapon development.
“A missile launch failure doesn't imply that they don't learn from the test; failures can be useful data points in improving their capabilities,” said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
U.S. and South Korean officials have said North Korea may be preparing to conduct its first full-scale intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test since 2017. With the construction of what analysts believe is a ballistic missile support facility at the airport, the site could be a centre of any renewed testing.
Historically, North Korea’s missile program has had a remarkably low rate of known failures compared to many other countries that have built such weapons, said Melissa Hanham, a researcher at Stanford University's Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC) in California.
In one notable incident amid North Korea's flurry of major new weapons tests in 2017, a Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile failed after launch and crashed in a populated area.
""Frankly, I remain surprised there are not more failures,"" Hanham said. 
Some analysts have pointed to that as evidence that the North, at least initially, relied heavily on technology from partners like Russia. Its first ICBM, the Hwasong-14, is also believed to have technology gained through cooperation with Iran. 
""There is no flawless development, and if there seems to be one, it always turns out that a lot of development work had been done elsewhere before,"" said Markus Schiller, a Europe-based missile expert who has researched foreign aid to North Korea's programme. ""Therefore, from that perspective, a failed launch might hint at a real indigenous development.""
ROCKET BOOSTERS TO BLAME?
North Korea has not disclosed what missile was involved in Wednesday's launch, nor the two most recent tests on Feb. 27 and March 5, which were also fired from the airport. It said those launches were for testing spy satellite equipment, but U.S. and South Korean officials said they were secret tests of a huge new ICBM system, known as the Hwasong-17.
""It makes sense that as they transition toward larger, newer missiles, including possibly the Hwasong-17, they'd see more failures,"" Panda said.
If the Hwasong-17 was involved in Wednesday's botched test, however, it would be unusual that the failure didn't occur on the first or second flights, Schiller said.
The quick interval between the tests is also unusual for a developmental programme, as it doesn’t give time for the engineers to tweak their designs, he said.
“Therefore, it seems that the missiles were already manufactured and ready for launch even before number one was launched, which would hint at a programme that is already beyond prototyping,” Schiller said. “Or it might hint at taking high risks.”

Because the failure came soon after liftoff, it likely involved the missile's first stage, which in the case of the Hwasong-17 has a complicated set of four massive rocket engines, Hanham said.
""Though North Korea heralded the tests of individual engines as successes, clustering four of them together for the first stage of the Hwasong-17 is very challenging,"" she said.

637,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 11:50PM ET</span>","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's military said on Thursday that it had spotted four large Russian amphibious warfare ships sailing close to its islands as they traveled west, possibly towards Europe.
Pictures of the amphibious transports, typically used for landing expeditionary forces ashore, published by Japan's defence ministry showed what appeared to be military trucks loaded onto the deck of one of the vessels.
We don't know where they are heading, but their heading suggest it is possible,"" a Japanese defence ministry spokesman said. Asked if they could be bound for Ukraine, he said ""it is possible"".
A Japanese Self Defense Force maritime patrol first detected the Russian vessels, which can carry dozens of tanks other military vehicles and hundreds of troops, on Tuesday and monitored them as they passed West from the Pacific Ocean to the Sea of Japan through the narrow Tsuruga Strait separating Japan's main Honshu island from Hokkaido island on Wednesday.
It is unusual for Russian ships to pass through the strait so close to Japanese territory, the military spokesman said.
Armed with anti-tank weapons supplied by the United States and other countries Ukrainian fighters have taken a heavy toll on Russian armour and fuel trucks, meaning Moscow, which describes its attack as a ""special operation,"" may need to reinforce its forces with new equipment. 
NATO allies, which have already supplied 20,000 anti-tank and other weapons to Ukraine, on Wednesday said they would keep helping the country resist the Russian attack.

SEOUL (Reuters) - More than 24 hours after a missile test reportedly ended in a fiery failure over Pyongyang on Wednesday, North Korea had yet to say anything about the incident.
South Korea said a presumed ballistic missile exploded mid-air shortly after it was launched from the international airport near Pyongyang on Wednesday morning.
North Korea's government did not immediately comment on the South's report, and state media had made no mention of a test a day later.
Strikingly, no photos or named eye witnesses had emerged publicly, despite the missile exploding over a city of around three million people.
Human rights activists said the silence underscored the complete control the government wields over communication in the country.
""We shouldn't become numb to how ridiculous and outrageous that is just because its North Korea,"" Sokeel Park, of Liberty in NK, which helps North Korean defectors, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Debris fell in or near Pyongyang after the failed test, Seoul-based NK News reported, citing unnamed witnesses and a photograph it said it had seen of the test showing a red-tinted ball of smoke at the end of a zig-zagging plume that traced the rocket's launch trajectory in the sky above the city.
The website did not release the photograph, citing a need to protect the source.
""If it was London, Istanbul or Seoul imagine our newsfeeds - filled with video, images and eyewitness accounts,"" Park said. ""But it was Pyongyang, so there isn't a SINGLE public image or video. A complete visual blackout for a huge explosion in the sky above an Asian capital in 2022.""

Cell phones have proliferated in North Korea in recent years, but the government retains tight control of phone networks and internet connections, most of which do not link to the outside world.
The country's isolation has deepened amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with border closures choking off most cross-border travel and communication with China, and forcing many foreign embassies and international aid organisations to pull their staff from the country.

KYIV/LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday called Russian leader Vladimir Putin a war criminal in comments the Kremlin said were ""unforgivable"" as it insisted the war in Ukraine was ""going to plan"" amid talk of compromise at peace talks.
Kremlin forces kept up their bombardments of besieged cities, including intensified shelling of the capital Kyiv, and civilians waiting in line for bread and sheltering in a theatre were killed, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials 
Moscow has yet to capture any of Ukraine's biggest cities following its invasion that began on Feb. 24, the largest assault on a European state since World War Two, raising fears of wider conflict in the West.
Putin on Wednesday said he would discuss neutral status for Ukraine and that what he calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarize the country was ""going to plan"". Kyiv and allies say his actions are an unprovoked incursion, and more than 3 million Ukrainians have fled and hundreds have died. 
The United States announced an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine to fight Russia, with the new package including drones, anti-armour and anti-aircraft systems.
""More will be coming as we source additional stocks of equipment that ... we are ready to transfer,"" Biden said, later condemning Putin.
""He is a war criminal,"" he told reporters. 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the comment was ""unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric"", according to Tass news agency.
Ukraine still hopes for a diplomatic solution. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said negotiations were becoming ""more realistic"" and Russia said proposals under discussion were ""close to an agreement."" 
The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said Russian forces had shot dead 10 people waiting in line for bread in Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv. Russia denied the attack and said the incident was a hoax.
Emergency services said rescue workers had found the bodies of five people during searches of shell-hit buildings.
In the besieged southern port of Mariupol, the city council said Russian forces bombed a theatre where civilians were sheltering. The number of casualties was not known.
Russia denied it had carried out an air strike against the theatre. Reuters could not independently verify the information.
Maxar Technologies (NYSE:MAXR), a private U.S. company, distributed satellite imagery that it said was collected on March 14 and showed the word ""children"" in large Russian script painted on the ground outside the red-roofed Mariupol Drama Theatre.
FACEBOOK POSTS REMOVED 
The governor of Zaporizhzhia region said Russian forces had fired artillery at a convoy of evacuees from Mariupol, wounding five people on Wednesday.
Three people were killed and five wounded after shelling caused a fire at a market in eastern Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, emergency services said.
Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said 400 staff and patients were being held hostage at a Mariupol hospital that Russian forces captured on Tuesday.
Moscow denies targeting civilians.
Kyiv's Mayor Vitali Klitschko said Russian shelling caused a fire and damaged private homes and a gas line in the evening after early morning barrages.
Russian troops have halted at the gates of the capital after taking heavy losses.
Ukraine handed over nine captured soldiers to secure the freedom of the mayor of the city of Melitopol, who was detained last week, the Interfax Ukraine news agency quoted a senior official as saying on Wednesday.
And as an information battle goes on alongside fighting, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Wednesday removed official Russian posts that falsely claimed reports of Russia bombing a children's hospital in Ukraine were a hoax. 
Russia has shifted its stance over the bombing that caused outrage around the world with a mix of statements that veered between aggressive denials and a call to establish clear facts.
'DARKEST TIME'
In a speech to the U.S. Congress by video link, Zelenskiy repeated a request for a no-fly zone over Ukraine, something the West won't introduce.
""In the darkest time for our country, for the whole of Europe, I call on you to do more,"" he said. 
NATO defence ministers meeting in Brussels pledged more arms supplies to help Ukraine.
The U.N. Security Council is due to vote on Friday on a Russian-drafted call for aid access and civilian protection, but diplomats say the measure is set to fail because it does not push for an end to the fighting or withdrawal of troops.
Delegations from the two sides were meeting via video conference, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday as efforts continued for a diplomatic solution.
The Kremlin said negotiators were discussing a status for Ukraine similar to that of Austria or Sweden, both members of the European Union that are outside the NATO military alliance.
Ukraine's chief negotiator said Kyiv was still demanding a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian troops, with guarantees.
Zelenskiy has said Ukraine could accept international security guarantees that stopped short of its longstanding aim to join NATO. That prospect has been one of Russia's primary concerns. 
""Neutral status is now being seriously discussed along, of course, with security guarantees,"" Lavrov said. ""There are absolutely specific formulations which in my view are close to agreement.""
Vladimir Medinsky, Russia's chief negotiator, told state TV: ""Ukraine is offering an Austrian or Swedish version of a neutral demilitarised state, but at the same time a state with its own army and navy.""
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the idea ""could really be seen as a compromise"".
Austria and Sweden, the biggest of six EU members outside NATO, both have small militaries that cooperate with the alliance.
DAMAGE TO RUSSIA'S ECONOMY 
Ukrainian forces have withstood an assault by a much larger army but the humanitarian toll is rising. 
Ukraine said about 20,000 people had escaped besieged Mariupol in cars, but hundreds of thousands remain trapped.
The economic fallout is also being felt around the world.
The Biden administration has authorized additional exports of liquefied natural gas from Texas-based Cheniere Energy (NYSE:LNG) in a move that could help Europe deal with a worsening crunch.
Meanwhile, Russia was due to pay $117 million in interest on dollar-denominated sovereign bonds but may pay in roubles instead, amounting to its first default on foreign debt since the Bolshevik revolution. 

Moscow said it had the money, and Washington would be to blame if it cannot pay. 
In his most explicit acknowledgment of the pain inflicted by Western sanctions, Putin said inflation and unemployment would rise, and structural changes to the economy would be needed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged American lawmakers to do more to protect his country from Russia's invasion in an address to the U.S. Congress on Wednesday and pleaded with President Joe Biden to be the world's ""leader of peace.""
""Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people,"" Zelenskiy said in a virtual address before showing graphic video of death and destruction in his country that ended with an appeal to ""close the sky over Ukraine.""
Zelenskiy continued his push for the imposition of a no-fly zone over Ukraine and asked for aircraft and defensive systems to respond to the invasion launched by Russian last month that has unleashed a wave of refugees. He also called for more economic sanctions against Russia.
Ukraine is facing terror that Europe had not experienced since World War Two and the nation's destiny is being decided, Zelenskiy said through an interpreter.
""Is this a lot to ask for - to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine to save people? Is this too much?"" Zelenskiy asked in remarks from Kyiv, a capital city attacked every day that he said ""doesn't give up."" 
Zelenskiy closed with a direct plea in English to Biden: ""I wish you to be the leader of the world. Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace."" 
He received standing ovations before and after his remarks. 
Zelenskiy invoked American history, asking the lawmakers to remember the 1941 Japanese bombing of Hawaii's Pearl Harbor, the 2001 al Qaeda attacks on the United States and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 ""I have a dream"" speech in Washington.
""I have a dream. These words are known to each of you today. I can say: I have a need. I need to protect our sky,"" Zelenskiy said.
Democratic and Republican lawmakers said after the speech that they were ready to do more for Ukraine quickly by clamping down on Russia, providing more military aid including aircraft and tightening global human rights law. But they again rejected a no-fly zone, saying there was too great a risk of wider war with nuclear-armed Russia.
Biden and NATO also have opposed establishing a no-fly zone. The White House has not supported a proposal to help transfer Russian-made MiG warplanes into Ukraine, although that idea has some support in Congress - especially among opposition Republicans.
Zelenskiy said Ukraine is grateful to the United States for its overwhelming support and to Biden ""for his personal involvement, for his sincere commitment to the defense of Ukraine and democracy all over the world.""
""In the darkest time for our country - for the whole Europe - I call on you to do more,"" Zelenskiy added.
The video presented during his remarks showed buildings exploding into fire, dead and wounded people as well as babies cradled by soldiers and police officers.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation.""
BILLIONS IN AID
Biden on Tuesday signed into law $13.6 billion in emergency aid to Ukraine to help it obtain more weaponry and for humanitarian assistance. He previously announced a ban on Russian energy imports and called for a suspension of a trading status that lowers tariffs on Russian exports. The House is expect to vote to suspend that status as soon as this week.
The Senate on Tuesday passed a resolution condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin as a war criminal. 
Zelenskiy, who sought to shore up support for his country in speeches to foreign audiences, on Tuesday made a plea to Canada's parliament for a no-fly zone and more Western sanctions on Russia. He made similar appeals to the British and European parliaments this month.
U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced him with Ukrainian words meaning ""glory to Ukraine."" At the conclusion of his remarks, Zelenskiy waved and put his hand on his chest in thanks for the reception.
Support for Ukraine is a rare instance in which Republicans and Biden's fellow Democrats have aligned in the sharply divided Congress.
""The carnage is not coming from Russian airplanes and the Russian air force, it's coming from the ground and from missiles,"" said Representative Hakeem Jeffries, chairman of the House Democratic caucus, making reference to the proposed no-fly zone.

Republican Representative Liz Cheney said the United States has done a great deal and should do more quickly, noting that Biden can do more on his own.
""The United States has got to lead. Our own freedom and security depends upon it. And there can be no equivocation between our support for Ukraine versus Russia,"" Cheney told reporters.

TOKYO (Reuters) -A powerful magnitude 7.3 earthquake jolted Japan's northeast coast off Fukushima late on Wednesday, leaving two dead and 94 injured and reviving memories of a quake and tsunami that crippled the same region just over a decade earlier.
There were some reports of fire, the government said. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency said on Thursday morning that there had been two confirmed deaths and 94 injured, including four seriously.
The quake was felt in Tokyo, some 275 kilometres (170 miles) away, where the shaking of buildings was long and pronounced. Hundreds of thousands of homes in the capital were plunged into darkness for an hour or more, although power was fully restored by the early hours of Thursday morning.
Authorities cancelled an earlier tsunami warning.
Just before midnight, the quake hit off the coast of Fukushima prefecture at a depth of 60 kilometres, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. It sparked memories of a devastating earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, a week after that disaster's 11th anniversary.
There were no abnormalities at nuclear power plants, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters. The 2011 disaster triggered a meltdown at the Daiichi nuclear plant in Fukushima, an incident Japan is still coming to grips with.
Authorities earlier said a fire alarm had been triggered at a turbine building at the crippled plant.
Separately, a Shinkansen bullet train derailed with some 100 people on board, although there were no reports of injuries. 
Utility Tokyo Electric Power Company said that initially around 2 million households lost power on Wednesday, including 700,000 in the capital. Tohoku Electric Power said around 38,500 homes were still without power as of 7.40am local time Thursday.
Strong quakes in Japan can disrupt manufacturing, particularly of sensitive electronic components such as semiconductors that are made using precision machinery.
The 2011 quake halted production for three months at a factory owned by Renesas Electronics Corp, which makes nearly a third of all microcontroller chips used in cars. A fire at the facility last year exacerbated a chip shortage that has forced auto companies to curb output.

Renesas said it was checking the condition of three of its plants - Naka, Yonezawa and Takasaki - and would provide a statement on whether production has been affected later.
Sitting on the boundary of several tectonic plates, Japan experiences around a fifth of the world's earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) -The U.N. Security Council is due to vote on Friday on a Russian-drafted call for aid access and civilian protection in Ukraine, but diplomats say the measure is set to fail because it does not push for an end to the fighting or withdrawal of Russian troops.
The draft resolution, seen by Reuters, also does not address accountability or acknowledge Russia's invasion of its neighbor.
Britain's U.N. Ambassador Barbara  Woodward  (NASDAQ:WWD) described these as ""glaring omissions"" in a video posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Tuesday and said Russia was ""game playing."" She said Britain would not vote for Russia's draft text. 
""Their resolution calls for parties to respect international humanitarian law, but leaves out the fact that Russia is committing war crimes,"" she said. ""It is their invasion and their actions driving this unfolding humanitarian crisis.""
A Security Council resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, Britain, France or the United States to be adopted. Diplomats said the Russian move would fail because most of the 15 members would likely abstain.
""We are not going to lend credence to Russia's effort to evade accountability, responsibility and culpability for their unprovoked aggression,"" said Olivia Dalton, spokesperson for the U.S. mission to the United Nations. 
Russia put forward the text after France and Mexico withdrew their own push for a council resolution on Ukraine's humanitarian situation because they said it would have been vetoed by Moscow. They instead plan to put it to a vote in the 193-member General Assembly where no country wields a veto.
""We said from the very beginning that we would be prepared to adopt a humanitarian resolution on the situation in Ukraine, provided that this is not a disguise to blame and shame Russia again,"" Russia's U.N. envoy Vassily Nebenzia said on Tuesday.
The Russian-drafted Security Council resolution ""demands that civilians, including humanitarian personnel and persons in vulnerable situations, including women and children are fully protected."" It also calls for safe and unhindered aid access and for the safe passage of people out of Ukraine.
Ukraine and its Western allies have accused Moscow of attacking civilians indiscriminately. Thousands of people have been killed during Russia's invasion, which began on Feb. 24, and several million have been displaced. 

Russia has called its military actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"". It denies attacking civilians and says its air strikes, ground and sea offensive are intended to destroy Ukraine's military infrastructure.
The U.N. Security Council will also meet on Thursday to be briefed on Ukraine, diplomats said, at the request of the United States, Albania, Britain, France, Ireland and Norway.

(Reuters) - The United States is considering removing Iran's Revolutionary Guards from its foreign terrorist organization blacklist in return for Iranian assurances about reining in the elite force, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The source said Washington had not decided what might be an acceptable commitment from Tehran in exchange for such a step, which would reverse former U.S. President Donald Trump's 2019 blacklisting of the group and draw sharp Republican criticism.
The move was the first time Washington had formally labeled part of another sovereign government as a terrorist group.
The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is a powerful faction in Iran that controls a business empire as well as elite armed and intelligence forces that Washington accuses of carrying out a global terrorist campaign.
The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Biden administration was weighing whether to drop the terrorist designation ""in return for some kind of commitment and/or steps by Iran, with respect to regional or other IRGC activities.""
The Biden administration's consideration of such a tradeoff was first reported by Axios, citing Israeli and U.S. sources.
Multiple sources have said dropping the designation is one of the last, and most vexing, issues in wider indirect talks on reviving the 2015 deal under which Iran limited its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions.
Asked about the possibility of removing the IRGC from the U.S. terrorism list, U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price declined comment beyond saying that sanctions relief is at the heart of negotiations to revive the nuclear deal. 
Last week an Iranian official said the IRGC's removal from the blacklist had been under discussion as far back as June but that the issue had become more complicated after last summer's election of hardliner Ebrahim Raisi as Iran's president.
The Iranian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the United States had made clear ""they cannot remove it without major concessions from Iran,"" a stance he said had been rejected by Iran's lead nuclear negotiator, Ali Bagheri Kani.
The IRGC's political influence in Iran's complex power structure has increased since the election of Raisi, who took office in August and whose government includes dozens of Revolutionary Guard commanders.

Raisi's election led to a five-month gap in the indirect U.S.-Iranian talks over reviving the nuclear deal, which Trump abandoned in 2018 and reimposed U.S. sanctions, prompting Iran to start violating its nuclear limits about a year later.
Negotiations resumed in late November, with officials from other parties to the deal - Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia - as well as European Union officials coordinating the talks shuttling between U.S. and Iranian representatives. An agreement would allow Iran to sell its oil abroad.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. federal prosecutors on Wednesday accused Chinese government agents of trying to spy on and intimidate dissidents living in the United States including a congressional candidate.
Justice Department officials said the three criminal cases amounted to ""transnational repression"" by an authoritarian government, including a discussion of assaulting one dissident.
""These cases expose attempts by the government of the People's Republic of China to suppress dissenting voices within the United States and demonstrate how the PRC attempts to stalk, intimidate and silence those who oppose them,"" Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen told a news conference.
In one of the cases, federal prosecutors said a Chinese government agent approached a U.S. private investigator to help manufacture a political scandal that would undermine a China-born man seeking the Democratic nomination to run for a New York seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.
At one point, the Chinese agent proposed that the private investigator consider physically attacking the candidate to prevent his candidacy, according to prosecutors.
""You can start thinking now, aside from violence, what other plans are there,"" the Chinese agent allegedly said. ""But in the end, violence would be fine too. Huh? Beat him, beat him until he cannot run for election.""
The candidate was not identified in court documents, but fits the description of Xiong Yan, who is seeking the Democratic nomination to run for a House seat representing the eastern part of New York's Long Island. The seat is held by Republican Lee Zeldin, who opted to run for governor rather than seek reelection.
Yan did not respond to a request for comment.
In another case, prosecutors said a Long Island resident named Frank Liu approached a private investigator about performing due diligence on two Chinese-born dissidents living in the United States. Liu was charged with conspiring to act in the United States as an agent of a foreign government.
At Liu's initial appearance in Brooklyn federal court on Wednesday afternoon, his lawyer, Edgar Frankbonner, said Liu is a U.S. citizen who has lived in the United States for 38 years. He said there was no evidence Liu had recent contact with China. 
Asked by U.S. Magistrate Judge James Cho if he understood the charges, Liu said through an interpreter: ""I understand it, but I deny all the allegations."" 
Cho set a $1 million bond for Liu, with conditions including that he not visit China's consulate in New York.
In another case, Chinese government agents are accused of planting surveillance equipment in a California-based artist’s workplace and car to spy on him. The agents also allegedly destroyed artwork created by the artist, a Chinese national residing in Los Angeles.
The Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.
""These charges show that both election interference and malign foreign influence remain top priorities for the DOJ,"" said Brandon Van Grack, a former Justice Department lawyer now at Morrison & Foerster who is not involved in the cases.
The United States last year sanctioned Russia for having tried to interfere in the 2020 presidential election, a claim that Russia denies.

Last month the Justice Department ended a program focused on fighting Chinese espionage and intellectual property theft at universities, shifting to address threats from a broader array of hostile nations.
Critics said that initiative, put in place during former President Donald Trump's administration, amounted to racial profiling and that it created a culture of fear that has chilled scientific research.

645,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 05:31PM ET</span>","(Reuters) -Canada will remove the need for incoming fully vaccinated travelers to get tested for COVID-19 before entering the country, starting on April 1, a source familiar with the plan said on Wednesday.
The government is expected to announce the easing of testing requirements for people entering the country by all modes of transport on Thursday, according to the government source, who declined to be named because the plan was not yet public.
Pre-entry testing requirements would still be in effect for partially or unvaccinated travelers.
As the effects of the Omicron COVID wave wanes, the federal government has taken a more cautious approach to easing health restrictions than some of the provincial governments. 
Ontario, Canada's most populous province, said last week it would scrap virtually all pandemic-related public health measures by end-April, citing the reduced threat of the pandemic. Other provinces, including Alberta and Quebec, have also announced an easing of restrictions.

The move could further boost Canadian air carriers who were seeing a bounce in spring travel after a slump due to the spread of coronavirus infections.
The Canadian Broadcasting Corp had reported plans to remove the testing requirement earlier.

communities prevent gun and gang violence, and in banning of more than 1,500 models of assault-style firearms.
Incidents related to gun violence in Canada have jumped 81% since 2009, but the level of gun ownership is low compared to the United States. In Canada, there are 31 firearms per 100 residents, while the US has 89 firearms per 100 residents, according to a Small Arms Survey.
Mendicino said the government will be launching a ""mandatory buy-back program"" to get newly prohibited guns off the streets as part of Liberal government's effort to keep communities safe.
He said the government's action plan to fight crime resulted in a record seizure of trafficked firearms last year.
""Building community resilience through prevention is one of the key pillars of our plan to take action on gun violence...,"" Mendicino said.
Gun related homicides in Canada rose to 277 in 2020 from 223 in 2016, according to official data. In 2020, shootings represented 30% of the 743 homicides in Canada. Still, Canada’s firearm homicide rate was 0.8 per 100,000 people in 2020, and in contrast nearly six in every 100,000 United States residents were killed with a gun in 2020, according to government data.

Canada witnessed its deadliest mass shooting in May 2020, when a gunman armed with weapons that included an assault rifle killed 22 people in Atlantic province of Nova Scotia. Canada banned assault-style weapons in the aftermath of the mass shooting.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) -The United Nations' top court for disputes between states ordered Russia on Wednesday to immediately halt its military operations in Ukraine, saying it was ""profoundly concerned"" by Moscow's use of force.
Although the rulings of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) are binding, it has no direct means of enforcing them, and in rare cases in the past countries have ignored them. 
""The Russian Federation shall immediately suspend the military operations that it commenced on Feb 24, 2022 on the territory of Ukraine,"" the ICJ judges said in a 13-2 decision.
They added that Russia must also ensure that other forces under its control or supported by Moscow should not continue the military operation.
Ukraine filed its case at the ICJ shortly after Russia's invasion began on Feb. 24, saying that Moscow's stated justification, that it was acting to prevent a genocide in eastern Ukraine, was unfounded. 
In addition to disputing the grounds for the invasion, Kyiv also asked for emergency ""provisional"" measures against Russia to halt the violence before the case was heard in full. Those measures were granted on Wednesday.
GENOCIDE
During hearings earlier this month, Ukraine said there was no threat of genocide in eastern Ukraine, and that the U.N.'s 1948 Genocide Convention, which both countries have signed, does not allow an invasion to prevent one.
Ukrainian government forces have been battling Russia-backed separatists in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine since 2014. Kyiv and its Western allies reject Moscow's claims of any genocide being perpetrated against Russian speakers there.
Russia said it had skipped the hearings at the ICJ, also known as the World Court, ""in light of the apparent absurdity of the lawsuit"". It later filed a written document arguing that the court should not impose any measures.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Wednesday welcomed the ruling by the ICJ on emergency mesaures as ""a complete victory"" in its case against Russia. 

""The (ICJ) order is binding under international law. Russia must comply immediately. Ignoring the order will isolate Russia even further,"" Zelenskiy said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
Reading out Wednesday's ruling, presiding judge Joan Donoghue said the court was ""profoundly concerned about the use of force by the Russian Federation in Ukraine which raises very serious issues of international law"".

VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran has defied Western powers by converting some of its uranium enriched to near weapons-grade into a form less easily recovered, diluted and shipped out of the country, a report by the U.N. nuclear watchdog on Wednesday showed.
The move is unlikely to wreck indirect talks between Iran and the United States to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal but it will make it harder to implement any resulting agreement to return to the limits on Iran's stock of enriched uranium. 
U.S. allies France, Britain and Germany, which are involved in the talks, said as much in a joint statement https://www.gov.uk/government/news/e3-statement-to-the-iaea-board-of-governors-on-the-joint-comprehensive-plan-of-action-march-2022 issued last Tuesday in which they demanded that Iran not carry out the work.
""We strongly urge Iran to avoid undertaking any new escalations and in particular, call upon Iran to immediately cease all activity related to conversion of highly enriched uranium, which will have practical implications for returning to JCPoA limits,"" they said in the statement, calling the deal by its full name, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. 
The agreement, which diplomats say is nearing completion, would require Iran to get rid of its stock of uranium enriched above the deal's limit of 3.67% purity. Its most highly enriched uranium is roughly 60%, close to the 90% of weapons grade, of which it has about 33 kg (73 lb).
Until its latest move outlined in last Thursday's International Atomic Energy Agency report to member states, Iran's stock of uranium enriched to up to 60% was all in the form of uranium hexafluoride, the feedstock for uranium-enriching centrifuges. Uranium hexafluoride can easily be diluted and transported, a process delegates at the talks have been discussing for months.
The confidential report, seen by Reuters and summarized in a short statement by the IAEA, said that between March 6 and March 9 the IAEA verified that Iran had converted 2.1 kg (4.6 lb) of its up to 60% uranium into 1.7 kg (3.8 lb) in a different form enriched to the same level suitable for making small ""targets"" for irradiation.
Irradiating such targets produces molybdenum-99, a medical isotope that produces another one widely used in medical diagnostic imaging. What remains of the target includes highly enriched uranium in a form that must be processed to recover it. 

On March 11 and 13 the IAEA verified Iran had produced 32 targets containing a total of 186.7 grams (6.6 ounces) of uranium enriched up to 60%, the report said, adding that Iran later declared they had all been irradiated.
The agency then verified on March 15 that Iran had produced another batch of 56 targets containing a total of 329 grams (11.6 ounces) of uranium enriched to the same level, the report said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A new law bans the United States' former spies from hiring themselves out to foreign governments right after they stop working for Washington. 
The legislation, signed into law by President Joseph Biden on Tuesday as part of a $1.5 trillion spending bill, prohibits U.S. intelligence officials with knowledge of spycraft and national security secrets from selling their services to other countries for 30 months after retiring.
Democratic U.S. Representative Joaquin Castro introduced the legislation to address issues raised in a 2019 Reuters investigation, a congressional aide told Reuters. In a yearlong series, Reuters showed that former National Security Agency hackers helped the United Arab Emirates spy on journalists, dissidents and other Americans.
“We don't want our best trained intel officers going straight into the hands of foreign governments for the sake of money,"" Castro said. ""This discourages intelligence mercenaries and protects our national interest.""
The UAE spying operation, called Project Raven (NASDAQ:RAVN), hacked into Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) accounts and thousands of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhones, targeting activists that human rights groups say were later arrested and tortured. 
While U.S. law has always prohibited intelligence officials from revealing specific national security secrets, previously no rule restricted retired intelligence officers from the Central Intelligence Agency or the NSA from selling their services to foreign governments after retiring. 
On top of the 30-month ban, the new law will require former intelligence officials to report any foreign government work to the U.S. intelligence community and Congress for five years after they leave service.
The law applies to the CIA, the NSA and the more than dozen other American intelligence agencies.
Rhea Siers, a former senior official at the NSA, said the law addresses a critical gap in current law that has allowed American officials to commit grave ethical breaches for personal profit. 
“Even after government employment, intelligence officers have a responsibility to uphold the public trust,” she said. “Personally, I was appalled by what was revealed about Project Raven, especially the involvement in conducting surveillance of U.S. citizens.” 
The law defined work for foreign governments broadly. For example, the prohibition includes work for state-backed companies that are controlled by or receive substantial investments from foreign governments. 
Glenn Gerstell, a former general counsel for the NSA, said that while he is generally supportive of the restrictions, he believes this definition is too broad and could end up preventing security experts from taking up important roles in the private sector. 
“My concern is that it could inadvertently have an effect of making it a little harder for people even to work for companies that we would be perfectly delighted for them to work for,” Gerstell said. 
Over the last decade, governments around the world have created investment funds that buy stakes in private companies, which could be included in the restriction depending on how the law is interpreted as it comes into force in the next six months.

The law allows former spies to apply for an exemption if they can show the foreign work is critical to U.S. national security. Washington has at times encouraged U.S. intelligence contractors to work with allied nations when it was seen as helping America's spying efforts, experts say. 
Gerstell said he hoped the law wouldn’t hinder these kind of legitimate intelligence contracting arrangements. “We rely on our allies. There is nothing evil about working for a foreign government,” he said. “Sometimes it helps us.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -More than 3 million people have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries since Russia invaded on Feb. 24, according to United Nations data https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine, but the United States has only admitted several hundred Ukrainian refugees so far, leaving some critics questioning U.S. government policy.
WHY HASN'T THE U.S. TAKEN IN MORE UKRAINIAN REFUGEES?
U.S. President Joe Biden and his top officials have said the United States stands ready to accept refugees if needed, but the administration has repeatedly signaled that Europe should be the primary destination for Ukrainians.
""We're going to welcome Ukrainian refugees with open arms if, in fact, they come all the way here,"" Biden said on March 11 during a meeting of fellow Democrats in Philadelphia.
Vice President Kamala Harris, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki have made similar comments. Psaki said on March 10 that the administration believes the ""vast majority"" of refugees will want to remain in neighboring countries where many have family, friends and former employers.
The U.S. State Department has said that it will work with the United Nations to bring Ukrainian refugees to the United States in the event they lack protection in Europe, ""bearing in mind that resettlement to the United States is not a quick process.""
Refugee resettlement can take years, though the Biden administration sped up the process for Afghans following the U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan last August. Lessons from that experience could help expedite the resettlement of other refugees, three U.S. officials told Reuters.
WHO IS CALLING FOR MORE REFUGEE ADMISSIONS?
A group of more than three dozen Democratic lawmakers urged Biden in a March 11 letter to increase refugee admissions and allow Ukrainians with family members in the United States to enter faster through a temporary mechanism known as ""humanitarian parole.""
Representative Raul Ruiz, a physician trained in emergency medicine and chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which wrote the letter, traveled to the Poland-Ukraine border earlier this month as part of a delegation of Democrats and Republicans.
""The crisis could overwhelm the countries currently hosting many of the Ukrainian refugees, and the United States must lead in the effort to assist these countries in helping the vulnerable escape war,"" he wrote in the letter to Biden.
Representative Victoria Spartz, a Republican from Indiana and Ukrainian immigrant, was in the delegation and told Fox News that the humanitarian response cannot be neighbor Poland's ""problem alone.""
The urgency of the crisis was underscored by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's wife Olena Zelenska, who told ABC News she was calling on American women to support Ukrainian women and children seeking refuge.
A coalition of more than two dozen Jewish-American organizations also pressed Biden last week to increase admissions of Ukrainian refugees, saying that ""our community knows painfully too well what happens when America shuts its doors to refugees.""
COULD THE U.S. ACCEPT MORE UKRAINIAN REFUGEES? 
The United States admitted only 514 Ukrainian refugees in January and February during Russia's build-up to the war, according to U.S. State Department data. 
Only seven Ukrainian refugees were resettled in the United States from March 1-16, according to internal State Department data seen by Reuters, as the war intensified and the number of Ukrainians fleeing skyrocketed.
Many Ukrainian refugee applicants cleared for travel to the United States were set to depart from inside Ukraine, according to one person familiar with the matter. Those cases were stalled by flight cancellations related to the conflict, leading to the near-shutdown of admissions in March, the person said.
Biden set the overall refugee ceiling for this year at 125,000 after his predecessor Donald Trump, a Republican, slashed admissions to a record-low 15,000, which gutted the program and led to processing delays already worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Biden has set aside 10,000 of the 125,000 refugee slots for people from Europe and Central Asia, which encompasses Ukraine, but that allotment can be expanded if needed, and is expediting certain cases.
WHAT HAPPENS TO UKRAINIANS WHO TRY TO ENTER THE UNITED STATES FROM MEXICO?
Thousands of Ukrainians and Russians have been traveling to the U.S.-Mexico border to seek asylum, a trend that could accelerate as the humanitarian crisis worsens, Reuters reported earlier this month.
During the first five months of this fiscal year, which began last October, U.S. authorities at the southwest border encountered about 1,300 Ukrainians, mostly at ports of entry, compared to about 680 for all of the last fiscal year.
Most Ukrainians have been allowed into the United States to pursue their immigration cases, unlike migrants from other countries who are often expelled to Mexico or other countries under a pandemic-era order known as Title 42. 
Anecdotal reports have surfaced, however, of a handful of Ukrainians arriving at the southwest border in recent days and being refused entry.
IF THE U.S. ISN'T ACCEPTING MANY UKRAINIAN REFUGEES, WHAT IS IT DOING?
The U.S. government is devoting significant economic aid to assist the European countries receiving refugees.
Biden signed into law a spending bill on Tuesday that provides $13.6 billion to help Ukraine and European allies, including about $4 billion to aid people fleeing. 

The U.S. government also announced earlier this month that it will grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to an estimated 75,000 Ukrainians already in the United States.
The status will offer them deportation relief and work permits for 18 months and can be renewed at the end of that period, but will not apply to people who arrived after March 1.

SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korea launched a suspected missile that appeared to explode shortly after liftoff in the skies over Pyongyang on Wednesday, South Korea's military said, amid reports that the nuclear-armed North was seeking to test-fire its largest missile yet.
The United States and South Korea have warned that North Korea may be preparing to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) at full range for the first time since 2017, in violation of United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions.
The projectile was fired from the international airport in Sunan, outside the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said in a statement.
""It is presumed that it failed immediately after launch,"" the statement said. It was presumed to be a ballistic missile and seemed to explode in mid-air while still in its booster phase, at an altitude below 20 kilometres (12 miles), a JCS official told Reuters.
A U.S. Department of State spokesperson said it was a ""ballistic missile launch"" and condemned it as a violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions, but declined to comment when asked about the reported failure.
Debris fell in or near Pyongyang after the failed test, Seoul-based NK News reported, citing unnamed witnesses and a photograph of the test showing a red-tinted ball of smoke at the end of a zig-zagging plume that traced the rocket's launch trajectory in the sky above the city.
The failed launch underscored the danger behind North Korea's decision to use an airport so close to heavily populated civilian areas as a site for test firing large missiles, analysts said.
In 2017, an intermediate-range ballistic missile launched from another location in North Korea failed shortly after liftoff and crashed into an industrial or agriculture complex in the city of Tokchon.
The Sunan airport has been the site of several recent launches, including on Feb. 27 and March 5. North Korea said those tests were for developing components of a reconnaissance satellite and did not identify what rocket it used, but Seoul and Washington said they were tests of a new ICBM system.
SERIES OF NEW MISSILE TESTS 
Reclusive North Korea has fired missiles at an unprecedented frequency this year, conducting its ninth weapons test on March 5, drawing condemnation from the United States, South Korea and Japan.
The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier led military exercises in the Yellow Sea, and air defence artillery at Osan air base in South Korea intensified drills in response to the increased North Korean missile activity, U.S. forces in Asia said on Tuesday.
South Korean Defence Minister Suh Wook and U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) Commander Gen. Paul LaCamera called for maintaining strong defence posture during Suh's visit to Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek, the largest U.S. overseas military base. 
""Our combined military forces provide a credible military deterrence to any adversary or threat who oppose us,"" LaCamera said, according to a statement released by USFK. 
North Korea's newest and largest ICBM system, the Hwasong-17, was first unveiled at a military parade in 2020 and reappeared at a defence exhibition in October 2021.
The Feb. 27 and March 5 launches did not demonstrate the missile's full range, and analysts said the North might have used only one stage of the missile or adjusted its fuel volume to fly at lower altitudes.
North Korea has not tested an ICBM or nuclear bomb since 2017, but has said that it could resume such testing because denuclearisation talks with the United States are stalled.
The government also appears to be restoring some tunnels at its shuttered nuclear test site, U.S. and South Korean officials said last week.
REGIONAL RESPONSE
U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan voiced Washington's serious concerns about the recent escalatory actions"" by North Korea during discussions with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi in Rome on Monday, while holding talks that focused on Ukraine.
Last week, the United States and 10 other countries bemoaned the failure of the U.N. Security Council to condemn North Korea's repeated missile launches.

Washington imposed fresh North Korea-related sanctions on Friday, targeting Russian individuals and companies after the two recent launches.
Russia and China, which backed U.N. sanctions after North Korea's last ICBM and nuclear tests in 2017, have since argued that sanctions should be eased to encourage dialogue.

""We are planning to urgently procure the first MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial systems,"" Lieutenant Colonel Krzysztof Platek, a spokesperson for the Defence Ministry's Armament Agency, said on Wednesday.
While the first drones would be ordered under an accelerated procedure, Poland was also pursuing the Zefir programme under which the purchase of MALE-class unmanned aerial vehicles is being negotiated, Platek told Reuters.
He declined to specify which drones might be ordered.
""We are talking about delivery of several sets in total,"" he later added.
Poland hopes to receive the first drones before the end of the year. The value of the planned acquisition was not disclosed by the ministry.

""This order is an answer to ... security situation, particularly in central and eastern Europe,"" Platek said, referring to the war in Ukraine, Europe's biggest armed conflict since World War Two.
Last May, Poland bought 24 Bayraktar drones from Turkey, becoming the first NATO member to buy drones from Ankara. The same drones were used by Ukraine against invading Russian forces.

653,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 02:13PM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) -President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday delivered a stark warning to Russian ""traitors"" who he said the West wanted to use as a ""fifth column"" to destroy the country.
The Kremlin leader assailed Russians who he said were more mentally in tune with the West than Russia, and said the Russian people would quickly be able to tell the difference between traitors and patriots. 
""Of course they (the West) will try to bet on the so-called fifth column, on traitors - on those who earn their money here, but live over there. Live, not in the geographical sense, but in the sense of their thoughts, their slavish thinking,"" he told government ministers, three weeks into Russia's war with Ukraine.
""Any people, and especially the Russian people, will always be able to distinguish the true patriots from the scum and the traitors, and just to spit them out like a midge that accidentally flew into their mouths.""
The venomous tone was striking even for Putin, who has for years been cracking down on domestic opponents and delivering bitter tirades against the West.
Russian opposition politician Mikhail Kasyanov, who served as Putin's first prime minister in the early 2000s, condemned the remarks on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
""Putin is intensifying his actions to destroy Russia and is essentially announcing the start of mass repressions against those who don't agree with the regime,"" he said. ""This has happened in our history before, and not only ours.""
""SELF-CLEANSING""
Putin said the West was trying to divide Russia and provoke civil confrontation with the help of its ""fifth column"".
""And there is one aim - the destruction of Russia,"" he said, adding that Russia would repel such efforts.
""I am convinced that this natural and necessary self-cleansing of society will only strengthen our country, our solidarity, cohesion and readiness to meet any challenge.""
Russia experts said the message was chilling.
""Putin in an Orwellian way has divided the citizens of Russia into clean and unclean,"" wrote Andrei Kolesnikov, a Moscow-based political analyst.
Since the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, dissent in Russia has become even more dangerous.
A law passed on March 4 makes public actions aimed at ""discrediting"" Russia's army illegal, and bans the spread of fake news, or the ""public dissemination of deliberately false information about the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation"".
Thousands of people have been detained while protesting against the war, which Russia calls a special military operation to demilitarise and ""denazify"" its democratic neighbour.

Several leading independent media organisations have suspended their operations.
Russia has opened at least three criminal cases against people for spreading what it calls fake news about the Russian army on Instagram and other social media, the Investigative Committee law enforcement agency said on Wednesday.

(Reuters) -The United Nations on Wednesday received only $1.3 billion in pledges towards a $4.27 billion aid plan for war-torn Yemen where the humanitarian drive had seen funding dry up even before global attention turned to the conflict in Ukraine.
""We hoped for more and it is a disappointment that we weren't able as yet to get pledges from some we thought we might hear from,"" U.N. aid chief Martin Griffiths told a one-day pledging event co-hosted by Sweden and Switzerland.
He said a second pledging drive for Yemen, where millions face hunger, may be considered in a few months to ""at a minimum reach levels of funding we saw last year"" when donors gave $2.3 billion. 
Among the 36 pledges received on Wednesday, the United States offered $585 million and the European Union and member states together offered $407.4 million. Britain pledged 88 million pounds ($115 million).
Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie, a UNHCR special envoy, visited Yemen last week to draw attention to the humanitarian crisis in which more than 17 million people require food aid.
That number could rise to 19 million in the second half of the year, U.N. bodies said. By December, those experiencing emergency levels of hunger could reach 7.3 million. 
""It is heart-breaking. It is infuriating,"" said Jolie. ""There is nothing more important for Yemen than to end the conflict."" 
Yemen has been mired in violence since the Iran-aligned Houthis ousted the government from the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014, prompting a coalition led by Saudi Arabia to intervene.
Saudi Arabia and coalition partner the United Arab Emirates did not announce new pledges. However Riyadh's King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center said it would continue to support Yemen. 
Aid agencies have already been forced cut back or stop food, health and other vital assistance in Yemen where the economy and basic services have collapsed.
Access to potable water for 4 million people living in major cities may be lost in coming weeks and women may lose healthcare services, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. 
""We cannot cut people adrift from humanitarian aid,"" he warned. 
Food prices, which doubled last year due to a coalition blockade on Houthi-held areas, are set to rise further since a third of the country's wheat comes from Russia and Ukraine.
Across Yemen, 2.2 million children are acutely malnourished.
In Aden's Keraa camp, Abdo Yehya has seen no aid this year.
""We survive with the help of our son who collects empty plastic bottles and metal cans and sells them, and ... the kindness of people,"" he said. ""We are exhausted.""
The World Food Programme warned on Monday that without substantial new funding mass starvation and famine would follow.
Donor budgets have been strained by the pandemic, the Afghanistan crisis and now Russia's invasion of Ukraine. There are also concerns over allegations of Houthi interference in aid flows. The Houthis previously told Human Rights Watch the allegations were “baseless”.
UAE Foreign Affairs Minister of State Sheikh Shakhboot al-Nahyan accused the Houthis of diverting aid and urged them to engage in peace negotiations.

The Saudi-based Gulf Cooperation Council plans to invite Yemeni parties including the Houthis for consultations in Riyadh starting this month in support of U.N.-led peace efforts.

655,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 01:36PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Idaho's Senate has blocked a controversial bill that would have outlawed gender-affirming healthcare for transgender children under the age of 18.
Republican leaders in the Idaho Senate halted the advancement of the bill on Tuesday, saying it undermined parental rights and amounted to government overreach, even as they affirmed their staunch opposition to any kind of trans-related medical care.
""We believe in parents' rights and that the best decisions regarding medical treatment options for children are made by parents, with the benefit of their physician's advice and expertise,"" Republican Senate leaders said in a statement https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Idaho-Senate-Republicans-Statement-on-HB-675-4.pdf released late on Tuesday.
The Republican-sponsored legislation would have made it a felony for anyone to provide gender-affirming surgeries and medications like puberty-blockers by amending existing provisions on female genital mutilation. It also would have criminalized taking a child across state lines to receive that care. 
Idaho's House had overwhelmingly passed the bill last week. 
The Senate's action marked a victory for LGBTQ groups, medical professionals and civil liberties advocates opposing moves by conservative politicians in dozens of states to criminalize gender-affirming treatments for trans youth.
Numerous medical associations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, support these treatments, calling them potentially life saving. 
Republican lawmakers have sought this year to pass a number of measures limiting trans healthcare, an issue that has emerged as a key front in the culture wars ahead of the November mid-term congressional elections. 
Last week, a Texas judge temporarily blocked the state from investigating parents who provide their transgender children with gender-affirming care. Governor Greg Abbott has called such care ""child abuse.""

The state's attorney general, Ken Paxton, appealed the injunction. It remains unclear whether investigations into parents are continuing while the matter rests with the courts.
In Alabama, legislation seeking to criminalize anyone who provides gender-affirming healthcare to minors could be voted on in the state's House this week.

656,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 01:31PM ET</span>","STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Ukraine could become a non-aligned or neutral state like Sweden or Austria, Russia said on Wednesday, as it seeks a compromise with Kyiv to end three weeks of war.
Here are some facts about the military status of Sweden and Austria, which are both members of the European Union but not of the NATO military alliance. Ukraine has previously said it wants to join both organisations, a stance that helped prompt Russia's decision to invade its southern ex-Soviet neighbour on Feb. 24.
SWEDEN
- Sweden was neutral in World War Two and part of the non-aligned movement during the Cold War, though it secretly cooperated with the United States in providing sensitive information on the Soviet Union.
- It gave up its formal neutrality when it joined the EU in 1995 and replaced it with a policy of military non-alignment. 
- It has increased links to NATO in recent years and regularly participates in military exercises. Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson recently rejected calls for membership, saying it would destabilise Europe's security.
- Sweden has participated in NATO and U.N. missions, for example in Mali, Afghanistan and Iraq, though usually in roles such as training and communications support.
- It cooperates closely with a number of countries on defence matters, including the United States, France and neighbouring Finland, which is also not a NATO member. 
- Sweden is part of the Joint Expeditionary Force, a British-led quick-response force with a focus on the High North, the North Atlantic and the Baltic Sea region.
- None of its allies is formally committed to fighting alongside Sweden if it were invaded. 
- After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Sweden said it plans to increase military spending to 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) as soon as possible, the level NATO members are required to meet, though most currently do not.
AUSTRIA
- Moscow made Austria's neutrality, modelled on Switzerland's, a condition of its independence when the country's occupation by the four Allied forces after World War Two ended in 1955. 
- Austria effectively became a buffer zone between the eastern bloc and the West, but the countries surrounding it are now all NATO member states with the exceptions of Switzerland and tiny Liechtenstein.
- Austria has a relatively small and underfunded military. Its defence spending was just 0.6% of GDP in 2020, the second-lowest level in the EU after Malta, Eurostat statistics show, well below the EU average of 1.3%. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer has suggested increasing it to at least 1%.

- Austria is a partner to NATO, and takes part in operations with a U.N. mandate under NATO command, such as the KFOR peacekeeping force in Kosovo.
- Austria does not usually allow foreign powers to use or pass through its territory unless they are acting under a U.N. Security Council mandate.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The United States and other NATO members said on Wednesday they would keep helping Ukraine fight off Russia's invasion, while also adapting the alliance's own security to the ""new reality"" triggered by the war.
Diplomats and military analysts estimate that NATO allies have sent more than 20,000 anti-tank and other weapons to Ukraine since the invasion started on Feb. 24. 
""We remain united in our support of Ukraine,"" U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said at an emergency meeting of NATO defence ministers in Brussels. ""We support their ability to defend themselves and will continue to support them.""
NATO countries will continue to deliver weapons to Ukraine even as those deliveries could become the target of Russian attacks, Dutch defence minister Kajsa Ollongren told reporters, adding: ""Ukraine has the right to defend itself.""
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation” that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.
Ukraine is not a member of NATO. Although it has repeatedly said it wants to join to benefit from its protection, Kyiv said on Tuesday it understood it does not have an open door to NATO membership and was seeking other types of security guarantees.
Fearing that an attack on NATO territory was also part of Moscow's broader military plans, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that defence ministers agreed to tell military commanders to draw up plans for new ways to deter Russia.
Those plans will likely be approved by NATO leaders at a summit in Madrid in June and will also be discussed briefly next Thursday by leaders when they meet in Brussels at allied headquarters in a bid to show unity.
""We must reset out collective defence and deterrence for the longer term. Today we tasked our military commanders to develop options across all domains - land, air, sea, cyber and space,"" Stoltenberg told a news conference.
Stoltenberg said any new ""posture"" would involve more troops in eastern Europe, more air and missile defences, more aircraft carriers and submarines at sea and possibly the use of defensive weapons on computer networks and in space.
However, diplomats said NATO wants to avoid directly stating its plans, or what would trigger its ""Article 5"" collective defence pledge, saying ""strategic ambiguity"" is also a defensive instrument against any Russian aggression.

""The surprise for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin was the West was so united. He didn't believe that. He has the wrong picture about western countries,"" Estonian Defence Minister Kalle Laanet said.
""We can't be afraid, we have to stay calm, because Putin would like to see that everybody is afraid.""

AHMEDABAD/LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - Hardline Hindu groups are demanding restrictions on wearing the hijab in classrooms in more Indian states after a court upheld a ban on the traditional Islamic head-scarf in Karnataka state, worrying Muslim students who had protested against the ban.
The Karnataka High Court decision on Tuesday, backing the southern state's ban on the hijab in February, has also been welcomed by top federal ministers from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), who say students should avoid wearing religious clothing in class. [L2N2VI09V]
A female Muslim student has already appealed the verdict in the country's highest court, which could take up the matter later this month, her lawyer said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Wednesday.
There is no national guideline on uniforms in India, and states often leave it to schools to decide what their students should wear.
""We are a Hindu nation and we do not want to see any kind of religious outfit in educational institutes of the country,"" said Rishi Trivedi, president of the Hindu-first group Akhil Bharat Hindu MahaSabha.
""We welcome the court verdict and want the same rule to be followed throughout the country.""
The ban in BJP-ruled Karnataka had sparked protests by some Muslim students and parents, and counter-protests by Hindu students. Critics of the ban say it is another way of marginalising the Muslim community that accounts for about 13% of Hindu-majority India's 1.35 billion people.
Leaders of the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), an affiliate of the RSS, the BJP's parent organisation, said they have asked for a hijab ban in Modi's home state of Gujarat and would soon write to the country's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh. The BJP is in power in both states.
""The hijab is not allowed in the defence forces, police, and government offices, then why the insistence on hijab in schools and colleges?"" said VHP's Gujarat secretary, Ashok Raval. ""It is an attempt to raise communal tensions.""
Gujarat Education Minister Jitu Vaghani declined to comment. A state minister and a bureaucrat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was no immediate plan to ban the hijab in schools.
Officials in Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP retained control in recent state elections, declined to comment saying a decision will only be taken by the next administration which should be in place in days.
Ayesha Hajeera Almas - who had challenged the Karnataka ban in court - said there is a real fear that the hijab ban will now go national.
The 18-year-old said she has not attended school since late December after its authorities barred Muslim girls from wearing the hijab, even before the state-wide ban came in early February.

""Increasingly, we feel we are living in an India where its citizens are not treated equally,"" Almas said from the Karnataka district of Udupi, from where the protests began.
""I am fighting for myself, fighting for my sisters, fighting for my religion. I'm scared that there will be changes like this in the whole country. But I hope it does not happen.""

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the new U.S. assistance in a video appearance before a conference in which the U.N. is seeking nearly $4.3 billion in additional aid for the war-torn country.
The conflict pits the internationally recognized Yemeni government, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement.
The European Union pledged $407.4 million, while the United Kingdom pledged 88 million pounds.
Blinken noted that humanitarian funding began drying up earlier this year - before attention was diverted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine - forcing the closure or reduction of two-thirds of U.N. programs and cuts in food rations for 8 million Yemenis.
""The Russian government's unprovoked aggression in Ukraine threatens a significant source of Yemen's imported wheat. Just in the first week alone, many Yemenis saw the bread price shoot up 50 percent,"" he said.

""To help meet the urgent needs today the United States is announcing before announcing the new U.S. contribution of $585 million, nearly $585 million in new humanitarian aid to Yemen,"" he said.
This takes the total U.S. contribution to Yemen since the start of the conflict to $4.5 billion, Blinken said.

LONDON (Reuters) - As Vladimir Putin looks out from behind the Kremlin's red walls, Russia's paramount leader of 22 years has a riddle to solve: how to win a war in Ukraine that the West says he has already lost.
Three weeks into its invasion, Russia is battling fierce resistance from Western-armed Ukrainian forces. It has yet to achieve its stated aims and its heavily sanctioned economy faces the deepest crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. 
Russia, where journalists risk jail if they use the term ""invasion"", says its special military operation is going to plan and that despite sanctions it can fare well without what it casts as a deceitful and decadent West led by the United States.
Putin, who works from an office in the Kremlin's 18th century Senate Palace, is expected to decide soon whether to press on with a war that has already killed thousands of people and displaced several million, or to seek some sort of peace that would allow him to claim victory. 
""There is a small chance of a peaceful resolution,"" one high-ranking Russian official told Reuters on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation. ""Something will be decided in the next three days to a week.""
A second senior Russian source said the president would consider a peaceful resolution on Russia's terms and that there was a window of opportunity for some sort of agreement. 
That could indicate a belief in the Kremlin that Russia can achieve many of its goals without a prolonged war in Ukraine. 
Launching the invasion on Feb. 24, Putin listed his key aims as halting NATO's eastward enlargement and ending what he called the ""genocide"" of Russian-speaking people by ""nationalists and neo-Nazis"" in Ukraine since Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who is Jewish and a native Russian speaker, and his Western supporters says Putin's claims are baseless.
'ON PAUSE'
Putin's looming decision will shape the course of European history and determine how much more carnage Ukraine's 44 million people will have to endure. It might also determine how long the former KGB spy remains as Russia's president.
Putin said on March 11 there were some ""positive shifts"" in ongoing talks with Ukraine but gave no details. Zelenskiy said on Wednesday that the talks ""sound more realistic"", and Russian Foreign Minster Sergei Lavrov said there was ""some hope of reaching a compromise"".
A Russian military source said there had been a change in orders in recent days.
""Everything is on pause,"" said the source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. ""There has been a clear change of tactics by our troops. The active advance has been halted.""
Attempts to take Kyiv and other major cities would mire Russian forces in bloody urban warfare against a population which views them as an occupying force
Pushing far into western Ukraine would strain Russian logistics, and its forces do not need to control the whole of Ukraine to achieve most of Putin's aims. 
PARTITION?
From a Russian perspective, the contours of a compromise would have to include a significant loss of territory for Ukraine possibly totalling at least 120,000 square km - equivalent to the U.S. state of Mississippi.
This would include Crimea, two Russian-backed rebel regions in eastern Ukraine and most likely swathes of other territory now held by Russian troops, notably that linking Russia to Crimea along Ukraine's southeastern flank and maybe further west, sharply reducing Kyiv's access to the Black Sea.
It is unclear how much territory - if any - Kyiv might be ready to surrender as part of the price for peace. It is also unclear what would happen to the people living in those affected areas. Most would probably not want to become Russian citizens, especially after such a devastating war.
At least publicly, Zelenskiy and his ministers say they would never accept Russia's annexation of any Ukrainian land.
Besides partition, Russia wants a neutral Ukraine that has formally renounced any plan ever to join the NATO alliance.
Zelenskiy said this week Ukraine was prepared to accept security guarantees from the West that stop short of NATO membership.
Vladimir Medinsky, Russia's chief negotiator in the talks, told Russian state television on Wednesday: ""Ukraine is offering an Austrian or Swedish version of a neutral, demilitarised state, but at the same time a state with its own army and navy.""
Putin said on Wednesday that Russia remained open for talks on Ukraine's neutrality and its demilitarisation.
Kyiv's chief negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, said a model of legally binding security guarantees that would offer Ukraine protection by a group of allies in the event of a future attack was ""on the negotiating table"".
The United States has sounded more downbeat on the prospects for any swift end to the conflict.
U.S. intelligence chiefs said on March 8 that Putin would intensify his assault on Ukraine despite the heavy cost in human life - including of Russian soldiers - and in sanctions which have effectively cut Russia off from much of the global economy. 

""Putin is angry and frustrated right now,"" William Burns, the Russian-speaking director of the Central Intelligence Agency who served as a U.S. ambassador to Moscow, told the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee.
""He's likely to double down and try to grind down the Ukrainian military with no regard for civilian casualties.""

SANTA ANA, Calif. (Reuters) - California property developers Ryan and Jeremy Ogulnick converted an industrial space into their first shelter in just under a month, helping the city of Santa Ana address its homeless crisis while they made a profit. 
The brothers then repeated the model in the neighboring Orange County cities of Anaheim and Fullerton, converting properties into 100- and 150-bed shelters in a matter of months. 
Such shelters have given a second chance to people like Roland Flores, 48, who was living with his grandmother as a caretaker and lost the home when she died. Now a resident at the Fullerton shelter, he is seeing a dentist and has been able to acquire his birth certificate and Social Security card during his nine-month stay. 
""They're giving me the tools that I need. And the right mindset that I'm going to need to be able to succeed on my own,"" Flores said of the shelter staff, run by the non-profit Illumination Foundation. 
Ryan Ogulnick, CEO of Vineyards Development, says he could build 50 such shelters across Southern California if the money was available. Instead of leasing the spaces to the private sector, they are rented to a city or homeless services providers at the market rate.
""It's such a simple solution,"" said Ogulnick, whose company invested $9.2 million to rebuild the new Santa Ana Carnegie Shelter over nine months and will rent it to the Illumination Foundation and the city for $44,000 per month when it opens next week. It will replace the 200 beds of the original Santa Ana shelter, which was only meant to be temporary and closed a year ago.
Quick and efficient though they may be, these emergency shelters are a short-term fix. With affordable housing scarce and real estate continuing to rise in one of California's priciest markets, some critics are concerned Orange County is content to shunt the unhoused out of view without promoting permanent housing. 
""It's very clear that the strategy being used right now in Orange County is more about appearances than solutions,"" said attorney Brooke Weitzman, co-founder of ELDR Center, a law office representing people who are homeless, seniors and have disabilities. 
Jurisdictions across the country face similar challenges. The United States was about 7 million units short of sufficient affordable housing, according to a 2021 study by the National Low Income Housing Coalition. 
Katrina Foley, one of five members of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, said bold solutions were too often sacrificed in favor of politics, because ""the election cycle always gets in the way."" 
""We've got to figure out a way to develop owner-occupied housing that's affordable,"" said Foley, who advocates converting more vacant buildings and rezoning appropriate areas for greater density to increase the housing stock. 
'WE NEED MORE HOUSING'
In nearby Los Angeles, where the issue is dominating the mayoral race, the county's homeless population is estimated at 66,000, with expanding tent cities on the sidewalks of Downtown L.A., Hollywood and Venice Beach. 
Orange County, a generally more affluent and politically conservative area just to the south, has a homeless population of some 7,000 people, nearly 60% unsheltered, according to the latest completed count in 2019. 
Shelters proliferated after a 2018 federal appeals court ruling banned police from arresting people on the streets if a community lacks enough shelter beds. 
Emergency shelter beds in Orange County grew 159% from 2015 to 2021, to 2,857, according to Orange County Homeless Management Information System data. By contrast, permanent supportive housing, defined as housing combined with social services, grew by just 13% over that same time period, to 2,602 beds.
""Instead of building actual, subsidized affordable housing, what they've done is throw up mass shelters,"" said Eve Garrow, homelessness policy analyst and advocate at the ACLU of Southern California.
Paul Leon, president and CEO of the Illumination Foundation, agrees more housing is needed but says many people are unprepared to go immediately from the street to maintaining a household.
His foundation has operated all the shelters built by the Ogulnicks, offering an array of support services including healthcare and mental health and substance abuse counseling. 
The Ogulnicks converted a former engineering company in a light industrial zone into the 150-bed Fullerton Navigation Center. In an attempt to reduce complaints from neighbors, the shelter bans residents from walking in and out, which keeps them out of public view. Shelter van drivers take residents in and out through a side gate deep within a parking lot.
Leon says most people with support move from the streets to homes. Some of those who do not may die, go to jail, or end up back on the street.
""That tells us we need more housing,"" Leon said.

Weitzman, who is skeptical of Ogulnick's claims about the speed and cost-effectiveness of shelters, said the best solution to homelessness has always been housing.
""When people are homeless, they're those homeless folks,"" Weitzman said. ""And when people are housed, they're your neighbors.""

663,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 10:46AM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) -President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia would achieve its goals in Ukraine and would not submit to what he called a Western attempt to achieve global dominance and dismember Russia.
Putin said Russia was ready to discuss neutral status for Ukraine, three weeks into a war that has killed thousands of people and forced millions of Ukrainians to flee their homes.
He said that what Russia calls its special military operation was ""going to plan"".
In a televised speech to government ministers, Putin went further than before in acknowledging the pain that Western sanctions were inflicting on the economy, but insisted that Russia could withstand the blow.
There was no sign of any softening in his bitter invective against the West and Ukraine.
""In the foreseeable future, it was possible that the pro-Nazi regime in Kyiv could have got its hands on weapons of mass destruction, and its target, of course, would have been Russia,"" Putin said.
Putin has consistently described the democratically elected leaders of Ukraine as neo-Nazis bent on committing genocide against Russian-speakers in the east of the country - a line that the West denounces as baseless war propaganda.
He said Western countries wanted to turn Russia into a ""weak dependent country; violate its territorial integrity; to dismember Russia in a way that suits them"".
If the West thought that Russia would break down or back down, ""they don't know our history or our people"", Putin said on the 21st day of the war.
""Behind the hypocritical talk and today's actions of the so-called collective West are hostile geopolitical goals. They just don't want a strong and sovereign Russia.""
He said Russia was ready to discuss Ukraine's neutral status in talks:
""The question of principle for our country and its future – the neutral status of Ukraine, its demilitarisation, and its denazification – we were ready and we are ready to discuss as part of negotiations.""
Ukraine says it is willing to negotiate to end the war but will not surrender or accept Russian ultimatums.
In his most explicit acknowledgment of the pain inflicted by Western sanctions, Putin said inflation and unemployment would rise, and structural changes to the economy would be needed. But he promised support to families with children.

He said the West had in effect declared Russia in default as part of its sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine, but that the conflict had been only a pretext for the West to impose those sanctions.
""The West doesn't even bother to hide that their aim is to damage the entire Russian economy, every Russian,"" Putin said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A juror in Ghislaine Maxwell's sex trafficking trial who did not reveal before trial that he was sexually abused as a child was seeking ""15 minutes of fame,"" the British socialite's lawyers argued on Monday, but prosecutors said she got a fair trial. 
Maxwell, 60, was convicted in December of helping the late financier Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse teenage girls. She has requested a new trial because of the juror's false statements.
In a hearing last week in Manhattan federal court, the juror - identified as Juror No. 50 - said he falsely answered ""no"" when asked before trial if he had ever been the victim of sexual abuse or other crimes.
In a Monday night letter to U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan, Maxwell lawyer Bobbi Sternheim pointed to social media posts he made after the trial announcing he had served on the jury as ""strong evidence"" of his bias. 
""Juror 50 was not looking to avoid notice. He was looking to soak up his 15 minutes of fame,"" Sternheim wrote. 
Prosecutors in a Monday night letter argued that Maxwell could not show that Juror 50 was biased because he asserted during jury selection that he would be fair and impartial and would decide the case based on the evidence. 
The juror testified at last week's hearing that he made a ""huge mistake"" and answered incorrectly because he rushed through the screening questionnaire. Sternheim said that explanation was not credible. 
""Juror 50 does not want to be responsible for the retrial of Ghislaine Maxwell, so he attempted to give innocuous explanations for his false questionnaire responses,"" Sternheim said.
Todd Spodek, a lawyer for the juror, declined to comment. 
Nathan has not yet ruled on Maxwell's request for a new trial. 
Experts told Reuters that cases where verdicts were overturned largely involved jurors who deliberately omitted information to try to get on the panel. Last week, Juror No. 50 said he did not deliberately lie.

In a January interview with Reuters after the verdict, the juror identified himself by his first and middle names, Scotty David, and said he did not recall the question on the form, but that he would have answered honestly.
Epstein died by suicide at age 66 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

In her first television interview since her on-air protest on Monday, Marina Ovsyannikova said the harrowing images from Ukraine had jolted her own childhood memories of growing up in Chechnya, the southern region torn apart by war after the breakup of the Soviet Union. 
""I absolutely do not feel like a hero...You know, I really want to feel like this sacrifice was not in vain, and that people will open their eyes,"" the editor at Channel One told Reuters from Russia.
""I believe in what I did but I now understand the scale of the problems that I'll have to deal with, and, of course, I'm extremely concerned for my safety,"" Ovsyannikova said.
Thousands of Russians have been detained for taking to the streets to protest the war but Ovsyannikova went further, holding up an anti-propaganda sign behind a studio presenter reading the news at prime time and shouting anti-war slogans.
State TV is a vital platform for the Kremlin, which portrays the invasion as a ""special military operation"" essential to prevent what it says is genocide against Russian-speakers.
Ukraine and the West dismiss that justification as a false pretext for an invasion of a sovereign country. 
""The worst thing is when Ukrainians ring Russians and Russians ring Ukrainians, there's always a conflict because the media and propaganda have divided us and put us on opposing sides of the barricades,"" Ovsyannikova said. 
The 43-year-old, whose father was Ukrainian, said she had no plans to leave Russia. 
She told Reuters she was held in a police station and questioned overnight and had no access to a lawyer until the following afternoon when she was taken to court and fined 30,000 roubles ($280). 
The Kremlin denounced her act of protest as ""hooliganism"" and commended Channel One for its news coverage. 
Reuters submitted a written request on Wednesday to ask the interior ministry for further comment on her case and whether legal proceedings had been closed. 
Her case stirred fears among her sympathisers that she could be prosecuted under new legislation criminalising actions that discredit the Russian army with a jail term of up to 15 years.
Ovsyannikova, mother to children aged 11 and 17, said she hoped she would not face criminal charges.
""If I end up having to serve time in jail for what I believe in then I hope it's a minimal sentence,"" she said. 
MEMORIES OF CHECHNYA 
Ovsyannikova said she had initially supported President Vladimir Putin, but had grown disillusioned with politics and that the war in Ukraine had first reduced her to a state of shock and then tipped her over the edge. 
""The war in Ukraine was like a trigger for me. Very vivid images from my childhood (in Chechnya) came flooding back. I understood… I could feel what those unfortunate people (in Ukraine) are going through. It's really beyond the pale,"" she said. 
As a child, she lived in Chechnya's Grozny and remembers gathering up her things and having to leave suddenly in 1991 as the southern Russian region where the Russian army later fought two wars to put down a separatist and Islamist movement. 
""There was shelling, I was 12 years old, we gathered up our things and left,"" she said. 
She first considered taking to a square near the Kremlin to protest, but concluded that would have little actual effect. 

She said she wanted not only to protest against the war but also to sent a message to Russians directly:
""Don't be such zombies; don't listen to this propaganda; learn how to analyse information; learn how to find other sources of information - not just Russian state television.""

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukrainian nurse Oksana Martynenko and her colleagues have 21 babies to look after at a makeshift clinic in a residential basement on the outskirts of Kyiv - all of them surrogates whose parents cannot come to collect them because of the war.
All the while she has her own family to worry about. Her children are in the region around Sumy, a city some 200 miles (320 km) east of the capital which has been bombarded by Russian forces.
It is too dangerous for Martynenko to try to reach them, so they are living with their grandmother.
""We haven't been able to get home since Feb. 24,"" she told Reuters on Tuesday, as she changed one of the baby's diapers.
""I am from Sumy region, but I cannot go there. I have children at home ... They (the Russians) started to bombard our town yesterday. We wait for news every day about what is happening there ... But we cannot leave these babies.""
Martynenko calls her family when she can to see if they are safe and whether they managed to sleep at night. Ukrainians across the country are dashing between homes and air raid shelters as advancing Russian forces attack cities and towns.
""It is not their fault that it happened,"" she said of the babies in her care. ""It is not their fault that parents cannot come to take them. So we stay here, we are coping and helping them with what we can.""
In the bare surroundings of the clinic, one nurse pushes a baby carriage with one hand and holds an infant in the other as she and her colleagues comfort the children. Babies lie in a line of small plastic beds and bottles are stacked up to be sterilized.
Staff said that two couples - one from Germany and one from Argentina - had made it to Kyiv to unite with their surrogate children, but it was not clear when they would be able to take them out of the country.
'TERRIFYING'
Ukraine is an international surrogacy hub, involving thousands of babies each year in normal times, according to some estimates, many of them taken abroad by foreigners.
The practice has raised concerns among rights groups and some former surrogate mothers over the physical and psychological cost of the process and the risk of exploitation of women and their babies in poorer countries.
The infants in the Kyiv clinic were born in various maternity wards in the capital, and have been brought to one place for their safety.
Heavy fighting has raged around Sumy in Ukraine's northeast since Moscow launched what it calls a ""special operation"" on Feb. 24 to demilitarise and ""denazify"" its neighbour, a claim Ukraine rejects as a pretext for an unjustified invasion.
Thousands of people have been killed, millions have fled the country, and towns and cities have been badly damaged by shelling, air strikes and fighting. Russia denies targeting civilians.
So far, Kyiv has been spared the worst of the fighting, but the Russian military is slowly closing in on the city and the shelling has intensified. At least five people were killed in shelling and air strikes on the city on Tuesday.
An exhausted Antonina Yefymovych, also a nurse, said that staff were trapped and working around the clock to care for the children.

""We don't have time to rest now ... We try to take short naps, to swap. It is tough, tough,"" Yefymovych said.
With the bombardment intensifying, the explosions are getting louder. ""It is terrifying indeed.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration will grant temporary deportation relief and work permits to Afghans without permanent legal status but who are currently in the U.S., a move that could aid those evacuated after last year's U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.
The grant of so-called Temporary Protected Status (TPS) will be available to 72,500 Afghans who entered on what is known as ""humanitarian parole,"" another temporary status, as part of the U.S. evacuation of at-risk Afghans last summer, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said on Wednesday. 
The TPS designation would also cover about 2,000 Afghans who entered the United States on student, employment and tourist visas and can no longer return to their home country following the Taliban takeover in August. 
The designation will be available to those living in the United States by March 15 and last for 18 months, the DHS said, although the status could be renewed.
The Islamist Taliban overran Afghanistan in August as the former Western-backed government collapsed with surprising speed and the last U.S. troops withdrew after 20 years of war.
U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, has greatly expanded the number of immigrants eligible for humanitarian protection under TPS, reversing the restrictive approach of his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump.
The program allows foreign nationals who cannot return to their home countries due to violent conflict, natural disasters or other extraordinary circumstances the ability to stay and work in the United States legally for a defined period of time.
Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a related announcement that the status would protect Afghans from having to return to dangerous conditions and aid ""trusted partners and vulnerable Afghans who supported the U.S. military, diplomatic, and humanitarian missions in Afghanistan over the last 20 years.""
About 80,000 Afghans have been resettled in the United States as part of ""Operation Allies Welcome,"" the largest effort of its kind since the Vietnam War era.

Certain evacuees who entered the United States through humanitarian parole may be eligible for U.S. government cash and medical benefits, making them less likely to use the TPS program in the near-term.
Afghans who entered on parole can apply for asylum in the United States, but the Biden administration has urged Congress to pass legislation that would offer them a more direct path to citizenship.

It fears the attack, described by President Vladimir Putin as a ""special operation"", threatens international norms and could embolden neighbouring China to use its military in East Asia.
""Japan's loud voice has made this a global response, because what happens in Ukraine does not stay in Ukraine,"" the U.S. ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, said at the Yokota event. 
Emanuel and Oniki were joined by the deputy chief of Ukraine's embassy in Tokyo, Oleksandr Semeniuk, who described Russia as neo-Nazi.
Japan, which renounced the right to wage war after its World War Two defeat, follows strict rules that ban weapon exports to conflict zones or countries not subject to United Nations resolutions.

DONGYIN, Taiwan/TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan held live fire drills in its northernmost territory on Wednesday, putting the spotlight on a remote island that is strategically located at a chokepoint near China - and potentially vulnerable to attack.
Although the defence ministry says the exercises on Dongyin, part of the Taiwan-controlled Matsu archipelago off the coast of China's Fuzhou, are routine, they are happening as Taipei has raised its alert level after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, wary of Beijing making a similar move.
Soldiers fired shells at a floating red cross in the water, meant to represent advancing enemy forces. Piercing the calm blue sea, each shell sent spray upwards.
The echoes of machine guns, punctuated by cannon fire, reverberated around the rugged coastline. 
Although Taiwan has not reported any unusual activities by Beijing since the Ukraine war began, on Feb. 5 a small, propeller-driven Chinese aircraft flew very close to Dongyin. The highly unusual event thrust the normally sleepy islet into the headlines. 
Taiwan said they suspected China was deploying a civilian aircraft to test the responses of its military.
Taiwan does not publish details of its military presence there, but the Dongyin Area Command has been at the front line of Taiwan's defences since the 1950s.
Chieh Chung, researcher at the National Policy Foundation, a Taipei-based think tank, said Dongyin's forces are equipped with Taiwan's self-made Hsiung Feng II anti-ship missile as well as Sky Bow II surface-to-air missiles, making it ""the most strategically important"" outlying island. 
Rocky Dongyin, reached by overnight boat from northern Taiwan's Keelung port and home to some 1,500 civilians, sits on an important passage for any southbound Chinese forces from the eastern province of Zhejiang if they attack Taiwan. 
""That's why Dongyin is equipped with the Hsiung Feng and Sky Bow missiles. Dongyin poses a very direct threat to the Chinese Communist's air and naval movements,"" Chieh said.
At a February seminar in Taipei simulating a Chinese attack on Taiwan, retired Navy Rear Admiral Tan Chih-lung said Dongyin's missile sites would be among the first targets of a Chinese attack.
""The People's Liberation Army for sure will go destroy the Hsiung Feng missile base in Dongyin,"" he said. ""It's a must-attack.""
A security official familiar with the deployment in Dongyin put the number of the troops there at around 1,100. 
""The missile base there is at the very front lines to counter any attack with our missiles. If not for that, why would we value such a small place where the port is too small for bigger military ships and where there's no airport for the air force?"" said the official, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
A second security source acknowledged that the Chinese aircraft that got close to Dongyin had highlighted its vulnerability and proved it was of great interest to China. 
""It's the key to control of the northern part of the Taiwan Strait,"" the source added.
SOUNDS OF GUNFIRE
Taiwan has governed Matsu, and Kinmen to its south, since the defeated Republic of China government fled to Taipei at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.
Despite the presence of troops, Dongyin is not a closed island. Tourists can explore former military tunnels, take in the stark natural beauty and go fishing.
""We're very used to these sounds,"" said Dongyin township chief Lin Te-chien, as he observed Wednesday's drills.
Taiwan does not have anywhere near the number of forces on Matsu and Kinmen as it did from the 1950s to late 1970s, when both island groups were regularly shelled by China.
But Matsu and Kinmen continue to preoccupy Taiwan's strategists, who have been given new focus by the war in Ukraine. 
Defence Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng told lawmakers this month that China could draw lessons from the war in Ukraine and ""speed up"" their pace of any assault on Taiwan, perhaps attacking the outlying islands and at the same time starting precision missile strikes on targets in Taiwan, while sending troops across the strait. 

China now has the capacity to take Kinmen and other outlying islands, Chiu said. 
""But why have they not done it?"" he asked. ""Because they want to make sure that they can settle everything with one strike.""

673,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 05:39AM ET</span>","(Reuters) -Russia said on Wednesday that some parts of a possible peace deal with Ukraine were close to being agreed after Kyiv agreed to discuss neutrality, raising hopes of an end to the biggest war in Europe since World War Two.
""Neutral status is now being seriously discussed along, of course, with security guarantees,"" Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said told RBC news. 
""Now this very thing is being discussed in negotiations - there are absolutely specific formulations which in my view are close to agreement,"" Lavrov said.
He said that President Vladimir Putin had spoken about neutrality, along with security guarantees for Ukraine without NATO enlargement, as one possible variant in February.
The euro extended gains after Lavrov's comments and was up 0.4% to $ 1.1005. 
Lavrov cautioned that the negotiations were not easy but that there was ""some hope of reaching a compromise"".
Ukraine has also made cautious positive statements on peace talks. It says it is willing to negotiate to the end the war, but will not surrender or accept Russian ultimatums.
Lavrov said key issues included the security of people in eastern Ukraine, the demilitarisation of Ukraine and the rights of Russian-speaking people in Ukraine. 
Announcing the invasion on Feb. 24, Putin blamed the United States for threatening Russia by enlarging the NATO military alliance eastwards into Russia's backyard.

Putin said there was no option but to launch the military operation because Russian-speaking people in Ukraine had been subjected to genocide by ""nationalists and neo-Nazis"" since Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. 
Ukraine and the West says claims of genocide are baseless.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea's decision to use the international airport near its capital city as a site for test-firing large missiles is ""absolutely bonkers"" and may be a way for leader Kim Jong Un to keep a close eye on his most prized weapons, analysts said.
Debris fell in or near Pyongyang after a failed test-fire from the airport on Wednesday, Seoul-based NK News reported, citing unnamed witnesses and a photograph of the test showing a red-tinted ball of smoke at the end of a zig-zagging rocket launch trail in the sky above the city.
There was no immediate confirmation of damage or casualties.
The launch underscored the danger behind North Korea's decision to use the airport as a major site for test firing large missiles. The airport is in Sunan about 17 km (10 miles) northwest of the North Korean capital. 
""The idea of placing a dedicated facility to support developmental missile testing at North Korea’s major international airport is absolutely bonkers,"" Jeffrey Lewis, a missile researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS), said in a report on Sunday.
""This is a very strange airport,"" he added. ""And it’s been getting progressively stranger all the time.""
Since Aug 2017, North Korea has conducted an increasing number of major tests from the Sunan airport, including a pair of launches on Feb. 27 and March 5 that U.S. officials believe are developmental tests for the Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile. 
With the construction of what analysts believe is a ballistic missile support facility, the airport could take on a major role as North Korea prepares to potentially conduct its first full-scale ICBM test since 2017.
Even before the COVID-19 pandemic ended international travel in and out of North Korea, the airport was hardly busy, with a handful of flights operating to cities in China and Russia. 
But North Korea appears to be the only country to have conducted missile tests from its primary international airport, and could be planning to use the site to develop technology specifically related to its ICBMs, Lewis said.
In 2016 North Korea began constructing a facility next to the airport that appeared to be for ballistic missiles. 
A high-bay building within the facility is tall enough to allow for North Korea’s largest ICBMs on launch vehicles to be easily elevated into the firing position to allow for testing of both, as well as the training of maintenance and ground crews, the U.S.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said in a 2020 report, citing satellite imagery. 
Dubbed the Sil-li Ballistic Missile Support Facility by CSIS, the complex also includes an unusually large covered rail terminal and buildings that are linked by drive-through access. The facility is also relatively close to ballistic missile component manufacturing plants in the Pyongyang area.
""The airport is likely favoured for its proximity to the capital, allowing Kim Jong Un potentially to attend and observe these launches, without his presence being reported,"" said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""Airports also provided large, paved areas for safely operating road-mobile launch vehicles.""

The Vienna-based Open Nuclear Network disputed media reports this week that said North Korea had built concrete pads to accommodate the launch of ICBMs at the airport, saying the activity was more consistent with agricultural development. 
Wednesday's failed launch is concerning given the airport's proximity to Pyongyang, Panda said, noting that in 2017 a Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile fired from a different location failed after launch and crashed into a populated area.

676,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 12:16AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China's government on Wednesday lambasted Taiwan's humanitarian aid for Ukraine and sanctions on Russia as ""taking advantage of other's difficulties"" after the island announced it was sending more funds donated by the public for refugees.
The war in Ukraine has garnered broad sympathy in Taiwan, with many seeing parallels between Russia's invasion and the military threat posed by China, which views the democratically governed island as its own territory.
Taiwan has joined in Western-led sanctions on Russia.
Asked about Taiwan's aid and sanctions at a news conference in Beijing, Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said Taiwan's government was trying to latch onto the issue for its own purposes.
""The Democratic Progressive Party authorities are using the Ukraine issue to validate their existence and piggy back on a hot issue, taking advantage of other's difficulties,"" she said, referring to Taiwan's ruling party.
""Their attempts to incite confrontation and create hostility through political manipulation will not succeed.""
Taiwan's government says that on Ukraine it has a duty to stand with other democracies.
Late on Tuesday, Taiwan's Foreign Ministry announced a second $11.5 million donation to help refugees after an initial donation this month of $3.5 million. President Tsai Ing-wen has gifted one month of her salary.
""During this conflict, the Taiwanese people have shown boundless compassion,"" the ministry cited Foreign Minister Joseph Wu as saying at an event attended by several senior Taipei-based Western diplomats, including the de facto European Union ambassador. 

China, which has refused to condemn the Russian invasion, said last week the Chinese Red Cross would provide humanitarian assistance worth 5 million yuan ($786,000) to Ukraine, its first publicly announced aid to the country since the war.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A suspect in shootings of five homeless men, two fatally, in Washington and New York, was taken into custody on Tuesday by federal agents in Washington, but New York police said investigators were still gathering evidence to charge him with the New York crimes.
Gerald Brevard, 30, of southeast Washington, D.C., was charged with homicide, assault with a dangerous weapon and assault with intent to kill, a spokesman for Washington's Metropolitan Police Department said.
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) said special agents found the suspect after an urgent, days-long manhunt, and brought him to Washington police detectives for questioning. The arrest was also announced in a joint statement by the mayors of the two cities. 
Three of the shootings took place in Washington over the past two weeks. Two other homeless men then were shot in New York. Police said one gunman shot all five men while they slept on the street. Investigators linked the violence through .22-calibre shell casings found at the crime scenes.
""We do not have anybody under arrest in New York or for any of these incidents that occurred in New York,"" New York Police Chief of Detective James Essig said at a news conference, noting police were gathering and turning over all criminal evidence to the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. 
""I'm very confident we'll get there,"" he said. 
Washington's Metropolitan Police Department said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that it was interviewing the suspect.
New York City Mayor Eric Adams said in the joint statement with Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser that the ""cold-blooded killer"" targeted homeless people with no regard to life. 
""We know that this experience has been especially scary for our residents experiencing homelessness,"" Bowser said. 
The shootings began on March 3, when Washington police were alerted to sounds of gunshots at about 4 a.m. The victim was taken to hospital for treatment of non-life threatening injuries.
On March 8, police in that city found another homeless man suffering from gunshot wounds. He too was transported to a hospital for treatment of non-life threatening injuries.
The following day, police spotted a tent fire and found a deceased homeless man inside. Further investigation determined that he had suffered multiple stab and gunshot wounds.
Three days later, a 38-year-old man was shot in the arm in New York City's lower Manhattan.

A short time later, police responded to an emergency call about a man suffering from gunshot wounds to the head and neck, and found the victim dead inside a sleeping bag on Lafayette Street. 
Violent crime has risen in both cities and there has been a spate of seemingly random attacks in New York City.

KYIV (Reuters) -An international peacekeeping mission should be sent to Ukraine and be given the means to defend itself, the leader of Poland's ruling party said on Tuesday after meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
Jaroslaw Kaczynski made his remarks after he and the prime ministers of the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovenia arrived in Kyiv in a show of high-level backing for Zelenskiy, who briefed them on the war with Russia.
""I think that it is necessary to have a peace mission - NATO, possibly some wider international structure - but a mission that will be able to defend itself, which will operate on Ukrainian territory,"" Kaczynski told a news conference.
""It will be a mission that will strive for peace, to give humanitarian aid, but at the same time it will also be protected by appropriate forces, armed forces,"" said Kaczynski, who is seen as the main decision-maker in Poland.
Russian air strikes and shelling hit Kyiv on Tuesday, killing at least five people, authorities said, as invading forces tightened their grip and the mayor announced a 35-hour curfew.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, Czech counterpart Petr Fiala and Slovenia's Janez Jansa, who all travelled by train, were the first foreign leaders to visit the capital since the invasion last month.
Zelenskiy, noting that many ambassadors had left Kyiv, said the visiting leaders were ""not afraid of anything and are more afraid of our fate"" and thanked them for their support.
""We absolutely trust these countries and the leaders of these countries... we are 100% sure that everything we discuss will achieve its goals for our country, our security and our future,"" he told the news conference.
The Czech Republic and Poland, former communist countries that are members of both the EU and NATO, have been among the strongest backers of Ukraine in Europe since the Russian invasion.
Before the meeting, Morawiecki tweeted that ""it is here, in war-torn Kyiv, that history is being made. It is here, that freedom fights against the world of tyranny. It is here that the future of us all hangs in the balance"".
The idea of the trip was agreed at an EU leaders' summit in Versailles in France last week, Polish prime ministerial aide Michal Dworczyk said.

But an EU official said there was no ""formal mandate"" extended by Brussels.
Russia calls its actions a ""special military operation"" to ""denazify"" Ukraine, which Kyiv and its Western allies reject as a pretext for an unjustified and illegal attack.

DUBAI/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Russia said on Tuesday it has written guarantees it can carry out its work as a party to the Iran nuclear deal, suggesting Moscow could allow a revival of the tattered 2015 pact to go forward.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's comments appeared to signal Moscow may have backed off its previous view that Western sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine were an impediment to salvaging the nuclear deal.
Lavrov on March 5 unexpectedly demanded sweeping guarantees that Russian trade with Iran would not be affected by the Ukraine-related sanctions - a demand Western powers have said was unacceptable and Washington has insisted it will not accept.
Under the deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program to make it harder to develop a nuclear bomb - an ambition it denies - in return for relief from global economic sanctions.
""We have received written guarantees – they are included in the very text of the agreement on reviving the JCPOA, and in these texts there is a reliable defence of all the projects provided for by the JCPOA and those activities – including the linking up of our companies and specialists,"" Lavrov said.
Speaking at a news conference with Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian in Moscow, Lavrov also denied that Russia was an obstacle to reviving the 2015 agreement.
""I have heard how the Americans have every day tried to accuse us of delaying the agreement – that is a lie. The agreement is not finally approved in several capitals, and the Russian capital – Moscow – is not one of them.""
Oil prices fell more than 6%, pulled down by Lavrov's comments that Moscow was in favour of the nuclear deal resuming as soon as possible, and by doubts about Chinese demand following surging COVID-19 cases in China.
However, Western officials said they were not sure if Russia was satisfied by guarantees it could carry out nuclear projects under the 2015 deal or if it wanted a the ""right to free and full trade, economic and investment cooperation and military-technical cooperation"" with Iran that Lavrov sought on March 5.
U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters a revival of the nuclear deal would not be ""an escape hatch"" for Russia to avoid sanctions imposed because of the Ukraine war.
""We of course would not sanction Russian participation in nuclear projects that are part of resuming full implementation of the JCPOA. We can't and we won't, and we have not provided assurances beyond that to Russia,"" Price added.
Another U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, responded cautiously to Lavrov's comments, saying they might mean Moscow had come around to the U.S. view that Russia's invasion of Ukraine should not torpedo the Iran nuclear deal.
""Perhaps it is now clear to Moscow that, as we have said publicly, the new Russia-related sanctions are unrelated to the JCPOA and should not have any impact on its implementation,"" said this senior U.S. State Department official.
Eleven months of fitful talks to revive the deal - which then-U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018, prompting Tehran to start violating its nuclear limits about a year later - paused in Vienna last week after Russia demanded assurances.
Iran said the United States lacked the ""political will"" to resolve several outstanding issues in the nuclear negotiations in Vienna. The Islamic Republic has insisted Washington remove human rights and terrorism-related sanctions, including those imposed in 2019 on its elite Revolutionary Guards.

Amirabdollahian said the pause in the Vienna talks could help resolve several of the outstanding issues and suggested that Russia was no impediment.
""If we can reach an understanding with the United States on the few issues that are our red line and get to a final agreement, Russia will stand with us until the end of talks to reach a good, stable and strong nuclear deal,"" he said.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced the March 24 meeting in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post on Tuesday and the White House confirmed Biden would attend, as well as a European Council Summit the same day.
The official announcement of the meeting at NATO headquarters, which was first reported by Reuters on Monday, was made two days after Russian missiles hit a Ukrainian base near the border with NATO member Poland, an attack that brought the conflict to the doorstep of the Western alliance. 
NATO bolstered countries on its eastern flank with additional troops in the months before the Feb. 24 Russian invasion.
Biden, whose administration has been in close contact with its NATO allies and others over the war, aims to cement the cohesiveness, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said. 
""His goal is to meet in person face-to-face and talk about and assess where we are at this point in the conflict,"" she said. ""We've been incredibly aligned to date. That doesn't happen by accident."" 
Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau was quoted as saying that a visit by Biden to Poland ""seems very much probable"" but the White House declined to comment. Psaki said details of the trip were still being worked out.
NATO defense ministers will also meet on Wednesday in what Stoltenberg called ""a defining moment for our security."" 
""I think it's a very important trip that the President is making,"" Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said. She called U.S. solidarity with NATO and the European Union unprecedented, and contrasted it with Russia's less-clear alliance with China.
""This is one of the great advantages we have a vis-a-vis Russia, who has very few, if any, allies or partners,"" Sherman said in an interview with CNN. ""And I think if in fact the PRC is a partner is a partner of just transactional relationship, not of true interests."" 
Ursula von der Leyen, president of the EU Commission, said she was glad to continue discussions with Biden in person. ""Transatlantic unity and coordination remain crucial for ramping up pressure on the Kremlin to stop this unjustified war,"" she wrote on Twitter.

Zelenskiy has been pleading for NATO to impose a no-fly zone to protect his country from Russian aerial bombardment, but the alliance is wary of any step that might draw it into direct conflict with fellow nuclear-armed power Russia.
The Ukrainian leader will likely state his case again when he addresses the U.S. Congress on Wednesday. He spoke to Canadian lawmakers on Tuesday and to the British Parliament last week.

Gary Cabana, suspected of the stabbing after the museum denied him admission over the weekend, was arrested in Philadelphia without incident after he was found sleeping at a Greyhound bus terminal, New York Police Department Chief of Detectives James Essig said at a news conference.
The 60-year-old man will face charges of second-degree assault for the weekend stabbing and third-degree assault on allegations that he had punched another employee in a separate incident, Essig said. Cabana is also accused of aggravated harassment for allegedly sending threats via email.
""He has been taken into custody and we are waiting extradition and the arrest warrants to bring him back to New York where he will be charged,"" Essig said.
Police tracked down the suspect after he checked into a Philadelphia hotel and set a fire in a fifth-floor room earlier in the night, 6ABC Action News reported.
It is unclear what led the suspect to Philadelphia. Local police did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
""We got information that this individual was also suicidal and was suffering from some mental health issues so we realized he was armed and very dangerous,"" Philadelphia Police Chief Inspector Scott Small told the ABC affiliate. 
Police say Cabana jumped over a counter and stabbed two MoMA employees on Saturday after they refused to let him into the museum, where he previously had been barred for unruly behavior. Surveillance video footage showed the assailant fleeing the museum on foot moments after the incident.

The two victims were rushed to a hospital for treatment of multiple stab wounds to their upper bodies, and were expected to survive, New York police said. 
New York police launched a hunt for the suspect, whom they said was familiar to MoMA staff as a museum regular. The suspect was also known to police from previous disorderly conduct incidents, including at least one at the museum in recent days, police said.

RIYADH (Reuters) -The Saudi-based Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is considering inviting the Houthi movement and other Yemeni parties for consultations in Riyadh this month as part of an initiative aimed at backing U.N.-led peace efforts, two Gulf officials told Reuters.
Formal invitations would be sent within days for the talks on military, political and economic aspects of the war between the Iran-aligned Houthis and a coalition led by Saudi Arabia, said the officials, who declined to be named ahead of an official announcement this week. The conflict enters its eighth year on Tuesday.
They said Houthi officials would be ""guests"" of GCC Secretary General Nayef Falah Mubarak Al-Hajraf at the body's Riyadh headquarters and would have his security guarantees if the group accepted the invitation for the talks, which are planned from March 29-April 7.
A Houthi official, remarking on the Reuters report, suggested the group may not agree to travel to Saudi Arabia, which backs the government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who was ousted from the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014 by the movement. Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system and foreign aggression. 
""Riyadh is a party in the war not a mediator,"" Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, head of the movement's supreme revolutionary committee, said in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post.
GCC members Oman, where some Houthi officials are based, and Kuwait, which hosted previous peace talks in 2015, would be a more neutral ground for such consultations.
The officials said Hadi, who is based in Riyadh, had agreed to the talks.
Riyadh has struggled to extricate itself from the costly and unpopular war, which has killed tens of thousands of people, mostly civilians, and pushed Yemen to the brink of famine. The conflict, largely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, is a point of friction between Riyadh and Washington.
Yemen has been eclipsed by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the GCC initiative comes ahead of a donors conference on March 16. The United Nations special envoy to Yemen last week held talks with Yemeni parties aimed at building a framework for inclusive political negotiations. 
Efforts by the United States and the United Nations to secure a ceasefire last year failed, and violence has intensified. 

The Houthis continue to battle coalition forces on the ground in energy-producing Marib, the government's last stronghold in North Yemen.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been seeking renewed support from the United States in the Yemen war, including for more weapons, after the Biden administration last year ended support for offensive coalition operations and revoked a terror designation on the Houthi group amid humanitarian concerns.

ISTANBUL/MADRID/BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich jetted into Moscow on Tuesday as the Spanish government seized more assets belonging to Russia's rich and the EU banned exports of caviar and luxury goods. 
Abramovich landed in Moscow early on Tuesday after taking off from Istanbul in his private jet, according to FLIGHTRADAR24 data. A source familiar with the matter said he was not in Russia to meet with President Vladimir Putin.
It was the second trip a jet linked to the oligarch has made between the Turkish city of Istanbul and the Russian capital in the past three days, the FLIGHTRADAR24 data showed. On Monday, he was spotted in the VIP lounge at Tel Aviv airport before the jet took off for Istanbul.
Abramovich was among several Russian billionaires added on Tuesday to an EU blacklist that already includes dozens of wealthy Russians. World governments are seeking to isolate Putin and his allies over the invasion of Ukraine, which Russia calls a ""special operation.""
The latest sanctions follow three rounds of punitive measures which included freezing of assets of the Russian central bank, exclusion from the SWIFT banking system of some Russian and Belarusian banks, and the asset freeze of oligarchs and top politicians, including Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
EU companies will also be no longer allowed to export to Russia any luxury goods worth more than 300 euros ($330), including precious stones, crystal, caviar, wine, handbags, leather products, shoes and coats. Exports of cars costing more than 50,000 euros will also be banned.
This is intended to impact on the lifestyle of Russia's elites, an EU official said.
Britain also imposed fresh sanctions on hundreds of Russian individuals and entities on Tuesday, using a new law to catch up with the EU and United States in targeting people accused of propping up Putin.
Britain said the latest round of sanctions included elites with a net worth of 100 billion pounds ($130 billion).
""We are going further and faster than ever in hitting those closest to Putin - from major oligarchs, to his prime minister, and the propagandists who peddle his lies and disinformation. We are holding them to account for their complicity in Russia's crimes in Ukraine,"" foreign minister Liz Truss said.
Abramovich said last week he was selling Chelsea soccer club, but after being targeted by British sanctions that sale is now on hold. Chelsea is operating under a special government license and the Premier League board has disqualified him as a club director.
Germany's Bild newspaper reported that Abramovich had met with former chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in Moscow on Thursday evening before Schroeder sat down with Putin. 
A source familiar with the matter confirmed the meeting with Schroeder to Reuters and said that the oligarch wanted to find a way to stop the war.
A spokesperson for Abramovich declined to comment.
The Russian billionaire, who also holds Israeli and Portuguese citizenship, has said he does not have close ties to Putin. Portugal has opened an investigation into how Abramovich was granted citizenship.
Refinitiv ship tracking data showed Abramovich's $600 million yacht Solaris sailing near the coast of Albania Tuesday morning with the status ""awaiting orders."" Its destination had previously been shown as Turkey.
It was unclear how the fresh EU sanctions would impact the yacht's progress through European waters.
Authorities in Europe have stepped up seizing yachts and luxury assets of billionaires in Putin's circle who are on sanctions lists.
The 48-meter (157-ft) yacht Lady Anastasia, owned by Russian oligarch Alexander Mikheyev, was detained by Spanish authorities on Tuesday at a Mallorca marina, a police source said. Mikheyev, who heads Russian weapon exporting group Rosoboronoexport, is on the EU sanctions list.
On Monday, Spanish authorities said they had seized the 85-meter (279-foot) superyacht Valerie, valued at $140 million, in Barcelona. That yacht belongs to Sergei Chemezov, a former KGB officer who heads state conglomerate Rostec, two sources said.

Chemezov was sanctioned by the United States in 2014 and Britain in 2020 over Russia's annexation of Crimea and was named in sanctions lists this month by the United States and Australia.

685,"<span>Mar 15, 2022 01:51PM ET</span>","(Reuters) -Russian prosecutors asked a court on Tuesday to sentence jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny to an additional 13 years on fraud and contempt of court charges and to move him to a maximum security prison, Navalny's spokeswoman said. 
Navalny is already serving a two-and-a-half year sentence at a prison camp east of Moscow for parole violations related to charges he says were trumped up to thwart his political ambitions. 
In a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post, his spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, cited a judge of the Lefortovo court in Moscow as saying the sentence would be announced on March 22.
Navalny used his appearance at the hearing, which was transmitted live from prison to reporters covering the case, to renew his call for an end to Russia's war in Ukraine but the transmission of his statement was blocked, she added.
""We've been saying that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin wants to keep Navalny in prison forever. The upcoming sentence has nothing to do with the law,"" Yarmysh wrote.
Navalny himself later struck a typically defiant tone, saying on Instagram: ""If the prison term is the price of my human right to say things that need to be said... then they can ask for 113 years. I will not renounce my words or deeds.""
The prosecutors asked for the transfer to a maximum security prison because they said Navalny had committed crimes in the prison camp, thus becoming a repeat offender, Yarmysh said. 
Officials at the prosecutor general's office did not reply to a request for comment.
FIGHTING 'DESPOTISM'
Navalny, who is able to publish social media posts through his lawyers and allies, renewed his call for protests against Russia's invasion of Ukraine that began on Feb. 24.
In Tuesday's Instagram post, he said the war had become ""the direct consequence of corruption and degradation, a bloody cover-up of the failure of Putin's regime"". 
Last week Russian authorities put Yarmysh on a wanted list. She left Russia last year after a court imposed 18 months of restrictions on her freedom of movement for breaching COVID-19 safety rules.
Russian authorities have cracked down hard on the opposition, and many of Navalny's most prominent allies have left Russia rather than face restrictions or jail at home.

Navalny was jailed last year when he returned to Russia after receiving medical treatment in Germany following a poison attack with a nerve agent during a visit to Siberia in 2020.
Navalny blamed Putin for the attack, a charge the Kremlin denies.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A Ukraine-born U.S. businessman was sentenced to one year and one day in prison on Tuesday after being convicted last year of campaign finance violations alongside a former associate of Rudy Giuliani. 
The defendant, Andrey Kukushkin, had been found guilty in October on two criminal counts for funneling money from Russian tycoon Andrey Muraviev to U.S. political candidates who could help a cannabis company he was building with Lev Parnas, the Giuliani associate.
Prosecutors had sought a sentence of 51 to 63 months, while Kukushkin said he should be spared prison.
Before being sentenced in federal court in Manhattan, Kukushkin had proposed being allowed to assist with relief efforts in his native Ukraine.
""I can do much more if I keep on helping my family and helping my community rather than be locked up in jail,"" Kukushkin, wiping away tears, told U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken.
Kukushkin's lawyer Gerald Lefcourt added that his client had recently taken in his fiancee's elderly mother, who fled Ukraine.
Oetken agreed that Kukushkin's family would suffer from his imprisonment, but said prison time was needed to deter others from similar crimes. 
""Straw donations by foreign nationals corrupt our system,"" Oetken said.
Prosecutors on Monday unsealed charges over the campaign finance scheme against Muraviev, who they said is at large and believed to be in Russia.
Washington has targeted wealthy Russian businessmen with possible sanctions, asset seizures and criminal charges to pressure the Kremlin to stop its invasion of Ukraine. Russia calls its actions a ""special operation."" 
Parnas, also born in Ukraine, was found guilty on all six counts of campaign finance violations he faced during the October trial, and is awaiting sentencing.
Another co-conspirator, Belarus-born Igor Fruman, was in January also sentenced to one year and one day in prison after pleading guilty to a campaign finance violation.

Parnas and Fruman helped Giuliani, a onetime personal lawyer to Republican former President Donald Trump, investigate Democrat Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. 
Giuliani, a former New York City mayor, has not been charged with crimes and has denied wrongdoing.

By Karin Strohecker
(Reuters) - The United States, Britain, Europe and Canada announced new sanctions on Russia on Saturday - including blocking certain lenders' access to the SWIFT international payment system - following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Thursday.
Below are details on the measures proposed so far:
SWITCHING OFF SWIFT
Washington and its partners started to deploy what was widely seen as one of the harshest sanction measures: barring banks from SWIFT - a step that will stop lenders from conducting most of their financial transactions worldwide and, according to the statement, effectively curb Russian exports and imports.
The step, which will include restrictions on the central bank's international reserves, will be implemented in the coming days, the nations said in a joint statement that also vowed further action.
It was not immediately clear which Russian banks would be removed from SWIFT, but Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said the move would ensure those selected were ""disconnected from the international financial system"" in a way that would ""harm their ability to operate globally.""
SWIFT is used by more than 11,000 financial institutions in over 200 countries. 
BANKS & FINANCIAL FIRMS 
The United States and Britain announced restrictions that, combined with previous sanctions, would in effect kick the vast majority of Russian banking assets out of both countries. New targets included Sberbank and VTB Bank, Russia's two largest lenders.
U.S. banks must sever correspondent banking ties - allowing banks to make payments between one another and move money around the globe - with Russia's largest lender, Sberbank, within 30 days.
Officials in Washington also wielded their most powerful sanctioning tool, adding VTB, Otkritie, Novikombank and Sovcombank to the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list - effectively kicking them out of the U.S. financial system, banning trade with Americans and freezing their U.S. assets. 
EU leaders have agreed sanctions targeting 70% of the Russian banking market and important state-owned companies, including in defence. 
Russia's large banks are deeply integrated into the global financial system and sanctions will be felt far beyond its borders. Data from the Bank for International Settlements showed European lenders hold the lion's share of the around $120 billion in foreign banks' exposure to Russia.
According to data from Russia's central bank, total Russian banking foreign assets and liabilities stood at $200.6 billion and $134.5 billion, respectively, with the U.S.-dollar share amounting to around 53% of both, down from 76%-81% two decades ago. 
SOVEREIGN DEBT & CAPITAL MARKETS
Britain announced it would ban Russian sovereign debt sales in London. Russia has issued $4.1 billion of sovereign debt in London since the beginning of 2020.
The coming package of EU measures will ""target the ability of the Russian state and government to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services, to limit the financing of escalatory and aggressive policies,"" the bloc said. It will ban EU investors from trading in Russian state bonds. 
Washington announced new restrictions on dealings in Russia sovereign debt on Tuesday. Americans - already barred from investing in Russian sovereign debt directly - will be banned from purchasing it in the secondary market after March 1.
Even before the latest events, access to Russian bonds had become increasingly restricted. 
U.S. sanctions imposed in 2015 made future Russian dollar debt ineligible for many investors and key indexes. In April 2021, President Joe Biden barred U.S. investors from buying new Russian rouble bonds over accusations of Russian election meddling. 
The curbs have cut Russia's external debt by 33% since early 2014 - from $733 billion to $489 billion in the third quarter of 2021. 
INDIVIDUALS
The U.S., the EU and Britain have already imposed asset freezes, travel bans and other curbs on Russian individuals. 
Britain announced sanctions on more than 100 Russian individuals and entities, including an asset freeze and travel ban on Yelena Georgieva, chair of the board of Novikombank; Pyotr Fradkov, Promsvyazbank chairman; Denis Bortnikov, VTB deputy president; Kirill Shamalov, President Vladimir Putin's former son-in-law; and United Aircraft's Yury Slyusar.
Britain will also introduce legislation to limit deposits that Russian nationals can hold in UK bank accounts. The limit will be 50,000 pounds ($66,860) at British banks.
Washington sanctioned Fradkov and Bortnikov on Tuesday, as well as Vladimir Kiriyenko, the son of a former prime minister. 
On Thursday, Washington targeted others close to Putin, including Sergei Ivanov, CEO of Russian state-owned diamond mining company Alrosa; Andrey Patrushev, who has served in leadership roles at Russian state-owned gas company Gazprom (MCX:GAZP); and Ivan Sechin, reportedly a deputy head of a department at energy company Rosneft. 
Biden said on Thursday he would consider personal sanctions on Putin, a move Moscow has said would not harm the Russian president personally but would prove ""politically destructive"".
The EU has already imposed sanctions on five people who were involved in a Russian parliamentary election in annexed Crimea last September, and said it would blacklist all lawmakers who voted to recognise two regions controlled by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, freeze any assets they have in the EU and ban them from travelling to the bloc. 
ENERGY CORPORATES & NORD STREAM 2
The United States and the EU already have sanctions in place on Russia's energy and defence sectors, with state-owned gas company Gazprom, its oil arm Gazpromneft and oil producers Lukoil, Rosneft and Surgutneftegaz facing various types of curbs on exports/imports and debt-raising. 
Sanctions could be deepened, with one possible option being to prevent companies settling in U.S. dollars. 
Nord Stream 2, a recently completed pipeline from Russia to Germany, was awaiting regulatory approval by EU and German authorities before Berlin put its certification on ice. 
The U.S. on Wednesday imposed sanctions on the company in charge of building Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
CURBING TECHNOLOGY
The EU has vowed to introduce measures to crimp Russia's technological position in key areas - from high-tech components to cutting-edge software.

The U.S. Commerce Department said on Thursday it was implementing export controls that will severely restrict Russia’s access to semiconductors, computers, telecommunications, information security equipment, lasers, and sensors that it needs to sustain its military capabilities. 
Similar measures were deployed during the Cold War, when sanctions kept the Soviet Union technologically backward and crimped economic growth.

LONDON (Reuters) -An anti-war protester interrupted a live news bulletin on Russia's state TV Channel One on Monday, holding up a sign behind the studio presenter and shouting slogans denouncing the war in Ukraine.
The sign, in English and Russian, read: ""NO WAR. Stop the war. Don't believe propaganda. They are lying to you here."" Another phrase, which looked like ""Russians against war"", was partly obscured.
The extraordinary act of dissent took place on day 19 of the war which began when Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what he called a special military operation.
""Stop the war. No to war,"" the woman protester could be heard shouting, as the news anchor continued to read from her teleprompter.
The protester could be seen and heard for several seconds before the channel switched to a different report to remove her from the screen.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy thanked the protester in his nightly video address:
""I am grateful to those Russians who do not stop trying to convey the truth. To those who fight disinformation and tell the truth, real facts to their friends and loved ones,"" Zelenskiy said. ""And personally to the woman who entered the studio of Channel One with a poster against the war."" 
Kira Yarmysh, spokeswoman for jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR): ""Wow, that girl is cool.""
She posted a video of the incident, which quickly racked up more than 2.6 million views.
PRO-KREMLIN CHANNEL
State TV is the main source of news for many millions of Russians, and closely follows the Kremlin line that Russia was forced to act in Ukraine to demilitarise and ""denazify"" the country, and to defend Russian-speakers there against ""genocide"". Ukraine and most of the world have condemned that as a false pretext for an invasion of a democratic country.
The woman was named by OVD-Info, an independent protest-monitoring group, and by the head of the Agora human rights group, as Marina Ovsyannikova, an employee of the channel.
Pavel Chikov, head of Agora, said Ovsyannikova had been arrested and taken to a Moscow police station. Tass news agency said she may face charges under a law against discrediting the armed forces, citing a law enforcement source.
The law, passed on March 4, makes public actions aimed at discrediting Russia's army illegal and bans the spread of fake news or the ""public dissemination of deliberately false information about the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation"". The offence carries a jail term of up to 15 years.
In a video recorded before the incident and posted online, a woman who appeared to be Ovsyannikova described herself as a Channel One employee and said she was ashamed to have worked for years spreading Kremlin propaganda. She said her father was Ukrainian, and her mother Russian.
""What is happening now in Ukraine is a crime, and Russia is the aggressor country. The responsibility for that aggression lies on the conscience of only one man, and that man is Vladimir Putin,"" she said.
""Now the whole world has turned away from us and the next 10 generations of our descendants will not wash away the shame of this fratricidal war,"" she said.

She urged Russians to go out and demonstrate.
Authorities have broken up anti-war protests. According to OVD-Info, which monitors protests and provides legal assistance to those detained, a total of 14,911 people have been arrested.

Alongside Biden, U.S. officials on the list included Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, CIA chief William Burns, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and former secretary of state and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

The ban was in response to sanctions imposed by Washington on Russian officials. The foreign ministry later added Trudeau to the list of sanctioned individuals.
The measures appeared to be mainly symbolic, as the Foreign Ministry said it was maintaining official relations and if necessary would make sure that high-level contacts with the people on the list could take place.

690,"<span>Mar 15, 2022 10:56AM ET</span>","WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States continues to engage with Russia on reviving the Iran nuclear deal, a senior U.S. State Department official said on Tuesday, saying Moscow may now grasp that Ukraine-related sanctions should not affect the accord's implementation.
Washington would not sanction Russian participation in nuclear projects that are part of the deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), when it is fully implemented, the official said on condition of anonymity.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday said U.S. suggestions that Moscow was blocking efforts to revive the Iran nuclear deal were untrue, following talks with his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amirabdollahian in Moscow.
Lavrov said Russia had received written U.S. assurances that sanctions against Moscow over Ukraine would not hinder cooperation within the framework of the deal, which lifted sanctions on Tehran in return for curbs on its nuclear program.

""We continue to engage with Russia on a return to full implementation of the JCPOA,"" the senior U.S. State Department official said when asked about Lavrov's comments. ""We would of course not sanction Russian participation in nuclear projects that are part of resuming full implementation of the JCPOA.""
""We cannot provide assurances beyond that to Russia and have no comment on (Foreign Minister) Lavrov’s publicly reported remarks,"" the official added. ""Perhaps it is now clear to Moscow that, as we have said publicly, the new Russia-related sanctions are unrelated to the JCPOA and should not have any impact on its implementation.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -An Indian court upheld on Tuesday a ban on wearing of the hijab in classrooms in the southern state of Karnataka, a ruling that could set a precedent for the rest of the country which has a big Muslim minority.
The ban last month by the state had sparked protests by some Muslim students and parents, and counter-protests by Hindu students. Critics of the ban say it is another way of marginalising a community that accounts for about 13% of Hindu-majority India's 1.35 billion people.
""We are of the considered opinion that wearing of hijab by Muslim women does not form a part of essential religious practice in Islamic faith,"" Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi of the High Court of Karnataka said in the judgement.
He said the government had the power to prescribe uniform guidelines, dismissing various petitions challenging the ban ordered by Karnataka.
""We are of the considered opinion that the prescription of school uniform is only a reasonable restriction constitutionally permissible which the students cannot object to,"" Awasthi said.
Ayesha Imthiaz, a third-year undergraduate student in the Karnataka district of Udupi where the protests began, said she would either drop out of her government-aided college or opt for a correspondence course. She said her fellow Muslim female students were planning to do the same.
""We can't take off the hijab, we won't take off the hijab,"" she said. ""We have fifth semester exams next month. We will have to sit that out unless things change by then.""
Ahead of the verdict, Karnataka authorities announced closures of schools and colleges and imposed restrictions on public gatherings in some parts of the state to prevent potential trouble.
NATIONAL PRECEDENT
Last month, Federal Home Minister Amit Shah said he preferred students sticking to school uniforms instead of any religious attire. Currently, there is no central law or rule on school uniforms across the country, but the Karnataka ruling could prompt more states to issue such guidelines.
The Students Islamic Organisation of India, which represents thousands of Muslim students across the country, said their fear was that Tuesday's verdict would encourage more states to ban the hijab in class.
""We don't want it to set a national precedent and we want it overturned,"" its national secretary Musab Qazi said. ""The court verdict might embolden more states to ban it. So in all likelihood, we will approach the Supreme Court.""
Karnataka, home to the tech hub of Bengaluru, is the only southern state ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and holds state assembly elections next year.
Critics say the BJP could benefit from the division between Hindus and Muslims, though the party says the hijab ban had nothing to do with their political ambitions.
'DEEPLY DISAPPOINTING'
Students who had challenged the ban in court had said wearing the hijab was a fundamental right guaranteed under India's constitution and an essential practice of Islam. Reuters could not immediately contact the challengers.
Muslim politicians, including the former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir state, Mehbooba Mufti, called the verdict ""deeply disappointing"".
""On one hand we talk about empowering women yet we are denying them the right to a simple choice,"" she wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""It isn’t just about religion but the freedom to choose.""

Karnataka ministers told reporters that Muslim female students who are staying away from class in protest against the ban should respect the judgement and rejoin school.
The ban had led to protests in some other parts of the country too and drew criticism from the United States and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.

The new sanctions were announced ahead of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's expected virtual address to the Canadian parliament at 11:15 am (1515 GMT).
""President Putin made the choice to further his illegal and unjustifiable invasion, and he can also make the choice to end it by immediately ending the senseless violence and withdrawing his forces,"" Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said.
""Canada will not hesitate to take further action should the Russian leadership fail to change course,"" Joly said in a statement.

Canada, like many other Western nations, has imposed broad sanctions on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. It has also closed its airspace and ports to Russian vessels, sent lethal military aid to Ukraine and asked the International Criminal Court to probe alleged war crimes by Russian forces.
Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" the country. Ukraine and the West have dismissed that justification as baseless propaganda.

KYIV (Reuters) -Russian air strikes and shelling hit Kyiv on Tuesday killing at least four people, authorities said, as invading forces tightened their grip on the Ukrainian capital and the mayor announced a 35-hour curfew starting at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT).
Two large blasts echoed across the centre of the city just before dawn on Tuesday. Late on Monday, tracer bullets flashed across the night sky as Ukrainian forces apparently targeted an enemy drone.
""Today is a difficult and dangerous moment,"" mayor Vitali Klitschko said.
""The capital is the heart of Ukraine, and it will be defended. Kyiv, which is currently the symbol and forward operating base of Europe's freedom and security, will not be given up by us.""
He called on men who took wives and children to the relative safety of the west of the country earlier in the conflict to return to the capital to fight. Some have done so already, he and his brother Wladimir told Reuters in a recent interview.
Reuters witnesses saw a high-rise apartment block in flames after being struck by artillery. Firefighters tried to douse the blaze and rescue workers helped evacuate residents trapped inside using mobile ladders. A body lay on the ground in a bag.
The Artem weapons factory in central Kyiv was also hit, with footage taken by a local resident showing smoke coming from the roof. Outside kiosks nearby, shopkeepers and helpers swept up glass and other debris from the impact of the explosions.
Russia said on Monday that it planned to attack Ukrainian arms factories in retaliation for what it said was a Ukrainian strike on the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk, and urged workers and local residents to stay away. Ukraine denied launching an attack.
Kyiv has been spared the worst of the fighting since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, but the Russian military is slowly closing in on the city and the shelling has intensified.
""What is happening right now in Kharkiv, in Mariupol and other cities - it was understandable that sooner or later it would happen in Kyiv,"" said local resident Igor Krupa.
Sitting on the ground outside the badly damaged apartment building, he described how he had cocooned himself with furniture and metal weights before going to sleep.
""This actually saved me because all the windows went out and all the debris went into the apartment, and I remained unwounded. Just a couple of scratches.""
In another part of the city, residents cleared debris from their homes after shelling blew out windows, ruined balconies and left wreckage strewn across the ground.

Thousands of people have been killed in the conflict and millions more displaced.
Russia, which denies targeting civilians, calls its actions a ""special military operation"" to ""denazify"" the country, a claim that Ukraine and its allies reject as a pretext for an unjustified and illegal attack.

The Israeli border police said that during an operation in a refugee camp in the northern West Bank, a gunman fired at undercover officers who shot back, ""neutralising"" him. 
In a second refugee camp near Jerusalem, border police said forces on a separate arrest raid encountered hundreds of Palestinians who threw heavy objects from rooftops, endangering the troops.
It was not immediately clear whether the Palestinian killed there had taken part in the clash. 
The Palestinian Health Ministry confirmed the fatalities. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the incidents as extra-judicial killings.

Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem - territories where Palestinians seek statehood - in the 1967 Middle East war. The last round of peace talks collapsed in 2014.
The Palestinian Authority, set up under interim peace accords with Israel in the 1990s, exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank, but Israeli forces are dominant in the area, where they often carry out raids to detain suspected militants.

(Reuters) - As soon as he learned abortion provider Planned Parenthood wanted to open a new clinic in the central California city of Visalia, resident Rod Greenfield wrote to all five city council members and urged them to deny the permit.
Another area resident, retired public health official Merrilyn Brady, began mobilizing supporters of the proposed clinic, which aimed to provide primary care and abortion services in a part of the state where both are in short supply.
In handwritten letters, emails and telephone calls, more than 200 people shared their opinions about the clinic, communications obtained from the city show. For two months, residents of Visalia, a city of 140,000 in the conservative San Joaquin Valley, along with nearby communities, attended crowded city council meetings.
""This proposal will bring shame to our city,"" opponent Jaime Zamora wrote in an email in early February.
""Expanding health care is crucial,"" supporter Linda Collishaw argued in another email.
The fight over the Visalia clinic is a window into the complicated and emotional politics of abortion, even in a largely liberal state like California. Last week, in the face of fervent resistance, Planned Parenthood leaders said they would seek a different site in the city.
Abortion proponents are scrambling to expand services in states such as California and Illinois, where reproductive rights are enshrined in local laws, while conservative states including Texas, Missouri and Florida move aggressively to limit access to the procedure.
The deeply conservative U.S. Supreme Court will rule this spring on a Mississippi law outlawing abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The case is widely expected to end or severely limit the right to abortion, some 50 years after a prior court legalized it in the landmark Roe v. Wade case.
If that happens, battles like the one in Visalia will become more common, predicted Wynette Sills, director of the anti-abortion group Californians for Life.
""Once it moves from being a federal issue and becomes a more state-by-state dynamic, I think we’ll see polarization even within California,"" she said.
PARKING AND PROTESTS
In Visalia, patients seeking to terminate a pregnancy at Planned Parenthood are referred to clinics an hour away in Fresno and Bakersfield. 
Looking to expand beyond their small existing clinic, and eventually provide abortions and abortion pills in Visalia, Planned Parenthood leaders spent about six years searching for a new site, said Stacy Cross, president of the Planned Parenthood chapter that includes much of central California and Nevada.
Last year, a property owner they were working with applied for permission to open a medical center on Mooney Boulevard, one of the city's main shopping streets. Cross said they intentionally left Planned Parenthood's name off the application to avoid provoking opposition.
Developer David Paynter caught wind of the plans anyway.
In a Dec. 10 letter to the city's planning commission, Paynter said the clinic would create parking issues for his nearby tenants, which included Hobby Lobby, Regal Cinemas, Marshalls and Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY).
He also complained that protesters of Planned Parenthood would disrupt the nearby businesses.
After the planning commission approved the project, Paynter filed a formal appeal to the city council. He declined further comment when reached by Reuters.
Local furor grew when anti-abortion group Tulare-Kings Right to Life learned about the proposed clinic. The group asked residents to voice their opposition at city council meetings.
""We are standing up against this organization and being a voice for the voiceless,"" the group said in a Feb. 2 Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post.
Brady, the retired public health official, wrote an op-ed defending the clinic and spoke at city council meetings. A Republican who voted twice for former President Donald Trump, Brady said she helped bring a Planned Parenthood clinic to provide contraceptive and sexual health care to a local community college more than 20 years ago.
""I am so upset with the way conservative people, especially the far right, look at this,"" she said in an interview. ""If we had open access and better education around sexual health, we wouldn’t be seeing the abortion rate that we see.""
DIFFICULT ROAD AHEAD
Cross and her team worked to persuade the city to support the clinic, speaking with council members and emphasizing the objective of providing more primary and sexual health care.
But days before a scheduled public hearing, Cross concluded the plan would not win support from a majority of the council. Reluctantly, she withdrew from a deal to purchase the Mooney Boulevard property.
Even so, an impassioned discussion about the proposal ran for nearly two hours at last week's city council meeting. Opponents vowed to fight any new locations.
In an interview, city councilwoman Liz Wynn declined to say how she would have voted. She said she expected the city would help the reproductive rights organization find a more discreet site for a new clinic.
The four other council members did not respond to requests for comment.

Cross said the city has sent a list of potential locations, but she is prepared for a difficult road ahead.
""California is the most progressive state as far as reproductive healthcare in the entire country,"" she said. ""But even within this state there are pockets like Visalia that are making it challenging.""

KRAKOW, Poland/ISACCEA, Romania (Reuters) -People fleeing what had been the relative safety of western Ukraine joined thousands crossing into eastern Europe on Monday after Russia attacked a Ukrainian base near the border with NATO-member Poland.
Ukraine said 35 people were killed at the base on Sunday. Moscow said up to 180 ""foreign mercenaries"" died and a large number of foreign weapons were destroyed.
Ukraine also reported renewed air strikes on an airport in the west of the country.
The number of refugees fleeing Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24 climbed to more than 2.8 million, United Nations data showed on Monday, in what has become Europe's fastest growing refugee crisis since World War Two. 
European Union officials have said 5 million may end up fleeing while others have put the figure higher. 
Millions of people have also been displaced inside Ukraine, with many evacuated only as far as the quieter western regions, including to cities like Lviv.
Myroslava, 52, fled her home in the Ternopil region, in western Ukraine, and was waiting in a terminal of Krakow station in Poland to be picked up by acquaintances. She did not know where she would stay.
""We left because of the attack yesterday,"" she said, adding that she had hoped western Ukraine would be safe. ""We weren't planning to leave, but as it was so close we decided to.""
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told a news conference with his counterparts from Ukraine and Lithuania that the attack near its border showed Russia wanted to ""create panic among the civilian population"". 
Mira from Kyiv, travelling with her mother to Warsaw, said she had been surprised by the Russian attack near Lviv. ""I just panicked and felt scared,"" she said.
Battles continued around many of Ukraine's main cities, including the capital Kyiv. Ukraine said it would try to evacuate civilians through 10 humanitarian corridors on Monday.
Russia denies targeting civilians, describing its actions as a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and Western allies call this a baseless pretext for Russia's invasion of the democratic country of 44 million.
""Houses were blown up,"" Alena Kasinyska, a refugee from the town of Mykolaiv, in southern Ukraine, said after crossing into Romania at Isaccea, a busy border crossing in the Danube delta. ""People have no place to live, we are scared.""
Ukraine said it had begun ""hard"" talks on a ceasefire, immediate withdrawal of troops and security guarantees with Russia on Monday.
Both sides reported rare progress at the weekend after earlier rounds primarily focused on ceasefires to get aid to cities under siege by Russian forces and evacuate civilians. Those truces have frequently failed. 
BEDS AND SOUP
Frontline (NYSE:FRO) states such as Poland, which has welcomed well over half of the total number fleeing, and Slovakia, Romania, Hungary and Moldova, have taken in the vast majority of the refugees, some of whom have then headed on further west.
Poland's border guard said about 1.76 million people had entered the country since the fighting started, with 18,400 arriving during the early hours of Monday.
Temporary beds and make-shift canteens have sprung up at convention centers and disused shopping malls around the region while volunteers work long hours handing out free hot drinks and SIM cards, or shuttling refugees further west. 
At a youth education center near Auschwitz, normally dedicated to preserving memories of the Holocaust and World War Two, nearly 2,000 meals had been served to refugees in the past couple of weeks. 
Further east, an international team of chefs and aid workers in the town Przemysl have served thousands of meals daily to the refugees streaming through Poland's busiest border crossing, Medyka, located nearby.
""We do a lot of soups because it's very cold and the refugees that are coming, they cannot carry like a big plate of food because they are carrying all their belongings,"" said Clara, a volunteer chef for aid NGO World Central Kitchen. 
""We do hot chocolate, we do a lot of baby food as well."" 
Sympathy over the plight of their neighbours and deep-set memories of Moscow's dominance has seen a groundswell of volunteer efforts, but the sheer scale of the refugee crisis has raised fears of being overwhelmed.

Some countries further away from Ukraine's borders, such as the Czech Republic, have also taken in tens of thousands of refugees, piling pressure on local authorities, while others, like Lithuania, have only just begun to receive significant numbers, with about 1,000 now arriving every day. 
""Most of these are women with small children, some with only a handbag for luggage,"" said Kristina Meide, director of the Lithuanian Red Cross.

TOKYO (Reuters) - In a sign of deepening military cooperation between Japan and the United States, amphibious Japanese troops and U.S. Marines on Tuesday practised airborne landing assaults together for the first time.
Japan is revising a decade-old national security strategy this year in the face of China's growing military assertiveness. The upgrade to defence policy guidelines is expected to call for the country to take a more active role alongside Washington in regional security. 
The drills in the foothills of Mount Fuji on Tuesday involved 400 troops from Japan's Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade (ARDB), and 600 U.S. marines, and is part of a three-week joint exercise to hone interoperability between the allies. Tilt-rotor Osprey troop carriers were used during the drills. 
""The real significance from this training is that the Marines and the ARDB are doing serious combat training of a sort that would have been unthinkable a decade ago,"" said Grant Newsham, a retired U.S. Marine Corps colonel who advised Japan as a liaison officer when it set up its amphibious force. 
""It demonstrates a more solidly linked U.S. and Japan."" 
Activated in 2018, the ARDB troops are Japan's first marines since World War Two and were formed to reinforce its defence along its southwest islands at the edge of the East China Sea. 
Trained to take back captured islands using helicopters, Ospreys and amphibious landing craft, the force of around 1,500 soldiers would likely be one of the first in action to counter any Chinese attack on Japan's islands. 
China, which is locked in a territorial dispute with Japan over uninhabited islands controlled by Tokyo in the East China Sea, routinely dispatches ships to assert its claims. 

The joint drills also come as Russia's invasion of Ukraine raises fresh security concerns in East Asia where China is putting pressure on Taiwan following its crackdown on Hong Kong. Japan also faces Russia's forces operating from Far East bases that are increasingly cooperating with China's military.
Moscow describes its military action in Ukraine as a ""special operation"".

""The U.S. has repeatedly spread malicious disinformation against China on the Ukraine issue,"" the Chinese embassy in London told Reuters in a statement. 
""China has been playing a constructive role in promoting peace talks,"" it added.
""The top priority now is to ease the situation, instead of adding fuel to the fire, and work for diplomatic settlement rather than further escalate the situation."" 

Several U.S. officials said Russia had asked China for military equipment after its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, sparking concern in the White House that Beijing might undermine Western efforts to help Ukrainian forces defend their country.
The Kremlin denied any such request had been made.

ROME/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Monday raised concerns about China's alignment with Russia in a seven-hour meeting with Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi as Washington warned of the isolation and penalties Beijing will face if it helps Moscow in its invasion of Ukraine.
The meeting took place in Rome as Washington told allies in NATO and several Asian countries that China had signaled its willingness to provide military and economic aid to Russia to support its war, two U.S. officials said.
The U.S. message, sent in a diplomatic cable, also noted China was expected to deny those plans, said one of the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""It's real, it's consequential, and it's really alarming,"" the second U.S. official said, although the U.S. government offered no public evidence to back its assertions of China's willingness to provide such aid to Russia.
After talks ended, the White House issued a short statement, saying Sullivan raised a ""range of issues in U.S.-China relations, with substantial discussion of Russia's war against Ukraine."" 
""We have deep concerns about China's alignment with Russia at this time, and the national security adviser was direct about those concerns and the potential implications and consequences of certain actions,"" a senior administration official told reporters.
Sullivan described to Yang ""the unity of the United States and its allies and partners ... in bringing costs on Russia for its actions,"" this official added. 
The official described the meeting as ""intense,"" reflecting ""the gravity of the moment,"" although it had long been planned, was not timed to events in Ukraine and covered other issues including North Korea, Taiwan and tense bilateral relations.
The official said the exchanges had been ""candid"" but led to no specific outcomes.
Before the talks, U.S. officials had said Sullivan planned to warn of the isolation China could face globally if it supported Russia.
Officials of the United States and other countries have sought to emphasize in recent weeks that siding with Russia could carry consequences for trade flows, development of new technologies and expose China to secondary sanctions. 
Chinese companies defying U.S. restrictions on exports to Russia may be cut off from American equipment and software they need to make their products, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said last week.
""We have communicated very clearly to Beijing that we will not stand by...(and) we will not allow any country to compensate Russia for its losses,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price told a regular briefing in Washington.
It was Sullivan's first-known meeting with Yang since closed-door sessions in Zurich in October that sought to calm tensions after an acrimonious public exchange between the two in Alaska a year ago.
AVOID CONFLICT, CHINA SAYS
China's official Xinhua news agency cited Yang as saying that Beijing was committed to promoting negotiations to resolve the Ukraine conflict. 
""China firmly opposes any words and deeds that spread false information and distort and smear China's position,"" Yang said, in an apparent oblique reference to Washington's claims about support for Russia. China and the United States should strengthen dialogue, properly manage differences, and avoid conflict and confrontation, he said.
Ryan Hass of the Brookings Institution said Chinese support for Russia ""would considerably narrow its path for preserving non-hostile relations with the United States and the West"" and not likely alter the trajectory of the conflict. 
China is the world's-largest exporter, the European Union's largest trading partner and the top foreign supplier of goods to the United States. Any pressure on Chinese trade could have economic effects on the United States and its allies. 
U.S. officials told Reuters on Sunday that Russia had asked China for military equipment after its invasion. Russia denied asking China for military assistance and said it has sufficient military clout to fulfill all of its aims in Ukraine.
Sino-U.S. ties, already at their lowest point in decades, took a further plunge last month when leaders Xi Jinping of China and President Vladimir Putin of Russia announced an upgraded ""no limits"" strategic partnership just weeks before the Ukraine invasion.
China, a key trading partner of Russia, has refused to call Moscow's actions an invasion, although Xi last week did call for ""maximum restraint"" and express concern about the impact of Western sanctions on the global economy, amid growing signs that they limit China's ability to buy Russian oil. 

Russia itself calls its moves into Ukraine a ""special military operation.""
The United States and its allies have imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia and banned its energy imports, while providing billions of dollars of military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.

(Reuters) - A London tribunal on Monday ruled that a 2018 Bermuda law that bans same-sex marriage in the British overseas territory is constitutional, a departure from the broad trend towards legalisation of gay marriage in the West.
Bermuda's top court in 2018 ruled that the 2018 Domestic Partnership Act, which allows same-sex couples to form partnerships but prohibits them from marrying, violates constitutional freedom of conscience.
London's Privy Council, the highest court of appeal for British territories, ruled on Monday that the constitution does not in fact require the state to recognise same-sex marriages, in response to an appeal by Bermuda's government.
""Our supporters often say 'love wins.' This time it didn't,"" said Roderick Ferguson, lead co-plaintiff in the legal case against the law, in a statement by LGBTQ advocacy group OUTBermuda. ""Our work as a society is not done until everyone's humanity is recognized both in law and in life.""
OUTBermuda called on the government to clarify how it will treat same-sex marriages that had been lawfully performed since 2017. The Bermuda court's 2018 ruling had suspended the prohibition. 

""The Government is pleased with the outcome of the appeal,"" Attorney General and Minister of Legal Affairs Kathy Simmons said in a statement. ""The Government will now take time to consider the full judgment and its impact.""
Authorities in Bermuda, a wealthy, socially conservative island in the Atlantic of 60,000 people, have said that domestic partnerships provide the same rights as marriage. Thousands of people support the gay marriage ban.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to travel to Brussels next week to meet with NATO leaders to discuss Russia's war in Ukraine, U.S. and foreign sources familiar with the situation said on Monday.
The plan, which is still being finalized, calls for Biden to meet with other leaders from the NATO alliance in Brussels on March 23, said three of the sources.
They cautioned that the plans could still change given the rapidly evolving situation in Ukraine.
The meeting comes as Russian forces continue to escalate their attacks on Ukraine. 
One source said Biden could also travel to NATO member Poland, where concerns are running high after a Russian attack on a large Ukrainian base just miles from the border killed 35 people.
NATO members are worried about being drawn into a military conflict with nuclear power Russia. Biden has repeatedly said that the United States will not send forces into Ukraine, but will defend ""every inch"" of NATO territory.

White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said that the United States was closely engaged with its NATO partners and European allies but that there had not been any final decision about a presidential trip.
Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two, the United States and its allies have coordinated broad sanctions against Moscow and President Vladimir Putin as punishment.

Shots against the consulate and Mexican military premises were reported amid gunfighting and pursuits in parts of the city that lies opposite Laredo, Texas, the ministry of public security in the state of Tamaulipas said in a statement.
Suspected gang members paralyzed traffic in Nuevo Laredo early Monday by blocking roads with spike strips and setting fire to trailer trucks, the statement said.
The U.S. consulate advised its employees to stay indoors and urged U.S. citizens to do the same or avoid the area. The consulate will be temporarily closed to the public, the Mexican government said later in a statement. 
A senior Tamaulipas official told Reuters there was at least one ""collateral"" fatality due to the violence.
The gunfight followed the arrest of Juan Gerardo Trevino, or ""El Huevo,"" on Sunday, Mexico's government said in a statement.
Trevino is facing a U.S. extradition order for drug trafficking and money laundering, as well as state-level charges for murder, terrorism, extortion and criminal association, it added.
He is also a U.S. citizen, a Mexican government official told Reuters. Trevino is on a list of the U.S. Border Patrol's most wanted criminals, according to media reports.
The Mexican statement named Trevino as the leader of the Cartel of the Northeast, a branch of the Zetas gang, as well as boss of hitman group ""Tropas del Infierno"" (Troops from Hell).

The arrest represents a ""forceful blow"" to the cartel's power in the region, Mexico's government said.
The government said in its later statement it was committed to security cooperation with the United States and that crime organizations involved in the incident will face the weight of the law of both countries.

LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - The United States warned China after ""intense"" talks on Monday against helping Moscow in its invasion of Ukraine, while an anti-war protester interrupted Russian state TV news in an extraordinary act of dissent.
Moscow has not captured any of the 10 biggest cities in Ukraine since beginning its incursion on Feb. 24, the most significant attack on a European state since World War Two.
It calls its actions a ""special military operation"" to ""denazify"" the country and has asked for military and economic aid from Beijing, according to U.S. officials. 
Moscow denies that, saying it has sufficient resources to fulfil all of its aims. China's foreign ministry labelled the reports on assistance as ""disinformation.""
China had signalled willingness to provide aid to Russia, a U.S. official said, as national security adviser Jake Sullivan met with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi in Rome. 
""We have communicated very clearly to Beijing that we won't stand by,"" State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters on Monday. ""We will not allow any country to compensate Russia for its losses."" 
The seven-hour meeting was ""intense"" and reflected ""the gravity of the moment,"" according to a U.S. official. 
The West is weighing how to deal with any involvement from China, top global exporter and No.1 foreign supplier of goods to Americans.
In Russia, a rare anti-war protest occurred in a studio during the main news programme on state TV's Channel One, which is the primary source of news for millions of Russians and closely follows the Kremlin line. 
A woman held up a sign in English and Russian that said: ""NO WAR. Stop the war. Don't believe propaganda. They are lying to you here.""
The protester could be seen and heard for several seconds before the channel switched to a different report so she was no longer visible.
HUMANITARIAN TOLL 
More than 2.8 million people have fled Ukraine.
Moscow on Monday allowed the first convoy to escape besieged Mariupol, home to the worst humanitarian crisis of the conflict.
""In the first two hours, 160 cars left,"" Andrei Rempel, a representative of the Mariupol city council told Reuters. 
But local authorities say as many as 2,500 civilians have died so far, a toll that cannot be independently confirmed. 
Russia says it does not target civilians. 
But Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a senior aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, later said Russia had yet again blocked a humanitarian aid convoy trying to reach the city with supplies.
Obtaining safe passage for aid to reach Mariupol and civilians to get out has been Kyiv's main demand at several rounds of talks. All previous attempts at a local ceasefire have failed.
The Ukrainian foreign ministry said a pregnant woman who was photographed being evacuated wounded from a maternity hospital in Mariupol bombed by Russia last week had since died along with her baby. Reuters was not able to verify this.
Despite video showing at least two pregnant women being carried out of the ruins, Russia has said the hospital was not used at the time and had been occupied by Ukrainian fighters.
Drone video footage released by Ukrainian forces in Mariupol showed a desolate wasteland of bombed out buildings, many in flames, with smoke pouring into the sky.
Britain's defence ministry said in an intelligence update on Monday that Russia could be planning to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine in response to a staged fake attack on Russian troops, without citing evidence. U.S. officials have made similar statements. 
Russia has accused Ukraine of planning to use biological weapons. The United Nations on Friday said it had no evidence Kyiv had such a program. 
MORE TALKS 
In the latest bid to ease the crisis, Russian and Ukrainian delegations held a fourth round of talks on Monday - by video link rather than in person - but no new progress was announced. Discussions were due to resume on Tuesday. 
Russia ""still has a delusion that 19 days of violence against (Ukrainian) peaceful cities is the right strategy"", said Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak. 
Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky wrote on social media: ""We're aiming to do everything possible for the achievement of the goals set by Vladimir Putin, for Russia's peaceful future.""
EU member states had agreed on a fourth package of sanctions against Russia, according to France.
Details were not officially disclosed, but diplomatic sources said they would include an import ban on Russian steel and iron, an export ban on luxury goods and a ban on investment in the energy sector. 
Chelsea soccer team owner Roman Abramovich and 14 others would be added to the EU blacklist.
The war has caused a surge in commodity prices, threatening the global recovery as inflation in the developed world is already at its highest since the 1980s, many poor countries are facing a food crisis and the pandemic is still being felt.
Russia is the world's biggest exporter of combined oil and gas, and Russia and Ukraine together supply nearly a third of the world's grain exports, as well as metals and chemicals used worldwide in industry and agriculture.
On Monday, Moscow temporarily banned grain exports to ex-Soviet countries and most sugar exports. 
Russia itself has been cast into economic isolation never before visited on such a big economy.
KYIV APARTMENT BLOCK HIT 
Its forces have been bearing down on Kyiv but have made little progress so far towards the capital itself, despite heavy fighting that has reduced suburbs on its outskirts to rubble. 
In Kyiv itself, an apartment block was hit by a missile overnight, killing at least one person, officials said. 
""The staircase was not there anymore, everything was on fire,"" apartment resident Maksim Korovii said.
""We managed to put on whatever clothes we had at hand and made our way from balcony to balcony and in the end we climbed down by the next building's entrance.""
In the south, where Russia has made more progress, residents of Odessa, a Black Sea port of 1 million people, fear their city could be next. They formed a human chain on Monday, singing patriotic songs as they carried sandbags from the beach.

In Donetsk, held since 2014 by Russian-backed separatists, Russia's defence ministry said at least 20 people had been killed and 28 wounded by what it said was a Ukrainian missile with a cluster charge. It released footage of a missile on a busy street and vehicles destroyed by shrapnel.
Ukraine accused Russia or its allies of carrying out that attack themselves as a pretext: ""It is unmistakably a Russian rocket or another munition,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Leonid Matyukhin said. Reuters could not verify either account.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors on Monday asked a judge to dismiss criminal charges against a Capitol riots defendant and release him from jail, a rare admission in a court filing that the Justice Department had violated his legal right to a speedy trial.
At the same time, however, prosecutors asked permission to refile the criminal charges again, saying that apart from the Oath Keeper militia members who are facing seditious conspiracy charges, the defendant is facing ""the most serious offenses charged in relation to the attack on the Capitol."" 
In the filing, prosecutors said they had made a mistake by failing to secure an indictment or criminal information against Texas resident Lucas Denney within 30 days of his Dec. 13, 2021 arrest, as required by the Speedy Trial Act.
Denney was charged in a criminal complaint with assaulting or resisting police, obstructing law enforcement during civil disorder and obstructing an official proceeding, among other charges.
He spent several months in jail, until the government finally secured an indictment against him on March 7, 2022 - two days after his defense lawyers formally petitioned his release and the dismissal of the charges.
During that period, for reasons that were not completely clear, Denney never made an initial appearance in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia as required, despite several failed attempts to arrange for one.
""To be sure, the government failed to comply with the Speedy Trial Act in this case,"" prosecutors wrote in their Monday filing. ""But there is no evidence of bad faith, a pattern of neglect or something more than an isolated incident that resulted from a number of unfortunate factors.""
The Justice Department has struggled to keep pace with the sprawling investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol by then-President Donald Trump's supporters, in a failed bid to block President Joe Biden's election win.

To date, more than 775 people have been charged.
According to media accounts, a U.S. magistrate judge last week scolded the Justice Department for biting off more than it can chew, and saying it should not bring so many cases if it does not have the resources.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A convoy of trucks attempted to bring a weeks-long, cross-country protest against COVID-19 mandates into Washington, D.C., on Monday, but police blocked numerous bridges, highway exits and city streets, preventing many of the vehicles from entering the heart of the nation's capital.
It was the first time the protesters sought to enter the city since the convoy arrived in the area earlier this month. The procession started out in California in February.
Before Monday, the trucks, which were joined by protesters in cars and recreational vehicles, remained on the Beltway, a 64-mile (103 km) highway that encircles the city, driving slowly to draw attention to their cause. 
Officials on Monday warned of traffic delays on three major interstates in the capital region due to the closures. 
A traffic camera mounted near the 14th Street Bridge over the Potomac River showed dozens of big rigs backed up on Interstate 395 near the Pentagon as police denied access. Many of the drivers were blaring their air horns as traffic snarled.
While many trucks were blocked, some apparently made it into the city, according to live streams posted on social media.
Leaders of the convoy, inspired by demonstrations last month that paralyzed Canada's capital city of Ottawa, are calling for an end to all pandemic-related restrictions. The movement attracted participants from around the country who were angry about vaccination requirements for health, government and military employees.
It has also drawn support from Republicans such as U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin.
The protest against vaccine requirements and other pandemic restrictions has been undercut in recent weeks, with many U.S. cities rolling back mask mandates and other measures as infections and hospitalizations decline sharply.
Before drivers made the roughly 80-mile trip to Washington on Monday morning, hundreds of vehicles gathered at the Hagerstown Speedway racetrack in Maryland.

The group had planned to stage a protest on Washington's National Mall but it withdrew its application for a permit when the National Park Service would not grant its requested dates, according to the Washington Post.
A representative of the National Park Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors on Tuesday will ask a judge to detain former Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio pending trial on a conspiracy charge for his alleged role in the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riots, saying they had ""compelling evidence"" of his guilt and fear he may try to flee or obstruct justice.
In a 21-page court filing on Monday, the Justice Department said it had damning encrypted messages exchanged between Tarrio and other Proud Boys who were invited to participate in a new chapter Tarrio created in December 2020 called the ""Ministry of Self Defense"" or ""MOSD.""
MOSD, they said, was described by Tarrio as a ""national rally planning"" chapter. Several of its ""hand-selected"" members are facing charges as co-defendants in the case after they breached the Capitol grounds and tussled with police.
In an encrypted chat group for MOSD, one member told the others it was ""time to stack those bodies in front of Capitol Hill,"" prosecutors said.
Tarrio, 38, is one of the most high-profile of more than 775 people criminally charged for their roles in the attack on the Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump in an effort to keep Congress from certifying Joe Biden's election victory. 
He is due to appear before a U.S. magistrate in federal court in Miami on Tuesday for his detention hearing, but his trial will be handled out of Washington, D.C.
Tarrio was not on the Capitol grounds on the day of the riot. Police arrested him on Jan. 4, 2021, for burning a Black Lives Matter banner at a historic African-American church in December 2020, a charge for which he later served four months in jail. 

But prosecutors said Tarrio still maintained an active leadership role behind the scenes on Jan. 6, forcefully telling his followers on social media not to leave the Capitol, and later, in the encrypted chat, telling them: ""We did this.""
After the attack on the Capitol, they said Tarrio took steps to prevent law enforcement from accessing the encrypted messages on his phone and encouraged other Proud Boys not to cooperate with police.

(Reuters) - The Biden administration wants to expand a federal COVID-19 tracking system created during the pandemic to provide a more detailed view of how respiratory and other infectious diseases are affecting patients and hospital resources, according to a draft of proposed rules reviewed by Reuters.
The plan would build upon a hospital data collection system designed by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the Trump administration. Management of the program was transferred last month to HHS's lead public health agency, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The change comes amid criticism over the CDC's shifting public health guidance during the pandemic and its ability to collect and analyze COVID data in a timely and transparent way.
Authorization for the current hospital data tracking program is due to expire once the government lifts the national state of pandemic emergency.
The proposed plan would ensure it remains in place long term and add new requirements of the nearly 6,200 participating hospitals, such as providing data on the number of patients with flu-like illnesses and other diseases with pandemic potential in addition to COVID and influenza.
Such reporting would be a condition of hospitals' participation in the federal Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs for older and poor Americans.
The hospitals would be required to provide data - without names - on patients' vaccination status, pre-existing conditions, age, ethnicity and other details that would shed light on health outcomes among various populations. 
Beth Blauer, who runs the Pandemic Data Initiative at Johns Hopkins University, called the proposed plan a ""big shift"" and ""a reconstitution of trust in the CDC."" 
""There's concern that when the pandemic emergency lifts, the data flow will dry up,"" she said. ""This is what they (CDC) were designed to do.""
The rules are being reviewed by the White House Office of Management and Budget, which is expected to publish them to allow for public comment before they are finalized. CDC officials declined to comment on the proposed data expansion.
However, the proposed changes have raised concerns among some administration officials.
""There are just no signs that any thought has been put into how the CDC can raise its game enough to allow for real-time sharing of information that informs the public beyond just the federal government,"" said a senior Biden administration official familiar with the debate over the proposal who was not authorized to speak about it. 
The CDC said in a statement the agency is continuing to partner with HHS ""to ensure the data are available and accessible."" 
HIGH-PROFILE SETBACKS
The HHS Protect system was created in 2020 under Dr. Deborah Birx, the coronavirus task force coordinator for the Trump White House, at a cost of tens of millions of dollars. It quickly became an effective clearinghouse for daily hospital data on coronavirus infections and deaths. 
At the time, CDC officials conceded that the agency could not rapidly adapt its National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) reporting system to collect additional hospital and medical inventory data needed to inform pandemic decision-making. As a result, CDC recommended HHS develop a new system for this purpose, according to documents reviewed by Reuters.
The CDC said the decision was based on the lengthy regulatory review that would have been required to change its own reporting system, among other factors.
""By no means was this an acknowledgement of the inadequacy of NHSN,"" Sherri Berger, CDC chief of staff, said in an email. 
More recently, the CDC has had several high-profile setbacks on its data reporting, including overestimating the benefit of COVID booster shots for younger people and failing to track and publish data on breakthrough infections among the vaccinated in a timely way. 

Blauer and other experts said the CDC was the appropriate agency to oversee the data program. Some noted that it has received an additional $500 million in funds under the American Rescue Plan to further modernize its data collection.
""What we really need to do,"" said Dr. Celine Gounder, a member of the Biden Administration's transition team, ""is hold them accountable for following through on that.""

The victim of the deadly attack on Saturday was Chris Cleave, 54, the source said. Cleave, a permanent resident of Mexico since 2013, was driving on a highway near Playa del Carmen in Quintana Roo state when his car was approached by two gunmen who opened fire. His daughter suffered minor, non life-threatening injuries. 
Two suspects were arrested later Saturday on suspicion of participation in the killing, the prosecutor's office of Quintana Roo said. A gun that may have been used was found in their possession at the time of the arrest, the office said. 
The prosecutor's office and local police did not respond to requests for further information or confirmation of Cleave's identity on Sunday. 
In a statement, the British embassy said, ""We are supporting the family of a British man who has died in Mexico and are in touch with the Mexican police/local authorities."" 
The embassy did not confirm his identity. 

Cleave was a businessman who worked in real estate and had recently been threatened by a local gang, according to local media reports. A Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page in his name showed dozens of messages from friends on Sunday, expressing shock at the news of his death. 
Mexico's government stationed National Guard troops in Quintana Roo late last year in response to a rise in violence linked to organized crime, including gunfights that killed two foreign tourists and a beachfront gang slaying that sent hotel guests fleeing for their lives.

While Assange's extradition must still be approved by the government, Monday's decision deals a serious blow to Assange's effort to fight his deportation from Britain in the courts.
U.S. authorities want Australian-born Assange, 50, to face trial on 18 counts relating to WikiLeaks' release of vast troves of confidential U.S. military records and diplomatic cables which they said had put lives in danger.
In December, the High Court in London overturned a lower court's ruling that he should not be extradited because his mental health problems meant he would be at risk of suicide, and on Monday the Supreme Court itself said it would not hear a challenge to that ruling.
""The application has been refused by the Supreme Court and the reason given is that application did not raise an arguable point of law,"" a spokesperson for Britain's Supreme Court said.
The extradition decision will now need to be ratified by interior minister Priti Patel, after which Assange can try to challenge the decision by judicial review. A judicial review involves a judge examining the legitimacy of a public body's decision.
An interior ministry spokesperson said it would not be appropriate to comment on the court's decision. 
The High Court had accepted a package of assurances given by the United States, including that Assange would not be held in a so-called ""ADX"" maximum security prison in Colorado and that he could be transferred to Australia to serve his sentence if convicted. 

Assange's lawyers said the decision to extradite Assange based on those pledges was ""highly disturbing."" 
""We regret that the opportunity has not been taken to consider the troubling circumstances in which Requesting States can provide caveated guarantees after the conclusion of a full evidential hearing,"" Assange's lawyers said in a statement on Monday.

711,"<span>Mar 14, 2022 03:41PM ET</span>","DUBAI (Reuters) -The United States needs to make a decision to wrap up a deal to salvage Iran's 2015 nuclear accord with world powers, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson said on Monday amid fears that talks in Vienna might collapse.
Efforts to clinch a new deal were left in limbo after a last-minute demand by Russia - now at odds with the West over its invasion of Ukraine - forced the powers to pause talks for an undetermined time despite having a largely completed text.
Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian will visit Russia on Tuesday, ministry spokesperson Saeed Khatibzadeh told a weekly news conference, without elaborating.
Iran's Nour News, affiliated with a top security body, described the foreign minister's visit to Moscow as ""a platform for serious, frank and forward-looking talks"" between two countries which have demonstrated that ""they can work very closely, decisively and successfully on complex issues"".
Washington would be open to ""diplomatic alternatives"" to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon if a deadlock sparked by sanctions against Russia makes a formal return to the 2015 nuclear deal impossible, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Monday.
Talks taking place in Vienna were paused last week after Russia demanded sweeping guarantees that Russian trade with Iran would not be affected by sanctions imposed on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine - a demand Western powers say is unacceptable and Washington has insisted it will not agree to.
""We are currently having a breather from the nuclear talks,"" said Khatibzadeh. ""We are not at a point of announcing an agreement now since there are some important open issues that need to be decided upon by Washington.""
The U.S. State Department said on Friday Washington continued to believe a potential deal to return to the 2015 agreement was close, but said decisions needed to be made in places such as Tehran and Moscow.
A collapse of the talks to restore constraints on its uranium enrichment programme could result in Tehran getting within sprinting distance of developing nuclear weapons, a prospect that could ignite a fresh war in the Middle East.
Tehran denies it has ever sought atomic bombs.
STAYING IN VIENNA
Still, Tehran seemed cautiously optimistic on Monday in assessing the future of the now 11-month-old negotiations.
""We will remain in the Vienna talks until our legal and logical demands are met and a strong agreement is reached,"" Ali Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, which makes the decisions in the Vienna talks, said in a tweet.
In Washington, 49 of the 50 Republican U.S. senators said they would not support a nuclear accord with Iran.
They pledged in a statement to do everything in their power to reverse an agreement that does not ""completely block"" Iran's ability to develop a nuclear weapon, constrain its ballistic missile programme and confront what they termed Iran's support for terrorism. 
Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said he had discussed the nuclear talks with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov during a visit to Moscow on Monday, without elaborating.
On Sunday, Iran fired a dozen missiles at Erbil, capital of the autonomous Iraqi Kurdish region, in an assault that appeared to target the United States and its allies.
Iranian state media said Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps carried out the attack against Israeli ""strategic centres"" in Erbil, suggesting it was revenge for recent Israeli air strikes that killed Iranian military personnel in Syria.
Tehran had warned Iraqi authorities many times that its territory should not be used by third parties including Kurdish militants, the United States and Israel to conduct attacks against Iran, Khatibzadeh said.

Iranian state television reported on Monday that security forces had thwarted planned sabotage at the country's Fordow nuclear site by a network recruited by Israel, and that the forces had made several arrests.
Iran has accused Israel - widely believed to have the Middle East's only nuclear arsenal - carrying out several attacks on facilities linked to its nuclear programme and of killing its nuclear scientists over the past years. Israel has neither denied nor confirmed the allegations.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. court on Monday unsealed campaign finance violation charges against Russian businessman Andrey Muraviev as part of a case implicating two associates of Rudy Giuliani, ex-U.S. President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer. 
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan say Muraviev contributed to U.S. political candidates with the help of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, the Giuliani associates. Foreign nationals are barred from donating funds to U.S. election campaigns. Muraviev is charged with two counts of violating campaign finance law. 
The Sept. 17, 2020 indictment had previously been kept under seal. The unsealing comes as Washington seeks to target wealthy Russian businessmen with possible sanctions, asset seizures and criminal charges in a bid to pressure President Vladimir Putin to stop his invasion of Ukraine.
Muraviev, who is based in Moscow, could not be reached for comment.
Parnas was convicted of six counts of campaign finance violations in October. Prosecutors said Parnas used $100,000 from Muraviev to donate to candidates who could help him and Fruman obtain licenses to operate legal cannabis companies in the United States.
""(Muraviev) attempted to corrupt our political system to advance his business interests,"" Damian Williams, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said on Monday, adding that his office would continue ""rooting out efforts by foreigners to interfere with our elections.""
Fruman had earlier pleaded guilty to one count of soliciting money from a foreign national for a U.S. political campaign.
Parnas and Fruman, who were born in Ukraine and Belarus, respectively, are best known for helping Giuliani investigate Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. 
Giuliani, also a former New York City mayor, has not been charged with any crimes and has denied wrongdoing. 
Andrey Kukushkin, a Ukraine-born California businessman who worked with Muraviev, was convicted of campaign violations alongside Fruman last year. His lawyer on Monday said he was hoping to help the Ukraine war relief effort in lieu of serving prison time.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Billed by Tehran as a warning to Israel, Sunday's attack on an Iraqi city was also a pointed reminder of Iran's armed clout for its U.S. and Arab foes at a delicate moment for the Islamic Republic, Iraqi and Western officials and independent analysts say.
The unusual direct strike coincides with a potential turning point in the Middle East balance of power, as talks to revive an Iranian nuclear deal face possible collapse and heightened risks of war in the Gulf, while in Baghdad, Iraqi leaders are trying to form a new government shorn of Iranian influence.
Both developments, some regional analysts say, help explain why Iran chose this moment to exhibit its readiness to use ballistic missiles, long prized by Tehran as a deterrent against the United States, Israel and Gulf Arab states that contest Tehran's regional sway. 
The decision by Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) to fire the projectiles directly into territory controlled by the U.S.-friendly Kurdish regional government - and to declare the attack - is a departure from Iran's normal procedure of applying military pressure through proxy militias. [L2N2VF0JB] 5N2N72Q8]
The missiles hit near a building which the U.S. consular team in Erbil, Kurdistan's autonomous regional capital, is due to move to. It caused no U.S. casualties and hurt one civilian.
The IRGC said the attack was aimed at Israeli ""strategic centres"" and was retaliation for an Israeli air raid that killed two of its members in Syria last week.
The Baghdad government did not respond to Reuters questions about what Israeli sites the IRGC was referring to. There was no immediate response from the Iranian embassy in Baghdad to a Reuters request for comment on the IRGC's mention of Israeli strategic centres. The Erbil government denied there are any Israeli sites in its territory.
The Israeli killing of IRGC members in Syria was likely the trigger for the Erbil attack, but the assault was also a warning to the United States and its Arab Gulf partners, as well Iraqi leaders who are threatening to form a government that excludes Tehran's chief allies in Baghdad, officials and experts said.
""You've got three things going on here,"" said Professor Toby Dodge of the London School of Economics.
""There's the JCPOA (Iran nuclear deal), tit-for-tat fighting between Iranians, Israelis and the U.S., and now Iraqi government formation. So you're sending a series of messages.""
An Iran-aligned Iraqi militia commander insisted Israel was the prime target, but acknowledged that the message being sent could be broader - and a clear sign that Iran was willing to escalate if it felt threatened.
""It's a message to Israel and to all countries that any attack, they will respond to with missiles,"" and not just via proxies, said the commander who asked not to be named because he is not authorised to speak to the media.
PROXIES
Israel has ramped up its attacks against the IRGC and its proxies in the region with at least 15 air raids in Iran's regional ally Syria in the past year, nine of which were carried out in the last four months, according to a Reuters tally.
Iran-backed Iraqi militia groups have regularly attacked U.S. targets in recent years, including its force of some 2,000 troops deployed across Iraq and Syria to fight remnants of Islamic State, with increasingly sophisticated attacks.
Washington's own actions have included its assassination of fabled Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad in 2020. Iran responded to that killing with a missile salvo on a U.S. base in Iraq, its last known direct attack against the United States.
Tehran's talks with Washington to revive a 2015 nuclear deal, which would bring much needed sanctions relief, have been plunged into uncertainty by a last-minute Russian demand.
Their collapse could mean Tehran moving closer to developing nuclear weapons if it chose to, a prospect that would plunge the region into turmoil. Tehran denies it ever sought atomic bombs.
Iran is widely believed to have applied military pressure for leverage around previous rounds of talks and said on Monday it was up to Washington to resuscitate a deal.
""Were the Iranians thinking about all those factors when they decided to launch the missiles? I'm not so sure about that - the Israel incident was the trigger,"" said Lahib Higel, senior Iraqi analyst at the International Crisis Group.
""But there are a lot of other factors at play ... like Russia putting demands on the JCPOA,"" Higel said.
IRAQI SHI'ITE RIVALS
Inside Iraq, Iran's adversaries have taken the strike as a warning to themselves in the midst of sensitive talks over the formation of a government following an October general election.
That election handed a victory to powerful cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, a Shi'ite Muslim leader who opposes Iranian influence and is the chief rival to fellow Shi'ites aligned with Iran.
Sadr has threatened to exclude Iran-backed groups from government, and has forged an alliance with the Kurdish Democratic Party that runs Erbil, as well as Sunni Arab groups.
Sadr issued a statement on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Sunday saying Iraq's Kurds were the target of the Erbil attack, and vowed to pursue his ""national majority government"" - a euphemism for a government free of Iranian influence.
A senior official from Sadr's political office said Sadr's plans would effectively exclude Iranian Shi'ite allies from government for the first time since the U.S. invasion of 2003 that toppled Saddam Hussein.
""The missiles were a message to Sadr warning against breaking with other Shi'ites and aligning yourself with a side that has relations with Israel,"" the official said, referring to the Kurds who have kept discreet ties with Israel for decades.
The official spoke on condition of anonymity because Sadr's movement has ordered that no one speak to media during government talks.

Dodge said Iran's message was bold but risky and that Iraq would bear the brunt of any further violence. Iran's adversaries would seek to retaliate against Tehran or its proxies, he said. 
""You get into this tit-for-tat again. Whatever happens next it's more instability for Iraq.""

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks gave up gains and turned negative on Monday on worries over the Russia-Ukraine conflict and uncertainty ahead of the eagerly-awaited Federal Reserve policy meeting.
At 4:04 PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat. The S&P 500 was down 0.7%, and the NASDAQ Composite fell 2%.
The fourth round of talks between Ukraine and Russia took place Monday but there was little sign of progress toward a ceasefire after a weekend of continued violence.
The Dow fell 2% last week, its fifth negative week in a row, while the S&P and the Nasdaq dropped 2.9% and 3.5% for the week. These indices have dipped into correction territory, all more than 10% below their all-time highs.
The S&P will end 2022 about 1% lower, said Goldman Sachs, in a note, trimming its year-end target for the benchmark index to 4,700 from 4,900, citing the surge in commodity prices on the back of the conflict in Ukraine.
Aside from the events in Eastern Europe, the main focus this week will be on Wednesday’s Federal Reserve policy meeting.
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to lift interest rates by 25 basis points, its first hike since 2018. This is likely to be the start of a series of interest rate increases, with inflation rising last week to 7.9%, a 40-year high and far above the Fed’s 2% target.
Also of interest will be comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell following the decision, given the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook as the Ukraine-Russia conflict exacerbates global supply disruptions.
U.S. and China are set to hold their first high-level, in-person talks since Russia’s invasion later Monday after U.S. officials over the weekend said Moscow had asked Beijing for military ​equipment in the early stages of the war.
Also prompting further caution was the news of surging Covid cases in China, with the mainland reporting the highest daily figure in two years on Sunday, prompting the lockdown of the city of Shenzhen, the country’s main tech hub.
The Chinese tech sector as a whole traded sharply lower Monday amid fears a number of companies will be delisted from New York for not meeting auditing requirements.
Oil prices weakened Monday, extending last week’s decline on hopes for progress in the diplomatic efforts to end the Ukraine war as well as the Chinese Covid lockdown. 
By 4:05 ET, U.S. crude futures traded 7% lower at $101 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 6% to $105. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 1.5% to $1,955/oz.

ODESSA, Ukraine (Reuters) - Residents of Odessa formed a human chain on Monday to carry heavy sandbags from the beach onto waiting trucks as the Ukrainian port city frantically built defences against advancing Russian troops.
Since shortly after the invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, civilians from all walks of life have been filling bags with sand, tying them up and transporting them into the city where they have been used for barriers and to protect monuments.
""We work here because we don't know how to kill,"" said event photographer Victor Skrypnik.
Dozens of people milled around behind him and a digger piled up mounds of sand. Occasionally workers burst into patriotic song.
""We are not professional warriors, but we can help our army and 60% of victory is built here by (ordinary) people,"" Skrypnik said.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called on citizens to join the war effort in whatever way they can.
Tens of thousands have answered his call as Russia's military advances in the south and northeast and is close to the outskirts of the capital Kyiv.
Moscow says it is conducting a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and Western allies call this a baseless pretext for a war of conquest.
Russian troops have not yet reached Odessa, but Britain's Defence Ministry said on Sunday that Russian naval forces have formed a blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea coast. Many in Odessa feel it is only a matter of time before fighting reaches them.
Residents are particularly proud of their city. Odessa, with its historic buildings and wide boulevards, was a favourite holiday destination for people across the Soviet Union.
It is also where a 1905 uprising, supported by mutineering Russian sailors, was violently crushed by tsarist forces - scenes which director Sergei Eisenstein famously set on Odessa's giant stairway in his 1925 film ""Battleship Potemkin.""
On the beach, organisers said they had moved around 400,000 bags of sand into Odessa so far and that some 700 tonnes of sand were being bagged up each day.
""We are very optimistic here about the situation, because the people are very united,"" said comedian Ivan Dyubo.

""You can see that different ages, different languages, different cultures are all prepared to fight for Ukraine, and for the whole Europe actually.
""While NATO is quite silent, we are actually fighting,"" he added, echoing growing frustration among Ukrainians that the West is not doing more to help repel Russia's advance.

Days after leaving her home city of Nikopol in southern Ukraine with her mother and three you, Tamila Tvardovska could finally set her heavy bags down and rest. 
The 39-year-old was among 50 refugees, most of them women and children, who arrived at the International Youth Meeting Centre in Oswiecim on Sunday, a quiet building which normally hosts educational events.
""I think there will be peaceful skies above our heads (here), Tvardovska said.
The centre, which sits around two kilometres away from the former Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp, aimed to do everything possible to make sure that those fleeing the war in Ukraine had a safe place to stay, Leszek Szuster, its director said. 
""I am pleased that in this extraordinary situation we have the possibility to offer help to our friends from Ukraine,"" he said. 
So far, the centre has served nearly 2,000 meals to refugees since the beginning of March. 
The number of refugees fleeing Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24 climbed to more than 2.8 million, United Nations data showed on Monday, in what has become Europe's fastest growing refugee crisis since World War Two.
At least 1.7 million of them have crossed the border into Poland, where citizens have stepped in to house refugees and non-governmental organisations and local communities have mobilised volunteers to provide everything from food and water to mobile SIM cards. 
Pavel, a 27-year-old economist, took a drag from his vape pen in the courtyard of the centre as he recalled scenes of chaos when he fled Kyiv with his girlfriend and his mother soon after the start of the invasion.
""We have another war in Europe and we are being saved by this place,"" Pavel said.
To suddenly become a refugee and to be sheltering in a place of such historical significance as Auschwitz was surreal, he said.
More than 1.1 million men, women and children, mostly Jews, lost their lives at Auschwitz, built by the Nazi Germans in occupied Poland as the largest of their concentration camps and extermination centers. The Nazis killed 6 million Jews during World War Two. 
Russia describes its actions as a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and Western allies call this a baseless pretext for Russia's invasion of the democratic country of 44 million.

Just a few weeks ago, Pavel said, he was playing guitar and eating sushi in his flat with his girlfriend.
""I don't know what to do, I don't know where to live. I left my life there. I don't know.""

Brady, who had established himself as one of the greatest players in league history, stunned the sporting world with the unexpected about face.
""These past two months I've realized my place is still on the field and not in the stands,"" said Brady on his official Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account. ""That time will come. But it's not now. I love my teammates, and I love my supportive family.
""They make it all possible. I'm coming back for my 23rd season in Tampa. Unfinished business LFG."" 
Shortly after Brady made his announcement the Buccaneers reacted with their own message on Twitter: ""He's baaackkkk,"" the team said with a video of the quarterback taking the field.
The NFL echoed that sentiment, tweeting a photo of a smiling Brady with the caption ""He's back.""
Tampa head coach Bruce Arians said he was ""ecstatic"" about the development. 
""As Tom said, his place right now is on the football field,"" Arians said. ""He is still playing at a championship level and was as productive as anyone in the league last season."" 
Perhaps Brady was inspired to make a comeback after watching another sporting great, Cristiano Ronaldo, score a hat trick in Manchester United's 3-2 Premier League win on Saturday over Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford.
Brady walked onto the pitch to greet 37-year-old Ronaldo after the match, and a day later announced his return to the gridiron.
FUTURE HALL OF FAMER
The 44-year-old Brady spent 20 seasons with the New England Patriots, winning six Super Bowls before moving to Tampa Bay and leading the Bucs to a championship in his first season with the team.
Brady's decision to retire on Feb. 1 was not unexpected but came after the future Hall of Famer had enjoyed one of the best seasons of his long career.
Last season Brady was a top contender for what would have been a fourth most valuable player award after leading the NFL in touchdown passes and passing yards.
News of his un-retirement had an immediate impact on sports books.
The Bucs are now favored to win the NFC next season and Brady is tied for third with Buffalo quarterback Josh Allen to win the MVP award, according to Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR) Sportsbook. 
Brady's return will bring a quick end to the Buccaneers' search for a starting quarterback.
Tampa was rumored to be interested in acquiring Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson or Russell Wilson, who was traded from the Seattle Seahawks to the Denver Broncos last week.
Brady's announcement comes just days before the official start of free agency.
A lightly regarded prospect coming out of college, Brady was the 199th pick in the 2000 NFL Draft but made the most of his chance when it finally came and turned around the fortunes of the Patriots franchise.

At the start of the 2001 campaign Brady was a then-unknown backup but took over the starting role in the second game of the season after starter Drew Bledsoe went down with an injury and he never relinquished the role.
Brady led the Patriots to an 11-3 record that season, which culminated with an upset win over of the St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl where he was named the game’s MVP, beginning one of the greatest dynasties across any sport.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The South Korean government believes North Korea could test an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) as soon as this week, domestic media said, citing unidentified sources.
Tension on the Korean peninsula has been rising amid growing signs that Pyongyang could soon follow through on its threats to restart such tests, breaking a self-imposed 2017 moratorium.
The office of outgoing President Moon Jae-in has told president-elect Yoon Suk-yeol a test launch was imminent and that it would not be a surprise if it took place on Monday, the Chosun Ilbo newspaper said.
Yonhap news agency said separately that both South Korea and the United States had detected signs of an upcoming test.
The comment was made as Moon's national security adviser, Suh Hoon, briefed Yoon on Saturday about foreign policy and security issues, the report said, citing an unnamed official at the president-elect's office.
""It is so imminent that it would be no surprise if they fire it on Monday,"" it quoted Suh as saying. ""We are taking the situation seriously.""
A spokesperson for Moon's office said Suh had briefed Yoon on North Korea's recent movements, including recent missile launches, and the Ukraine crisis, among other issues, but declined to comment on the Chosun Ilbo report.
Yoon spokesperson Kim Eun-hye told reporters that there could be additional briefings for the president-elect but did not confirm details of security issues.
At a meeting with senior aides, Moon called for Pyongyang to stop escalating tensions and seek diplomacy, and vowed to keep up a solid security posture. 
Seoul's Unification Ministry handling inter-Korean affairs also urged the North to immediately halt actions that ""run counter to peace and stability"" on the peninsula. 
On Friday, the United States and South Korea said in a rare joint announcement that the North had used its largest-ever ICBM in two recent launches, in the guise of satellite launch preparations.
The missile system, the Hwasong-17, was unveiled at a military parade in Pyongyang in 2020 and reappeared at a defence exhibition in October 2021.
The Dong-A Ilbo newspaper also reported on Monday, citing unnamed government sources, that a transporter-erector-launcher used to fire road-mobile missiles such as the Hwasong-17 had been spotted around the Pyongyang airport, where the two recent tests were held. 
Yoon, who was elected president last week, had signalled a tougher line against Pyongyang.
While staying open to restarting stalled denuclearisation talks, he has said pre-emptive strikes might be needed to counter an imminent North Korean missile attack, and vowed to buy additional U.S. THAAD missile interceptors.

Before the election, Yoon also warned of ""even stronger pressure from the international community if North Korea fires an ICBM under colour of a satellite launch"".
He declined to make additional comment on Sunday.

(Reuters) - As thousands of would-be fighters from outside the country volunteer to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia's invasion, some may also face legal consequences in their home countries.
Citizens of Canada, Georgia, India, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States are among the volunteers, Reuters and other media organizations have reported.
Below is a summary of some of the laws governing foreigners who have signed up for Ukraine's ""international legion.""
IS IT LEGAL FOR AMERICANS TO VOLUNTEER? 
U.S. citizens are not barred from serving in another country's military, the State Department's website says. Serving as an officer or fighting against a country that is at peace with the United States can be grounds for giving up citizenship voluntarily, but Supreme Court precedent says foreign military service alone cannot be used to strip Americans of citizenship. 
A separate U.S. law dating back to 1794, the Neutrality Act, prohibits citizens from making war against foreign governments at peace with Washington and carries a prison sentence of up to three years. The law, which could technically apply to volunteer military action against Russia, was used to prosecute Americans involved in an attempted coup in Gambia in 2014. But otherwise it has been rarely enforced in modern history, according to David Malet, a professor at American University in Washington, D.C. 
""Absent links to domestic terrorism, it’s hard for me to imagine Americans being prosecuted for going to Ukraine,"" Malet said. 
WHAT ABOUT AUSTRALIAN, BRITISH AND INDIAN VOLUNTEERS?
Britons traveling to Ukraine to fight could be subject to prosecution upon return, according to a UK Foreign Office travel advisory https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/ukraine/safety-and-security last updated Wednesday. Asked by Reuters what charges would apply to UK volunteers, a spokesperson for the British Foreign Office declined to comment. 
The United Kingdom's Foreign Enlistment Act, last updated in 1870, blocks citizens from joining foreign militaries fighting countries at peace with Britain, but it has not been applied to modern conflicts. The UK Foreign Secretary initially voiced support for citizen volunteers to fight in Ukraine, but later warned against any travel there. 
Australian prime minister Scott Morrison has urged his country’s citizens not to join the military fight in Ukraine, telling reporters last month that there are ""uncertainties"" about the legal position of foreign civilian combatants.
The Indian Ministry of Home Affairs did not respond to a request for comment about the legality of Indian citizens joining the Ukraine forces. In a case involving Indians traveling to Iraq in 2015, the ministry told the Delhi High Court that allowing Indians to participate in another country's conflict ""would lead to the allegation that the Indian government is promoting terrorism in other countries.""
HAVE ANY COUNTRIES GIVEN THE ALL-CLEAR?
Germany has said it will not prosecute volunteers who join the fighting, and Danish and Latvian leaders said they would allow their citizens to volunteer. Canadian defense minister Anita Anand has said whether Canadians volunteer is ""an individual decision."" 
WHAT IF FOREIGN FIGHTERS ARE CAPTURED IN UKRAINE? 
International law requires Russian forces to treat foreign fighters as prisoners of war, regardless of their nationality, said Daphné Richemond-Barak, a professor with the Lauder School of Government, Diplomacy and Strategy in Israel. That means Russian soldiers must give volunteers who are captured food, water and medical treatment.
However, a Russian Defense Ministry spokesman last week said Western ""mercenaries"" fighting for Ukraine would not be treated as lawful combatants and would face criminal prosecution or worse, according to Russian news agency TASS.

COULD VOLUNTEERS BE PROSECUTED FOR WARTIME CONDUCT? 
Because volunteers will be fighting as members of the Ukrainian army, they are unlikely to face charges in their home country over their specific actions in the war, with the exception of prosecution for war crimes or similar conduct, experts say.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who is due to meet with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi in Rome on Monday, warned Beijing it would ""absolutely"" face consequences if it helped Moscow evade sweeping sanctions over the war in Ukraine.
Russia asked China for military equipment after its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, sparking concern in the White House that Beijing may undermine Western efforts to help Ukrainian forces defend their country, several U.S. officials said.
Sullivan plans in his meeting with Yang to make Washington's concerns clear while mapping out the consequences and growing isolation China would face globally if it increases its support of Russia, one U.S. official said, without providing details.
Asked about Russia's request for military aid, first reported by the Financial Times, Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington, said: ""I've never heard of that.""
He said China found the current situation in Ukraine ""disconcerting"" and added: ""We support and encourage all efforts that are conducive to a peaceful settlement of the crisis.""
Liu said ""utmost efforts should be made to support Russia and Ukraine in carrying forward negotiations despite the difficult situation to produce a peaceful outcome.""
Sullivan told CNN on Sunday that Washington believed China was aware Russia was planning some action in Ukraine before the invasion took place, although Beijing may not have understood the full extent of what was planned.
After the invasion began, Russia sought both military equipment and support from China, the U.S. officials said.
Sullivan told CNN Washington was watching closely to see to what extent Beijing provided economic or material support to Russia, and would impose consequences if that occurred.
""We are communicating directly, privately to Beijing, that there will absolutely be consequences for large-scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to backfill them,"" Sullivan said. ""We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a lifeline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country, anywhere in the world.""
The meeting, planned for some time, is part of a broader effort by Washington and Beijing to maintain open channels of communication and manage competition between the world's two largest economies, a senior Biden administration official said.
No specific outcomes were expected, the source added, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the meeting's focus was to ""implement the important consensus"" reached during the virtual meeting held between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden in November, which discussed ""strategic stability"" and arms control issues. 
The two sides will exchange views on U.S.-China relations as well as international and regional issues of common concern, he said in a statement published on the ministry's website.
Wang Huiyao, head of a Beijing think tank and adviser to the Chinese government, warned of ""an escalatory spiral"" in a column published in the New York Times on Sunday, and said China was ""uniquely positioned to act as a neutral mediator between a Western-supported Ukraine and Russia"" to end the war.
""Unpalatable as some in the West may find the idea, it is time to offer the Russian leader an off-ramp with China’s help,"" Wang wrote. 
U.S. officials were skeptical about the proposal given China's ties to Russia and its spreading of misinformation related to the war.
CHINA, RUSSIA TRADE TIES 
The United States on Saturday said it would rush up to $200 million worth of additional weapons to Ukrainian forces as they try to defend against Russian shelling in the largest war in Europe since World War Two.
Washington and its allies have imposed sweeping, unprecedented sanctions against Russia and banned its energy imports, while providing billions of dollars of military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.
Individually and together they have appealed to China, Gulf nations and others that have failed to condemn the Russian invasion to join in isolating Russia from the global economy.
Beijing, a key trading partner of Russia, has refused to call Russia's actions an invasion, although Xi last week did call for ""maximum restraint"" in Ukraine after a virtual meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron.
Xi also expressed concern about the impact of sanctions on global finance, energy supplies, transportation and supply chains, amid growing signs that Western sanctions are limiting China's ability to buy Russian oil.
However, Hu Xijin, former editor-in-chief of the state-backed Chinese Global Times newspaper, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR): ""If Sullivan thinks he can persuade China to participate in sanctions against Russia, he will be disappointed.""
While in Rome, Sullivan will also meet with Luigi Mattiolo, diplomatic adviser to Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, to continue coordinating the strong global response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""war of choice,"" the U.S. official said.

Washington and the Group of Seven advanced economies on Friday ratcheted up pressure on Russia by calling for revoking its ""most favored nation"" trade status, which would allow them to jack up tariffs on Russian goods.
Trade made up about 46% of Russia's economy in 2020, much of that with China, its biggest export destination.

721,"<span>Mar 13, 2022 08:20PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Ukrainian officials negotiating with their Russian counterparts are to ensure direct talks between the countries' leaders that could lead to bringing peace, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Sunday.
The next round of the talks on the war in Ukraine between the two neighbors is scheduled for early Monday, via video links. Although officials have been giving upbeat assessments lately, positive results of the negotiations are yet to come.
Ukraine has repeatedly called for direct talks between Zelenskiy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, pointing to the Russian leader as the one making all final decisions. 
""Our delegation has a clear task - to do everything to ensure a meeting of the presidents. The meeting that I am sure people are waiting for,"" Zelenskiy said in his daily video address.
""Obviously this is a difficult story. A hard path. But this path is needed. And our goal is for Ukraine to get the necessary result in this struggle, in this negotiation work. Necessary for peace. And for security.""
Russia has said previously that the Kremlin would not refuse such a meeting to discuss ""specific"" issues, but there have been no further details. 
On Sunday, a barrage of Russian missiles hit a large Ukrainian base near the border with NATO member Poland on Sunday, killing 35 people and wounding 134, in an escalation of the war to the west of the country as fighting raged elsewhere.
Ukraine has said previously it was willing to negotiate with Russia, but not to surrender in the conflict. Thousands have died and more than 2.5 million have fled since the war began.
Three rounds of talks between the two sides in Belarus, most recently last Monday, had focused mainly on humanitarian issues and led to the limited opening of some corridors for civilians to escape fighting.

Putin said on Friday there had been some ""positive shifts"" in the talks but did not elaborate. 
Talks between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers produced no apparent progress towards a ceasefire last Thursday, but analysts said the fact they were even meeting left a window open for ending the war.

LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) -A barrage of Russian missiles hit a large Ukrainian base near the border with NATO member Poland on Sunday, killing 35 people and wounding 134, a local official said, in an escalation of the war to the west of the country as fighting raged elsewhere.
Russia's defence ministry said the air strike had destroyed a large amount of weapons supplied by foreign nations that were being stored at the sprawling training facility, and that it had killed ""up to 180 foreign mercenaries"".
Reuters could not independently verify the casualties reported by either side. 
The attack on the Yavoriv International Centre for Peacekeeping and Security, a base just 15 miles (25 km) from the Polish border that has previously hosted NATO military instructors, brought the conflict to the doorstep of the Western defence alliance.
Russia had warned on Saturday that convoys of Western arms shipments to Ukraine could be considered legitimate targets.
Britain called the attack as a ""significant escalation,"" and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken responded with a post on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) saying ""the brutality must stop.""
White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, speaking on CBS's ""Face the Nation"", warned any attack on NATO territory would trigger a full response by the alliance.
Regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy said Russian planes fired around 30 rockets at the Yavoriv facility.
Russian defence ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said Russia had used high-precision, long-range weapons to strike Yavoriv and a separate facility in the village of Starichi.
""As a result of the strike, up to 180 foreign mercenaries and a large amount of foreign weapons were destroyed,"" he said.
The 360-square km (140-square mile) facility is one of Ukraine's biggest and is the largest in the western part of the country, which has so far been spared the worst of the fighting.
Ukraine, whose aspirations to join NATO are a major irritant to Russian President Vladimir Putin, held most of its drills with Western countries at the base before the invasion. The last major exercises were in September.
In the weeks before Russia's Feb. 24 invasion, the Ukrainian military trained there, but according to Ukrainian media all foreign instructors left in mid-February, leaving behind equipment.
""The dining room and dormitory were destroyed. So were the barracks,"" said Colonel Leonid Benzalo, an officer in the Ukrainian medical reserve who was thrown across the room by one of the blasts. ""The most important thing is we're still alive,"" he told Reuters after treating the wounded there.
While Western nations have sought to isolate Putin by imposing harsh economic sanctions and have been supplying Ukraine with weapons, the United States and its allies are concerned to avoid NATO being drawn into the conflict. 
""There are no NATO personnel in Ukraine,"" the NATO official said, when asked if anyone from the alliance was at the base. 
STOCKPILING FOOD
Heavy fighting was reported on multiple fronts.
Air raid sirens wailed across the capital Kyiv and authorities said they were stockpiling two weeks worth of food for the 2 million people who have not yet fled from Russian forces attempting to encircle the city.
Ukraine reported renewed air strikes on an airport in the west and heavy shelling on Chernihiv, northeast of the capital.
Interior Ministry official Vadym Denyenko said Ukrainian forces were counterattacking in the eastern Kharkiv region and around the southern town of Mykolayiv. Reuters was not able to verify those statements.
An American journalist was shot and killed by Russian forces in the town of Irpin, northwest of Kyiv, and another journalist was wounded, the regional police chief said.
Britain's defence ministry said Russian naval forces had established a distant blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea coast, isolating the country from international maritime trade.
""We must hold on. We must fight. And we will win,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a nighttime video address.
Despite the violence, both sides gave their most upbeat assessment yet of prospects for progress at talks held periodically.
""Russia is already beginning to talk constructively,"" Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak said in a video online. ""I think that we will achieve some results literally in a matter of days."" 
A Russian delegate to talks, Leonid Slutsky, was quoted by RIA news agency as saying they had made significant progress and it was possible the delegations could soon reach draft agreements.
Neither side said what these would cover. Three rounds of talks between the two sides in Belarus, most recently last Monday, had focused mainly on humanitarian issues.
Zelenskiy said the countries' delegations have been speaking daily by video link and a clear aim of his negotiators was to ""do everything"" to arrange for him to meet with Putin.
'VIOLENT AND INHUMAN'
In the weeks since the invasion began, Russia has asked China - which has not condemned the assault on Ukraine - for military equipment, the Financial Times and Washington Post cited unnamed U.S. officials as saying.
A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington said he had not heard of such a request and that the priority was to prevent the situation ""from escalating or even getting out of control.""
Russia's invasion has sent more than 2.5 million people fleeing across Ukraine's borders and trapped hundreds of thousands in besieged cities.
""It is terrifying how violent and inhuman it is,"" Olga, a refugee from Kyiv, told Reuters after crossing into Romania.
Ukraine's human rights monitor said Russia used phosphorous bombs in an overnight attack on the town of Popasna in the eastern Luhansk region, calling it a ""war crime"". She shared a photograph purporting to show the alleged attack. Reuters could not immediately verify any of the reports.
Phosphorus munitions can be used legally in war to provide light, create smokescreens or burn buildings. But its use in populated areas has been a persistent source of controversy.
In eastern Ukraine, Russian troops were trying to surround Ukrainian forces as they advance from the port of Mariupol in the south and the second city Kharkiv in the north, the British Defence Ministry said.
The city council in Mariupol said 2,187 residents had been killed since the start of the invasion. Reuters was not able to verify that toll.
Kharkiv has suffered some of the heaviest bombardment. Videos from one resident, Teimur Aliev, showed bombed buildings lining streets, burned-out cars riddled with shrapnel holes and debris strewn around.
""We will stitch up the wounds and the pain of our country and our city,"" said Aliev, a 23-year-old musician. ""We're not going anywhere.""
In Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv, firefighters rescued residents from a burning building after heavy shelling, video from emergency service - and verified by Reuters - showed.
Moscow denies targeting civilians. It blames Ukraine for failed attempts to evacuate civilians from encircled cities, an accusation Ukraine and its Western allies strongly reject.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said more than 140,000 people had been evacuated from conflict zones, but a humanitarian convoy had been unable to reach Mariupol due to shelling.
The Kremlin describes its actions as a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""deNazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and Western allies call this a baseless pretext for a war of choice.

Hurt's death was also confirmed to Variety by his friend, Gerry Byrne.
Hurt, who studied at the prestigious Juilliard School in New York City, emerged as one of the most celebrated leading men of the 1980s, earning three Academy Award best actor nominations for his roles in 1985's ""Kiss of the Spider Woman"", 1986's ""Children of a Lesser God"", and 1987's ""Broadcast News"".
He won the Oscar for his portrayal of a homosexual man who shared a prison cell with a political prisoner in Brazil in ""Kiss of the Spider Woman"".

Hurt received his fourth and final Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor in ""A History of Violence"", a crime thriller released in 2005.

ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) -Iran attacked Iraq's northern city of Erbil on Sunday with a dozen ballistic missiles in an unprecedented assault on the capital of the autonomous Iraqi Kurdish region that appeared to target the United States and its allies.
The missiles came down in areas near a new U.S. consulate building, according to Kurdish officials. U.S. officials said no Americans were hurt and nor were U.S. facilities hit. Kurdish authorities said only one civilian was hurt and no one killed.
Iranian state media said Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps carried out the attack against Israeli ""strategic centres"" in Erbil, suggesting it was revenge for recent Israeli air strikes that killed Iranian military personnel in Syria.
The attack, in which huge blasts shook windows of homes in Erbil after midnight, was a rare publicly declared assault by Tehran against allies of Washington.
The last time Iran fired missiles directly at U.S. facilities was when it struck the Ain Al Asad air base in western Iraq in January 2020 - a retaliation for the U.S. killing of Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani.
Sunday's attack comes as talks to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal face the prospect of collapse after a last-minute Russian demand forced world powers to pause negotiations for an undetermined time despite having a largely completed text. 
It also comes days after Israel carried out an air raid in Syria which the IRGC said killed two of its members and for which it vowed retaliation.
'RESPONSE TO ISRAEL'
The IRGC issued a statement about Sunday's attack which was reported by Iranian state media.
""Any repetition of attacks by Israel will be met with a harsh, decisive and destructive response,"" it said.
The Iraqi Kurdish regional government said the attack only targeted civilian residential areas, not sites belonging to foreign countries, and called on the international community to carry out an investigation.
Iraq's foreign ministry summoned the Iranian ambassador to Baghdad in protest.
A U.S. State Department spokesperson called it an ""outrageous attack"" but said no Americans were hurt and there was no damage to U.S. government facilities in Erbil. 
France's foreign ministry said the move threatened efforts to conclude nuclear talks with Iran.
In another sign of derailing regional diplomacy, Iran said on Sunday it was suspending a fifth round of talks due this week in Baghdad with regional rival Saudi Arabia.
U.S. forces stationed in a section of the Erbil International Airport complex have in the past come under fire from rocket and drone attacks that Washington blames on Iran-aligned militia groups, but no such attacks have occurred for several months.
Asked about Sunday's attack, Israel's military said it did not comment on reports in the foreign press and the prime minister's office declined to comment.
BATTLEFIELD IRAQ
Iran has not fired ballistic missiles at U.S. forces since its January 2020 retaliation attack after the U.S. killing earlier that month of Soleimani at Baghdad airport. No U.S. personnel were killed in that attack but many suffered head injuries.
Iran-backed Shi'ite Islamist militias have since Soleimani's death regularly attacked U.S. forces stationed in Iraq and neighbouring Syria. Washington has on occasion retaliated with air strikes.
Some observers said Sunday's attack was retaliation against Israel and not aimed at the United States. 
""Iran had carried out attacks against American targets and did not shy away from publicizing this,"" said Hamidreza Azizi, Visiting Fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.
""I see this more as a warning sign to Israel and a show of force in the negotiations.""

Iraq has been rocked by chronic instability since the defeat of the Sunni Islamist group Islamic State in 2017 by a loose coalition of Iraqi, U.S.-led and Iran-backed forces.
Since then, Iran-aligned militias have regularly attacked U.S. military and diplomatic sites in Iraq, U.S. and many Iraqi officials say. Iran denies involvement in those attacks.

(Reuters) - Ukraine's defense ministry on Saturday began using Clearview AI’s facial recognition technology, the company's chief executive told Reuters, after the U.S. startup offered to uncover Russian assailants, combat misinformation and identify the dead.
Ukraine is receiving free access to Clearview AI’s powerful search engine for faces, letting authorities potentially vet people of interest at checkpoints, among other uses, added Lee Wolosky, an adviser to Clearview and former diplomat under U.S. presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden.
The plans started forming after Russia invaded Ukraine and Clearview Chief Executive Hoan Ton-That sent a letter to Kyiv offering assistance, according to a copy seen by Reuters.
Clearview said it had not offered the technology to Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation."" 
Ukraine's Ministry of Defense did not reply to requests for comment. Previously, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Ministry of Digital Transformation said it was considering offers from U.S.-based artificial intelligence companies like Clearview. Many Western businesses have pledged to help Ukraine, providing internet hardware, cybersecurity tools and other support. 
The Clearview founder said his startup had more than 2 billion images from the Russian social media service VKontakte at its disposal, out of a database of over 10 billion photos total.
That database can help Ukraine identify the dead more easily than trying to match fingerprints and works even if there is facial damage, Ton-That wrote. Research for the U.S. Department of Energy found decomposition reduced the technology’s effectiveness while a paper from a 2021 conference showed promising results.
Ton-That's letter also said Clearview's technology could be used to reunite refugees separated from their families, identify Russian operatives and help the government debunk false social media posts related to the war.
The exact purpose for which Ukraine's defense ministry is using the technology is unclear, Ton-That said. Other parts of Ukraine's government are expected to deploy Clearview in the coming days, he and Wolosky said.
The VKontakte images make Clearview's dataset more comprehensive than that of PimEyes, a publicly available image search engine that people have used to identify individuals in war photos, Wolosky said. VKontakte did not immediately respond to a request for comment; U.S. social media company Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), now Meta Platforms Inc, had demanded Clearview stop taking its data.
At least one critic says facial recognition could misidentify people at checkpoints and in battle. A mismatch could lead to civilian deaths, just like unfair arrests have arisen from police use, said Albert Fox Cahn, executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project in New York.
“We’re going to see well-intentioned technology backfiring and harming the very people it’s supposed to help,” he said.
Ton-That said Clearview should never be wielded as the sole source of identification and that he would not want the technology to be used in violation of the Geneva Conventions, which created legal standards for humanitarian treatment during war.
Like other users, those in Ukraine are receiving training and have to input a case number and reason for a search before queries, he said.

Clearview, which primarily sells to U.S. law enforcement, is fighting lawsuits in the United States accusing it of violating privacy rights by taking images from the web. Clearview contends its data gathering is similar to how Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) search works. Still, several countries including the United Kingdom and Australia have deemed its practices illegal.
Cahn described identifying the deceased as probably the least dangerous way to deploy the technology in war, but he said that “once you introduce these systems and the associated databases to a war zone, you have no control over how it will be used and misused.”

YAVORIV, Ukraine (Reuters) -The Ukrainian colonel's blast-damaged car limped back from the forest where he had just treated soldiers wounded in a Russian missile attack on a military base in the country's far western edge.
Leonid Benzalo, an officer in the Ukrainian medical reserve, told Reuters he was in a dormitory at the vast Yavoriv base, just 15 miles (25 km) from the Polish border, when air raid sirens woke him at 3:20 a.m. (0120 GMT) 
The soldiers took shelter for two hours, some in the surrounding forest, and were returning to the dormitory when the missiles struck, he said.
""The dining room and dormitory were destroyed. So were the barracks,"" he told Reuters, speaking after his driver, who still had blood on his uniform, stopped to buy coffee at a gas station on the road to the regional capital Lviv.
The military training facility, the biggest in western Ukraine and a venue for past drills with NATO, houses the International Center for Peacekeeping and Security.
The blast ripped through the building, throwing Benzalo across the room, he added. He remembered six powerful explosions in total.
""The most important thing is we're still alive,"" he said.
Ukrainian officials said the Russian strike killed 35 people on Sunday and injured at least 130. 
Russia's Defence Ministry said that its attack had killed 180 ""foreign mercenaries"" and had destroyed a large cache of weapons supplied to Ukraine by other countries. 
Reuters could not independently verify the casualties reported by either side, or the damage reported by Russia.
It was the most westerly air strike on Ukraine since Russia launched its attack on Feb. 24, demonstrating its reach across Europe's second largest nation as it continued to bombard and besiege cities to the east.
At a hospital near the facility, Reuters saw at least eight wounded men being stretchered or wheeled into ambulances bound for Lviv. Some wore military uniform and appeared to have burns on their hands or faces.
Regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy appealed for specialist medical equipment to treat wounds. ""If someone has an opportunity to help, please contact us,"" he said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post.
Reuters could not immediately verify Russia's assertion that foreigners had been on the base at the time of the strike, or which countries they came from.
Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said in a tweet on Sunday about the strike that ""foreign instructors work here"" and that information about the victims was ""being clarified"". But it was not clear if he meant any foreigners were there on Sunday, and he did not specify any nationalities.
While Ukraine held most of its drills with Western countries at the base before the invasion, according to Ukrainian media all foreign instructors left in mid-February, leaving behind equipment. 
""There are no NATO personnel in Ukraine,"" a NATO official said, when asked if any NATO personnel were at the base.
While Western nations have sought to isolate Moscow by imposing harsh economic sanctions and have been supplying Ukraine with weapons, the United States and its allies are concerned to avoid NATO being drawn into the conflict.
FOREIGN VOLUNTEERS
A Ukrainian official told Reuters on March 3 that Yavoriv played a central role in absorbing foreign volunteer fighters into the Ukrainian army.
""They all end in Yavoriv, and from there they are distributed to the points of service,"" said Roman Shepelyak, head of the Department for International Technical Assistance and International Cooperation at Lviv Regional State Administration. 
Shepelyak said foreign fighters came from many countries, including - on a day Reuters visited his office - Poland, Holland and Britain.

Some foreign volunteers have told Reuters they are joining Ukraine's fight against Russia as individuals rather than fighting under their country's flag.
The British government, for example, has urged its citizens not to join the fighting.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain will pay people to open their homes to Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion as the government moves to deflect anger over its response to the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War Two.
The new scheme called ""Homes for Ukraine"" will let refugees from the war come to Britain even if they do not have family ties, the government said on Sunday.
Britain will pay people 350 pounds ($456) a month if they can offer refugees a spare room or property for a minimum period of six months.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has sought to portray Britain as helping lead the global response to the Russian invasion - which Moscow calls a ""special operation"" - but his government has faced criticism over delays in accepting refugees.
Lawmakers from all the main political parties have attacked the government's insistence that Ukrainians seek visas and biometric tests before arriving in Britain, saying this prioritised bureaucracy over the welfare of those fleeing war.
Under the new scheme, members of the public, charities, businesses and community groups should be able to offer accommodation via a web page by the end of next week, the government said.
""The UK stands behind Ukraine in their darkest hour and the British public understand the need to get as many people to safety as quickly as we can,"" Michael Gove, the minister for housing, said in a statement.
""I urge people across the country to join the national effort and offer support to our Ukrainian friends. Together we can give a safe home to those who so desperately need it.""
Anyone offering a room or home will have to show that the accommodation meets standards and they may have to undergo criminal record checks. 
In an interview on Sky News, Gove estimated tens of thousands of Ukrainians could come to Britain via this route, with the first arrivals likely in around a week's time. 
Gove said local authorities would be given just over 10,000 pounds per Ukrainian to help fund the additional demands on public services, with extra funding for school-age children.

The number of refugees fleeing Ukraine could rise to more than 4 million, double the current estimates of about 2 million, the UN's Refugee Agency said last week. Britain has so far issued visas to around 3,000 Ukrainians.

PRZEMYSL, Poland (Reuters) - At Sunday Mass in the Polish border town of Przemysl, Ukrainian-speaking Greek Catholics listened as their archbishop asked the questions on many people's lips since Russia invaded Ukraine more than two weeks ago.
""How long, Lord?"" Archbishop Eugeniusz Popowicz said during his sermon at the Greek Catholic Cathedral of St. John the Baptist. 
Przemysl, which before the Russia-Ukraine war was home to 60,000 people, is the first stop for many of the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have flowed across the border from Ukraine into Poland in recent days.
""Why did we suffer such a fate? Why is everyone else watching and not closing the sky to stop the deadly rockets,"" he told the congregation of around 100 people, many from the Polish Ukrainian community that had been living there before.
Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, sending millions fleeing to other cities or abroad while trapping others in besieged cities.
While Western nations have sought to isolate Putin by imposing harsh sanctions, the United States and its allies are concerned to avoid NATO being drawn into the conflict - a reason cited against imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a special military operation to demilitarise and ""de-Nazify"" its neighbour.
At a Przemysl school that has been turned into a shelter, Ludmyla, a 38-year old refugee who did not give her surname, rested after she fled with her parents and children from the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv which has been under heavy fire. She said she waited seven hours to get into Poland.
""I was shocked when I got here that there were no lines to buy bread,” she said. In Kharkiv there were lines lasting hours, she said. 
The United Nations refugee agency UNHCR reported on Sunday that nearly 2.7 million people had fled Ukraine as of Saturday, nearly 1.7 million of them heading to Poland.
Poland reported 79,800 arrivals for Saturday alone, Romania has 16,676, Slovakia 10,307 and Hungary 10,630, authorities in the individual countries said on Sunday. The numbers were similar or slightly higher than the day before but below peaks seen earlier. 
A Russian missile attack on a large Ukrainian military facility near the border with NATO member Poland on Sunday killed 35 people and wounded 134, a Ukrainian official said.
CRISIS FATIGUE
Ukrainian refugees have been met with open arms in neighbouring Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania, with thousands of volunteers, non-governmental organisations as well as government agencies and local communities providing food, shelter, clothes, transportation and mobile phone cards.
Thousands of people have taken refugees into their homes. Ukrainian children have started attending schools and governments have moved to allow refugees bypass standard procedures to allow them work.
But as time passes and capacity to absorb this influx of people, there were multiple warnings from the region that the initial bout of support could turn sour.

Lajos Gyori-Dani, vice chairman of the Hungarian Charity Service of the Order of Malta which manages the reception of refugees at the Beregsurany border crossing, said in an interview with news site 24.hu on Sunday that support from the public would wane.
""We are aware that soon the main task will be not the reception of refugees, but helping them integrate, helping them in their everyday lives. We also know the size of donations will decline so we need to prepare for the long term task knowing that the current support from the society will last maximum 3 months,"" he said.

Concern over China's military ambitions for the region, after it provided police and riot equipment to the Solomon Islands, prompted U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to last month announce Washington would open a Solomon Islands embassy.
Morrison said China had been ""very clear"" about aspirations to build a military base in the Pacific islands, but this had not occurred.
This was because Australia worked closely with the region, including providing COVID-19 vaccines before others could offer support, he said in a TV interview with Nine's Weekend Today.
""I talk to Pacific leaders every single week and that is what ensures that we can block the incursion into our region, because we share values with the Pacific,"" he said.
Australia is historically the largest aid donor to the Pacific islands, although China has increased infrastructure lending and aid, and provided military equipment to regional hub Fiji.
Beijing has previously said Australia and the United States are ""resurrecting a Cold War mentality"", while China's assistance would ""build a community with a shared future for China and Pacific island countries.""

Tensions between Australia and China, who are significant trading partners, have risen as Beijing sanctioned Australian products in reprisal for Canberra calling for an investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Morrison, who faces an election in May, has put his government's tough rhetoric on China at the forefront of his campaign for re-election.

LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) -Ukraine accused Russian forces on Saturday of killing seven civilians in an attack on women and children trying to flee fighting near Kyiv, and France said Russian President Vladimir Putin had shown he was not ready to make peace.
With Russia's invasion in its third week, the Ukrainian intelligence service said the seven, including one child, were killed as they fled the village of Peremoha and that ""the occupiers forced the remnants of the column to turn back.""
Ukrainian officials later said the convoy was not traveling along a ""green corridor"" agreed with Russia when it was struck on Friday, correcting their earlier assertion that it was on such a designated route.
Reuters was unable immediately to verify the report and Russia offered no immediate comment. 
Moscow denies targeting civilians since invading Ukraine on Feb. 24. It blames Ukraine for failed attempts to evacuate civilians from encircled cities, an accusation Ukraine and its Western allies strongly reject.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Moscow was sending in new troops after Ukrainian forces put 31 of Russia's battalion tactical groups out of action in what he called Russia's largest army losses in decades. It was not possible to verify his statements.
""We still need to hold on. We still have to fight,"" Zelenskiy said in a video address late on Saturday, his second of the day.
He said earlier that about 1,300 Ukrainian troops had been killed so far and urged the West to get more involved in peace negotiations. The president suggested Russian forces would face a fight to the death if they sought to enter the capital.
""If they decide to carpet bomb (Kyiv), and simply erase the history of this region ... and destroy all of us, then they will enter Kyiv. If that's their goal, let them come in, but they will have to live on this land by themselves,"" he said.
Zelenskiy discussed the war with Chancellor Olaf Scholz and President Emmanuel Macron, and the German and French leaders then spoke to Putin by phone and urged him to order an immediate ceasefire.
A Kremlin statement on the 75-minute call made no mention of a ceasefire and a French presidency official said: ""We did not detect a willingness on Putin's part to end the war"".
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov accused the United States of escalating tensions and said the situation had been complicated by convoys of Western arms shipments to Ukraine that Russian forces considered ""legitimate targets"". 
In comments reported by the Tass news agency, Ryabkov made no specific threat, but any attack on such convoys before they reached Ukraine would risk widening the war.
Crisis talks between Moscow and Kyiv have been continuing via a video link, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by Russia's RIA news agency. He gave no details but Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Kyiv would not surrender or accept any ultimatums.
Zelenskiy later on Saturday said he had spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett about the prospects for peace talks. Bennett met with Putin and previously talked by phone to Zelenskiy, but the diplomatic efforts so far have appeared fruitless. 
HUMANITARIAN CORRIDORS
Russian rocket attacks destroyed a Ukrainian airbase and hit an ammunition depot near the town of Vasylkiv in the Kyiv region, Interfax Ukraine quoted its mayor as saying.
The exhausted-looking governor of Chernihiv, around 150 km (100 miles) northeast of Kyiv, gave a video update in front of the ruins of the city's Ukraine Hotel.
""There is no such hotel any more,"" Viacheslav Chaus said, wiping tears from his eyes. ""But Ukraine itself still exists, and it will prevail."" 
Britain's defence ministry said fighting northwest of the capital continued, with the bulk of Russian ground forces 25 km (16 miles) from the centre of Kyiv, which it has said Russia could attack within days. 
Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol remained encircled under heavy Russian shelling, it said.
But the general staff of the Ukraine armed forces said later on Saturday that Russia had slowed its offensive and in many places its forces had been stopped. The military's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post did not give details.
Russia's invasion has been almost universally condemned around the world and Moscow has drawn tough Western sanctions.
The Russian bombardment has trapped thousands of people in besieged cities and sent 2.5 million Ukrainians fleeing to neighbouring countries. Zelenskiy said the conflict meant some small Ukrainian towns no longer existed.
The United States said it would rush up to $200 million in additional small arms, anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine, where officials have pleaded for more military aid. 
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and ""de-Nazify"" the country.
Ukrainian officials had planned to use humanitarian corridors from Mariupol as well as towns and villages in the regions of Kyiv, Sumy and some other areas on Saturday.
But Russian shelling threatened attempts to evacuate trapped civilians, they said.
Still, around 13,000 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities on Saturday, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk. It was almost twice the number who got out the previous day but far fewer than on the two days prior to that.
A senior Russian defence ministry official said the humanitarian situation in Ukraine continued to decline rapidly and blamed Ukrainian fighters, accusing them of mining neighbourhoods and destroying bridges and roads, the RIA news agency reported.
Russian officials have previously accused Ukrainian forces of shelling their own people and then seeking to blame Moscow, allegations that Kyiv and Western nations dismissed as lies.
The governor of the Kyiv region, Oleksiy Kuleba, said fighting and threats of Russian air attacks were continuing on Saturday morning though some evacuations were proceeding.
The Donetsk region's governor said constant shelling was complicating bringing aid into the southern city of Mariupol.
Images taken on Saturday by private U.S. satellite firm Maxar showed fires burning in the western section of Mariupol and dozens of apartment buildings heavily damaged.
""There are reports of looting and violent confrontations among civilians over what little basic supplies remain in the city,"" the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. 
MAKESHIFT BURIALS
People were boiling ground water for drinking, using wood to cook food and burying their dead near where they lay, a staff member for Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders) in Mariupol said.
At least 1,582 civilians in Mariupol have been killed as a result of Russian shelling and a 12-day blockade, the city council said on Friday. It was not possible to verify casualty figures.

Efforts to isolate Russia economically have stepped up, with the United States imposing new sanctions on senior Kremlin officials and Russian oligarchs on Friday.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU on Saturday would suspend Moscow's privileged trade and economic treatment, crack down on its use of crypto-assets, and ban the import of iron and steel goods from Russia, as well as the export of luxury goods in the other direction.

PRZEMYSL, Poland/ISACCEA, Romania (Reuters) - Ukraine's neighbours reported a dip in numbers of refugees on Saturday as governments and volunteers struggled to find shelter for the nearly 2.6 million mostly women and children who have fled since Russia's invasion two weeks ago.
Arrivals were still building on an influx that is overwhelming volunteers, non-governmental organisations and authorities in eastern Europe's border communities as well as the big cities to which most of the refugees head.
Poland's Border Guard said 76,200 people arrived on Friday - a drop of 12% from the day before. Slovak police reported a similar dip in numbers, to 9,581 people, and arrivals to Romania dropped by 22% to 16,348, police said.
Elena Pugachova, 52, a psychologist from Ukraine's port city of Odessa, fought back tears after she stepped off a ferry that had carried her across the Danube river to Romania.
""I can't speak without tears, I'm sorry, but I'm really sorry for my country and nobody could expect this...They're bombing Kharkiv, they're bombing Mykolayiv, it's only 120 km from Odessa and it's painful inside,"" she said.
Mayor Wojciech Bakun of Przemysl, a Polish city of 60,000 near the Medyka border crossing, said the number of people arriving fell to around 18,000 over the past day from 23,000 the day before and peaks of over 50,000. 
He said he needed support to prepare accommodation for 2,000-3,000 people.
""I have the buildings but they need work, it would require between 10-20 million zloty ($2.3-4.6 million). I can't finance this from the municipal budget as we have other needs, it could be funds from the European Union or from the government,"" he said.
Veronika Zhushman, 32, travelling with her 6-year-old daughter, mother and younger sister from Vasylkiv in the Kyiv region, had slept the night in a sports gymnasium at a high school in the city.
She was woken up early on Saturday morning by another refugee's mobile alert about a bombing.
""I haven't slept well since the beginning of the invasion … after the alarm went off I felt worried all over again,"" she said.
Fighting raged near Kyiv on Saturday and Ukrainian officials said heavy shelling and threats of Russian air attacks were endangering attempted evacuations of desperate civilians from encircled towns and cities.
The United Nations refugee agency UNHCR reported that nearly 2.6 million people had fled Ukraine as of Friday, 1.6 million of them heading to Poland.
Refugees have aimed for cities with established Ukrainian communities and better chances of finding work.
In the capital Warsaw, a city of 1.8 million before the Russian attack, refugees now make up more than 10% of the population, the city's mayor said on Friday.
CZECHS ASK EU PARTNERS FOR HELP
Hungary has received over 230,000 refugees, with 10,530 arrivals on Friday. Romania reported 380,866, including 16,348 on Friday.
Slovakia reported 185,660 arrivals, with most continuing their journey further west. 
The western route often goes to the Czech Republic, where officials on Friday estimated the number of refugees at 200,000.
On Saturday, the country asked EU partners to provide modular homes to shelter 50,000 refugees. Refugees would also be housed in gyms, halls and possibly tent camps, Interior Minister Vit Rakusan told news agency CTK.
Czech police warned refugees about scammers offering help with visa processing and other assistance for money, or taking personal data that could be abused to steal or launder money. They also urged caution about suspicious offers of work that could lead to forced prostitution or trafficking.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a special military operation to disarm its neighbour and dislodge its ""neo-Nazi"" leaders. Kyiv and its Western allies say this is a baseless pretext to invade a country of 44 million people.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan on Saturday demanded a joint probe into a missile India said it accidentally fired into its territory, rejecting New Delhi's decision to hold an internal inquiry into the incident and calling on the international community to play a role.
""Such a serious matter cannot be addressed with the simplistic explanation proffered by the Indian authorities,"" Pakistan's foreign office said in a statement.
""Pakistan demands a joint probe to accurately establish the facts surrounding the incident,"" it added.
India said on Friday it had accidentally fired the missile into Pakistan this week because of a ""technical malfunction"" during routine maintenance, giving its version of events after Pakistan warned New Delhi of ""unpleasant consequences.""
The international community must play its ""due role in promoting stability in a nuclearised environment"", the foreign office statement from Pakistan said, warning of ""dire consequences"" if any misinterpretation by one of the sides lead to an escalation.
Military experts have in the past warned of the risk of accidents or miscalculations by the nuclear-armed neighbours, which have fought three wars and engaged in numerous smaller armed clashes, usually over the disputed territory of Kashmir.
Tensions have eased in recent months, and the incident, which may have been the first of its kind, immediately raised questions about safety mechanisms.

Pakistan demanded clarifications from India over its safety mechanism to prevent accidental missile launches, and whether it was appropriately handled by its armed forces.
According to the U.S.-based Arms Control Association, the missile's range is between 300 km (186 miles) and 500 km (310 miles), making it capable of hitting Islamabad from a northern Indian launch pad.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States on Saturday said it would rush up to $200 million in additional small arms, anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine, as Ukrainian officials pleaded for more equipment to defend against heavy shelling by Russian forces.
President Joe Biden on Saturday authorized the additional security assistance, the White House said, paving the way for the ""immediate"" shipment of fresh military equipment to Ukraine, a senior administration official said.
Biden's decision brings total U.S. security aid provided to Ukraine to $1.2 billion since January 2021, and to $3.2 billion since 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimea region of Ukraine, according to senior administration officials.
In a memorandum to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Biden directed that up to $200 million allocated through the Foreign Assistance Act be designated for Ukraine's defense.
Blinken said he had authorized a fourth drawdown of U.S. defense stocks, in line with Biden's directive, ""to help Ukraine meet the armored, airborne, and other threats it is facing"" as the war entered a third week.
He lauded the ""great skill, iron will and profound courage"" being shown by the Ukrainian armed forces and citizens, and said the United States would also continue to provide humanitarian assistance to those in need.
""The United States and our allies and partners stand in solidarity with the people and government of Ukraine in the face of the Kremlin’s aggression,"" he said in a statement. ""The international community is united and determined to hold (Russian President Vladimir) Putin accountable.""
Russia says it is engaged in a ""special military operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine.
The funds ""will provide immediate military assistance to Ukraine, including anti-armor, anti-aircraft systems, and small arms in support of Ukraine’s front-line defenders,"" one of the U.S. officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
Ukraine has been asking for more Javelin anti-tank weapons and Stinger missiles to shoot down aircraft.
Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, on Saturday underscored Ukraine's need for additional military supplies in an interview with the non-profit Renew Democracy Initiative. 
The United States has drawn from U.S. weapons stocks to supply Ukraine repeatedly, beginning in the fall of 2021 and then again in December and February.

The last batch of U.S. weapons provided in February included anti-armor, small arms, body armor and various munitions, according to the Pentagon, as well as anti-aircraft systems.
On Thursday night the U.S. Congress approved $13.6 billion in emergency aid for Ukraine as part of a $1.5 trillion measure to fund the U.S. government through September.

LVIV, Ukraine/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Ukraine voiced hope on Saturday for positive results from Israel's bid to broker peace with Russia, denying a media report that suggested Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett had tried to nudge Kyiv into caving to Moscow's demands.
Bennett, acting at Ukraine's behest, held a three-hour Kremlin meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Saturday. He has since spoken twice with Putin by phone and four times with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, officials say.
""I believe (Bennett) can play an important role, because Israel is a country with a lot of history and parallels (to our situation), as well as having a large migration of Jews from Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus,"" Zelenskiy said in a briefing.
Earlier on Saturday, a top Ukrainian adviser denied a report carried by Israel's Walla news, the Jerusalem Post and U.S. news site Axios that had suggested, citing an unidentified Ukrainian official, that Bennett had urged Ukraine to give in to Russia. 
Israel, ""just as other conditional intermediary countries, does NOT offer Ukraine to agree to any demands of the Russian Federation,"" the adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, tweeted. ""This is impossible for military & political reasons. On the contrary, Israel urges Russia to assess the events more adequately.""
A senior Israeli official, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, called the report ""patently false"".
""At no point did Prime Minister Bennett advise President Zelenskiy to take a deal from Putin - because no such deal was offered to Israel for us to be able to do so,"" the official said.
TALKS IN JERUSALEM? 
Moscow has said little about Bennett's mediation efforts. It has issued terms including that Ukraine recognise Crimea as Russian and Russian-backed breakaway areas as independent. Kyiv says it will not cede any territory.
One official briefed on the mediation, and who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, envisaged a potential situation where the warring countries ""put it (the recognition issue) on the side, perhaps for 10 or 15 years"".
As a possible precedent, the official cited the Soviet-Japanese peace pact of 1956 that left the status of disputed islands unresolved. It was not immediately clear if the remarks reflected wider thinking in Kyiv or Moscow.
Zelenskiy said he would be open to peace talks in Jerusalem, and anticipated Israel giving Ukraine security guarantees.
""I said to (Bennett) that at present it's not constructive to hold meetings in Russia, Ukraine, or Belarus. These are not the places where we (the leaders of the involved countries) can agree to stop the war... Do I consider Israel, Jerusalem in particular, to be such a place? I think the answer is yes.""
The crisis diplomacy, coordinated with the United States, Germany and France, has been a high-wire act for Bennett.
He has left it to his foreign minister to condemn the Russian invasion in Israel's name. That, said another official, was meant to keep Putin's door open to the Israeli prime minister.

""Power in Russia is pooled entirely around this one man. It's highly personal. Israel has managed relations with Russia through leader-to-leader contacts, and that requires avoiding soundbites that might stir up ill will,"" the official said.
Citing the time that Putin and Zelenskiy have invested in speaking to - and through - Bennett, a senior official in Israel's Foreign Ministry, Simona Halperin, said in a radio interview on Thursday the mediation efforts ""certainly, certainly have a chance of succeeding"".

737,"<span>Mar 12, 2022 06:30AM ET</span>","PARIS (Reuters) - France, Britain and Germany warned Russia on Saturday that its demands to have its trade guaranteed with Iran risked the collapse of an almost-completed nuclear deal.
Negotiators have reached the final stages of discussions to restore the so-called JCPOA deal, which lifted sanctions on Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear programme, long seen by the West as a cover for developing atomic bombs.
However, last Saturday Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov unexpectedly demanded sweeping guarantees that Russian trade with Iran would not be affected by sanctions imposed on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.
""Nobody should seek to exploit JCPOA negotiations to obtain assurances that are separate to the JCPOA,"" France, Britain and Germany - the so-called E3 European parties to the 2015 accord - said in a joint statement.
""This risks the collapse of the deal,"" they said.
The deal on the table should be concluded with the utmost urgency, they added.
Washington has already insisted it will not agree to Russia's demands.

The 11-month-old international talks seek to bring Iran back into compliance with the deal's restrictions on its rapidly advancing nuclear activities and bring the United States back into the accord it left in 2018 under former President Donald Trump.
Oil markets are closely watching the progress of talks to see whether restrictions on Iranian crude exports might be lifted, which could help to offset disruption to supplies from Russia's war in Ukraine.

ANTALYA, Turkey (Reuters) -Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said he held ""productive and constructive"" talks with his Armenian counterpart Ararat Mirzoyan on Saturday as they bid to mend ties after decades of animosity.
The two met at a diplomatic forum in Antalya on Turkey's southern coast. Ankara has had no diplomatic or commercial ties with Armenia since the 1990s but they held talks in January in a first attempt to restore links since a 2009 peace accord, which was never ratified.
Saturday's meeting was the first sit-down meeting between the two countries' foreign ministers since 2009. They spoke briefly on the sidelines of an OSCE meeting in November last year.
""It was a very productive and constructive conversation,"" Cavusoglu told reporters after the talks, which lasted 30 minutes. ""We are making efforts for stability and peace.""
Speaking through a translator, Mirzoyan said: ""We are continuing the process of normalising relations without preconditions ... We are making efforts.""
The two countries are at odds over several issues, primarily the 1.5 million people Armenia says were killed in 1915 by the Ottoman Empire, the predecessor to modern Turkey.
Armenia says the 1915 killings constitute a genocide. Turkey accepts that many Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire were killed in clashes with Ottoman forces during World War One, but contests the figures and denies killings were systematic or constitute genocide.

The two countries have said the January talks were ""positive and constructive,"" raising the prospect that ties could be restored and borders reopened. 
Tensions flared during a 2020 war over the Nagorno-Karabakh territory. Turkey accused ethnic Armenian forces of occupying land belonging to Azerbaijan. Turkey has since called for a rapprochement, as it seeks greater regional influence.

VALPARAISO, Chile (Reuters) -Chilean leftist Gabriel Boric was sworn in as president on Friday, vowing to listen to all sides while warning of the challenges ahead, as the Andean country marked the sharpest shift in its politics since the return to democracy three decades ago after the bloody dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet.
At the Congress building in the port city of Valparaiso, Boric, a 36-year-old, tattooed former protest leader and lawmaker, took the presidential sash from outgoing billionaire President Sebastian Pinera, making him the country's youngest-ever elected leader.
""The road ahead will be long and hard,"" Boric said during his first speech as president from a balcony at La Moneda government palace, overlooking a mostly masked and flag-waving crowd. 
In a wide-ranging address that touched on economic inclusion, immigration and climate change, Boric energetically pledged to lead a government that represents all citizens, stressing he will reach beyond his leftist base.
""I will always listen to the proposals of those who think differently from us,"" he said. ""I'll be a president for all Chileans.""
Boric's rise has sparked hope among progressives in Chile, long a conservative bastion of free markets and fiscal prudence in volatile South America, but has also stoked fear that decades of economic stability could come undone.
The leader of a broad leftist coalition including Chile's communist party, Boric has vowed to overhaul a market-led economic model to fight inequality that sparked violent protests in 2019, though he has moderated his fiery rhetoric in recent months.
The copper-producing country is also in the midst of redrafting its Pinochet-era Constitution, which has underpinned growth but been blamed for stoking inequality.
""We need a constitution that unites us,"" thundered Boric. ""A constitution that's different from the one imposed by blood, fire and fraud of the dictatorship.""
Pinochet, whose shadow still looms large over the country, ousted socialist President Salvador Allende, who committed suicide in 1973 during a military coup. Boric has often praised Allende's legacy and did so again in his inaugural address.
""He reminds me of Allende, but I hope it has a happier ending,"" said Marigen Vargas, 62, who traveled all night to be at Boric's inauguration. ""We want a more united, happier Chile.""
'TASKS LIE AHEAD'
Boric faces a raft of challenges from an economic slowdown, high inflation and a split legislature that will test his deal-making abilities to push through reforms in healthcare and pensions, while toughening environmental regulation.
Carlos Ruiz, an academic at the University of Chile who taught Boric, said Boric would have to deal with a rising ultra-conservative bloc that did well in elections last year and find consensus to push through his reforms.
""These are now the tasks lying ahead of Boric,"" he said.
Boric's female-majority Cabinet was also sworn in on Friday, as delegations from the United States, Spain, Argentina, Peru and others looked on.
Among a sea of suits and military garb, a part of the Senate was filled with representatives of Chile's various indigenous communities in traditional attire.
""It's a sign that it's going to be an inclusive government,"" Cecilia Flores, an indigenous Aymara told Reuters in the chamber, adding it was the first time representatives from each indigenous group have been present at the inauguration.
""It's going to be a government that will make the social changes the people of Chile have been fighting for, especially indigenous groups.""

High hopes may quickly butt up against a divided electorate and legislature, split down the middle between the right and left. Lawmakers will face sharply competing visions on fighting crime and dealing with waves of migrants, as well as indigenous rights.
""I wish him success in his future government,"" the outgoing president, Pinera, said in his final address, while citing concerns about identity politics, weakening of the judiciary, and crime. ""But also the wisdom to distinguish right from wrong.""

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin shows no sign of being willing to engage in diplomacy, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said on Friday during a visit to Romania three weeks into Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Harris credited Romania for taking in thousands of people fleeing the fighting in neighbouring Ukraine and said Washington was constantly reassessing support levels for its NATO allies according to the dynamic situation on the ground.
""From everything that we know and have witnessed, Putin shows no sign of engaging in serious diplomacy,"" Harris said at a news conference with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis.
Her visit to Bucharest came a day after talks between Ukraine and Russia's foreign ministers failed to bring any pause in the conflict.
Asked if Washington intends to increase the number of troops in Romania, Harris said, ""We will on a daily basis, assess the needs that we have to maintain stability in this region.""
Iohannis said he underscored the need to make the NATO battle group in Romania operational as soon as possible during his talks with Harris.
Bucharest was Harris' second stop on a three-day trip through eastern Europe. Meanwhile, the United States, together with the Group of Seven nations and the European Union, will move to revoke Russia's ""most favoured nation"" status in an effort to pressure it to end the conflict with Ukraine.
Harris met Polish leaders and Ukrainian refugees in Warsaw on Thursday and offered U.S. support to calls for an international war crimes investigation against Russia. Her visit to Poland came amid a rift between the United States and Poland over supplying warplanes to Ukraine.
Polish President Andrzej Duda asked for more help to house and feed Ukrainians fleeing the conflict, and said he had asked Harris that Washington speed up the process for refugees who sought to go to the United States and might have family there.
About 1.43 million Ukrainians have fled to Poland since the invasion began on Feb. 24. Over that same time, more than 291,081 Ukrainians have fled to Romania.
In total, more than 2.3 million people have fled Ukraine as of March 10, according to the United Nations, which has warned that up to 5 million people could flee. That would make it the biggest humanitarian crisis in Europe since World War Two.

President Joe Biden was expected to sign legislation on Friday to help Ukraine finance ammunition and other military supplies, as well as humanitarian support.
Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"", to disarm its neighbour and dislodge leaders it calls neo-Nazis, has denied targeting civilians.

LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday Ukraine was at a ""strategic turning point"" in the war as Russian forces bombarded cities across the country and appeared to be regrouping for a possible assault on Kyiv, with satellite images showing them firing artillery as they closed in on the capital.
The governor of the Kharkiv region, on the Russian border, said a psychiatric hospital had been hit, and the mayor of the city of Kharkiv said about 50 schools there had been destroyed. 
Russia also carried out air strikes deeper into western Ukraine, far from the battlefields in the north, east and south where ground combat has raged.
In the besieged southern city of Mariupol, the city council said at least 1,582 civilians had been killed as a result of Russian shelling and a 12-day blockade that has left hundreds of thousands trapped with no food, water, heat or power.
Russia's defence ministry said the Black Sea port was now completely surrounded and Ukrainian officials accused Russia of deliberately preventing civilians getting out and humanitarian convoys getting in.
A new effort to evacuate civilians along a humanitarian corridor from Mariupol appeared to have failed, with Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk saying Russian shelling prevented them from leaving.
""The situation is critical,"" Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko said.
Western countries meanwhile took more economic steps to try to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to end his assault.
President Joe Biden, who this week banned U.S. imports of Russian oil, said the G7 industrialised nations would revoke Russia's ""most favoured nation"" trade status. He also announced a U.S. ban on imports of Russian seafood, alcohol and diamonds. Washington later sanctioned more oligarchs and elites, including board members of Russian banks, in addition to a dozen lawmakers.
European Union leaders said they were ready to impose harsher sanctions on Russia and might give Ukraine more funds for arms. But they rejected Ukraine's request to join the bloc.
At a meeting with Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, Putin said there were ""certain positive shifts"" in talks with Kyiv, but did not elaborate.
GEARING UP
With the Russian assault in its third week, Zelenskiy, who has rallied his people with a series of addresses from Kyiv, said Ukraine had ""already reached a strategic turning point"".
""It is impossible to say how many days we still have (ahead of us) to free Ukrainian land. But we can say we will do it,"" he said. ""We are already moving towards our goal, our victory.""
Russia's main force has been stalled north of Kyiv, having failed in what Western analysts say was an initial plan for a lightning assault.
But images taken on Friday and released by private U.S. satellite firm Maxar showed Russian forces were continuing to deploy closer to Kyiv and firing artillery toward residential areas, according to the company's analysis.
Multiple homes and buildings were on fire and widespread damage was seen throughout the town of Moschun, northwest of Kyiv, Maxar said. Reuters could not independently verify the images.
Britain's defence ministry said Russia appeared to be gearing up for a new offensive in coming days that would probably include Kyiv.
However, the Russian ground forces were still making only limited progress, hampered by logistical problems and Ukrainian resistance, it said in its intelligence update.
The Ukrainian general staff said Russian forces were regrouping after taking heavy losses. Ukrainian troops had pushed some back to ""unfavourable positions"" near the Belarus border, it said.
Kyiv's mayor, former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, said the capital had enough essential supplies to last a couple of weeks. Supply lines remained open.
'WRONG ASSUMPTIONS'
    Ukrainian authorities said a psychiatric hospital near the eastern town of Izyum had been hit. Emergency services said no one was hurt, but Kharkiv governor Oleh Synegubov called the attack a war crime. Reuters could not verify the report.
Moscow denies it has been targeting civilians in what it calls a ""special operation"" to disarm and ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and its allies say this was a baseless pretext for Russia's invasion of the democratic country of 44 million.
Air strikes near a kindergarten in the central city of Dnipro killed at least one person on Friday, emergency services said.
The mayor of Lutsk said four people were killed and six wounded in an attack on an airfield - a rare strike so far into western Ukraine. A U.S. official said such attacks were aimed at preventing western bases from being used by Ukraine's air force.
Britain's defense intelligence ministry said Russian air and missile forces struck the western city of Ivano-Frankivsk in the past 24 hours.
In Kharkiv, hundreds were sheltering in metro stations.
Nastya, a young girl lying on a makeshift bed on the floor of a train carriage, said she had been there for over a week, unable to move around much and ill with a virus.
""I'm scared for my home, for the homes of my friends, very scared for the whole country, and scared for myself of course,"" she said.
Moscow said its separatist allies in the southeast had captured the town of Volnovakha, north of Mariupol.
But Mathieu Boulegue, an expert at London's Chatham House think tank, said Moscow might not have sufficient troops to achieve its goals.
""You can't invade a country on a one-on-one ratio (of troops). Nobody has done it, which means that either something was wrong or they had very wrong assumptions,"" he told Reuters.
In a nighttime video address, Zelenskiy accused Russia of abducting the mayor of Melitopol, a captured city in southeastern Ukraine, calling it a ""new stage of terror."" Russia has not commented on the fate of Mayor Ivan Fedorov.
Zelenskiy said 7,144 people were evacuated from four cities on Friday, a sharply lower number than each of the two previous days. He accused Russian troops of refusing to allow civilians out of Mariupol and vowed to try to deliver food and medicines there on Saturday.
Ukraine also raised the prospect of Moscow's ally Belarus entering the war, accusing Russia of staging ""false flag"" air attacks on Belarus from Ukraine to provide an excuse.
Belarus has served as a staging post for Russian forces before and after the Feb. 24 invasion. The Kremlin did not respond to a request for comment.
Putin and Lukashenko agreed Moscow would supply its smaller neighbour with up-to-date military equipment, the official Belarus Belta news agency said.
NO EU MEMBERSHIP
Away from the battlefields, EU leaders meeting near Paris agreed to spend more on defence and cut reliance on Russian energy supplies by 2027. But they declined Ukraine's call for a speedy admission to the EU.
Western countries have moved to isolate Russia from the global financial system. The Russian rouble ended a third week of hefty losses, stripped of a third of its value in Moscow exchanges since Russia invaded Ukraine.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the U.S. economy was strong - though inflation was a problem - and acknowledged there would be spillovers from sanctions against Russia.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that on Saturday the bloc would suspend Moscow's privileged trade and economic treatment; crack down on its use of crypto-assets; and ban the import of iron and steel goods from Russia as well as the export of luxury goods in the other direction.

(Reuters) -A Texas judge on Friday temporarily blocked the state from investigating parents who provide their transgender children with gender-transitioning medical treatments that Governor Greg Abbott calls ""child abuse.""
District Court Judge Amy Clark Meachum imposed a statewide temporary injunction on investigations that Abbott ordered the Department of Family Protective Services (DFPS) to carry out, saying the probes endangered children and their families.
The ruling marked a victory for LGBTQ groups, medical professionals and civil liberties advocates opposing moves by conservative politicians in dozens of states to criminalize the provision of gender-transitioning treatments for trans youth.
Critics of such proposals have accused Republicans of seizing on issues surrounding gender identity as a wedge issue in the run-up to November's mid-term congressional elections, with Republicans keen to try and retake the majority in both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.
The injunction issued Friday in Texas is to remain in place until it is fully litigated and settled by a judgment or other means. Meachum scheduled a trial to start July 11.
In her decision following a seven-hour hearing, Meachum said Abbott had overreached.
“The governor's directive was given the effect of a new law or a new agency rule, despite no new legislation,” Meachum said, saying the actions of the governor and the DFPS commissioner violated ""separation of powers by impermissibly encroaching into the legislative domain.”
Abbott's February directive called on doctors, nurses and teachers to report such treatment or face criminal penalties.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Lambda Legal lawsuit challenged Abbott's order on behalf of the family of a 16-year-old transgender girl targeted for investigation. 
The child has taken puberty-delaying medications and hormone therapy. Her mother is a DFPS employee and was put on paid administrative leave after asking what Abbott's directive would mean for her family.
Meachum last week temporarily blocked a probe of the teen's parents. At Friday's hearing, she approved a request to go one step further, stopping the probes statewide.
'IRREPARABLE INJURY'
Meachum said the plight of the 16-year-old and her parents, whose names were withheld in the lawsuit, was an example of the ""irreparable injury"" that would be caused unless the investigations were stopped, given the stigma attached to being the targets of a child abuse investigation, as well as the loss of livelihood.
Representing the state, assistant attorney general Courtney Corbello argued that gender-transitioning procedures constituted child abuse, saying they involved administering controlled substances that physically and mentally impaired children.
The position was countered by doctors, testifying as expert witnesses, who said procedures like puberty blockers and hormone therapy were safe, reversible medical treatments.
Andrea Dalhouse, a parent of a transgender child, said she felt trapped between activists who saw ""trans medicine"" as ""blissful,"" pharmaceutical companies selling products, and Texas politicians like Abbott who wanted procedures banned.
""It's shut down the possibility of having a civil and compassionate discussion about the real science that we don't have yet,"" said Dalhouse, the mother of a trans-identifying 17-year-old. ""We don't know, if we're jumping all these kids on hormones and lopping off body parts, what this means longterm."" 
Over 60 major U.S. businesses, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), signed their names to an advertisement that ran in Texas on Friday opposing Abbott's directive, saying ""discrimination is bad for business.""
The DFPS has opened nine child welfare inquiries under Abbott's directive, a spokesman said. 
Abbott, a Republican running for a third term in office, issued the directive based on the Feb. 18 non-binding legal opinion from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton days before a Texas primary election that Abbott easily won.

The court heard from a DFPS supervisor who said that under the directive child abuse inspectors were told they had to investigate parents of transgender children, even if they did not think abuse had occurred.
""We had to be investigating these cases,"" Randa Mulanax testified, adding that she has handed in her resignation letter because she believed the directive was ""unethical.""

SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -North Korea used what would be its largest ever intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) system in two recent launches, and appears to be restoring some tunnels at its shuttered nuclear test site, U.S. and South Korean officials said on Friday.
The reports are the latest to suggest the country may soon follow through on threats to resume testing long-range ICBMs or nuclear weapons for the first time since 2017.
The escalation in North Korea tensions comes as South Korea on Wednesday elected a new conservative president.
Yoon Suk-yeol has said that pre-emptive strikes may be needed to counter any imminent attack by the North and has vowed to buy American THAAD missile interceptors, while remaining open to restarting stalled denuclearisation talks.
Reclusive North Korea and the affluent, democratic South are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a ceasefire, not a peace treaty. 
South Korea's military said on Friday it had detected unspecified activity to restore some tunnels at Punngye-ri, the North's only known nuclear test site, which were demolished with explosives when it was closed in 2018.
Analysts say that with few details on the extent of the demolition, it is unclear how quickly the site could be used again. It is also unclear if the activity is related to a number of small natural earthquakes recently reported in the area.
The Pentagon and U.S. State Department declined to comment on ""matters of intelligence"" when asked about Punngye-ri.
In what Washington called a ""serious escalation requiring a united global response"", North Korea used a huge new ICBM system in launches on Feb. 27 and March 5, according to U.S. and South Korean officials. Seoul issued a strong condemnation and urged Pyongyang to immediately stop actions that heighten tension. 
""The purpose of these tests, which did not demonstrate ICBM range, was likely to evaluate this new system before conducting a test at full range in the future, potentially disguised as a space launch,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said in a statement.
North Korea did not specify what missile was used, but said it tested components for reconnaissance satellites that leader Kim Jong Un said would soon be launched to monitor military activity by the United States and its allies.
It says its military activities, including nuclear weapons, are its sovereign right and only for self defence. It accused the United States and its allies of threatening it with ""hostile policies"" such as military drills and sanctions.
The U.S. Treasury, which has imposed a range of sanctions on North Korea over its weapons programmes, announced fresh steps on Friday in response to the launches, targeting Russian individuals and companies it linked to Pyongyang's procurement activities for its missile programs.
A senior U.S. administration official said before the announcement the aim of the new sanctions was to help prevent North Korea ""accessing foreign items and technology that enable it to advance its weapons programmes.""
He said the steps would be followed by a range of further actions in coming days.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Yoon said they had agreed to ramp up three-way ties with the United States in responding to North Korea's evolving military threat.
Japan is also considering imposing additional sanctions against North Korea, as well as other diplomatic options, Kishida told reporters after a phone call with the South Korean president-elect.
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, in a call with her counterparts in Japan and South Korea on Friday, again condemned Pyongyang's launches and said Washington would continue ""efforts to seek diplomacy,"" the U.S. State Department said in a statement.
ROCKETS AND SATELLITES
The United States and South Korea both said the missile system, known as the Hwasong-17, was unveiled at an October 2020 military parade in Pyongyang and reappeared at a defence exhibition in October 2021. 
Analysts said the tests probably only used one stage of the huge Hwasong-17, and may have adjusted its fuel use to fly at lower altitudes.
The intelligence assessments, released simultaneously by the United States and South Korea, came as North Korean state media reported on Friday that Kim had inspected the Sohae Satellite Launching Ground. 
The facility has been used to put a satellite in orbit and also to test various missile components including rocket engines and space launch vehicles that South Korean and U.S. officials say require similar technology to that used in ICBMs. 
North Korea ""has historically used its space launches to try to hide its attempted advancements of its ICBM programme"", the U.S. official told reporters.

At the Sohae station, Kim inspected facilities and ordered them to be modernised and expanded to ensure that ""various rockets could be launched to carry multi-purpose satellites, including a military reconnaissance satellite"", the North's KCNA news agency reported. 
""I think that the North Koreans are genuinely working on a set of technologies that have applications across both ICBMs and satellites,"" said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Pentagon is turning to a special team to respond to increased demand for new weapons sales and requests to transfer existing weapons among U.S. allies as countries including Ukraine scramble to obtain arms following Russia's invasion, three people familiar with the effort said.
The Pentagon's office of Acquisition and Sustainment, the weapons buyer for the U.S. Department of Defense, has been fielding increased demand from European allies hoping to ship weapons to Ukraine through third party transfers or to buy arms to bolster their own defenses, the sources said.
The rapid response team was revived in recent days to coordinate and cut through the bureaucracy around sales and transfers while prioritizing requests from allies, the sources said.
The previously unreported effort comes as the Pentagon works to respond to a rapidly changing landscape for arms deals and transfers. The Pentagon made use of the rapid response team during the Trump administration.
""As part of Department of Defense's ongoing supply chain resilience efforts, the Department is evaluating industrial base capacity to produce items critical to our national security and that of our allies and partners. This effort is focused on identifying key supply chain constraints and mitigation actions to improve capacity,"" a defense official said.
The operation is being run in cooperation with the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which oversees weapons sales and transfers to other countries for the Department of Defense.
According to an email seen by Reuters, DSCA recently asked the defense industry for devices that can be used to disable or shoot down drones that were either in stock or could be ready for delivery in 120 days. 
""In light of the ongoing crisis in Europe, the USG (U.S. government) continues its efforts to identify effective solutions which would assist Ukraine in the ongoing situation. One of our focus areas is C-sUAS,"" the message said. Counter small unmanned aerial systems (C-sUAS) technology is used to defeat drones.
Counter-drone devices come in a variety of sizes, prices and formats including the portable radar gun-like Dronekiller made by IXI Electronic Warfare and the Dronebuster from Radio Hill Technologies that can cost in the tens of thousands of dollars each. There are also larger versions of the technology including one that could shield an area the size of a stadium made by SRC Inc. The larger systems can cost in the $3 million to $6 million range, industry executives have said.
The Pentagon has stressed that smaller systems such as Javelin anti-tank systems and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, which allies are shipping to Ukraine via truck near-daily, are most useful.
""We believe the best way to support Ukrainian defense is by providing them the weapons and the systems they need most to defeat Russian aggression, in particular anti-armor and air defense,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) has said.

In some cases allies are trying to leverage the Ukraine situation to ""press for things they wanted even before the conflict,"" one U.S. official said on condition of anonymity, adding that supply chains are still stressed from the pandemic so there was uncertainty about how this demand could be immediately met.
Countries in Europe - and across the globe - are looking at expanding defense budgets to meet an increasingly uncertain security outlook, with Germany among those promising a sharp increase in spending.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Actor Alec Baldwin said in a legal filing on Friday that his ""Rust"" movie contract protects him from financial liability in the fatal shooting of the film's cinematographer.
Baldwin has been named as a defendant in several civil lawsuits including one from the husband of Halyna Hutchins, who was killed in October when a gun the actor was using during a rehearsal fired off a live bullet. 
In addition to playing the lead role, Baldwin served as a producer of the film.
In an arbitration demand filed against fellow producers, Baldwin seeks to enforce a ""broad indemnification clause"" in his contract that his lawyers said shields him from financial claims regarding the production. 
Baldwin has said he was heartbroken by the incident but does not believe he bears any responsibility because he was told the Colt .45 revolver he was handed was ""cold,"" an industry term meaning it is safe to use. He has said he pulled the gun's hammer back but did not pull the trigger.
""Rust,"" a Western, was being filmed at Bonanza Creek (NYSE:BCEI) Ranch in New Mexico. Authorities in Santa Fe are investigating the incident and say they have not ruled out criminal charges. A key question is how live ammunition wound up on the set.
In the new filing, attorneys said he provided creative input in his producing role and did not hire any crew members, who were the people responsible for ensuring gun safety procedures were followed.

""This is a rare instance when the system broke down, and someone should be held legally culpable for the tragic consequences,"" the filing said. ""That person is not Alec Baldwin."" 
Matthew Hutchins, the cinematographer's husband, argued in his lawsuit that Baldwin bore responsibility because he fired the gun and should have checked that it did not contain live rounds.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States, together with the Group of Seven nations and the European Union, will move on Friday to revoke Russia's ""most favored nation"" status over its invasion of Ukraine, multiple people familiar with the situation told Reuters.
President Joe Biden will announce the plans at the White House at 10:15 a.m. EST (1515 GMT), said one of the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The White House said Biden would announce ""actions to continue to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine"", but gave no details.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"".
Stripping Russia of its favored nation status paves the way for the United States and its allies to impose tariffs on a wide range of Russian goods, which would further ratchet up pressure on an economy that is already heading into a ""deep recession.""
The coordinated moves by Washington, London and other allies come on top of a raft of unprecedented sanctions, export controls and banking restrictions aimed at pressuring Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the largest war in Europe since World War Two.
Each country must implement the change in Russia's trading status based on its own national processes, two of the people said.
In the United States, removing Russia's ""Permanent Normal Trade Relations"" (PNTR) status will require an act of Congress, but lawmakers in both houses - and on both sides of the political aisle - have already signalled their support, two officials said.
""President Biden and the administration appreciate the bipartisan leadership of Congress and its calls for the revocation of PNTR,"" one of the officials said, adding that the White House would work with lawmakers on legislation to revoke Russia's status.
Unprecedented, sweeping sanctions slapped on Russia's banks and elites, along with export controls on a raft of technologies, have already caused the Russian economy to crater, and the International Monetary Fund is now predicting that it will plunge into a ""deep recession"" this year.
In 2019, Russia was the 26th largest goods trading partner of the United States, with some $28 billion exchanged between the two countries, according to the U.S. Trade Representative's office.
Top imports from Russia included mineral fuels, precious metal and stone, iron and steel, fertilizers and inorganic chemicals, all goods that could face higher tariffs once Congress acts to revoke Russia's favored nation trade status.

Biden on Tuesday had imposed an immediate ban on Russian oil and energy imports.
Some U.S. governors have already ordered government-run liquor stores to stop selling Russian-made vodka and distilled spirits in solidarity with the Ukrainian people.

ACCRA (Reuters) - Blazing heat radiated from the wood-fired oven of the Bethel Brothers Bakery in Ghana's capital Accra, as a dozen men hastily shaped dough into hundreds of rolls that would be scattered through the city the following morning.
The bakery, founded nearly 25 years ago by childhood friends Raphael Borketey and David Eshun, churns out hundreds of loaves of bread each day for households, restaurants and street traders. But spiralling inflation could soon shut its doors. 
""Every month they increase the price of flour... sugar, margarine, all things that we need to produce bread,"" Borketey said. ""You try to stand, then a new (price increase) will come and knock you down again.""
Supply chain bottlenecks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, a depreciating national currency and other global market factors have sent inflation spiralling over the past nine months to its highest levels since 2016, with the country's consumer price inflation hitting 15.7% in February. 
Cereals have seen some of the steepest price rises - and that was before the Russian invasion of Ukraine last month further stretched global commodity markets, particularly wheat. Ghana imports nearly a quarter of its wheat from Russia, according to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity.
The inflation has been disastrous for bakeries, whose sales prices are standardized by the national bakers' association and have not risen since August.
Many have had to reduce portion size or illegally hike prices to stay afloat. Bethel Brothers is laden with debt and has been forced to lay off staff. 
""We have sacrificed a lot (and) this (inflation) could bring it all to an end,"" Borketey said. ""A bad month or year can put you out of business. It's very painful."" 
Eshun still sets off before dawn each morning to deliver fresh bread to faithful customers from a rackety delivery van held together with pins and wire.
But these days he can barely afford fuel and has been running out between stops. 

The 45-year-old's doctor says he is in dire need of sleep, another luxury Eshun said he cannot afford. 
""I am a born and bred Ghanaian. I have never travelled anywhere before. This is my country,"" Eshun said. ""If I cannot make it in my own country, then where am I going to make it?""

BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Hassan Al-Khalaf, 11, clung to hope when he trekked across Ukraine by himself, safely reaching Slovakia after joining the masses of refugees escaping Russia's invasion of their country.
Hassan arrived in Slovakia in early March, drawing wide media attention after local police posted his story on their Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, calling him a ""hero"" after his long journey by train and on foot from Zaporizhzhie in southeast Ukraine.
""I got my hope from my mom wanting me to go,"" Hassan said in an interview before appearing as a guest at a pro-Ukraine demonstration in the Slovak capital in Bratislava on Friday.
""My hope carried me on my way,"" he said through an interpreter.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation.""
Hassan's widowed mother could not leave his grandmother at home, so she sent the boy off alone on the trip of over 1,000 km (620 miles) to Slovakia, where his older brother studies. He arrived with nothing but a plastic bag, passport and a phone number written on his hand.
""This brings tears to our eyes. This is the biggest hero of last night,"" Slovak police wrote on March 5 after Hassan appeared at the border crossing.
Hassan is one of more than 2.5 million refugees who have fled Ukraine, mostly to Poland, but also Slovakia, Hungary and Romania, to reach the European Union.
At least 176,000 have crossed Slovakia's border in an exodus that the United Nations has called the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War Two.

""I want to say a big thank you to the volunteers, because they are helping people they don't even know,"" said Hassan, who is hopeful of seeing his mother again.
""I believe that there will be a happy end.""

(Reuters) -Texas's high court on Friday effectively ended a challenge by clinics to a state law that banned most abortions in Texas by ruling that state officials including those tasked with doctor licensing have no role in enforcing the law.
The Texas Supreme Court ruled that only private citizens, not state officials, can enforce the law known as SB8 by suing anyone who performs or assists a woman in obtaining an abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy.
The conservative-leaning U.S. Supreme Court in December allowed the case to partly move forward against only those same licensing officials and not others, while leaving the ban in place.
Suing officials would have allowed the clinics to overcome a novel feature of the law that has frustrated their ability to challenge it in federal court by placing enforcement in the hands of private citizens, rather than the state officials.
The clinics sought an injunction barring the officials from enforcing the law, which took effect Sept. 1 and bans abortions after cardiac activity is detected in the embryo. Citizens can be awarded at least $10,000 for successful lawsuits.
The clinics contend the law is unconstitutional under Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that made abortion legal nationwide, and that the U.S. Supreme Court with its 6-3 conservative majority is now weighing rolling back or overturning in a Mississippi case.
After the Supreme Court's December ruling, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals asked the Republican-dominated Texas Supreme Court to consider whether those licensing officials could indirectly enforce the law by taking disciplinary actions against violators.
Justice Jeffrey Boyd, writing for the unanimous nine-member court, on Friday said the answer was no. ""Texas law does not grant the state-agency executives named as defendants in this case any authority to enforce the Act’s requirements.""

While the case now will return to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, abortion rights groups said the ruling meant their high-profile case would now be thrown out. Other challenges to the law remain pending.
""With this ruling, the sliver of this case that we were left with is gone,"" Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represented the clinics, said in a statement.

The mayor of the city of Lutsk in western Ukraine, said four people were killed and six wounded in an attack on an airfield there, a rare strike on a target deep in western Ukraine far from the battlefields in the north, east and south.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, could not say the extent to which targeted airfields had been used by Ukraine's air force.
Ukraine still had about 56 fighter jets available to use, more than 80 percent of their inventory, the official told reporters.
Russian jets were flying about 200 sorties per day in and around Ukraine, the official added. 
Images released by private U.S. satellite firm Maxar showed that a large Russian military convoy, last seen northwest of Kyiv near Antonov airport, has largely dispersed and redeployed.
The official said that some parts of the convoy had moved away from the main road and towards the tree line to protect themselves rather than a tactical move to advance towards Kyiv. 
Advance elements of the Russian military were as close as about 15 km (9 miles) away from Kyiv's city center, the official added.

LONDON (Reuters) -Russia might use chemical weapons in Ukraine in a ""false flag"" attack to provide a retrospective justification for its invasion, but there is nothing to suggest a broader use of such weapons in the war, Western officials said.
Russia's war in Ukraine has entered a third week with thousands of people killed, more than two million made refugees and people cowering in besieged cities under relentless bombardment.
""We think that chemical weapons could be used in a false flag attack to provide a retrospective justification for Russia's invasion of Ukraine,"" one of the officials said on Friday.
""The context that we've been looking at it in is from a false flag perspective. Clearly, whilst the Russians are highly likely to have a chemical weapons capability, there is nothing to suggest that they intend to use at this point in a major escalation of the current conflict.""
The comments came after the United States this week denied renewed Russian accusations that Washington was operating biowarfare labs in Ukraine. It called the claims ""laughable"" and suggested Moscow may be laying the groundwork to use a chemical or biological weapon.
The officials said a third Russian major general had been killed in fighting in Ukraine. There had probably been around 20 Russian major generals deployed in Ukraine, the officials said.
This could suggest Russian ""troops are unable to make decisions of their own and lack situational awareness, or where they are fearful of moving forward, at which point more senior officers come forward to lead from the front,"" the official said. 

The officials said the Russian forces' advance had been slowed by logistical problems, low morale and Ukrainian resistance.
Overall, Russia has lost about 5,000 to 6,000 soldiers, they said. Ukraine says its forces have killed more than 12,000 Russian troops. Russia has confirmed about 500 losses.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Arrests and deportations of immigrants living illegally in the United States plummeted in 2021 compared with 2020, while more of those arrested were convicted of serious crimes in keeping with a shifting strategy under U.S. President Joe Biden, an agency said in a report released on Friday.
Overall, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) made about 74,000 arrests of immigration offenders in the 2021 fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30. That is a 28 percent decrease compared with the previous year and the lowest total in over a decade, according to the agency's data reviewed by Reuters.
ICE deportations of immigrants also plunged in 2021 - to 59,000 compared with 186,000 in 2020. The 2021 total was the lowest since 1995, according to government data.
Of those arrested in fiscal year 2021, approximately 12,000 were people convicted of what is known as an ""aggravated felony,"" which includes violent crimes but can also include non-violent misdemeanors. 
The total of those with serious criminal histories was nearly double a year earlier, reflecting a move by Biden's Democratic White House to prioritize the arrest of more serious offenders and de-emphasize enforcement against non-criminals in contrast to former President Donald Trump, a Republican.
""As the annual report's data reflects, ICE's officers and special agents focused on cases that delivered the greatest law enforcement impact in communities across the country while upholding our values as a nation,"" acting ICE Director Tae Johnson said in a related news release.

In a setback for Biden, the U.S. Senate on Tuesday night unexpectedly delayed a vote on Biden's pick to run the agency, Harris County, Texas, Sheriff Ed Gonzalez.
The delay came after Republican Senator James Lankford raised concerns over an allegation of domestic abuse that Gonzalez denies.

PORT READING, New Jersey (Reuters) - In a corner of a cavernous warehouse, a woman in a yellow Tweety Bird sweatshirt separated catheters from blood-stopping gauzes. Another volunteer sealed up a box of energy bars and gloves, while a ponytailed man sorted batteries and diapers.
""I'm a Ukrainian - every Ukrainian should be doing something,"" said Roman Pylypiv, 27, who had driven from his Philadelphia home to the New Jersey warehouse to help prepare donations for Ukrainians.
""There's men my age fighting there,"" said Pylypiv, who moved to the United States eight years ago from the western Ukrainian city of Ivano-Frankivsk, where his family remains. ""This is nothing like what they do.""
Hundreds of volunteers have descended upon the warehouse run by Meest-America Inc, a shipping company specializing in deliveries to Eastern Europe, to sort and pack donated medical supplies, clothing, military equipment and other goods destined for Ukraine.
Its warehouse sprawls across 92,000 square feet (8,550 square meters) - more than an American football field - just 14 miles (22 km) from Newark Liberty International Airport.
Inside are 35 long rows of orange painted brackets, each three shelves high and overflowing with packages of toys, housewares and other goods - typical shipments that have been put on hold since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Over the past two weeks, nearly all of Meest-America's work has shifted to organizing deliveries of humanitarian aid donated by churches, charities and individuals, Chief Operating Officer Natalia Brandafi said in an interview.
The company, whose name means bridge in Ukrainian, is charging a 30% discounted rate for the humanitarian goods it is handling, funded by monetary donations, she said. It has been able to secure export permits for sensitive items such as bullet-proof vests and helmets.
In the last week alone, Meest's New Jersey warehouse shipped more than 260,000 pounds (120,000 kg) of humanitarian aid, nearly all of it First Aid kits, medical supplies and non-perishable food, Brandafi said.
Demand for medical supplies and military gear replaced an earlier plea for warm clothing and baby goods. 
More than 2 million Ukrainians have fled the country, many with only what they had on their backs. Nearly all are women and children, as men were urged to stay and fight, and the government issued them weapons to bolster the Ukrainian Armed Forces defense.
For donation requests, Meest consults with the Ukraine Embassy in Washington, the Ukraine Consulate in New York and the delivery company's headquarters in the western Ukraine city of Lviv, Brandafi said.
In a corner of the warehouse, Valentyna Goloborodko, an Odessa native who is an internal medicine doctor at New York City's Montefiore Medical Center, pushed up her Tweety Bird sweatshirt sleeves on her third day as a volunteer.

She separated donated ""medical goods"" from more urgently needed ""tactical medicine,"" such as First Aid kit hemostatic gauze to pack a wound and stop bleeding. 
""It's simple things that could save somebody's life in the battlefield,"" Goloborodko said.

""We will fight until the end, we are not going to live in a Russia-managed state."" Korsunsky told Reuters in an interview.
""There is no reason to believe that he (Putin) can threaten us, as he thinks, to the state that we will overthrow our government and we will embrace Russia after what they have done to us. No way. Therefore he may use nuclear weapons.""
Late last month, Putin ordered his military command to put Russia's deterrence forces - which include nuclear arms - on high alert, citing what he called aggressive statements by NATO leaders and Western economic sanctions against Moscow.
Putin has not directly threatened to use nuclear arms. But while announcing the military operation in Ukraine last month, he said after referring to Russia's powerful nuclear arsenal: ""Whoever tries to hinder us... should know that Russia's response will be immediate. And it will lead you to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history."" 
Korsunsky said that Ukraine was relying on its allies to help avoid any kind of escalation.

""We try to work with our partners, major nuclear powers who know how to monitor the situation on nuclear weapons, and which can help us not to allow this to happen,"" he said.
Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation. It says it wants to ""demilitarise"" and ""denazify"" its pro-Western neighbour and prevent Kyiv from joining NATO.

LONDON (Reuters) - Talks between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers produced no apparent progress towards a ceasefire on Thursday but analysts said the fact they were even meeting left a window open for ending Russia’s war against Ukraine.
Ukraine's Dmytro Kuleba said his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov had indicated he did not have the authority to negotiate even a 24-hour ceasefire or a humanitarian corridor in Mariupol, the besieged southern Ukrainian city under heavy fire from Russian artillery.
But Lavrov left the door open for further talks and an eventual meeting between presidents Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
""I hope that this will become necessary at some point,” Lavrov said. ""But preparatory work needs to take place for this.""
Moscow’s position – at least rhetorically — has appeared to soften in recent days, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying the war could stop ""in a moment"" if Kyiv agreed to a list of demands that has appeared to narrow since the start of the war.
The focus has switched to neutrality for Ukraine and the status of Russian-occupied regions, while the Russian foreign ministry said it was not seeking to overthrow the Kyiv government.
But the Kremlin has continued its military onslaught regardless, striking a maternity hospital in Mariupol with missiles and seeking to move relentlessly closer to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.
French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday that Russian forces were “indiscriminately” using lethal weapons against civilian targets. “I am worried, pessimistic,” the French leader said, adding he saw no diplomatic solution in the coming days.
HARD ROAD
Analysts said the road ahead for any negotiation would be difficult, but Moscow’s slower than expected military progress and the stinging cost of economic sanctions imposed by a united West had potentially opened an opportunity for a compromise.
""The position of Moscow in this war has weakened because they have not been able to implement their initial plans,"" said Nikolai Petrov, senior research fellow for Eurasia at Chatham House. 
""For Putin, the imposing of sanctions has been a terrible thing. They are killing the Russian economy and also acting on the people around him.""
Petrov said Putin faced an increasingly difficult situation, including with his army.
""The army is demoralised and is not ready for a long-term operation. When they spoke of days initially that was one thing, but with a longer war it is absolutely different,"" he said.
""For the political elite for whom the war was a shock, there is a complete feeling that Putin made a colossal and tragic mistake. The Russian side has softened its position but it can’t soften it any further.""
Others, however, cautioned that Putin could still seek to escalate. A defiant Kremlin leader on Thursday said Russia would emerge stronger from the economic sanctions, while ultimately the measures would rebound on the West.
""There is pressure from the elite"" to find a compromise, said Sergei Guriev, the well-connected former chief economist for the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development. 
""The question is how effective it can be. Putin so far seems to be doubling down. If he believes in the foreseeable future he will manage to encircle Kyiv and destroy it, he may say I will go on.
""In that sense an immediate decision on a further EU embargo on Russian oil imports would be important,"" Guriev said, referring to discussions ongoing in the EU on whether to join a US and UK ban on purchases of Russian oil.
""WE HAVE MOVED THE DIAL""
Jonathan Eyal, associate director at the Royal United Services Institute in London, said the Kremlin's reframing of its demands had provided ""the first indication that Moscow is prepared to climb down on regime change"".
""There is also an element of compromise in Zelenskiy’s declaration about an alternative to NATO membership,"" he said.
""We have moved the dial for the process from zero to at least having the possibility for a discussion. But the indications of troop movements toward Kyiv may indicate that the worst may still be ahead of us,"" Eyal said.
On Tuesday Zelenskiy responded to the apparent softening of Moscow’s demands by saying he was ready to withdraw the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO, an aim that is currently enshrined in the Ukrainian constitution but has long been a source of deep concern for Russia.
Zelenskiy said instead, however, he wanted a collective security agreement with the participation of Ukraine’s neighbours, as well as the United States, France, Germany and Turkey, that would provide security guarantees in case of further attack.
He also said he was willing to seek a compromise over Crimea, the peninsula Russia annexed in 2014. Kremlin spokesman Peskov said Moscow was now demanding Kyiv accept Crimea was Russian territory and recognise the independence of the separatist republics of Donetsk and Lugansk. 
Analysts cautioned the path was still fraught for both sides. 
""The conditions being forwarded by Russia would still amount to a significant blow for Ukraine... Zelenskiy is being asked to accept the de jure loss of Ukrainian territory,"" Eyal said.
While there had been no discussion of any withdrawal of Russian troops from territory it had taken since the start of the war, Zelenskiy’s desire for a collective security agreement instead of NATO membership meant ""effectively he wants a bespoke NATO,"" Eyal said.
Petrov said it would be psychologically difficult for Ukrainians to accept any loss of territory, particularly after Russia’s devastating invasion and Ukraine’s success so far in fiercely slowing it down, Petrov said. 
But this had to be weighed against the chance of stopping a war in which people were dying in their hundreds every day.

""The Ukrainians are in euphoria that they have been able to heroically resist when no one believed that they could, and in the belief that if the West will help, they just need to keep fighting and they will win,"" Petrov said.
""But this is not correct and it does not help find a rational solution.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department acknowledged on Thursday it would miss a deadline set by President Joe Biden's executive order to review and release documents from the FBI investigation of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, which killed nearly 3,000 people.
In a filing, it told Judge Sarah Netburn in New York the FBI would have released most of the required documents by mid-March, but more releases would occur into mid-April.
This was ""due to continuing co-ordination with a number of foreign governments and ongoing interagency review,"" it added.
In September, Biden ordered the Justice Department to review documents from the FBI investigation and gave it six months to make public the declassified documents.
The FBI was also working to create separate ""production sets"" of the documents by mid-April since the records produced in line with the order contained redactions required by the Privacy Act, the Justice Department told the judge.
To date, it said, the FBI has released over 700 documents and over 2,700 pages in accordance with the process outlined in the Sept. 3 executive order. 
Relatives of the people killed on Sept. 11, 2001, have been pushing for years for more information about what the FBI discovered in its probe and have contended that the documents would show Saudi Arabian authorities supported the plot.
Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia. The kingdom has long said it had no role in the attacks. 
9/11 Families United, a group that represents families and survivors of the attacks, sent Biden a letter on Thursday, urging him to raise the Sept. 11 attacks in any meetings with the Gulf country as he pushes oil producers to boost output and ease price pressures sparked by Russia's war against Ukraine.
Media reports said Biden was considering a visit to the kingdom, but the White House has said there are no current plans for Biden to travel there.
The group praised Biden's actions to release more documents, but said no reset of U.S.-Saudi ties could succeed ""without proper reconciliation for the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.""
It said thousands of pages of new evidence against Saudi Arabia had been released under Biden's executive order, but the majority were not made available to the 9/11 Commission. The Commission investigated the attacks and found no evidence that Saudi Arabia directly funded al Qaeda, the group led by Osama bin Laden, the mastermind behind the Sept. 11 attacks.

It left open whether individual Saudi officials might have done so.
The families of roughly 2,500 of those killed in the attacks, and more than 20,000 people who suffered injuries, businesses and various insurers, have sued Saudi Arabia seeking billions of dollars.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea's latest launches appear aimed at developing and testing technology that can be used both for spy satellites and in a massive intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of launching multiple nuclear warheads, analysts said.
North Korea deployed a new ICBM system in Feb. 27 and March 5 test-firings, U.S. and South Korean officials said on Friday, in what could be a prelude to the nuclear-armed country's first full ICBM test since 2017, potentially disguised as a space launch.
The giant, long-range missile system, known as the Hwasong-17, was first unveiled at an October 2020 military parade in Pyongyang and reappeared at a defence exhibition in October 2021, according to U.S. and South Korean officials.
The large size of the Hwasong-17 suggests North Korea may be looking to tip it with multiple nuclear warheads in ""multiple independently-targetable reentry vehicles"" (MIRV), analysts said.
In such a system, the main rocket booster pushes a ""bus"" carrying multiple reentry vehicles and sometimes decoys to confuse missile defence systems, into a suborbital ballistic flight path. 
The bus then uses small on-board rocket motors and a computerised inertial guidance system to manoeuvre and release the warheads on different trajectories.
State media reports on the recent satellite system tests mentioned attitude control, which refers to small motors that help reorient an aerodynamic object, Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace noted.
""It turns out that this would help them both develop and deploy new reconnaissance satellites as well as a 'bus' for multiple warheads on an ICBM,"" he said.
In 2021, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said a multi-warhead rocket was in the final stage of development.
Kim has also said putting multiple reconnaissance satellites in orbit is important for the country's security, as well as its national prestige, and has suggested he could order new ICBM tests.
""North Korea wants to successfully place a satellite in orbit,"" Michael Duitsman, a researcher at the U.S.-based James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""I suspect that, even more than that, they want to put more warheads on their missiles, to maximize their limited number of TELs,"" he added, referring to the Transporter Erector Launcher (TEL) vehicles used to fire road-mobile missiles like the Hwasong-17.
SECRETIVE LAUNCHES
North Korea was unusually secretive about the launches, saying they tested various components to be used in a developmental reconnaissance satellite but releasing no details or photos of the rockets involved.
Unlike North Korea's usual space rockets, which were launched from static pads at the Sohae Satellite Launching Ground, the recent missiles were fired from near Sunan, where Pyongyang's international airport is located, suggesting the missiles were fired from a TEL. 
North Korea's space programme has always been controversial because of its ties to military missile development.
""North Korea used early rockets like the Taepodong and Unha/Kwangmyongsong series to test their theories and later develop the ICBMs known as Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15,"" said Melissa Hanham, a researcher at Stanford University's Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC) in California. ""This is type of development is pretty standard for all countries with ICBMs.""
North Korea's last formal ICBM test was the Hwasong-15, which reached an altitude of around 4,475 km (2,780 miles) and travelled 950 km (590 miles) during a single launch in Nov. 2017, giving it an estimate range to strike anywhere in the continental United States.
In contrast, the latest test that reportedly involved the new Hwasong-17 system reached a height of 550 km (340 miles) and flew 300 km (190 miles), according to South Korea.

Analysts said the tests may have only used only one stage of the liquid-fuelled Hwasong-17. 
Any use of ballistic missile technology by North Korea, even in a space launch vehicle, is fully banned by United Nations Security Council resolutions, a senior U.S. official told reporters in Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) -In Barrio Yungay, an edgy central Santiago neighborhood, an artist-owned sourdough bakery rubs shoulders with the Chilean city's oldest barbershop and a mini-market with a flickering back light that sells vegetables, dairy products and snacks.
Now the district will be home to a president too, in a powerful sign of changing times in the Andean nation, where anger has risen in recent years over stark inequality and an entrenched ruling elite.
Gabriel Boric, a 36-year former student protest leader and lawmaker, will be sworn in as Chile's youngest ever president on Friday, having pledged to rip up the country's conservative, market-orientated rule book and push progressive social reform.
Unlike his predecessors, Boric has opted to live in downtown Santiago rather than the capital's wealthy eastern zone of sprawling homes far from the dense city center and flanked by the Andes. Chile has no official presidential residence.
""It's good and notable that the president is coming to live in real Chile,"" said Beatrice di Girolamo, who runs the bakery, half a block east from new barricades for presidential security.
""There are all kinds of people here. Homeless people, people who are well off. There are ordinary people, elegant people. There's a lot of immigration.""
Boric, the head of a broad leftist coalition who came from outside the mainstream political parties, rattled the establishment with fiery rhetoric last year about tearing up Chile's market-orientated model, though has moderated his tone since winning a December election, talking up gradual change.
However, he has looked to set store as a progressive, with a majority female Cabinet for the first time in Chile's history, strong support for LGBTQ groups and a focus on fighting climate change.
Boric's team declined to comment on his choice of new home, but the message is clear: making a break from past political leaders many say had become disconnected from the people. 
LESS GARBAGE, MORE SECURITY 
Amid Santiago's high rises, Yungay stands out with colorful one- and two-story buildings and a medley of elaborate murals. Perfectly preserved buildings stand next to others with crumbling facades.
The area also hints at some of the challenges facing Boric, who will need to keep Chile's economy humming even as he looks to bolster environmental regulation of mining, bring down inflation, raise taxes for social spending and tackle fears about crime and immigration, key voter concerns.
Once an aristocratic neighborhood, the area is now home to a working-class community and a melting pot for immigrants from Peru, Venezuela and Colombia.
Carlos Noriega, 45, owner of the Donde Carlitos mini-market on Boric's new street, said in the last three years local crime has picked up. He said his store was robbed at gunpoint in 2020, a year after violent months-long protests broke out against inequality that many blamed on a constitution dating to the Augusto Pinochet-era dictatorship.
Noriega and others said the area's new neighbor had already brought benefits: less garbage on the street, more security and graffiti being painted over. Boric has passed by his store, he said, but he's still waiting for him to become a customer. 
Others said Boric would have to get used to the neighborhood's rough edges.
Security teams have blocked off Boric’s busy street with gates and check every car entering, from government vehicles to beaten-up old Volkswagens driven by locals. 
Eliza Pacheco, who lives in front of the president's new building with her husband and 12-year-old daughter, said she felt safer now, though worried about street protests on her doorstep.
""He has to assume the consequences of anything that happens. That's his responsibility,"" Pacheco said. ""He has to adapt to us, we don’t have to adapt to him."" 

Store owner Noriega said outgoing President Sebastian Pinera and others who came before lived on ""another planet.""
""He doesn't live in reality with the rest of us,"" said Noriega, who has owned his shop for the last 12 years after arriving from Peru soon after Chile's return to democracy in 1990.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The first licenses to open the newly legalized marijuana retail outlets coming to New York later this year will be reserved for people with prior marijuana-related convictions, New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced on Thursday.
The policy, approved by the state's Cannabis Control Board earlier in the day, is intended to give people punished during prohibition the first chance to benefit from legalization of the drug, ahead of the U.S. corporations planning to capitalize on a valuable new retail market.
In voting to legalize marijuana in March 2021, some lawmakers in the Democrat-controlled state legislature noted that laws banning the possession and sale of marijuana had disproportionately targeted Black and Latino users, even though white New Yorkers used marijuana at similar rates.
Hochul, a Democrat, said in a statement the policy was ""righting the wrongs of the past.""
""The regulations advanced by the Cannabis Control Board today will prioritize local farmers and entrepreneurs, creating jobs and opportunity for communities that have been left out and left behind,"" her statement said.
New York is the largest U.S. state after California to legalize marijuana for adults over 21 years old. Sixteen other states have legalized recreational marijuana, all in defiance of federal law, which still prohibits marijuana use.
The state's first 100 to 200 marijuana retail licenses will be reserved for ""social equity"" applicants, namely New York residents with marijuana-related convictions, or their immediate family, who can show they have experience running a business. The licenses will allow them to sell marijuana products from New York farmers in stores slated to open by the end of the year.
Nearly a million people were arrested in New York over the last 20 years for marijuana offences, Chris Alexander, the cannabis board's executive director, said at a news conference. Almost 90 percent of those arrests were for lower-level offenses.
""That's the individual getting arrested for a single joint or a small baggie,"" he said.
Even beyond time in jail and prison, advocates who pushed for legalization said that prohibition harmed New Yorkers in many other ways. 
""Cannabis prohibition really focused on criminalizing certain groups of people,"" said Kassandra Frederique, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, a national group that advocates for loosening drug laws. ""It was always a racialized policy.""
Convictions made New Yorkers ineligible for federal student loans and made it more difficult to find a job or open a business, Frederique said. Some New Yorkers were evicted from their homes, some parents lost custody of their children, and some immigrant New Yorkers were deported as a result of marijuana convictions.

The policy still faces a public comment period, but state officials believe the first licenses will be issued by the fall. The cannabis board also approved licenses for New York farmers to become the first suppliers of the new outlets.
Hochul has also asked lawmakers to approve a $200 million budget to lease and renovate New York storefronts that can be operated as marijuana outlets by the ""social equity"" licensees.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ukraine's stiff resistance against the invasion by Russian forces could be a model for Taiwan to defend itself should China choose to violate the island's ""sovereignty"" by attacking, a senior U.S. defense official told a Senate hearing on Thursday. 
The United States, like most countries, does not have formal ties with Taiwan but is its main arms supplier, and has long urged it to buy cost effective and mobile defense systems – so-called ""asymmetric"" weapons – to counter China's more powerful military.
""I think the situation we're seeing in Ukraine right now is a very worthwhile case study for them about why Taiwan needs to do all it can to build asymmetric capabilities, to get its population ready, so that it can be as prickly as possible should China choose to violate its sovereignty,"" Mara Karlin, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans and Capabilities, said.
Under the United States' ""one China"" policy, Washington only acknowledges China's stance that the island belongs to it, but takes no position on Taiwan's sovereignty.
China bristles at any reference to democratically self-governed Taiwan as independent, and Beijing's ambassador to Washington warned in January that U.S. encouragement of independence could trigger a military conflict between the two superpowers.
China's embassy in Washington did not respond immediately to a request for comment on Karlin's remark to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Jessica Lewis, Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs, told senators that the United States continues to urge Taiwan to procure asymmetric systems, which had been ""used to great effect in Ukraine."" 
Taiwan needs to prioritize short-range air defense, naval sea mines and coastal defense and cruise missiles, Lewis said, adding that the United States and Taiwan were increasingly seeing eye-to-eye on what qualified as an asymmetric system. 
""We're working with them on that today. I think we have a much deeper understanding of that right now,"" Lewis said.

Lewis said Taiwan also needed to take a cue on reserve force reforms from Ukraine, which has volunteer territorial defense units and around 900,000 reservists, and that its population ""has to be ready to fight.""
""Obviously we don't want there to be a conflict in Taiwan,"" Lewis said. Taiwan has just created ""an all-out defense mobilization organization"" and is working with the U.S. National Guard in the development stage, Lewis said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russian forces are operating with ""reckless disregard"" for civilians as they face stronger-than-expected resistance in Ukraine, and American intelligence agencies are tracking their actions to hold them to account, U.S. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said on Thursday.
""The Russian military has begun to loosen its rules of engagement to achieve their military objectives,"" Haines told the Senate Intelligence Committee's annual hearing on worldwide threats to U.S. security.
Haines, a Cabinet-level official who heads the U.S. intelligence agencies, said intelligence officers were documenting Russia's actions in order to hold to account both the government in Moscow and individuals responsible for assaults on civilians.
""Russian forces are, at the very least, operating with reckless disregard for the safety of civilians as Russian units launch artillery and airstrikes into urban areas - as they have done in cities across Ukraine,"" said Haines, the main intelligence adviser to President Joe Biden. 
U.S. officials, including Vice President Kamala Harris, have offered support to calls for an international war crimes investigation into Russia's invasion. 
They cite examples including the bombing of a maternity hospital in the southern city of Mariupol. Russia shifted its stance over the hospital bombing, with a mix of statements on Thursday that veered between aggressive denials and a call by the Kremlin to establish clear facts.
Lieutenant General Scott Berrier, director of the U.S. military's Defense Intelligence Agency, said Russia was using missiles, artillery, multiple rocket launchers and some precision-guided weapons in strikes on Ukrainian hospitals and apartment blocks.
Russia has denied targeting civilians. It calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbor's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. Ukraine and its allies say that is a baseless pretext to invade a country of 44 million people.
UKRAINIAN RESISTANCE
Three weeks into the conflict, Haines and the other intelligence leaders said Russia was surprised by the strength of Ukrainian resistance. Haines said the resistance deprived Russia of a quick victory it thought would have prevented the United States and NATO from providing meaningful military aid.
Republican senators asked repeated questions about the rejection by Democrat Biden's administration of accept Poland's offer of its Russian-made MiG fighter jets for eventual transfer to Ukraine.
Berrier said providing combat aircraft would move the United States further up ""the escalation ladder"" than sending equipment like anti-tank and air defense systems.
The intelligence chiefs also said they thought China, which has refused to condemn Russia or call the attack an invasion, was ""unsettled"" by events in Ukraine.
""I do believe that the Chinese leadership, President Xi (Jinping) in particular, is unsettled,"" Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns said. ""By what he's seen, partly because his own intelligence doesn't appear to have told him what was going to happen.""
The hearing featured unusually blunt admissions that initial U.S. assessments about Ukraine’s ability were off.

While U.S. spy agencies assessed before the invasion that Russian President Vladimir Putin was under-estimating the Ukrainians’ “likely resistance,” they did not do as well predicting the military challenges that Russia would face, Haines said.
Berrier said he initially believed the Ukrainians ""were not as ready as I thought they should be. Therefore, I questioned their will to fight. That was a bad assessment on my part because they have fought bravely and honorably.""

BOSTON (Reuters) - A former University of Southern California water polo coach accepted bribes to help secure spots for wealthy parents' children as fake athletic recruits at the school , a prosecutor said on Thursday at the start of the second trial in the U.S. college admissions scandal.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Ian Stearns told a federal jury in Boston that Jovan Vavic for years misled USC admissions officials into believing that unqualified high school students belonged on his championship water polo team, regardless of their abilities.
Vavic, who was fired in 2019, was among dozens of parents and coaches charged during an investigation dubbed ""Operation Varsity Blues"" into a vast scheme in which executives and celebrities illicitly secured spots for their children at prestigious universities.
""They would never play for his team,"" Stearns said in his opening statement. ""It was a lie. And the only reason he was recruiting them was in exchange for the money.""
He said that money came from William ""Rick"" Singer, a ""corrupt"" college admissions consultant who made payments to a USC account that funded Vavic's team and paid nearly $120,000 to cover his own children's private school tuition.
But Stephen Larson, Vavic's lawyer, argued Singer was a ""con man"" who kept the coach in the dark about the scheme. Vavic, 60, never sought bribes but instead was trying to recruit legitimate water polo players whose families could donate to USC, he said.
""While the college admissions scandal was real, Jovan Vavic was not part of it,"" Larson said.
Singer, the mastermind of the operation, pleaded guilty in 2019 to facilitating the admission of students through cheating on college entrance exams and by bribing coaches at USC, a central focus of the scheme, and schools like Stanford and Yale to help them gain entrance as phony athletic recruits. 

Overall, 51 of the 57 defendants have pleaded guilty, including the actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman, among Singer's many wealthy clients.
Stearns said the students Vavic recruited included the son of private equity financier John Wilson, who was sentenced to 15 months in prison after being convicted in October with another parent in the first trial to stem from the scandal. He plans to appeal.

Erdogan also told Biden in a phone call that Turkey's facilitator role in trying to find a solution to the conflict was important, according to a statement from his office.
NATO member Turkey, which shares a maritime border with Russia and Ukraine in the Black Sea, has good relations with both countries. It has called Russia's invasion unacceptable although it opposes sanctions against Moscow.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba met in Turkey's southern Antalya province on Thursday under Ankara's auspices.
But the highest-level contact between the two sides since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine made no apparent progress towards a ceasefire.
It also did not reach a solution for a humanitarian corridor from the southern Ukrainian port of Mariupol.

In the call with Biden, Erdogan said arranging the meeting between Lavrov and Kuleba was in itself a diplomatic victory.
Both Kuleba and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, who hosted the talks, said it was not an easy meeting.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former Canadian government official has been extradited to the United States to face criminal charges alleging he deployed ransomware known as ""NetWalker"" to target companies, municipalities, hospitals and law enforcement during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The U.S. Justice Department said that Sebastien Vachon-Desjardins, 34, of Gatineau, Quebec, was extradited on Wednesday after he was indicted by a federal grand jury in Florida.
Prosecutors said Vachon-Desjardins is accused of launching a series of ransomware attacks between April and December 2020.
During a search of his home in January 2021, investigators found and seized 719 bitcoin, which is valued to be worth more than $28 million.
Vachon-Desjardins already faced parallel criminal charges in Canada earlier this year, including mischief in relation to computer data, extortion, unauthorized use of a computer and participating in a criminal organization, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
He pleaded guilty to three of those four charges on January 31, 2022. He was sentenced to seven years in prison.
According to a LinkedIn profile for a Sebastien Vachon that appears to match his description, he previously worked as an IT consultant for Public Works and Government Services in Canada.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lev Parnas, convicted in October on campaign finance charges, will plead guilty to a conspiracy count concerning his work at a fraud insurance company that former ally Rudy Giuliani also worked for.
Ukraine-born Parnas on Thursday asked U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken in Manhattan to schedule a change-of-plea hearing, after pleading not guilty in November 2020 to wire fraud conspiracy.
Prosecutors accused Parnas and co-defendant David Correia of conning people into investing more than $2 million in their Florida start-up Fraud Guarantee, but withdrawing much of it for personal use including political donations.
Giuliani, a onetime lawyer for former U.S. President Donald Trump, has said he was paid $500,000 to work for Fraud Guarantee.
Parnas was convicted last Oct. 22 after being accused of using money tied to Russian businessman Andrey Muraviev to gain favor of candidates in the 2018 U.S. midterm elections, with an eye toward building a legal cannabis business.
Oetken on Monday denied requests by Parnas and co-defendant Andrey Kukushkin to set aside their convictions.
The conspiracy charge had been severed from that case. Any sentence would cover Parnas' conviction and guilty plea.
""Mr. Parnas believes the time is right for him now to accept responsibility"" for the conspiracy charge, his lawyer Joseph Bondy said in a statement.
No sentencing date has been set.
The office of U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in Manhattan declined to comment.
Bob Costello, a lawyer for Giuliani, also declined to comment. Giuliani has denied wrongdoing.
Before breaking with Giuliani, Parnas traveled to Ukraine to seek damaging information about Democrat Joe Biden, who later became president, and his son Hunter.
Igor Fruman, Parnas' Belarus-born former business partner, was sentenced on Jan. 21 to one year and one day in prison after pleading guilty to a campaign finance violation.

Correia received the same sentence from Oetken in February 2021 after pleading guilty to the same conspiracy charge as Parnas.
Oetken said Fraud Guarantee had ""real victims"" and ""the irony of the business' name, Fraud Guarantee, is hard to ignore.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party won India's most populous state with a big majority, according to the count on Thursday of a state assembly vote that could offer clues to the national mood before a 2024 general election.
The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had won or was leading in 255 of the 403 seats in Uttar Pradesh, which it currently rules, according to the Election Commission of India.
Final results were expected to be out in a few hours but were unlikely to change much. Party workers in the state staged impromptu rallies to celebrate and smeared each other in the BJP's saffron colours.
Modi said that some political experts had said the results of polls in five states in 2017 decided the results of the general election in 2019, which the BJP won with a sweeping majority.
""I believe this time also they will say that the results of 2022 have decided the results of 2024,"" he said.
Uttar Pradesh is home to about a fifth of India's 1.35 billion people and sends the most legislators to parliament of any state.
The victory in the northern state has come despite the state and federal government's much-criticised handling of COVID-19, lack of jobs and anger over farm reforms that Modi cancelled last year after protests.
""The people of the state have rejected the opposition that was building a castle in the air,"" party spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia.
The BJP has long predicted it would retain the state because of policies such as free staples for the poor during the pandemic, a crackdown on crime, and its popularity among the Hindu majority reinforced by the construction of a temple on the site of a razed mosque.
KEY TO MAJORITY
In elections in four smaller states over the past month, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which governs the national capital territory of Delhi, won a landslide victory in Punjab. The BJP retained control of Uttarakhand, and looked set to form governments in Goa and Manipur.
The AAP, whose name means ""common man"" in Hindi, emerged in 2012 out of an anti-corruption movement. Party leaders said they were ready to take on Modi nationally.
It has long been assumed in Indian politics that without winning Uttar Pradesh and the neighbouring state of Bihar, no party or coalition has much hope of securing a majority in parliament. The BJP has been in power in both.
For decades, Uttar Pradesh was a stronghold of the main opposition Congress party, but it has been unable to stem a slide in its popularity over recent years.
""Humbly accept the people's verdict,"" senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, the scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty who has overseen the party's decline, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).

""We will learn from this and keep working for the interests of the people of India.""
The win in Uttar Pradesh is a seal of approval for Hindu monk Yogi Adityanath, who was surprisingly chosen as chief minister for the state five year ago and is seen as a future prime ministerial candidate for the BJP.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Requests by federal prisoners for compassionate release soared following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, but approvals were granted far less often in conservative-leaning multistate U.S. judicial regions than in more liberal-leaning ones, an analysis released on Thursday showed.
The report by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, an independent agency of the federal judiciary, examined how the legal landscape for compassionate release changed in 2020, as COVID-19 swept through the prison system, sickening thousands of inmates.
The World Health Organization in March 2020 declared that COVID-19 had caused a pandemic. The report found that between that month and the following month, there was a 900% increase in the number of federal inmates who applied for compassionate release - allowed when a prisoner demonstrates ""extraordinary and compelling reasons"" for a sentence reduction.
Federal prisoners are eligible if they meet certain criteria such as terminal illness or advanced age.
The report looked at compassionate release requests and approvals during the 2020 fiscal year, running from Oct. 1, 2019, to Sept. 30, 2020, finding an overall grant rate of nearly 26%. But there were stark regional differences, as seen in approval rates registered in the various multistate federal court regions around the country.
For instance, federal courts in the liberal-leaning 1st Circuit, which includes Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Puerto Rico and Rhode Island, had a grant rate of 47.5%. Federal courts in the conservative-leaning 5th Circuit, which includes Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana, had a grant rate of 13.7%. 
After criminal justice reform advocates complained that the federal Bureau of Prisons rarely granted compassionate release requests, Congress in 2018 passed legislation allowing inmates to appeal directly to federal courts for release.
The Sentencing Commission is responsible for defining what constitutes ""extraordinary and compelling."" But shortly after it laid out its compassionate release policy, the agency lost its quorum - the minimum number of members required to conduct business or take a vote - in 2019 and has been unable to update it since.
""This report underscores why it is crucial for the commission to regain a quorum to again have the ability to address important policy issues in the criminal justice system, such as compassionate release,"" acting Chair Judge Charles Breyer, the seven-member commission's sole remaining member, said in a statement.
Federal prosecutors can also play a role in whether inmates can win compassionate release in court.
In an interview with NPR that aired on Thursday, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced he will be issuing a new policy, after an NPR report found that some prosecutors are forcing offenders who plead guilty to waive their rights to file for compassionate release down the road.

""That sounded wrong, and we, immediately after I read your piece, started investigating that,"" Garland told NPR.
""Very soon we will be issuing new policies to prevent those kind of across-the-board requirements that defendants waive their rights to seek compassionate release,"" he added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday denied renewed Russian accusations that Washington was operating biowarfare labs in Ukraine, calling the claims ""laughable"" and suggesting Moscow may be laying the groundwork to use a chemical or biological weapon.
Late on Tuesday, Russia repeated its accusation of several years that the United States is working with Ukrainian laboratories to develop biological weapons. Such assertions in Russian media increased in the run-up to Moscow's military move into Ukraine and were made as recently as Wednesday by foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova.
""The Russian accusations are absurd, they are laughable and you know, in the words of my Irish Catholic grandfather, a bunch of malarkey. There's nothing to it. It's classic Russian propaganda,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said on Wednesday.
In a statement, also released on Wednesday, State Department spokesman Ned Price said Russia ""is inventing false pretexts in an attempt to justify its own horrific actions in Ukraine.""
White House press secretary Jen Psaki, citing what she called Russia's ""false claims,"" wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR): ""It's Russia that has a long and well-documented track record of using chemical weapons, including in attempted assassinations and poisoning of Putin's political enemies like Alexey Navalny."" 
There was no immediate response from the Russian embassy in Washington to the U.S. assertions on Wednesday. Russia has denied carrying out an attack on Navalny. 
On Wednesday, Zakharova said Russia had documents showing the Ukrainian health ministry had ordered the destruction of samples of plague, cholera, anthrax and other pathogens before Feb. 24, when Russian forces moved into Ukraine.
Zakharova said the documents unearthed by Russian forces in Ukraine showed ""an emergency attempt to erase evidence of military biological programmes"" financed by the Pentagon. She provided no further details on the documents.
Reuters was unable to independently confirm her information.
A Ukrainian presidential spokesperson said: ""Ukraine strictly denies any such allegation.""

Like many other countries, Ukraine has public health laboratories researching how to mitigate the threats of dangerous diseases affecting both animals and humans. Its laboratories have received support from the United States, European Union and World Health Organization.
The Pentagon's Biological Threat Reduction Program has been working with the Ukrainian government to ensure the security of pathogens and toxins stored in the laboratories. In the midst of similar biowarfare accusations in 2020, the U.S. embassy in Kyiv issued a statement saying its involvement was to ensure ""dangerous pathogens do not fall into the wrong hands.""
A former U.S. official, who is familiar with the cooperation between Kyiv and Washington, said the United States had helped to convert several Ukrainian laboratories that had been involved in the former Soviet Union's biological weapons program into public health facilities.",,,,,

ANTALYA, Turkey (Reuters) - Talks between Russia and Ukraine's foreign ministers on Thursday made no apparent progress towards a ceasefire in the two-week-old conflict or on a humanitarian corridor from the southern Ukrainian port of Mariupol.
Ukraine's Dmytro Kuleba said after the talks that he had sought a 24-hour ceasefire across the whole combat zone as well as the opening of a Mariupol corridor, but that his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov did not commit to either.
Lavrov said he reminded Kuleba that Moscow had presented proposals to Kyiv, and that Russia wanted to see what he called a friendly, demilitarised Ukraine. 
The meeting, in the southern Turkish resort of Antalya was the highest-level contact between the two sides since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. It lasted just under an hour and a half.
Both Kuleba and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, who hosted the talks, said it was not an easy meeting.
""I made a simple proposal to Minister Lavrov: I can call my Ukrainian ministers, authorities, president now and give you 100% assurances on security guarantees for humanitarian corridors,"" Kuleba told a news conference.
""I asked him 'Can you do the same?' and he did not respond.""
At a separate news conference Lavrov said there had been no discussion of a ceasefire, and that the talks in Turkey could not be an alternative to the ""real, main diplomatic track"", referring to lower-level meetings in Belarus, an ally of Moscow.
""I am not surprised that Mr Kuleba said that it was not possible to agree about a ceasefire. Here, no one was intending to agree a ceasefire,"" he said.
HOSPITAL BOMBING
Responding to Kyiv's condemnation of Wednesday's bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol, Lavrov said the building was no longer used as a hospital and had been occupied by Ukrainian forces, though the Kremlin separately said the incident was being investigated.
""Three days ago at the U.N. Security Council meeting our delegation presented facts that this maternity hospital had long been seized by the Azov battalion and other radicals,"" he said. 
Russia's invasion has uprooted more than 2 million people in what the United Nations calls the fastest-developing humanitarian crisis in Europe since World War Two.
Moscow has said that all of its demands - including that Kyiv takes a neutral position and drops aspirations of joining the NATO alliance - must be met to end its assault. 
Moscow calls its incursion a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine and dislodge leaders it calls ""neo-Nazis."" Kyiv and its Western allies dismiss that as baseless pretext for an unprovoked war against a democratic country of 44 million people.
Lavrov said he did not believe the conflict would spiral into a nuclear war but he cautioned the United States and Europe that Moscow never again wanted to be reliant on the West.

""We will do everything to ensure that we never again depend on the West in those areas of our life which have a significant meaning for our people,"" he said.
Turkey, which hosted Thursday's meeting, shares a maritime border with Russia and Ukraine in the Black Sea and has good ties with both. It has called Russia's invasion unacceptable and appealed for a ceasefire but has opposed sanctions on Moscow.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An upstart political party that rules India's capital has swept an election in Punjab state, a Thursday vote-count showed, bolstering its hopes of becoming the main challenger to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), led by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, was leading in 91 out of 117 seats in the northern state and looked set to beat the state's incumbent Congress party, the BJP and a regional party by a wide margin, according to Election Commission data.
""Now there will be a national alternative to the BJP and Congress,"" the party's spokesman, Saurabh Bharadwaj, told Reuters.
The party - its name in Hindi means ""common man"" - emerged in 2012 out of an anti-corruption movement and soon went on to win power in the capital, home to 20 million people.
Its appeal stems from Kejriwal's reputation as a incorruptible leader with a track record of delivering public services, analysts say.
""He's got a super clean image and he is seen as having done a very good job in Delhi,"" Neelanjan Sircar, a senior fellow at the Centre for Policy Research think-tank, said of the 53-year-old former bureaucrat.
Modi and his party are looking strong in the run-up to India's next general election, due by 2024. The BJP has deep pockets, formidable electoral machinery and its Hindu nationalist agenda is a proven vote-winner.
Opposition to Modi has failed to coalesce around the Congress party, which ruled India for decades but has been unable to stem a slide in its popularity over recent years.
That raises the possibility that the AAP could grow and breathe new life into an anti-Modi bloc, said Sircar.
""Over time, it's hard not to see Kejriwal and Aam Aadmi Party emerge as a serious opposition,"" he said.
'DELHI MODEL'
The AAP would now focus on building support in the northern states of Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, and the western state of Gujarat, Modi's home state, to show voters the BJP was not their only choice, said Bharadwaj.
""In national politics, the BJP survives on the fact that there is no national alternative - the only alternative that is suggested is Congress, which is a weak alternative,"" he said.
Aman Arora, a lawmaker in Punjab who was inspired by Kejriwal to join the party in 2016, said voters in the breadbasket state of more than 27 million people had been won over by the AAP's performance in Delhi and the party had to build on that.
""Our biggest strength and driving force is the governance model of the last five years in Delhi,"" said Arora, pointing especially to improvements in education and health that the AAP has show-cased as the ""Delhi model"".
Bharadwaj acknowledged that taking on the BJP was a big challenge but he said he had faith his party could use Punjab to show the rest of India just what it could do.

""We cannot compete with the BJP in terms of resources,"" he said.
""But when we start performing in Punjab, there will be many reasons for people to vote for the Aam Aadmi Party.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea will launch a number of reconnaissance satellites in coming years to provide real-time information on military actions by the United States and its allies, state media on Thursday reported leader Kim Jong Un as saying.
While inspecting North Korea's National Aerospace Development Administration, Kim said ""a lot"" of military reconnaissance satellites would be put into sun-synchronous polar orbit in the period of a five-year plan announced last year, state news agency KCNA reported.
""He noted that the purpose of developing and operating the military reconnaissance satellite is to provide the armed forces of the DPRK with real-time information on military actions against it by the aggression troops of the U.S. imperialism and its vassal forces in south Korea, Japan and the Pacific,"" the news agency said.
North Korea appears to be preparing to launch a reconnaissance satellite, which could prove as controversial as the nuclear-armed country's weapons tests because they use the same banned ballistic missile technology, experts say.
North Korea says it conducted two tests of satellite systems on Feb. 27 and March 5. Authorities in South Korea, Japan, and the United States says the tests involved launches of ballistic missiles.
The launches drew international condemnation and the U.S. military said on Thursday it had increased surveillance and reconnaissance collection in the Yellow Sea. 
The United States also said it had heightened its ballistic missile defence readiness after a ""significant increase"" in North Korean missile tests.
Kim defended the satellite work as not only about gathering information but protecting North Korea's sovereignty and national interests, exercising its legitimate rights to self-defence, and elevating national prestige, KCNA reported.
""He stressed that this urgent project for perfecting the country's war preparedness capacity by improving our state's war deterrent is the supreme revolutionary task, a political and military priority task to which our Party and government attach the most importance,"" KCNA said.
The United States and its allies have condemned previous North Korean space launches as violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions that have imposed sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear and missile programmes. 
'MILITARY SIGNIFICANCE'
North Korea has not tested a nuclear weapon or its long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) since 2017, but has suggested in could resume such tests because talks with the United States are stalled.
Its latest flurry of missile launches could be groundwork for a return to ICBM and nuclear bomb tests this year, the U.S. Directorate of National Intelligence (DNI) said in its annual Worldwide Threat Assessment released this week.
A satellite launched into orbit would be the first since 2016.
Recent sub-orbital launches, which likely used road-mobile medium-range ballistic missiles, appeared designed to ""pop the key components of an imagery reconnaissance satellite up to operational altitudes for a few minutes of testing"", 38 North, a U.S.-based monitoring group, said in a report.
Such components, including satellite stabilisation, the imaging payload, and data transmission may have failed in previous tests and therefore required additional testing, the group said.
""It remains to be seen how capable any North Korean imagery satellite would be, the frequency of launches, or how many such satellites might be maintained in orbit at any one time—all key indicators of the actual military significance of such satellites,"" 38 North said.
Regardless, North Korea clearly sees this capability as having propaganda value and showcasing its technological prowess and effective leadership, it added.

A launch could make technical contributions to North Korea’s ICBM capability, depending on what type of rocket booster is used, 38 North said.
""It may also be the precursor to other more provocative developments mentioned by Kim, such as the testing of multiple-warhead missiles, solid-propellant ICBMs, and ICBM-range solid-propellant submarine-launched ballistic missiles,"" it said.

SEOUL (Reuters) -Conservative South Korean opposition candidate Yoon Suk-yeol rode to victory in a tight presidential election on a wave of discontent over economic policy, scandals and gender wars, reshaping the political future of Asia's fourth-largest economy.
His victory in Wednesday's bitterly fought election marks a stunning turnaround for the main conservative bloc, now known as the People Power Party, which has regrouped since the 2017 snap election after the impeachment and ouster of then President Park Geun-hye.
Yoon is a former prosecutor-general involved with Park's case who fell out with outgoing President Moon Jae-in after being appointed by him, gaining notoriety for his investigations of top presidential aides.
""The people put me here with hope in my conviction that I have not yielded to any power for fairness and justice for 26 years,"" Yoon said in a speech of his career as a prosecutor.
Yoon has pledged to stamp out graft, foster justice and create a more level economic playing field, while seeking a ""reset"" with China and a tougher stance towards reclusive North Korea, which has launched a record number of missile tests in recent months.
He faces the challenge of uniting a country of 52 million riven by gender and generational divisions, growing inequality and surging home prices.
""Real estate prices, housing policy, jobs, and tax policies will top his domestic agenda,"" said Duyeon Kim, a Seoul-based expert with the Center for a New American Security.
Yoon will need to restore public trust in Korea’s institutions and is likely to conduct major ""housecleaning"" by following through on a campaign pledge to investigate Moon's administration for corruption, she added.
Official results showed Yoon, 61, edged out the ruling centre-left Democratic Party's Lee Jae-myung to replace Moon, whose single five-year term ends in May. 
Yoon's lack of elected political experience was seen as both a liability and an asset.
While his campaign was marked by gaffes and controversy, the race became a referendum on Moon's economic policies from jobs to housing to wealth inequality.
The benchmark KOSPI rose more than 2%, its sharpest daily rise in at least three months, with Yoon expected to speed deregulation in South Korea's capital markets.
The election was one of the closest in recent history and came after an unusually bitter campaign marred by scandals and smears. Both candidates' disapproval ratings matched their popularity as scandals, mud-slinging and gaffes dominated what was dubbed the ""unlikeable election"".
CONFRONTING CRISIS
Lee's loss casts doubt on Moon's legacy, including his signature efforts to engage with North Korea, which have largely been stalled since talks fell apart in 2019.
The new president will likely face an almost immediate crisis with Pyongyang, which appears to be preparing to launch a spy satellite and has suggested it could resume testing of long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles or nuclear weapons for the first time since 2017.
Yoon has vowed to forge even closer ties with the United States - South Korea's only treaty ally - in the face of increased missile activity by North Korea and competition with China, which is the South's largest trading partner.
The White House congratulated Yoon, saying President Joe Biden looked forward to working closely with him to bolster the alliance.
Yoon and Biden spoke by telephone on Thursday, the White House later added.
""We can expect the alliance to run more smoothly and be in sync for the most part on North Korea, China, and regional and global issues,"" said Kim from the Center for a New American Security.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida welcomed Yoon's win, and said he hoped to work closely with him to rebuild healthier ties with its neighbour amid tensions over historic and economic disputes dating to Japan's 1910-1945 occupation of Korea.
More than 77% of South Korea's 44 million eligible voters cast ballots to pick their next leader, despite an record surge in new COVID-19 cases this week.
Yoon said he would work with opposition parties to heal polarised politics and foster unity.
""Our competition is over for now,"" he said in an acceptance speech, thanking and consoling Lee and other rivals. ""We have to join hands and unite into one for the people and the country."" 
At a separate ceremony with supporters, Yoon said he would put top priority on ""national unity,"" adding all people should be treated equally regardless of their regional, political and socioeconomic differences.

Lee conceded defeat and congratulated his opponent. The Democrat leadership, including the party chairman, resigned on Thursday taking responsibility for the result. 
""I did my best, but failed to live up to your expectations,"" Lee told a news conference, blaming his ""shortcomings"".

Relentless rains since late last month burst river banks across Australia's southeast, submerging homes, farms and bridges, and cutting off entire towns. Twenty-one people have been killed so far. 
""We know it has been a devastating time up here, probably moving through the initial shock for many people and the trauma that is associated with that,"" New South Wales state Premier Dominic Perrottet said from the worst-hit Northern Rivers area. 
""Many people are now coming back to their homes in very difficult conditions, many are not habitable,"" Perrottet said as he unveiled a A$551 million ($403 million) aid package for flood-hit residents providing up to 16 weeks of rental support.
More than 1,200 people remained in emergency accommodation in the Northern Rivers region while around 3,000 homes were deemed uninhabitable, authorities said.
Rescue teams, including defence force personnel, took advantage of eased conditions to clear debris and deliver essential supplies but anger swelled among many residents, with no access to power and internet for several days. 
Amid criticism over slow relief, Prime Minister Scott Morrison, behind in polls in an election year, on Wednesday declared the floods a national emergency and designated catastrophe zones in flood-stricken towns. 
A Climate Council of Australia report published on Thursday described the recent flood events as one of the most extreme disasters in Australian history and said the devastation was ""wide ranging"". Total damages have been estimated at A$1.77 billion ($1.30 billion), the Insurance Council of Australia said. 
Meanwhile, skies cleared in Sydney after nearly two weeks but major flooding continued in the city's western suburbs of North Richmond and Windsor as water continued to flow from overloaded dams and rivers. Floodwaters could continue at the current levels over the next 24 hours, emergency services said.

Ukrainian forces including citizen-soldiers who only last month never dreamed of firing a weapon in anger were holding out in Kyiv and other frontlines, while Russian troops, tanks and artillery made slow progress from the north, south and east.
Moscow's stated objectives of crushing the Ukrainian military and ousting the pro-Western elected government of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy remained out of reach, with Zelenskiy unshaken and lethal Western military aid pouring across the Polish and Romanian borders.
Western-led sanctions designed to cut the Russian economy and government from international financial markets were beginning to bite, with the Russian sharemarket and rouble plunging and ordinary Russians rushing to hoard cash.
Zelenskiy accused Russia of carrying out genocide after Ukrainian officials said Russian aircraft bombed a children's hospital on Wednesday, burying patients in rubble despite a ceasefire deal for people to flee the besieged city of Mariupol.
The attack, which authorities said injured women in labour and left children in the wreckage, underscored U.S. warnings that the biggest assault on a European state since 1945 could become increasingly attritional after Russia's early failures. 
The White House condemned the hospital bombing as a ""barbaric use of military force to go after innocent civilians"".
Russian had earlier pledged to halt firing so at least some trapped civilians could escape the port city, where hundreds of thousands have been sheltering without water or power for more than a week. Both sides blamed the other for the failure of the evacuation.
""What kind of country is this, the Russian Federation, which is afraid of hospitals, is afraid of maternity hospitals, and destroys them?"" Zelenskiy said in a televised address late on Wednesday.
Zelenskiy repeated his call for the West to tighten sanctions on Russia ""so that they sit down at the negotiating table and end this brutal war"". The bombing of the children's hospital, he said, was ""proof that a genocide of Ukrainians is taking place"".
The Donetsk region's governor said 17 people were wounded in the attack.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked by Reuters for comment, said: ""Russian forces do not fire on civilian targets."" Russia calls its incursion a ""special operation"" to disarm its neighbour and dislodge leaders it calls ""neo-Nazis.""
Ukraine's foreign ministry posted video footage of what it said was the hospital showing holes where windows should have been in a three-storey building. Huge piles of smouldering rubble littered the scene.
The U.N. Human Rights body said it was verifying the number of casualties at Mariupol. The incident ""adds to our deep concerns about indiscriminate use of weapons in populated areas,"" it added through a spokesperson. 
Among more than 2 million total refugees from Ukraine, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said on Wednesday that more than 1 million children have fled the country since the invasion started on Feb 24. At least 37 had been killed and 50 injured, it said.
The International Committee of the Red Cross said houses had been destroyed all across Ukraine. ""Hundreds of thousands of people have no food, no water, no heat, no electricity and no medical care,"" it said.
TALKS IN TURKEY
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is due to hold talks on Thursday with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba, the first meeting between the two since the invasion. 
Ukraine is seeking a ceasefire, liberation of its territories and to resolve all humanitarian issues, Kuleba said, adding: ""Frankly ... my expectations of the talks are low."" 
Moscow demands that Kyiv take a neutral position and drop aspirations of joining the NATO alliance. 
Zelenskiy told VICE in an interview on Wednesday that he was confident Putin would at some stage agree to talks. ""I think he will. I think he sees that we are strong. He will. We need some time,"" he said.
Russia has been hit by Western sanctions and the withdrawals of foreign firms. Nestle, cigarette maker Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) and  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) on Wednesday joined the list of multinationals stepping back from the country. 
The United States is weighing sanctions on nuclear power supplier Rosatom, a senior Biden administration official said on Wednesday.

The World Bank's chief economist said Moscow was edging close to defaulting on its debt. The Kremlin is taking measures to shore up the economy and planned to respond to a U.S. ban on its oil and energy exports as the rouble dropped to record lows. 
The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday voted to rush $13.6 billion in aid to Ukraine, sending the legislation to the Senate.

(Reuters) - Anti-abortion measures moving through Idaho and Kentucky's legislatures would severely restrict or essentially end access to abortion in those states, abortion rights advocates said on Wednesday.
In Idaho, a bill that would ban abortion after six weeks - before many women know they are pregnant - and allow relatives of the fetus to sue providers who perform abortions after that gestation period passed the Senate last week and will likely pass the House in coming days.
In Kentucky, the House has passed a bill that includes several abortion restrictions, including a requirement that fetal remains be cremated or interred, and a requirement that a combination birth-death or stillbirth certificate be issued for each abortion. 
The two states are among those with Republican-led legislatures across the country that are swiftly passing new abortion limits in anticipation that the U.S. Supreme Court will likely undercut constitutional abortion protections this year. 
Forty states have introduced more than 500 anti-abortion measures so far in 2022, according to the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights advocacy group. Missouri lawmakers are considering a recently introduced measure https://house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills221/amendpdf/4259H03.01H.pdf that would allow citizens to sue anyone who helps women get abortions beyond state borders. 
""This six-week ban, coupled with the restrictions that are already on the books in Idaho, would put abortion out of reach entirely for most Idahoans,"" Planned Parenthood's Idaho state director Mistie DelliCarpini-Tolman told reporters on Wednesday.
The Supreme Court has signaled its willingness to allow a 15-week abortion ban to stand in Mississippi, which would undermine the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that established the right to have an abortion before a fetus is viable, typically around 23 or 24 weeks. A decision in the Mississippi case is expected this spring.
Idaho's measure is similar to Texas' six-week ban, which allows the general public to sue anyone who helps women get abortions after six weeks. The number of abortions in Texas dropped by some 60% within the first month after the law took effect on Sept. 1, according to state health department data.
If the Idaho state House passes the bill, as expected, it will then go to Republican Governor Brad Little, who is anti-abortion. It would take effect 30 days after being signed by the governor.
Blaine Conzatti, president of the anti-abortion organization Idaho Family Policy Center, applauded the Senate's passage of the bill, saying in a statement that ""preborn babies deserve the same constitutional right to life"" as born people. 
The Kentucky bill will likely be heard in a Senate committee next week, and it is expected to pass the full Republican-led chamber.
If Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a Democrat, vetoes the bill, the Senate Republicans' supermajority could override the veto and make the law effective immediately.
Two provisions in the measure would hinder the state's abortion clinics from operating, Planned Parenthood's Kentucky state director Tamarra Wieder said on Wednesday. 
The first is a requirement that the state Board of Pharmacy certify providers who dispense abortion pills. That process could not feasibly happen as quickly as the law would take effect, Wieder said. 

The second is a requirement that fetal remains be cremated or interred, which would place ""unsustainable"" logistical and cost burdens on the clinics, she said. 
""We are most certainly looking at the final few weeks of abortion in Kentucky,"" Wieder said.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Parties trying to revive the Iran nuclear deal scrambled on Wednesday to resolve last-minute Russian demands that threaten to scupper negotiations, diplomats said, with the United States appearing unwilling to engage with Russia on the matter.
Western powers on Tuesday warned Russia against wrecking an almost completed deal on bringing the United States and Iran back into compliance with the 2015 accord. Iran's top negotiator returned to Vienna on Wednesday from consultations in Tehran.
Russia's envoy to the talks, Mikhail Ulyanov, dismissed any suggestion Moscow was holding up an agreement and said a final text had in any case not been completed.
Eleven months of talks to restore the deal, which lifted sanctions on Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear programme, have reached their final stages with several diplomats saying there was broad agreement.
But just as the final issues were being resolved, Russia presented a new obstacle by demanding written guarantees from the United States that Western sanctions targeting Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine would not affect its trade with Iran.
Ulyanov said Moscow's demands had not received a positive reaction. 
""In view of the new circumstances and wave of sanctions against Russia we have the right to protect our interests in the nuclear field and wider context,"" Ulyanov said.
He said the United States and the European Union had to make it clear that neither now or in the future sanctions could hit the implementation of nuclear projects in Iran as well as its trade and economic relations.
Ulyanov met the coordinator of the talks, Enrique Mora of the European Union, on Tuesday evening and again on Wednesday. 
He said he would still have to report back to Moscow for a final decision after the text was finalised.
""There is no final text so how can our position delay anything if final negotiations are not finished,"" he said. 
""A number of participants at this moment are not ready to confirm that the text is fully acceptable to them.""
U.S. NOT PLAYING
U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland on Tuesday accused Russia of seeking to reap extra benefits from its participation in the effort to restore the nuclear agreement, but she said Washington would not be playing ""Let's Make a Deal.""
Two Western diplomats said it was still not clear what the exact nature of Moscow's demands were, while a European diplomat said Russia was demanding sweeping guarantees on trade between Moscow and Tehran, demands that were deemed unacceptable.
They said the talks were now not likely to end this week. 
Mora broke off informal meetings on Monday saying the time had come for political decisions to be taken to end the negotiations.

European negotiators from France, Britain, and Germany had already temporarily left the talks as they believed they had gone as far as they could go and it was now up to the United States and Iran to agree on outstanding issues.
Iran's chief negotiator, Ali Bagheri Kani, returned to Tehran unexpectedly after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov outlined Moscow's new demands. Iran's foreign minister said at the time that Tehran would not let its interests be harmed by ""foreign elements"".

At least 37 children had been killed and 50 injured, Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement.
Russell said that she was ""horrified"" by the reported attack on a children's hospital in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, where officials said a Russian air strike buried patients under rubble despite an agreed ceasefire.
""This attack, if confirmed, underscores the horrific toll this war is exacting on Ukraine’s children and families,"" Russell said. 
The bombing, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called an ""atrocity,"" took place despite an agreed ceasefire to enable thousands of civilians trapped in the city to escape.
Mariupol city council said the hospital had been hit several times by an air strike, causing ""colossal"" destruction. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""Russian forces do not fire on civilian targets.""
More than 2 million people have fled Ukraine since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion on Feb. 24. Moscow calls its action a ""special military operation"" to disarm its neighbor and dislodge leaders it calls ""neo-Nazis.""

Most of those who fled are women and children, as able-bodied men have been ordered by the Kyiv government to stay home to fight.
The war has swiftly cast Russia into economic isolation as well as drawing almost universal international condemnation. The United States on Tuesday banned imports of Russian oil, while Western companies are rapidly pulling out of the Russian market.

PRZEMYSL, Poland/ISACCEA, Romania (Reuters) -Thousands more Ukrainian refugees fled to central and eastern Europe on Wednesday, many with no contacts and nowhere to go, as host countries scrambled to accommodate them.
The number of refugees has probably reached 2.1-2.2 million since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, the head of the U.N. Refugee Agency (UNHCR), Filippo Grandi, said.
Most are women and children, as able-bodied men have been ordered by the Kyiv government to stay home to fight. 
So far, most refugees have gone to relatives, friends or contacts in the Ukrainian diaspora rather than to reception centres being set up by authorities, Grandi said. 
""This is the best way for them to feel welcomed, to feel in a familiar environment and also have less burden on public services, frankly, which is very important for these countries,"" he said.
But this was likely to change as more refugees arrive and more will need to stay in reception centres, Grandi said.
""We need to be realistic and we need to plan for that.""
Some signs of that trend were appearing at Przemysl, a town near Poland's busiest border crossing that has become a transit hub for refugees.
""At the start, about 90-95% were people who had a place to go, now there's many more people looking for a place to go and where someone will take care of them,"" Mayor Wojciech Bakun told reporters, speaking in front of the train station where refugees arrive from Ukraine. ""They don't have friends or relatives.""
Alina Kondrashova, 33, a doctor from Krivoy Rog in Ukraine, who arrived in Przemysl on Wednesday with her three-year-old, mother, sister and her sister's baby, was hoping to travel on to Estonia by bus. 
""We don't have family there, but my mother was born there during Soviet times and there's a place to stay,"" she told Reuters at the train station, where the temperature was -1 degree Celsius (30 degrees Fahrenheit) and snow was falling.
Another arrival at the station was Viktor from Makariv near Kyiv, a 64-year-old school security guard who said he did not know anyone in Poland.
""I'd like to stay here in Poland and return when all of this ends,"" he said.
'WE WERE VERY SCARED'
Some spoke of harrowing experiences as they fled their country.
""We were hiding with my family in the basement and (Russian forces) bombed so hard that sand was falling from the ceiling... And we were very scared,"" said Irina Mihalenka, who left an area northeast of the Black Sea port of Odessa before arriving in Romania.
""When we were walking, a bridge was blown up. And when we crossed over the wreckage... because there was no other way out, there were corpses of Russian people (soldiers) lying there.""
Authorities in the Romanian capital Bucharest opened two centres for Ukrainian children to play and do activities before they move on elsewhere with their families.
At the Siret border crossing, refugees continued to cross from Ukraine on foot and by car, most carrying backpacks and dragging suitcases. Some carried pets. 
They are welcomed by volunteers offering hot drinks, food and a smile. Travelling by train remains free for Ukrainian refugees.
Further south, dozens of women and children crossed the Danube by barge from Orlivka in Ukraine to Isaccea in Romania, huddling in winter coats against the bitter wind. 
Romanian firefighters helped them carry children and luggage to shore and into orange tents put up as shelter. 
In Warsaw, Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski met with leaders of non-governmental organisations to find ways to meet what they described as the biggest humanitarian crisis the city had faced since the end of World War Two. 
Back in Przemysl, signs were put up in shelters in Ukrainian, Russian, Polish and English encouraging refugees to think safety when taking a lift. ""Take a selfie with the driver - if they refuse, don't go with them"" and ""Avoid tired drivers"", some read.
Across central Europe, memories of Moscow's dominance after World War Two run deep, heightened by outrage at Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Moscow calls its action a ""special military operation"" to disarm its neighbour and dislodge leaders it calls ""neo-Nazis"". Kyiv and its Western allies dismiss that as a baseless pretext for an unprovoked war against a democratic country of 44 million people.
The UNHCR is planning a cash programme for refugees that could help them pay rent in private accommodation. ""It will start hopefully by this week in Poland,"" Grandi said. ""We will try to do this to complement what governments are doing.""

The United Nations' plans are based on four million refugees arriving but Grandi said the number would likely have to be revised upwards.
More than 1.3 million people have crossed into Poland since the war began, while nearly 320,000 have crossed into Romania - more than half entering via non-EU member Moldova - and 153,000 having entered Slovakia, officials said.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's opposition presidential candidate Yoon Suk-yeol was projected to win Wednesday's election, broadcaster KBS said, with nearly 90% of votes counted, a race that will shape Asia's fourth-largest economy for the next five years.
Conservative Yoon, with 48.6%, was slightly ahead of liberal Lee Jae-myung on 47.8%, with more than 89% of the ballots counted as of 2.30 a.m. on Thursday (1730 GMT Wednesday). 
KBS put Yoon's probability of winning the election at about 95%. 
The unusually bitter election campaign was marred by scandals and smears, but the policy stakes are high for the country of 52 million.
Around 77% of South Korea's 44 million eligible voters cast ballots to pick the leader of a nation whose global status is rising even as it has been riven by gender and generational divisions, while facing a confrontational North Korea. 
The winner must tackle challenges including South Korea's worst wave of COVID-19 infections, growing inequality and surging home prices, while navigating an increasingly tense rivalry between China and the United States.
Voters also want the new president to root out graft and pursue negotiations to curb North Korea's nuclear ambitions.
Lee, the standard-bearer of the ruling Democratic Party, and Yoon, from the conservative main opposition People Power Party, are vying to succeed incumbent President Moon Jae-in, who is constitutionally barred from seeking re-election.
An exit poll jointly conducted by KBS and two other major broadcasters had shown Yoon's 0.6% lead with 48.4%, and another one by cable network JTBC put Lee ahead with 48.4% to Yoon's 47.7%.
The exit polls suggested Lee had performed better than expected. Surveys last week had given Yoon the edge after he secured the support of a fellow conservative who had been trailing a distant third and then quit the race.
LEE SURPRISES IN SEOUL
Lee was seen garnering more votes than expected in Seoul, home to some 8.3 million voters, winning 45.4% in the joint exit poll compared with Yoon's 50.9%. Earlier polls had given Yoon a lead of up to 10 percentage points in the capital.
Cheers and applause erupted at the Democrats' office when the exit polls were released. Party leader Song Young-gil, who wore a bandage after being assaulted at a rally this week by a man with a hammer, shed tears.
Lee had maintained a tight lead during initial counting, but Yoon began narrowing the gap and surpassed him after midnight when about 50% of the ballots were counted. 
A nationwide win by the conservative opposition would represent a remarkable turnaround for a party that was in disarray after the last election in 2017, held early after the impeachment and dismissal of President Park Geun-hye.
Moon's liberal Democratic Party is fighting to protect and continue his agenda, and also to head off threats by Yoon to investigate the outgoing administration for graft if elected.
The two presidents before Moon, including Park, were imprisoned after they left office. Moon faces no specific allegations of wrongdoing, but some of his closest aides were engulfed in corruption scandals.
A former prosecutor general, Yoon has vowed to fight corruption, foster justice and create a more level playing field, while seeking a harder line towards North Korea and a ""reset"" with China.
Lee was governor of the most populous province of Gyeonggi and shot to fame with his aggressive coronavirus response and advocacy of a universal basic income.
'UNLIKEABLE ELECTION'
Both candidates' disapproval ratings matched their popularity as scandals, mud-slinging and gaffes dominated what was dubbed the ""unlikeable election"".
Young voters who backed Moon but became disillusioned over economic woes and the scandals are regarded as a key bloc. 

""As current problems for young people concerning employment and housing prices are serious, I voted for a candidate who made a pledge to come up with solutions,"" Lee Sung-jin, 33, said as he cast his vote in Seoul. He did not say whom he backed.
South Korea is facing a surge in new COVID-19 cases - with a record 342,446 reported on Wednesday - but the issue did not register much in the campaign.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has seen indications that Russia's military in its assault on Ukraine is using so-called dumb bombs that are unguided and greatly increase the risk of missing targets, a senior U.S. defense official said on Wednesday.
""We do have indications that the Russians are in fact dropping some dumb munitions,"" the official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity, adding that the United States was observing ""increasing damage to civilian infrastructure and civilian casualties.""
The comments came shortly after Ukraine accused Russia on Wednesday of bombing a children's hospital in the besieged port city of Mariupol. At least 1,170 civilians have been killed in Mariupol since the start of the Russian invasion, according to Ukrainian authorities.
Reuters was unable to independently confirm those figures.
Russia denies targeting civilians and says it is using precision munitions in its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, and hitting military targets. 
But use of unguided munitions in urban settings, if confirmed, would bolster accusations about Russia's disregard for civilian casualties.
Ukrainian officials are increasingly accusing Russia of intentionally targeting civilians in the two-week-old invasion of the country, the largest conflict in Europe since World War Two. 
The U.S. official declined to quantify Russia's use of unguided munitions and could not say whether Wednesday's hospital strike was a result of their use. 
""We don't have visibility into their targeting process,"" the official said. 
Leaders of U.S. spy agencies said on Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin may intensify the assault on Ukraine despite military setbacks and economic hardships resulting from international sanctions, setting up ""an ugly next few weeks."" They estimated that 2,000 to 4,000 Russian troops had died.
After two weeks, Russians forces have lost use of several hundred vehicles, many of them destroyed. The Kremlin maintains use of more than 90% of the pre-staged combat power that it had assembled outside of Ukraine before the invasion began, the official said.

Russia had amassed more than 150,000 forces outside Ukraine, but much of its campaign in the north stalled in the early days and it failed to carry out plans to quickly capture Kyiv, the capital, U.S. officials say.
Separately, the official said Russian forces had advanced toward the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. That appeared to confirm remarks by the city's mayor, who earlier on Wednesday said Russian troops were regrouping and described the situation as very tense.

The ministry said that some of them, serving in supply units, had been taken prisoner by the Ukrainian army since the fighting began on Feb. 24.
Citing Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov, the RIA news agency said Putin had ordered military prosecutors to investigate and punish the officials responsible for disobeying his instructions to exclude conscripts from the operation.
Some associations of soldiers' mothers in Russia had raised concerns about a number of conscripts going incommunicado at the start of what Kremlin calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, suggesting they could have been sent to fight despite a lack of adequate training.
The Kremlin and military authorities had denied it until now. Last week, Russia's parliament passed a law imposing a prison term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally ""fake"" news about the military.
""Unfortunately, we have discovered several facts of the presence of conscripts in units taking part in the special military operation in Ukraine. Practically all such soldiers have been pulled out to Russia,"" the defence ministry said, promising to prevent such situations in the future.

One mother of a conscript, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said her 19-year-old son's military unit was sent south to the Russian city of Kursk soon after he started his military service and was then moved to Belgorod, a town closer to the Ukrainian border, for training.
She says that judging by the few phone calls she had received, he had not yet been deployed into Ukraine and had not signed a contract to do so. ""I am not sure what will happen tomorrow,"" she told Reuters by telephone.

Bucaram engaged in significant corruption while he was in office and has not been held accountable, it said.

In a daily televised address, he said the threat level in Ukraine was at a maximum nearly two weeks into Russia's invasion but Ukrainians had shown they would never give in.
""Russia uses missiles, aircraft and helicopters against us, against civilians, against our cities, against our infrastructure. It is the humanitarian duty of the world to respond,"" he said.

LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Russia announced a new ceasefire in Ukraine on Wednesday to let civilians flee besieged cities, but there were only limited signs of progress providing escape routes for hundreds of thousands of people trapped without medicine or fresh water.
The governor of Sumy, an eastern city, said civilian cars were leaving for a second day through a safe corridor set up to Poltava further west.
But by midday in Ukraine there was no confirmation that any of the other evacuation corridors had been successfully opened, including a route out of Mariupol, seen as the most urgent, where the Red Cross has described conditions as ""apocalyptic"".
The mayor of Enerhodar, site of Europe's biggest nuclear power plant which Russian forces seized last week in a battle that raised global alarm, said humanitarian supplies would be allowed in and buses would take residents out on the way back.
The greatest humanitarian concern is Mariupol, a southern port surrounded by Russian troops for more than a week.
Residents there have been sheltering underground from relentless bombardment, unable to evacuate their wounded, and with no access to food, water, power or heat. Local ceasefires to let them leave have failed since Saturday.
Kyiv said 30 buses and eight trucks of supplies failed to reach it on Tuesday after they came under Russian shelling in violation of the ceasefire. Moscow has blamed Kyiv for failing to halt fire.
More than 2 million people have fled Ukraine since President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion nearly two weeks ago. Moscow calls its action a ""special military operation"" to disarm its neighbour and dislodge leaders it calls ""neo-Nazis.""
Kyiv and its Western allies dismiss that as a baseless pretext for an unprovoked war against a democratic country of 44 million people.
In recent days, Russia has also accused Ukraine of having tried to develop biological or nuclear weapons. On Wednesday, the Kremlin said Washington must explain what Moscow described as Ukrainian biological weapons labs. Western countries call that an attempt to fabricate a new pretext for the invasion retroactively.
Ukraine's nuclear power plant operator said it was concerned for safety, both at Enerhodar and at Chernobyl, mothballed site of the world's worst nuclear disaster, where it said a power cut due to fighting meant spent nuclear fuel could not be cooled.
'RETALIATORY MEASURES'
The war has swiftly cast Russia into economic isolation never before visited on such a large economy. The United States said on Tuesday it was banning imports of Russian oil, a major policy change after energy was previously exempted from sanctions.
Western companies have swiftly withdrawn from the Russian market. In a stark symbol, McDonalds said on Tuesday it was shutting its nearly 850 restaurants in Russia. Its first, which drew huge queues to Moscow's Pushkin Square when it opened in 1990, had been an emblem of the end of the Cold War.
Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) , Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Pepsi and others made similar announcements. Imperial Brands (OTC:IMBBY), the UK-listed maker of Winston cigarettes, joined the stampede out on Wednesday, shutting its factory in Volgograd. 
Russia's ruling United Russia party said it proposed seizing assets of foreign companies that leave.
""We will take tough retaliatory measures, acting in accordance with the laws of war,"" Andrei Turchak, secretary of the party's council, wrote on its website. 
Banishing Russia, the world's top exporter of combined oil and gas, from markets is sending shockwaves through the global economy at a time when inflation in the developed world is already at levels not seen since the 1980s. Retail fuel pump prices have surged to records. [O/R]
Both Ukraine and Russia are also major global exporters of food and metals. Prices of grain and food oils have soared worldwide, punishing poor countries in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Trade in nickel, critical in electric vehicle production, was called off on Tuesday in London after the price more than doubled.
Ukraine said on Wednesday it was halting exports of rye, barley, buckwheat, millet, sugar, salt and meat for the rest of the year.
'WAR MACHINE'
U.S. President Joe Biden acknowledged that Americans' bills would rise but said it was necessary to restrict Russia's ability to wage war.
""The American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin's war machine,"" he said.
Britain said it would phase out Russian oil by the end of 2022, while the European Union published plans to cut its reliance on Russian gas by two thirds this year. 
China, which signed a friendship pact with Russia three weeks before the invasion, has yet to join the West in condemning Moscow or imposing sanctions.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told the New York Times Washington could ""essentially shut"" down Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp or any Chinese companies that kept supplying chips or other advanced technology to Russia.
U.S. intelligence chiefs told lawmakers on Tuesday that China appeared to have been unsettled by difficulties Russia was facing in Ukraine and the strength of the Western reaction.
High oil prices prompted by Russia's invasion could cut a full percentage point off the growth of big developing economies such as China, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey, a World Bank official said.
'OUR TASK'
Western countries believe Moscow had aimed to quickly topple the Kyiv govenrment in a lightning strike, and is being forced to adjust after underestimating Ukrainian resistance. Russia has taken substantial territory in the south but has yet to capture any major cities in northern or eastern Ukraine, with an assault force stalled on a highway north of Kyiv.
Russia is desperate for some kind of victory in cities like Mariupol and Kyiv, before it negotiates peace, Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister, wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Wednesday. ""Therefore, our task is to withstand for the next 7-10 days,"" he said.

Ukrainians fear the next big target will be Odessa, Ukraine's main Black Sea port. Residents are preparing to defend the historic city of 1 million, a polyglot centre of culture with wide resonance for Ukrainians and Russians alike. A giant blue and yellow banner reading ""Odessa-Ukraine"" was draped atop sandbags in the near-deserted city centre.
""We did not surrender Odessa to Hitler, and we will not surrender it to anyone else,"" said Galyna Zitser, director of the Odessa Philharmonic, which on Tuesday put on its first performance since the crisis began.

TUNIS (Reuters) - As Tunisia's president prepares to rewrite the constitution after dismissing parliament last year and ruling by decree, he has called for citizens' input by setting up a voluntary multiple-choice questionnaire online.
With two weeks to go before the survey is due to end, only 276,000 people have taken part in the country of 12 million, according to the survey website, amid accusations by Kais Saied's critics that the consultation is a charade.
After his move against the elected parliament last summer, the 64-year-old announced in December he would appoint a committee to rewrite the constitution with input from the people and put it to a referendum in June.
He says his intervention was a response to a decade of political and economic stagnation at the hands of a corrupt, self-serving elite.
""The future of Tunisia is in the hands of Tunisians and it is their intensive participation that will pave the way towards a new stage in the history of Tunisia based on the real popular will and not on fake legitimacy,"" Saied said in January.
His critics decry the president's actions as a coup that has imperilled democracy won in a 2011 revolution that sparked ""Arab Spring"" uprisings across the Middle East.
They say the public consultation on the constitution is designed to create a veneer of inclusiveness while Saied imposes his own preferred political system, the latest step in a march towards near total power.
""I think Tunisia is going to one-man politics, so I'm not enthusiastic about any participation in the consultation,"" said Karim Saqaa, a law student in the capital Tunis.
Many political parties and the powerful UGTT labour union have also denounced the plan, and some said that Saied, who was a constitutional law professor before taking up politics, appeared to be prejudging the results of the survey.
In January he said it was already apparent from the results so far that people wanted a presidential system.
His opponents - and Tunisia's main foreign donors - say any truly inclusive process should involve all of the country's main political players.
2014 CONSTITUTION HAILED AS TRIUMPH
The 2014 constitution, which Saied intends to replace, was hailed at the time as a triumph of compromise between rival factions that helped avert a period of dangerous polarisation.
When it was agreed, rival parliamentarians embraced, weeping on the floor of the now-suspended chamber. 
But the mixed parliamentary and presidential system it introduced was prone to paralysis, and squabbling politicians failed to set up a constitutional court that would have resolved disputes.
When Saied won a landslide presidential election second round in 2019, the result was seen by many voters as a repudiation of Tunisia's entire political class.
On a recent cold, rainy day near Tunis university, a group of pro-Saied volunteers set up a stall on a cafe balcony with banners and a loudspeaker to encourage people to enrol for the questionnaire.
Reuters journalists who were there for an hour saw only a few people sign up. 
""We volunteered because for once in Tunisia's history, people are being directly consulted on vital issues and are no longer being brought down by a political elite,"" said Ahmed Kouki, handing out fliers to promote the consultation.
One question in the survey asks whether a presidential, parliamentary or mixed political system is best.
Another asks whether the government should prioritise electoral or constitutional reform, or leave things as they are. Other questions address economic and social issues. 
""Tunisia, security, sovereignty, freedom"" read one of the banners hanging outside Kouki's stall at the cafe.
Regional governors, state officials, university authorities and publicly owned companies have tried to promote the consultation with a publicity campaign.
While the Minister for Youth blamed the low turnout on technical problems and poor internet penetration, Saied accused counter-revolutionaries of trying to torpedo the process.
On Tuesday he suggested offering people free internet access as a way of boosting the participation rate.
For many Tunisians, Saied's constitutional tinkering seems divorced from their daily reality of low employment, rising prices and shortages of some goods, as a crisis in public finances looms.

In response to his internet offer, some people wrote on the presidency's social media feed saying they were online, but needed bread. 
""The president should focus on the economy, on providing jobs. But nothing has changed,"" said Ashraf, 25, a supermarket worker sitting in the cafe behind the volunteers.

Taiwan, claimed by China as its own territory, has raised its alert level since Russia invaded Ukraine, wary of Beijing making a move on the island at the same time, though it has reported no unusual Chinese military movements.
In a report to parliament on the security implications of the war, Taiwan's China-policy making Mainland Affairs Council said Beijing would continue to ""increase its unilateral actions"" against the island.
""But the current priority is to ensure the stability of the internal and external environment before the 20th Party Congress, to pave the way for Xi's reappointment, and not to suddenly escalate tensions in the short term,"" it said.
The congress is likely to take place towards the end of the year, where Xi is widely expected to be confirmed for a third term as China's leader, an event unprecedented in modern times. 
Over the past two years China has increased military activity around Taiwan, mostly by sending fighter jets into its air defence identification zone.
Taiwan calls these incursions ""grey zone"" warfare designed to test its pilots' response times and wear them out with constantly having to scramble.
The Mainland Affairs Council said China's failure to condemn the invasion, which Russia calls a ""special operation"", or to place any sanctions on the country was in contravention of the United Nations Charter and rules of international relations.
""It will also become a security risk for the Taiwan Strait,"" it added.
China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, and stand-off between the two remains a potentially dangerous military flashpoint. China recognises no claims of sovereignty by Taiwan.
Speaking in Beijing earlier on Wednesday, the Communist Party's fourth-ranked leader Wang Yang said ""uncertainties and instabilities"" over the Taiwan Strait had increased.

""But the times, momentum and righteousness are always on our side,"" said Wang, who heads China's top political advisory body.
""We have the overall strength and sure-win confidence to cope with various complex situations.""

LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Victoria Zaburyna had urged her 76-year-old mother to flee the Russian forces that now besiege Mariupol in southeastern Ukraine. She replied that the city was still calm and had stayed put.
Then her mother called to say that she was sheltering in a hallway after a bomb or shell had destroyed a nearby school, peppering her apartment block with debris.
""It's kind of quiet now, so I'll probably return home,"" said her mother, Tamara Usenko. ""Don't worry."" There has been no word from her since. 
Hundreds of thousands of residents of Mariupol under bombardment have been sheltering without water or power for more than a week. Phone signals are also down, effectively cutting off the industrial city from the world. 
Zaburyna has become one of thousands of Ukrainians desperately seeking information about loved ones who might have been cut off, displaced and possibly killed in the war.
Oleg Maksimchuk's older brother Viktor, who is 63 and retired, lives in a village just east of Mariupol. They haven't spoken since Feb. 26, when Viktor was sheltering in a basement.
""The bombing has started,"" Viktor told Oleg during that last telephone call. ""I can see a military aircraft, too.""
Oleg, who lives hundreds of miles away, tried to call Viktor the next day but couldn't get through. ""I hope my brother is alive,"" he told Reuters.
Oleg has since posted a message on a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page dedicated to reuniting Ukrainians with relatives in Mariupol. ""Any information will be appreciated,"" he wrote, adding: ""Glory to Ukraine.""
A Telegram group has also been created to help find Ukrainians missing from Mariupol and other cities under intense bombardment. It has about 70,000 subscribers.
HUMANITARIAN CORRIDOR
Russia has promised to open a humanitarian corridor to let Mariupol's besieged residents flee but the plan fell apart after Ukraine's government accused Russian forces of shelling it.
Ukrainian authorities said on Tuesday that a six-year-old girl had died alone from dehydration after Russian shells had destroyed her home and killed her mother.
Russia describes its actions in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" to disarm its neighbour. [
Until 1989, when the Soviet Union began to disintegrate, Mariupol was named Zhdanov, after a high-ranking Communist who had led Leningrad - now St. Petersburg - during its gruelling siege by Germany in World War Two.
Now Mariupol endures its own siege.
Olha Uha hasn't heard from her 82-year-old uncle, Anatoliy Mulika, for eight or nine days. He lived alone in an apartment in eastern Mariupol.
Uha had urged her uncle to leave the city. She lives near Rivne, at the opposite corner of Ukraine.
But Mulika, who was born during World War Two, refused to budge. ""He was optimistic and didn't want to hear about escaping,"" said Uha, recalling their last telephone conversation.
He said he had survived World War Two and the events of 2014, when Russia annexed nearby Crimea. ""And I'll survive again,"" he told Uha. ""I'll never give up.""
Uha called the next day and couldn't get through. Now it was her turn to stay positive. ""I don't want to think the worst,"" she said.
Iraida Dzyubenko was looking for her daughter-in-law, Olga Ponomarenko, who lived with two children in an apartment block on Mariupol's eastern edge.
Olga had tried to flee the city, but had decided to wait a day or two because the train station was crowded and her son was sick.
Eight or nine days ago, in the middle of the night, Dzyubenko got a last message from Olga, but while trying to open it she accidentally deleted it.
""I wish I could retrieve it but I can't,"" she said.

Dzyubenko, who also lived hundreds of miles from Mariupol, broke down several times while speaking about her relatives.
""Please help to find them,"" she sobbed.

Syrian state media said the other two victims of Monday's strike on Damascus were civilians, while the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights identified them as pro-Iran Syrian militiamen. 
The Observatory said the two dead Iranians killed belonged to Iran's elite Quds Force. Six militiamen were also wounded, it added.
Holding Israel accountable for such attacks ""is one of the main goals of the resistance (forces) in the region,"" Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Saeed Khatibzadeh said. 
The Guards' website, Sepah News, identified the two slain officers as colonels Ehsan Karbalaipour and Morteza Saeidnejad, adding that Israel would ""pay for this crime."" Their funerals will be held on Wednesday, it said.
The Observatory said Monday's was the seventh Israeli strike on Syria this year and that the target was a weapons and ammunition depot near Damascus airport.

Israel rarely comments on air strikes in Syria, of which it has carried out hundreds since the start of the civil war in 2011. 
Iran has been Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad’s most supportive ally throughout the conflict. Backed by Russian air power, Syria’s army and thousands of Iran-backed militias have been fighting insurgents.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's military said on Wednesday it had sent back all seven North Korean sailors who were aboard a ship it seized after the vessel crossed into the South's waters a day before. 
The boat was towed to a South Korean border island after crossing the Northern Limit Line (NLL), the de facto sea boundary between the two Koreas, according to Seoul's military officials.
A North Korean patrol vessel that was tracing the seized ship briefly crossed the NLL but turned back shortly after the South's military broadcast warnings and fired a warning shot. 
Seoul's defence ministry said its military handed the seven sailors and the seized boat to North Korean authorities near the NLL around 14:00 p.m. (0500 GMT), after the crew asked to return during questioning. 
""It's been confirmed that the border crossing resulted from a navigating error and mechanical defects, and all of the sailors expressed their willingness to go back to North Korea,"" the ministry said in a statement. 
The incident came at a sensitive time on the Korean Peninsula. The South holds a presidential election on Wednesday, and tensions have risen over Pyongyang's recent missile tests and rising signs of activity at its nuclear testing site.
The two Koreas remain technically at war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.

The U.N. agency confirmed on Monday that at least nine people had died in 16 attacks on health care facilities since the start of a Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. It did not say who was responsible. 
The WHO's senior emergency officer for Europe, Catherine Smallwood, told a news briefing that the tally included incidents where ambulances had been commandeered for purposes other than emergency healthcare.
""We will continue to update those numbers. They've been increasing quite rapidly over the past few days,"" Smallwood said.
The agency is working to rapidly provide medical supplies to Ukraine, where oxygen, insulin, personal protective equipment, surgical items and blood products are running low, Europe regional director Hans Kluge told the briefing. 
The supply of oxygen, children's vaccines, especially against polio amid an outbreak, and mental health expertise are among the WHO's top priorities for the region, he said. 
In a separate statement, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said countries neighbouring Ukraine which are hosting Ukrainian refugees should include them in their vaccine programmes against a range of diseases, 

They should prioritise vaccinating against COVID-19 and polio and also against measles, as the current inoculation coverage is insufficient to prevent measles outbreaks, the ECDC said in a statement. 
""Crowding in bomb shelters and reception centres could facilitate the start of a measles outbreak, particularly as spring coincides with the natural seasonality of the disease,"" the agency added.

CARACAS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Venezuela released two jailed U.S. citizens on Tuesday in an apparent goodwill gesture toward the Biden administration following a visit to Caracas by a high-level U.S. delegation.
One of the freed prisoners was Gustavo Cardenas, among six Citgo oil executives arrested in 2017 and convicted on charges the U.S. government says were fabricated. The other was a Cuban American, identified as Jorge Alberto Fernandez, detained on unrelated charges.
""Tonight, two Americans who were wrongfully detained in Venezuela will be able to hug their families once more,"" President Joe Biden said in a statement.
""We are bringing Gustavo Cardenas and Jorge Fernandez home,"" he said. He gave no more details about their release.
The weekend visit by the U.S. delegation focused not only on the fate of detained Americans but on the possibility of easing U.S. oil sanctions on the OPEC member to fill a supply gap if Biden banned Russian oil imports in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine - something he did on Tuesday. Venezuela is Russia's closest ally in South America.
Washington has sought the release of at least nine men, including those known as the ""Citgo 6,"" two former Green Berets and a former U.S. Marine.
The freeing of the two could set a more positive tone for talks between the United States and Venezuela, which have had hostile relations through successive American administrations.
The U.S. delegation, the highest-ranking to travel to Venezuela in recent years, met the detainees on Sunday in a Venezuelan prison. U.S. hostage envoy Roger Carstens was part of the group, and he was believed to have stayed behind to finalize the release.
Tuesday’s release followed talks with socialist President Nicolas Maduro on Saturday as the Biden administration sought ways to stave off the impact of soaring U.S. gasoline prices spurred by efforts by the West to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.
Biden ramped up the pressure campaign on Moscow on Tuesday with his announcement of a U.S. ban on Russian oil and other energy imports. The ban could further increase prices at the pump for American consumers, adding to inflationary pressure.
Engagement with Maduro, a longtime U.S. foe, was also aimed at gauging whether Venezuela is prepared to distance itself from Russia.
But the Biden administration faced strong criticism on Capitol Hill for its contact with Maduro, who is under U.S. sanctions for human rights abuses and political repression.
Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, urged the White House not to pursue a deal with Venezuela.
Maduro, he said in a statement, “is a cancer to our hemisphere and we should not breathe new life into his reign of torture and murder.”
The United States in 2019 recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate president following Maduro’s 2018 re-election, which Western governments dismissed as a sham.
STICKING POINT
Cardenas was one of six executives of U.S.-based Citgo Petroleum, owned by Venezuela's state-own oil company PDVSA, arrested during a business trip to Caracas in 2017. A Venezuelan court in November 2020 sentenced the men, who were accused of crimes including embezzlement, money laundering and conspiracy, to prison terms ranging from eight to 13 years.
The executives - five naturalized U.S. citizens and one permanent U.S. resident - have been in and out of prison and house arrest in recent years, their circumstances often appearing to depend on the state of U.S.-Venezuela relations.
Their detention has been a major sticking point between Caracas and Washington, which has repeatedly demanded their release and called their detention unlawful.

Among the Americans still held in Venezuela is Matthew Heath, a Marine veteran charged with terrorism and arms trafficking. Heath denied the charges. U.S. officials said Heath was not sent by Washington and accused Venezuelan authorities of holding him illegally.
Two other Americans still detained are former U.S. special forces members, Luke Denman and Airan Berry, who were arrested in 2020 in connection with a botched raid aimed at ousting Maduro.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's military strategists have been studying Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the country's resistance, for the island's own battle strategy in the event its giant neighbour China ever makes good on its threat to take them by force.
While Taiwan's government has not reported any unusual activity by the military in China, which views the island as its own territory, Taipei has raised its alert level.
Russia's use of precision missiles, as well as Ukraine's tactically well thought through resistance despite being outmanned and outgunned, are being carefully watched in security circles in Taiwan, whose own forces are likewise dwarfed by China's.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has championed the idea of ""asymmetric warfare"", to make its forces more mobile and hard to attack, with for example vehicle-mounted missiles. 
Ma Cheng-Kun, director of the Graduate Institute of China Military Affairs Studies at Taiwan's National Defence University, said Ukraine had used the same concept with mobile weapons to stymie Russian forces.
""Ukraine's military has been making full use of asymmetric warfare, very effectively, and so far successfully holding off Russia's advance,"" added Ma, a government advisor on China policy. 
""That's exactly what our armed forces have been proactively developing,"" he said, pointing to weapons like the lightweight and indigenously-developed Kestrel shoulder-launched anti-armour rocket designed for close-in warfare.
""From Ukraine's performance we can be even more confident in our own.""
Taiwan has been developing other missiles which can reach far into China.
Last week, the defence ministry said it plans to more than double its yearly missile production capacity to close to 500 this year, including the upgraded version of the Hsiung Feng IIE missile, the longer-range Hsiung Sheng land-attack missile which military experts say is capable of hitting targets further inland in China.
Taiwan's Defence Ministry says it has a ""close grasp"" of the international security situation and that it is working hard to ""improve its armaments and national defence combat capability all the time"" but that the military is ""not provocative"".
NATURAL BARRIER
There are big differences however between Taiwan and Ukraine's positions that have offered reassurance. 
Taiwan's government has repeatedly pointed out, for example, the natural barrier of the Taiwan Strait which separates it from China. Ukraine has a long land border with Russia.
Strategists say Taiwan can also easily detect signs of Chinese military movements and make preparations ahead of an invasion in which China would need to mobilise hundreds of thousands of soldiers and equipment like ships, which could be easily targeted by Taiwanese missiles.
To put boots on the ground China would have to cross the strait, ""so it's a much higher risk"" for China, said Su Tzu-yun, an associate research fellow at Taiwan's top military think tank, the Institute for National Defence and Security Research.
It's not only about hardware.
Looming in the background is the perennial debate - given new focus by the Ukraine war - about whether U.S. forces would ride to Taiwan's aid in the event of a Chinese attack. Washington practices ""strategic ambiguity"" on the subject, giving no clear answer either way.
Lo Chih-cheng, a senior lawmaker from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party who sits on parliament's defence and foreign affairs committee, said the Biden administration sending a team of top former officials to Taiwan last week shortly after Ukraine was invaded should dispel the idea that the United States is not to be relied on.
""At this time it sent a message to the other side of the strait, to Taiwan's people, that the United States is a trustworthy country,"" he told a party podcast on Tuesday.
Taiwan, a major semiconductor producer, hopes its geographic and supply chain importance makes it different from Ukraine.

But the Biden administration repeatedly ruling out sending troops to Ukraine has caused unease for some in Taiwan.
""Do people in Taiwan really think now that the West and the United States will still come to save us?"" said Chao Chien-min, a former deputy head of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council now at Taiwan's Chinese Culture University.

WASHINGTON/LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - A U.S. ban on imports of Russia's oil ratcheted up punishment for the invasion of Ukraine on Tuesday as McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) closed outlets and Moscow promised safe passage for some people to flee. 
As the number of refugees created by the biggest assault on a European country since World War Two surpassed 2 million, several of the most internationally famous brands added to the Kremlin's global isolation on the 13th day of the incursion. 
McDonald's, a symbol of capitalism that opened in Russia as the Soviet Union fell, and coffeehouse chain Starbucks will temporarily close stores, while Pepsi will stop selling its soft drink brands and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is halting business in the country.
Washington, meanwhile, imposed an immediate ban on imports of Russian energy, sparking a further increase in the oil price, which rose around 4% on Tuesday. Prices have surged more than 30% since Russia's incursion began on Feb. 24. [O/R]
Russia - the world's second-largest exporter of crude - has warned the cost will skyrocket further if the West implements bans. 
Despite the prospect of higher household bills, U.S. President Joe Biden said President Vladimir Putin needed to face consequences for the assault.
""The American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin's war machine,"" he said.
The Kremlin describes its actions as a ""special operation"" to disarm Ukraine and unseat leaders it calls neo-Nazis. 
Ukraine and Western allies call this a baseless pretext for an invasion that has raised fears of wider conflict in Europe and could deal a further hit to the world economy as it tries to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.
Civilians fled the besieged city of Sumy on Tuesday in the first successful ""humanitarian corridor"" opened since Russia's invasion but Ukraine accused Russian forces of shelling another evacuation route, from Mariupol in the south of the country. 
Talks between Kyiv and Moscow over safe passage have previously failed, with Ukraine opposing routes out of the country to Russia or its ally Belarus. 
Moscow is ready to provide humanitarian corridors so people can leave capital Kyiv and four other cities - Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol - on Wednesday, Mikhail Mizintsev, head of Russia's National Defence Control Centre, was quoted as saying by the Tass news agency.
""In order to ensure the safety of civilians and foreign citizens, Russia will observe a regime of silence from 10 am Moscow time (0700 GMT) on March 9 and is ready to provide humanitarian corridors,"" he said. It was unclear if the proposed routes would pass through Russia or Belarus.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy renewed calls on Tuesday for no-fly zones, something the West has rejected for fears of escalating the conflict. 
The United States turned down a surprise Polish offer to transfer MiG-29 fighter jets to a U.S. base in Germany to help replenish Ukraine's air force.
The prospect of flying combat aircraft from NATO territory into the war zone ""raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,"" the Pentagon said.
Instead, the West has focussed its pressure on sanctions, mainly on individuals and financial institutions. Up until now, oil and natural gas had been excluded. 
The United States is not a leading buyer of Russian oil and Europeans, who are far more reliant on it, have been reluctant to follow suit.
Britain, however, said it would also phase out the import of Russian oil and oil products by the end of 2022, while the EU published plans to cut its reliance on Russian gas by two thirds this year. 
Vyacheslav Volodin, chairman of Russia's State Duma lower house of parliament, said the measures would hurt Europe while helping the United States.
""By promoting sanctions against Russian energy resources, Washington is seeking to occupy the European market,"" he said in an online post.
'APOCALYPTIC'
In Mariupol, hundreds of thousands of people have been sheltering under bombardment for more than a week. Many tried to leave on Tuesday along a safe corridor but Ukraine's foreign ministry said Russian forces violated a ceasefire and shelled it.
Moscow denies targeting civilians. 
International Committee of the Red Cross spokesman Ewan Watson said people in Mariupol were fast running out of electricity, heat, food, and drinking water.
""The situation in Mariupol is apocalyptic,"" he said. 
Russia opened a separate corridor out of the eastern city of Sumy. Buses left for Poltava further west, only hours after a Russian air strike which regional officials said had hit a residential area and killed 21 people. Reuters could not verify the incident. 
Russia said 723 people had been evacuated via that corridor, including 576 Indian nationals.
Residents were also leaving Irpin, a frontline Kyiv suburb.
Elsewhere, Ukrainian troops repulsed efforts by Russian forces to enter the eastern city of Kharkiv on Tuesday and foiled a planned operation by 120 Russian paratroopers near the border, regional governor Oleh Synehubov said.
Five people, two of them children, were killed late on Tuesday when Russian planes attacked the town of Malyn, some 100 kilometres (62 miles) northwest of Kyiv, and destroyed seven houses, the state emergency service said in an online post. Reuters was unable to corroborate.
The United Nations human rights office said it had verified 1,335 civilian casualties in Ukraine, including 474 killed and 861 injured, since the invasion began on Feb. 24. The real toll is likely higher, it said.
A total of 2 million people, mostly women and children, have fled, according to the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR. 
ADVANCE SLOWED
Western countries say Russia's initial battle plan for a rapid strike to topple Ukraine's government failed early in the war, and Moscow has adjusted tactics for longer sieges of cities.
""The tempo of the enemy's advance has slowed considerably, and in certain directions where they were advancing it has practically stopped,"" Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych told a briefing on Tuesday.
Ukraine's defence ministry said Vitaly Gerasimov, first deputy commander of Russia's 41st army, was killed on Monday, the second Russian major general killed during the invasion. Russia's defence ministry could not be reached for comment.
The main Russian assault force heading towards Kyiv has been stuck on a road north of the capital. But to the south, Russia has made more progress along the Black and Azov Sea coasts.

Within Russia, the war has led to a severe new crackdown on dissent, with the last remaining independent media largely shut last week and foreign broadcasters banned.
Russian police arrested at least 100 protesters against the invasion of Ukraine on Tuesday, the OVD-Info monitoring group said. Police made no comment.

(Reuters) -Florida lawmakers on Tuesday passed a Republican-backed bill that would prohibit classroom discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity for many young students, rejecting criticism and student protests that characterized the measure as discriminatory and misguided.
The legislation, referred to by its opponents as the ""don't say gay"" bill, has stirred national controversy amid an increasingly partisan debate over what schools should teach children about race and gender.
Governor Ron DeSantis, who is seeking re-election this year, has indicated his support for what is formally called the ""Parental Rights in Education"" bill. He and other Republican politicians across the United States say they want to give parents more control over what young children learn in school.
Democrats say such policies will harm the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community. The Florida measure bars classroom instruction in public schools on sexual orientation or gender identity for children in kindergarten through third grade, or from about ages 5-9.
It also prohibits such teaching that ""is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate"" for students in other grades. Under the law, parents would be allowed to sue school districts they believe to be in violation.
""We're going to make sure that parents are able to send their kid to kindergarten without having some of this stuff injected into their school curriculum,"" DeSantis told reporters on Monday.
High school students across Florida have staged walk-outs to protest the bill. Video footage showed students crowding the steps and the halls of the state capitol on Monday, carrying pro-LGBTQ signs and chanting ""We say gay!""
The measure passed the state Senate on Tuesday mostly along party lines. The Republican-led state House also approved the bill last month.
'STAIN' ON FLORIDA HISTORY
In a floor debate before the state Senate vote on Tuesday, Democrat Shevrin Jones, the first openly gay Florida state senator, chided his Republican colleagues for pushing for the bill for political gain.
""As you prepare for this victory lap in the name of parental rights, just know that this is no victory lap,"" Jones said to the chamber, a day after tearfully sharing his own difficult experiences as a gay man. ""I believe this will be another stain on the history of Florida.""
Republicans who supported the bill insisted that it was intended to prevent discussions about sex and gender identity they deemed inappropriate for young students.
""There is an effort to inject these types of discussions into younger and younger age groups,” Republican state Senator Danny Burgess said. “Our default position as a state has to be and should remain: trust the child’s parents.”
The education bill is the latest Florida policy to draw objections from across the country.
On Monday, the state surgeon general said Florida would recommend that healthy children not receive COVID-19 vaccines, defying federal health guidance. The state Senate last week passed a ban on abortion after 15 weeks, which would slash access to late-term abortions for women in the U.S. Southeast as the Supreme Court weighs the constitutionality of such a ban.

The Biden administration has criticized state efforts targeting women and the LGBTQ community. 
U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona in a statement on Tuesday rebuked Florida lawmakers for ""prioritizing hateful bills that hurt some of the students most in need.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The former chairman of the U.S. right-wing group the Proud Boys, Enrique Tarrio, was arrested on Tuesday on a conspiracy charge for his alleged role in plotting the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol in a bid to block certification of President Joe Biden's election.
Tarrio, 38, appeared in a virtual Miami-based federal court hearing from a cellblock in a nearby local jail, and prosecutors said they were seeking to have him detained pending trial because they believe he is a danger to the community and poses a risk of flight.
Tarrio told the judge he has ""absolutely"" no savings, and that he only recently got a job printing T-shirts that earns him $400-500 per week.
Andrew Jacobs, a federal defender, was appointed to represent Tarrio, and a detention hearing was set for Friday at 10 a.m.
An attorney for Tarrio did not respond to requests for comment.
Tarrio is one of the most high-profile of more than 775 people criminally charged for their roles in the attack on the Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump. Tarrio was not on the Capitol grounds on the day of the assault, but is charged with helping plan and direct it.
Other members of the Proud Boys removed Tarrio from their private chatrooms early on Tuesday after learning of his arrest, said a member of the group who asked for anonymity.
Eleven people affiliated with the Oath Keepers militia, including that group's founder, Stewart Rhodes, were charged in January with seditious conspiracy for their alleged roles in planning the attack.
Tarrio was added as a defendant to a case naming other Proud Boy members Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs, Charles Donohoe, Zachary Rehl and Dominic Pezzola.
That case is tentatively slated to go to trial on May 18.
Police in Washington on Jan. 4, 2021, arrested Tarrio on destruction of property charges connected to the Dec. 12, 2020, burning of a Black Lives Matter banner at a historic African-American church. 
He later served a four-month stint in jail for the charges.
Tarrio was released from custody on Jan. 5, 2021, and ordered to stay out of the city as a condition of his release in the banner-burning case. 
However, the indictment alleges that he did not immediately comply, and instead met with Oath Keepers leader Rhodes in an underground parking garage. 
Last month, Reuters reported that the FBI was investigating the details of the meeting between Rhodes and Tarrio. Tarrio previously told Reuters the meeting was unplanned and he did not consider it to be significant.
He also previously denied any Proud Boys planning ahead of Jan. 6.
Although Tarrio did not storm the Capitol with some of the other Proud Boys, prosecutors say he nonetheless continued to direct and encourage his fellow Proud Boy members during the riots. 
He also allegedly claimed credit for what happened on social media, as well as through an encrypted chat room.
According to the indictment, Tarrio posted a number of incendiary comments to his followers about the 2020 presidential election.
On Nov. 6, 2020, for instance, he wrote: ""The media constantly accuses us of wanting to start a civil war. Careful what the fuck you ask for we don't want to start one ... but we sure as fuck finish one.""
Tarrio is charged with conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding, a fairly common felony charge that many Capitol rioters are facing. It can carry up to 20 years in prison on conviction.

Rhodes, by contrast, is facing charges of seditious conspiracy, a less commonly seen serious felony offense that criminalizes attempts to overthrow the government.
One of the 11 Oath Keepers defendants, Joshua James, pleaded guilty as part of a deal with prosecutors last week. The deal was a notable victory for the Justice Department, which hopes to secure similar convictions against other defendants.
