(Reuters) - A New York judge struck down the state's mask mandate on Monday, one week before it was due to expire, ruling the governor overstepped her authority in imposing a rule that needed to have been passed by the state legislature.
Judge Thomas Rademaker of New York State Supreme Court on Long Island found that the state legislature last year curbed any governor's ability to issue decrees, such as a mask mandate, amid a declared state of emergency. 
It was latest setback for executive branch officials at state and federal levels. Earlier this month, the U.S. Supreme Court blocked President Joe Biden's vaccination-or-testing mandate for large businesses. A judge in Texas last week ruled that Biden could not require federal employees to be vaccinated.
Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, vowed to fight back, saying in a statement, ""We strongly disagree with this ruling, and we are pursuing every option to reverse this immediately.""
""My responsibility as Governor is to protect New Yorkers throughout this public health crisis, and these measures help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and save lives,"" Hochul said. 
Disagreements and court action over mandates in a number of states have become a flashpoint of the pandemic response in the United States, often dividing Democrats and Republicans.
The requirements in New York state, home to around 20 million people, include wearing masks in schools, on public transit and other public indoor spaces.
Hochul declared a state of emergency almost immediately after the World Health Organization named Omicron as a variant of concern on Nov. 26. 
At the time, New York state's seven-day average of new daily cases was around 6,400. That number rapidly rose until peaking at 73,815 on Jan. 10. It has since fallen to about a third of that.
When Hochul imposed the rule on Dec. 31, she called it temporary. She later extended the original expiration date of Jan. 15 until Feb. 1. 

Rademaker wrote that his ruling is not intended in any way to question or otherwise opine on the efficacy, need, or requirement of masks as a means or tool in dealing with the COVID-19 virus, but that ""enacting any laws to this end is entrusted solely to the State Legislature.""
Hochul's Democrats hold large majorities in both houses of he New York state legislature.

MOSCOW/BRUSSELS (Reuters) -NATO said on Monday it was putting forces on standby and reinforcing eastern Europe with more ships and fighter jets, in what Russia denounced as Western ""hysteria"" in response to its build-up of troops on the Ukraine border.
The U.S. Department of Defense in Washington said about 8,500 American troops were put on heightened alert and were awaiting orders to deploy to the region, should Russia invade Ukraine.
Tensions are high after Russia massed an estimated 100,000 troops in reach of its neighbour's border, surrounding Ukraine with forces from the north, east and south.
Russia denies planning an invasion and Moscow is citing the Western response as evidence that Russia is the target, not the instigator, of aggression.
President Joe Biden, pushing for transatlantic unity, held an 80-minute secure video call with a number of European leaders on Monday from the White House Situation Room to discuss the Ukraine crisis.
Biden told reporters ""I had a very, very, very good meeting"" with the Europeans, which included the leaders of Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Poland. He said there was ""total unanimity.""
A White House statement said the leaders ""discussed their joint efforts to deter further Russian aggression against Ukraine, including preparations to impose massive consequences and severe economic costs on Russia for such actions as well as to reinforce security on NATO's eastern flank.""
Welcoming a series of deployments announced by alliance members in recent days, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg earlier said NATO would take ""all necessary measures.""
""We will always respond to any deterioration of our security environment, including through strengthening our collective defence,"" Stoltenberg said in a statement.
He told a news conference that the enhanced presence on NATO's eastern flank could also include the deployment of battlegroups in the southeast of the alliance.
So far, NATO has about 4,000 troops in multinational battalions in Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland, backed by tanks, air defences and intelligence and surveillance units.
U.S. officials said the Pentagon was finalising efforts to identify specific units that it could deploy to NATO's eastern flank.
One of the officials said up to 5,000 could be deployed, while a NATO diplomat said Washington was considering gradually transferring some troops stationed in western Europe to eastern Europe in the coming weeks.
Denmark, Spain, France and the Netherlands were all planning or considering sending troops, planes or ships to eastern Europe, NATO said. Ukraine shares borders with four NATO countries: Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania.
A Polish official said Warsaw would draw the line at sending troops to Ukraine.
GROWING TENSIONS
As tensions grow, Britain said it was withdrawing some staff and dependents from its embassy in Ukraine, a day after the United States https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-faces-severe-sanctions-if-it-installs-puppet-regime-ukraine-uk-minister-2022-01-23 said it was ordering diplomats' family members to leave. U.S. diplomats are being allowed to leave voluntarily.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov accused the West of ""hysteria"" and putting out information ""laced with lies"".
""As for specific actions, we see statements by the North Atlantic Alliance about reinforcement, pulling forces and resources to the eastern flank. All this leads to the fact that tensions are growing,"" he said.
""This is not happening because of what we, Russia, are doing. This is all happening because of what NATO and the U.S. are doing and due to the information they are spreading."" 
Global stock markets skidded as the prospect of a Russian attack quashed demand for riskier assets such as bitcoin, and bolstered the dollar and oil. The rouble hit a 14-month low against the dollar, and Russian stocks and bonds tumbled.
Russia has used its troop build-up to draw the West into discussions after presenting demands to redraw Europe's security map. It wants https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/why-is-russias-putin-so-focused-ukraine-2021-12-15 NATO never to admit Ukraine and to pull back troops and weapons from former Communist countries in eastern Europe that joined it after the Cold War.
Washington says those demands are non-starters but it is ready to discuss other ideas on arms control, missile deployments and confidence-building measures.
Russia is awaiting a written U.S. response this week after talks last Friday - the fourth round this month - produced no breakthrough. 
'PAINFUL, VIOLENT AND BLOODY' 
Asked whether he thought an invasion was imminent, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told broadcasters that intelligence was ""pretty gloomy on this point"" but that ""sense can still prevail.""
He repeated Western warnings that invading Ukraine would be ""a painful, violent and bloody business"" for Russia.
The United States and the European Union, wary of Russia's intentions since it seized Crimea and backed separatists fighting government forces in eastern Ukraine in 2014, have told Russia it will face crippling penalties if it attacks again.
EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels warned Russia it would face ""massive"" consequences, but are divided over how tough to be on Moscow and did not say what the consequences might be.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told EU President Charles Michel, who was also on the call with Biden, that it was important for Kyiv that the EU showed unity. 
""Ukraine will not fall for provocations, and together with its partners, will remain calm and restrained,"" his office said.

The European Commission, the EU executive body, proposed a 1.2-billion euro ($1.36-billion) financial aid package to help Ukraine mitigate the effects of the conflict.
A Russian delegation source said political advisers from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany would meet in Paris on Wednesday for talks on resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine, in which some 15,000 people have been killed since 2014. Previous efforts have failed to yield any breakthrough.

ST. PAUL, Minn. (Reuters) - Three former Minneapolis officers broke the law by failing to stop Derek Chauvin killing George Floyd during an arrest and were indifferent to the handcuffed Black man's dying pleas, a prosecutor told a jury in opening statements in the federal trial on Monday.
Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane are charged with violating Floyd's civil rights during his arrest on a road outside a Minneapolis grocery store in May 2020, video of which sparked street protests against racism and police brutality around the world.
In opening a trial that hinges on when a police officer has a duty to intervene in a colleague's misconduct, federal prosecutor Samantha Trepel, from the U.S. Department of Justice's civil rights division, said the defendants had broken their oath with a callous indifference to Floyd, 46. 
She said video captured how Kueng at times seemed more preoccupied with some gravel lodged in the tire of the nearby police car than the man beneath him repeatedly saying: ""I can't breathe.""
Their lawyers argued that widely seen cellphone video of Floyd's killing does not capture chaotic and even frightening events leading up to an arrest in a dangerous neighborhood. 
Two of the defendants were rookies only a few days into the job, they noted, while Thao was described by his lawyer as nothing more than a ""human traffic cone"" who made sure onlookers and passing vehicles stayed clear.
Last year, the defendants' former colleague Chauvin https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ex-policeman-derek-chauvin-be-sentenced-george-floyds-murder-2021-06-25, 45, was found guilty of murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death at the end of a nationally televised state trial in April 2021, and a Minnesota judge sentenced him to 22-1/2 years in prison. 
Chauvin, who is white, was also charged alongside his colleagues by federal prosecutors with violating Floyd's civil rights in their capacity as police officers. Chauvin changed his plea to guilty last December. Thao, Kueng and Lane https://www.reuters.com/world/us/after-chauvin-sentencing-charges-remain-police-officers-floyd-case-2021-06-25, who could face years in prison if convicted, have all pleaded not guilty.
""For more than nine minutes, each of the three defendants made a conscious choice over and over again not to act,"" Trepel told the jury. ""They chose not to intervene and stop Chauvin as he killed a man slowly in front of their eyes on a public street in broad daylight.""
She said that the officers had sworn an oath to care for people in their custody, and were required by law to stop Chauvin and give Floyd medical aid. 
Defense lawyers say the three defendants had a duty to arrest Floyd on suspicion he used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes, and were not criminally liable for the conduct of Chauvin, who they deferred to as the most senior officer present.
Earl Gray, a lawyer for Lane, said Floyd was visibly intoxicated when Lane and Kueng first approached him and struggled against being put into the back of their police car.
""He was all muscle,"" Gray said. ""These two rookies simply could not get this fellow in the back seat and were clearly doing something wrong. So what does Chauvin do? He takes over and he grabs the guy and he puts him on the ground.""
Floyd's girlfriend, Courteney Ross, said during a recess that the defendants were shirking responsibility and trying to blame Floyd for his own death.
""I know that when someone is crying out for help, the right thing to do is help them,"" she said.
'DELIBERATE INDIFFERENCE'
Prosecutors are seeking to convince the jury in the U.S. District Court in St. Paul that the men willfully failed to help Floyd during what Trepel called Chauvin's ""slow-motion killing."" The indictment says https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1392451/download a person under arrest has a right to ""be free from a police officer's deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs.""
Thao, 36, and Kueng, 28, face an additional count in the indictment, which says they willfully failed to stop Chauvin using excessive force against Floyd, violating Floyd's right to be free from unreasonable seizure.
Thao had worked for the Minneapolis Police Department for eight years. Lane, 38, and Kueng, who helped restrain Floyd's lower body, had joined only a few months prior, and Chauvin was their field training officer.
Kueng was ""a rookie officer"" on his third shift ever on the job and was let down by his seniors with ""inadequate training,"" his lawyer Thomas Plunkett told the jury. Lane would take the stand in his own defense, his lawyer said.
The jury will hear from other Minneapolis police officers that the defendants were trained in how to administer medical aid to people in their custody, and taught that moving Floyd onto his side could have saved his life, Trepel said.
They will also hear from some of the horrified bystanders who shouted at the officers to check Floyd's pulse, Trepel said.
""After Mr. Floyd lost the ability to speak, the people on the sidewalk stood up for him,"" Trepel told the jury. ""They understood just by seeing his body go limp, listening to his words and then listening to his silence that, unless somebody changed what was happening, he would die."" 

After the federal trial, the three men face a state trial for aiding and abetting Floyd's murder.

(Reuters) - Sheldon Silver, the once-powerful New York State Assembly Speaker who was convicted on corruption charges that resulted in a prison sentence of six and a half years, has died aged 77.
Silver died at a federal prison medical facility while serving out his sentence in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, his former chief of staff Judy Rapfogel told the media.
Silver began serving his sentence in August 2020 despite being in poor health. He had appealed the portions of his 2018 conviction that were upheld in January 2020 by the Manhattan-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
In January last year, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal by Silver of his conviction on the corruption charges.
Silver, a Democrat, was accused of accepting close to $4 million in illegal payments in exchange for taking official actions in two separate schemes.
Prosecutors had said Silver arranged for state grants to go to a cancer researcher who referred mesothelioma patients to his law firm, and supported rent-regulation interests of two real estate developers that sent business to another law firm.
Silver represented Manhattan's Lower East Side, and served as Assembly speaker from 1994 to 2015. Along with former Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican former Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, Silver was one of the ""three men in a room"" with effective power to shape New York legislative priorities.

Former U.S. President Donald Trump had considered granting clemency to Silver, sources told Reuters in January last year.
Silver was originally convicted in 2015 and sentenced to 12 years in prison. The 2nd Circuit voided that conviction in 2017, citing a 2016 Supreme Court decision narrowing the definition of corruption by public officials in a case involving Republican former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell.

DUBAI (Reuters) -Yemen's Houthi movement, aligned with Iran, launched a missile attack at the United Arab Emirates on Monday that targeted a base hosting the U.S. military but was thwarted by U.S.-built Patriot interceptors, U.S. and Emirati officials said.
The attack, which sent U.S. troops into bunkers, was the second in a week on the UAE, the tourism and commercial hub of the Gulf region. On Jan. 17, the Houthis hit a fuel depot in Abu Dhabi, killing three people. 
The Houthis, battling a Saudi-led military coalition that includes the UAE, have said they aim to punish the Gulf state for backing militias that are blocking their attempts to capture oil-producing regions in Yemen.
A Houthi military spokesperson said the group had fired Zulfiqar ballistic missiles at al-Dhafra airbase, used by U.S. forces, and other ""sensitive targets"". He said it had also launched drones towards Dubai.
""We advise foreign companies and investors in the UAE to leave as it has become unsafe,"" he said, adding the group was ready to ""meet escalation with escalation.""
The foreign ministry of the UAE, part of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), called the attack a ""criminal escalation"" and said it had a right to respond. 
The U.S. military said it had fired multiple Patriot missile interceptors at two inbound missiles, and acknowledged simultaneous efforts by UAE's military.
""The combined efforts successfully prevented both missiles from impacting the base,"" said a spokesperson at U.S. Central Command who represents U.S. forces in the Middle East. 
The Emirati ambassador to Washington, Yousef al Otaiba, tweeted that close cooperation with the United States had helped to deflect the attack, and the U.S. State Department reaffirmed Washington's commitment to strengthen the defenses of its Saudi and Emirati partners.
U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price, however, said the Houthi attacks on the UAE and Saudi Arabia, along with Saudi-led coalition airstrikes in Yemen, represented a ""troubling escalation"" in violence, and he called anew for a ceasefire.
Price declined to say if U.S. President Joe Biden's administration would accede to a UAE request to restore the Houthis to a U.S. list of foreign terrorist groups, reimposing financial sanctions on them. Biden said last week the request was under consideration.
But Price noted that the group was striken from the list last February out of concerns the sanctions could result in cuts in humanitarian aid and commerical imports of food and other necessities to Houthi-controlled areas.
""We are taking a look at the appropriate response,"" he said.
The Houthis have repeatedly carried out cross-border missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia, but by targeting the UAE they have raised the stakes of a conflict https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/who-is-fighting-yemens-war-2021-12-07 largely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Air strikes on Yemen, which the Saudi-led coalition says are aimed at crippling Houthi capabilities, killed at least 60 people in Saada province on Friday, and about 20 people in the Houthi-held capital Sanaa on Tuesday.
The U.S. embassy issued a rare security advisory for the UAE, urging its citizens to ""maintain a high level of security awareness.""
RISK CALCULATIONS
""This is absolutely an escalation and changes the regional dynamic,"" said Karen Young, director at the Middle East Institutes' Economics and Energy Programme.
""The safety of the GCC now has risk calculations that approach what we know in other parts of the Middle East,"" she said, citing potential risks to energy pipelines and production facilities as well as civil aviation.
Dubai's main stock index closed down nearly 2%, while Abu Dhabi's ended the day flat. Higher oil prices were providing support to markets, analysts said.
The attacks have rattled https://www.reuters.com/markets/stocks/houthi-attacks-rattle-some-united-arab-emirates-residents-2022-01-24 some Abu Dhabi residents.
""Overall I feel safe but I don’t know how it will escalate,"" said 19-year-old American medical student Tahlia Rivera. 
The UAE published a video of what it said was an F-16 warplane destroying a Houthi missile launcher in Yemen. 
The Houthis on Monday said they had also attacked Saudi Arabia, which reported material damage from remnants of an intercepted missile in a southern industrial area.

On Sunday night, a missile fell in another southern region, injuring https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-led-coalition-says-houthi-missile-fell-industrial-zone-2022-01-23 two foreigners. 
The coalition intervened in March 2015 after the Houthis ousted the government from Sanaa. The group says it is fighting a corrupt system and foreign aggression.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Boris Johnson was fighting to shore up his premiership on Monday after his office said his birthday in 2020 was marked by a gathering in Downing Street, adding fuel to an investigation into government parties during COVID-19 lockdowns.
Johnson, who in 2019 won the biggest Conservative majority in more than 30 years, is facing a raft of accusations that he and his staff partied https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/lockdown-party-allegations-facing-uk-pm-johnson-2022-01-13 during the worst pandemic for a century and a complaint of racist discrimination https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-lawmaker-says-he-will-meet-police-over-government-blackmail-accusations-2022-01-22 in his party. 
The new allegation come just days before an official investigation by Cabinet Office official Sue Gray into the lockdown parties is due to be published later this week. 
 ITV  (LON:ITV) News said up to 30 people attended the June 2020 birthday event, during the first COVID lockdown, in 10 Downing Street, his central London office and residence. Social gatherings indoors were banned at the time.
The prime minister was believed to have been presented with a cake while his wife led staff in a chorus of happy birthday, it said.
Johnson's office disputed that it was a party, telling ITV: ""A group of staff working in No. 10 that day gathered briefly in the Cabinet Room after a meeting to wish the prime minister a happy birthday."" 
""He was there for less than 10 minutes,"" it said.
ITV said there was another gathering in Downing Street the evening before his birthday. Johnson's office said that was ""totally untrue"".
Johnson has given a variety of explanations about the previous allegations of parties: first he said no rules had been broken but then he apologised to the British people for the apparent hypocrisy of such gatherings. 
Police officers who guard Downing Street have been interviewed by Gray and have given ""extremely damning"" evidence, the Telegraph newspaper reported, citing an unidentified source.
""Johnson has completely lost his authority,"" Nick Timothy, who served as Downing Street chief of staff to Johnson's Conservative predecessor Theresa May, wrote in the Telegraph.
""The collapse in Johnson's authority is causing widespread political dysfunction and further danger for the Conservatives,"" he said. ""Johnson is no longer popular, he is no longer powerful.""
Johnson has denied an allegation that he was told a ""bring your own booze"" lockdown gathering on May 20, 2020, which he says he thought was a work event, was inappropriate.
His former senior adviser Dominic Cummings - now a harsh critic - said on Monday he was answering questions from Gray in writing.
DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINT
Toppling Johnson https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/how-uk-pm-johnson-could-be-ousted-by-unhappy-lawmakers-2022-01-19 would leave Britain in limbo for months just as the West deals with the Ukraine crisis and the world's fifth largest economy grapples with a once-in-a-generation inflationary wave. 
To trigger a leadership challenge https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/first-rebellion-against-johnson-was-doomed-next-may-not-be-2022-01-21, 54 of the 359 Conservative MPs in parliament must submit letters of no confidence.
Leading rivals within the Conservative Party include Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak, 41, and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, 46.
Johnson on Monday ordered an inquiry into allegations by a lawmaker who said she was fired from a ministerial job in the government partly because her Muslim faith was making colleagues uncomfortable.
Nusrat Ghani, 49, who lost her job as a junior transport minister in February 2020, told the Sunday Times that she had been told by a ""whip"" - an enforcer of parliamentary discipline - that her ""Muslimness"" had been raised as an issue in her sacking.
The government's chief whip, Mark Spencer, said he was the person at the centre of Ghani's allegations. He said they were completely false and defamatory.
""I have never used those words attributed to me,"" he said.
Johnson met Ghani to discuss the ""extremely serious"" allegations in July 2020, a spokesperson from the prime minister's office said on Sunday.
Downing Street said that when the allegations were first made, Johnson recommended she make a formal complaint to the Conservative Campaign Headquarters. 

""She did not take up this offer,"" Downing Street said. 
Ghani's allegation came after one of her Conservative colleagues said he would meet police to discuss accusations that government whips had attempted to ""blackmail"" lawmakers suspected of trying to force Johnson from office.

PLANO, Texas (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday said she will rule within the next two days on whether Stewart Rhodes, founder of the far-right Oath Keepers, should remain in custody while he awaits trial on seditious conspiracy https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-built-textbook-case-sedition-charges-capitol-attack-legal-experts-2022-01-14 charges for his alleged role in the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.
During a two-hour court hearing in Plano, Texas, federal prosecutors urged U.S. Magistrate Judge Kimberly Priest Johnson to keep Rhodes behind bars, saying he is dangerous and could try to flee the country.
""He is charged with organizing a plot to forcibly oppose the peaceful transfer of power,"" said Justice Department lawyer Kathryn Rakoczy. ""It is hard to imagine a greater risk to society.""
Phillip Linder, a lawyer for Rhodes, said his client maintains his innocence and does not pose a danger.
""He not only wants a public trial, he wants a speedy public trial,"" Linder said.
The judge said she would consider the evidence and issue a written ruling.
An indictment made public earlier this month accused Rhodes and 10 associates or members of the group of plotting to storm the Capitol by force in a failed bid to block Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.
Rhodes, 56, is the most high-profile defendant of more than 725 charged so far for taking part in the attack on the Capitol by former President Donald Trump's supporters. The riot was fueled by Trump's false claims that his election defeat was the result of fraud.
Rhodes and his associates are the first people charged with seditious conspiracy for their alleged roles in the attack. That seldom-used charge can carry a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.
Prosecutors said that Rhodes told his supporters beginning in November 2020 to prepare to ""oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power https://www.reuters.com/world/us/a-bloody-desperate-fight-us-prosecutors-release-oath-keepers-communications-2022-01-13.""
""We aren't getting through this without a civil war,"" he said in a message two days after the election. ""Too late for that. Prepare your mind body, spirit.""
In another high-profile Jan. 6 prosecution, a judge in Washington on Monday sentenced right-wing activist Brandon Straka to three years of probation and three months of home detention.

Straka recorded video of himself during the Jan. 6 attack encouraging others to take a riot shield from a police officer and push their way into the Capitol building.
U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich said while Straka, who at one point had about 500,000 followers on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), did not assault anyone, he ""clearly violated the law"" and made statements showing that suggested the actions of the crowd were ""appropriate and justified.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -A Mexican reporter who told the president three years ago that she feared for her life was shot dead on Sunday, the second journalist killed in the same area in a week and underscoring the country's status as one of the deadliest for journalists outside a war zone.
Lourdes Maldonado, a local journalist with decades of experience, was shot dead in her car in the Santa Fe neighborhood of the bustling border city of Tijuana, just south of San Diego, California, the attorney general's office of Baja California state said in a statement.
Asked at his regular morning news conference about the latest journalist slaying, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledged a full investigation.
""What happened is very regrettable,"" said Lopez Obrador, adding that investigators still had to determine a motive and evaluate any possible links to a labor dispute Maldonado was involved in.
Maldonado appeared at Lopez Obrador's morning news conference in 2019, pleading for help because she feared for her life.
A source with knowledge of the case said Maldonado had been registered in the state's protection program for journalists, which included some police surveillance of her home. 

From 2000 to 2021, human rights group Article 19 has registered 145 killings of journalists in Mexico, with seven deaths last year.
The killing of Maldonado occurred less than a week after officials reported that Mexican photojournalist Margarito Martinez, 49, died after being shot in the head outside his home in Tijuana. Maldonado was the third journalist killed this year in Mexico.

DUBAI/PARIS (Reuters) - Iran is ready to consider direct talks with the United States if it feels it can get a good deal with guarantees, its foreign minister said on Monday, adding no decision had yet been made. 
Indirect talks between Iran and the United States on reviving the 2015 nuclear deal resumed almost two months ago.
Western diplomats have indicated they were hoping to have a breakthrough over the next few weeks, but sharp differences remain. Iran has rejected any deadline imposed by Western powers.
Iran refuses to directly meet U.S. officials, meaning other parties - Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia - must shuttle between the two sides.
""Reports saying that Iran and the U.S. are directly negotiating with one another are untrue,"" Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian told a news conference in Tehran. ""However, if we get to a stage where reaching a good deal with strong guarantees necessitates direct talks with the U.S., we will consider it.""
Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei last year banned Iranian officials from holding talks with Washington.
A Western diplomatic source said Iran's negotiating team had brought up the subject of direct talks during a recent return to Tehran for consultations.
The source said it was unclear whether Khamenei had given his green light yet, but negotiators felt direct contact would ease negotiations at this stage.
""We've heard nothing to that effect. We'd welcome it,"" the United States' Iran envoy Robert Malley told Reuters.
Iran earlier on Monday ruled out any U.S. preconditions for reviving a 2015 nuclear deal, including the release of American prisoners held by the Islamic Republic.
Malley said on Sunday the U.S. was unlikely to strike an agreement with Iran unless Tehran released four U.S. citizens Washington says it is holding hostage.
""Iran has never accepted any preconditions ... The U.S. official's comments on the release of U.S. prisoners in Iran is for domestic use,"" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said Monday.

Iran has been in talks with world powers since April to reinstate the deal. In 2018, then-U.S. President Donald Trump ditched the agreement and re-imposed sanctions on Tehran, prompting Iran to gradually breach limits of the deal on its nuclear programme. 
But after eight rounds of talks, the thorniest points remain the speed and scope of lifting sanctions on Tehran, including Iran’s demand for a U.S. guarantee of no further punitive steps, and how and when to restore curbs on Iran’s atomic work.

Prosecutors say Avenatti, who has pleaded not guilty, embezzled book contract proceeds intended for Daniels, in part by forging her signature in a letter to an agent. 
""This is a case about a lawyer who stole from his client. A lawyer who lied to cover up the scheme,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Rohrbach said in his opening statement. ""The defendant stole almost $300,000 from the person he was supposed to be looking out for."" 
Avenatti, 50, said in a statement over the weekend that he was ""completely innocent of these charges."" Avenatti became a cable TV fixture when he represented Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, in cases against Trump. 
Daniels said she had a sexual liaison with Trump and received $130,000 before the 2016 presidential election in exchange for not discussing her encounter with Trump, who denies it happened. Avenatti represented her in a lawsuit seeking to invalidate the nondisclosure agreement, which Daniels won, and a defamation case against Trump, which she lost. 
Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney who made the so-called hush money payment to Daniels, was present in the courtroom on Monday.
Rohrbach said Daniels paid Avenatti $100 to represent her in cases against Trump, and authorized him to raise further funds from the public to pay his expenses. But he said there was no agreement for Avenatti to receive payments under Daniels' contract to publish her memoir, titled ""Full Disclosure."" 
Defense attorney Andrew Dalack countered that Avenatti was entitled to a ""reasonable percentage"" of the proceeds from Daniels' book and was authorized to accept payments on her behalf. The dispute, Dalack said, ""has no business in federal criminal court."" 
""What we have in this case is a disagreement, a fee dispute between an attorney and his disgruntled former client,"" Dalack said in his opening statement. 
Avenatti faces up to 22 years in prison if convicted of wire fraud and identity theft.
The trial in Manhattan federal court is the latest in a slew of legal troubles that have cost Avenatti his legal career https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-crime-avenatti/michael-avenatti-faces-the-trial-of-his-life-his-own-idUSKBN1ZP0LI, which ended abruptly in 2019 when prosecutors in New York and California brought dozens of criminal charges that could land him in prison for the rest of his life. 
Avenatti is appealing a February 2020 conviction and 2-1/2-year prison sentence https://www.reuters.com/world/us/michael-avenatti-gets-2-12-years-prison-nike-extortion-scheme-2021-07-08 for trying to extort up to $25 million from  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) by threatening to expose its alleged corrupt payments to families of college basketball prospects unless it hired him to conduct a probe.
Nike denied wrongdoing.

Avenatti is separately facing federal wire fraud charges in California from prosecutors who say he embezzled nearly $10 million from five clients.
Since his March 2019 arrest in the Nike case, Avenatti has spent most of his time confined at a friend's California home.

LONDON (Reuters) -WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on Monday was given the chance to challenge at Britain's highest court a decision allowing him to be extradited to the United States to face 18 criminal charges including breaking a spying law.
U.S. authorities want Australian-born Assange, 50, currently in jail in London as he awaits a ruling on his extradition, to face trial on 18 counts relating to WikiLeaks’ release of vast troves of confidential U.S. military records and diplomatic cables which they said had put lives in danger.
In December, the High Court in London overturned a lower court's ruling that he should not be extradited because his mental health problems meant he would be at risk of suicide. 
While High Court judges refused him permission for a direct appeal to the Supreme Court on their decision, they said his case raised an issue of legal importance that he could ask the United Kingdom's top court to rule on.
This means the Supreme Court will have to decide whether or not it should hear his challenge. 
""The respondent's application to certify a point of law is granted,"" the judges said in their pronouncement.
They said the issue of whether the High Court could rely on U.S. assurances about Assange's treatment, which had not been given in the initial proceedings, was a subject on which his legal team could seek clarification. 
""Whether or not the issue needs ventilation in that court is a matter appropriately for its decision. We would respectfully invite the Registrar of the Supreme Court to take steps to expedite consideration of any application for leave to appeal which follows.""
Assange has 14 days to make an application to the court. 
WikiLeaks came to prominence when it began to publish thousands of secret classified files and diplomatic cables in 2010. 
Soon afterwards, Sweden sought Assange's extradition from Britain over allegations of sex crimes. When he lost that case against extradition in 2012, he fled to the Ecuadorean Embassy in London.
After relations with Ecuador soured, Assange was dragged out by British police in April 2019 and jailed for breaching British bail conditions, although the Swedish case against him had already been dropped.
U.S. authorities then sought his extradition, but although a junior judge rejected Assange's arguments that the case was political and an assault on freedom of speech, she said he should not be sent to the United States because there was a real risk he would commit suicide.

""Make no mistake, we won today in court,"" said Assange's partner, Stella Moris, with whom he had two children while in the Ecuadorean embassy. ""Our fight goes on, and we will fight this until Julian is free.""
Even if the Supreme Court decides not to hear his appeal, the legal battle is far from over. The extradition must be approved by the home secretary (interior minister), whose decision can also be subject to legal challenge.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to consider limiting the scope of a landmark federal environmental law as it took up for the second time an Idaho couple's bid to build on property the federal government has deemed a protected wetland.
The justices will hear an appeal by Chantell Sackett and her husband Mike Sackett, who own property in Priest Lake, Idaho where they hoped to build a home, of a lower court ruling favoring the government. 
The court will consider what test courts should use to determine what constitutes ""waters of the United States"" under the landmark 1972 Clean Water Act, the answer to which determines whether the property is subject to regulation, requiring owners to obtain permits in order to carry out construction.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2007 determined that the Sacketts' land was part of a wetland and that they were required to obtain a permit under the Clean Water Act before beginning construction, which they had failed to do.
""The Sacketts' ordeal is emblematic of all that has gone wrong with the implementation of the Clean Water Act,"" said Damien Schiff, a lawyer at the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation, which represents the Sacketts.
There has been lengthy litigation and political debates over how much of a connection with a waterway a property must have in order to require a permit, with the Supreme Court issuing a ruling in 2006 that led to further uncertainty. 
Four justices at that time said the law governed land with a ""continuous surface connection"" to a waterway while Justice Anthony Kennedy, who cast the deciding vote in the 5-4 case and has since retired, said the law extended further to areas that had a ""significant nexus"" to a waterway. 
The new case gives the justices an opportunity to embrace the more stringent test proposed by the four justices, which business groups favor. Lower courts have found that Kennedy's test controls because he was the key vote.
The last three presidential administrations have sought to clarify the issue through regulations. Democrat Barack Obama embraced broader federal reach, while his Republican successor Donald Trump took the opposite approach. Democratic President Joe President Biden's administration is currently working on a new regulation.
The Sacketts' case reached the Supreme Court once before, with the justices ruling unanimously in 2012 that the couple could challenge in court an EPA compliance order imposing financial penalties until they restore the affected land. The area was filled in with gravel and sand after they purchased the property in 2004. 
The litigation continued since then even as the regulations evolved. The EPA has since dropped its compliance order for the Sacketts but still has sought to require a permit.

The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year ruled against the Sacketts, finding that the EPA had ""reasonably determined"" that the property was subject to Clean Water Act regulation based on Kennedy's ""significant nexus"" test. The Sacketts' lawyers then appealed the case to the Supreme Court.
The justices are expected to hear the case in their next term, which begins in October and ends in June 2023.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Sunday for the first time conferred the lay Roman Catholic ministries of lector and catechist on women, roles that previously many had carried out without institutional recognition.
He conferred the ministries at a Mass in St. Peter's Basilica, where, in an apparent reference to resistance to change by some conservative, he criticised those who need to have rigid regulations and ""more rules"" in order to find God.
Last year, Francis changed Church law on the ministries of lector and acolyte, which mainly had been reserved to seminarians preparing for priesthood, saying he wanted to bring stability and public recognition to women already serving in the roles.
Lectors read from scripture, acolytes serve at Mass, and catechists teach the faith to children and adult converts.
The ministries of lector and acolyte existed before but were officially reserved to men. Francis instituted the ministry of the catechist last year.
At Sunday's Mass the pope installed six women and two men as lectors and three women and five men as catechists. Francis gave a bible to each lector and a crucifix to each catechist.
The formalisation, including a conferral ceremony, will make it more difficult for conservative bishops to block women in their dioceses from taking on those roles.
The change will be particularly important as a recognition for women in places such as the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), where some are the de facto religious leaders of remote communities hit by a severe shortage of priests.
The Vatican stressed that the roles are not a precursor to women one day being allowed to become priests. The Catholic Church teaches that only men can be priests because Jesus chose only men as his apostles.

Supporters of a female priesthood say Jesus was conforming to the customs of his times and that women played a greater role in the early Church than is commonly recognised.
Francis has appointed a number of women to senior jobs in Vatican departments previously held by men.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Union called on Russia on Monday to defuse tensions over Ukraine and reaffirmed that Moscow would face ""massive"" consequences if it attacked its neighbour.
The EU's 27 foreign ministers, meeting in Brussels, said the bloc ""condemns Russia's continued aggressive actions and threats against Ukraine and calls on Russia to de-escalate."" 
""Notions of 'sphere of influence' have no place in the 21st century ... any further military aggression by Russia over Ukraine will have massive consequences and severe costs,"" they said in a statement, giving no details of the ""consequences"".
Russia has massed tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine's borders. It denies planning an invasion but NATO https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/nato-sends-ships-jets-eastern-europe-ukraine-crisis-2022-01-24 said it was putting forces on standby and reinforcing eastern Europe -- moves that Moscow described as ""hysteria"".
Denmark said the EU would be ready to impose ""never-seen-before"" economic sanctions on Russia. 
The European Commission, the EU executive body, proposed a 1.2-billion euro ($1.36-billion) financial aid package for Ukraine [L8N2U42SZ], but there are differences among EU member states about how hard to be on Russia.
Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis suggested Russia wanted to ""splinter the West"" and that the EU could not afford to be divided.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has urged Europe and the United States to think carefully when considering sanctions and some European politicians, and Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg underlined the EU's heavy dependency on Russian gas.. 
TALKS WITH BLINKEN 
Asked about potential sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany, which is yet to win regulatory approval, Schallenberg said sanctioning something that is not yet operative was not a credible threat.
Another potential sanction would be cutting Russia off from the SWIFT global messaging system, but German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said wielding the ""hardest stick"" may not always be the best way to deal with such a situation.
The EU has been largely sidelined by direct Russia-U.S. talks, but the foreign ministers began talks with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken remotely on Monday.
""Russia should know, (President Vladimir) Putin should know that the price of using provocations and military forces to change borders in Europe will be very, very high... We are ready to undertake the most severe sanctions, also more severe than in 2014,"" Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod told reporters.
He declined to say what sectors would be targeted.
The EU, along with the United States, imposed economic sanctions on Moscow targeting its energy, banking and defence sectors after Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014. 

For now, the EU does not plan to withdraw diplomats' families from Ukraine, its foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said after Washington announced such a move.

(Reuters) - Families have stopped children playing outside as Tonga struggles to deal with ash and the psychological fallout of last week's volcanic eruption and tsunami, aid workers and residents said.
Communication with the outside world remained difficult on Sunday, with few internet services, and outlying islands still cut off from the phone service.
The Red Cross said it was providing not only tents, food, water and toilets to 173 households on Tonga's main island, but also comfort. 
""Everyone is still struggling right now,"" said Drew Havea, the vice president of Tonga Red Cross. Because of the ash, ""families are making sure their kids are not playing outside, that they are all indoors"", he said.
Although some residents from the worst affected outlying islands in Ha'apai had been evacuated to the main island Tongatapu, others were refusing to leave, Havea said. 
The psychological impact of waves rushing through and destroying villages will affect their lives for some time, he said.
There was another worry shared by many in Tonga, he said. 
""Every kid grew up, in your geography lesson you were taught this is the Ring of Fire where we are all living. Now I think that we are quite concerned and start thinking, 'How active are these places?"" he told Reuters.
The eruption of Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai volcano, which sits on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, sent tsunami waves across the Pacific Ocean and was heard some 2,300 kms (1,430 miles) away in New Zealand.
The eruption was so powerful that space satellites captured not only huge clouds of ash but also an atmospheric shockwave that radiated out from the volcano at close to the speed of sound.
'PULSATING, TERRIFYING'
""I thought the world was coming to an end,"" recalled John Tukuafu, owner of the Vakaloa beach resort, who had to rush to rescue his wife from the tsunami. The resort was in Kanokupolu, one of the worst hit areas on Tongatapu, and uprooted trees and debris now lie in the area where the resort stood. 
""I think the whole island, we are in shock,"" Mary Lyn Fonua, the managing editor of news website Matangi Tonga Online, told Reuters on Sunday.
It had taken a week for many people to recover from the ""pulsating, terrifying"" sound of the eruption, she said. 
""It was too loud to hear but I could feel it. The house was vibrating, windows were vibrating and it became more and more intense until the big bang,"" she told Reuters by telephone on Sunday.
Residents were wishing for tropical rain to wash off the ""awful and itchy"" volcanic dust, said Fonua. Leaves on trees had turned brown and were falling off.
Fonua said she was in her seafront office talking on the phone to her son in New Zealand when the tsunami struck. 
When the line went dead, he feared she had been swept away. The anxiety of many Tongan families overseas was prolonged in the days it took for limited international call capacity to be restored.
Cut off from the world, Tongans got on with immediate rescue efforts, Fonua said.
Older Tongans with a tradition of self-reliance remarked that young people had been forced to stop looking at their smart phones and had leapt into action, she said.
With power restored after a week, the Matangi Tonga website posted its first story on Saturday since the eruption and tsunami, describing the ""pumice rain"", as volcanic debris fell from the sky, and waves that engulfed cars.

Still, her office cannot send email and Tonga needs more satellite capacity, Fonua said.
The international navy ships and flights arriving had brought much needed supplies and communication equipment, she said.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Former Pope Benedict XVI acknowledged on Monday he had been at a 1980 meeting over a sexual abuse case when archbishop of Munich, saying he mistakenly told German investigators he was not there.
A report released last week on abuse in the archdiocese from 1945 to 2019 said then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ex-pope-benedict-criticised-munich-church-abuse-report-2022-01-20 failed to take action against clerics in four cases of alleged abuse when he was its archbishop between 1977-1982.
At Thursday's news conference in Munich, lawyers who investigated the abuse contested an assertion by Benedict in an 82-page statement that he did not recall attending a meeting in 1980 to discuss the case of an abuser priest.
They said this contradicted documents in their possession.
In a statement on Monday, the former pope's personal secretary, Archbishop Georg Ganswein, said Benedict did attend the meeting but the omission ""was the result of an oversight in the editing of the statement"" and ""not done out of bad faith.""
Ganswein said no decision was made at the 1980 meeting about a new assignment for the priest but only a request to provide him with accommodation during therapeutic treatment.
""He (the former pope) is very sorry for this mistake and asks to be excused,"" Ganswein said.
'SHAME AND PAIN'
He said Benedict planned to explain how the error happened after he finishes examining the nearly 2,000-page report, sent electronically last Thursday.
Benedict, 94, infirm and living in the Vatican, resigned the papacy in 2013.
""He is carefully reading the statements set down there, which fill him with shame and pain about the suffering inflicted on the victims,"" Ganswein said. A complete review ""will take some time due to his age and health,"" he added.
Presenting the report last Thursday, lawyer Martin Pusch said Ratzinger had done nothing against the abuse in four cases and there appeared to be no interest shown to injured parties. 
""In a total of four cases, we have come to the conclusion that the then Archbishop Cardinal Ratzinger can be accused of misconduct in cases of sexual abuse,"" said Pusch. 

""He still claims ignorance even if, in our opinion, that is difficult to reconcile with the documentation.""
Conservatives have defended the former pope but victims groups and experts said the findings of the German report had tarnished the legacy https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/conservatives-defend-ex-pope-after-report-experts-see-legacy-dented-2022-01-21 of one of Catholicism's most renowned theologians.

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Two U.S. aircraft carrier groups have entered the disputed South China Sea for training, the Department of Defense said on Monday as Taiwan reported a new Chinese air force incursion at the top of the waterway including a fearsome new electronic warfare jet.
The South China Sea and self-governing Taiwan are two of China's most sensitive territorial issues and both are frequent areas of tension between the United States and China. 
U.S. Navy ships routinely sail https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-says-warned-away-us-warship-south-china-sea-2022-01-20 close to Chinese-occupied islands in the South China Sea to challenge Chinese sovereignty claims, as well as through the Taiwan Strait, to Beijing's anger.
The U.S. Department of Defense said the two U.S. Navy Carrier Strike Groups, led by their flagships USS Carl Vinson and USS Abraham Lincoln, had begun operations in the South China Sea on Sunday. 
The carrier groups will carry out exercises including anti-submarine warfare operations, air warfare operations and maritime interdiction operations to strengthen combat readiness, it said in a statement.
The training will be conducted in accordance with international law in international waters, the Department of Defense added, without giving details.
""Operations like these allow us to improve our combat credible capability, reassure our allies and partners, and demonstrate our resolve as a Navy to ensure regional stability and counter malign influence,"" it quoted Rear Admiral J.T. Anderson, commander of the strike group led by the USS Abraham Lincoln, as saying.
Both carrier groups were reported on Sunday by the U.S. Navy to have been exercising with Japan's navy in the Philippine Sea, an area that includes waters to the east of Taiwan.
The news of the U.S. operations coincides with Taiwan reporting https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/taiwan-reports-new-large-scale-chinese-air-force-incursion-2022-01-23 the latest mass incursion by China's air force into its air defence identification zone - 39 aircraft - in an area close to the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands in the northern reaches of the South China Sea.
Taiwan on Monday reported a further 13 Chinese aircraft in the zone, with one, an anti-submarine Y-8, flying through the Bashi Channel which separates Taiwan from the Philippines and connects the Pacific to the South China Sea, according to a map provided by Taiwan's Defence Ministry.
The ministry added that two Chinese J-16Ds took part in the mission, though kept close to China's coast, a new electronic attack version of the J-16 fighter designed to target anti-aircraft defences of the sort Taiwan would rely on to fend off an attack. 
China has yet to comment, but has previously said such missions are aimed at protecting its sovereignty and to prevent external interference in its sovereignty claims over democratically-governed Taiwan.
Security sources have previously told Reuters that China's flights into Taiwan's defence zone are also likely a response to foreign military activity, especially by U.S. forces, near the island, to warn that Beijing is watching and has the capability to handle any Taiwan contingencies.

Taiwan calls China's repeated nearby military activities ""grey zone"" warfare, designed to both wear out Taiwan's forces by making them repeatedly scramble, and also to test Taiwan's responses. 
The South China Sea, crossed by vital shipping lanes and also containing gas fields and rich fishing grounds, is also claimed by Taiwan, while Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines claim parts.

18,"<span>Jan 24, 2022 05:00AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING (Reuters) -Organisers of next month's Beijing Winter Olympics slightly eased the strict COVID-19 requirements for participants, a move that means fewer athletes are likely to be tripped up by positive tests, although authorities also warned about seasonal air pollution. 
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced the changes on Monday, which included easing the threshold for being designated positive for COVID-19 from PCR tests and reducing to seven days from 14 days the period for which a person is deemed a close contact.
The changes, which take effect immediately and apply retrospectively, ""have been developed in order to further adapt to the reality of the current environment and support the Games participants"", the IOC said in a statement.
The slight relaxing of rules for Games participants comes despite China's scramble to contain local flare-ups of COVID-19, including in Beijing, with four more Chinese provinces finding infections linked to the Beijing cluster amid the Lunar New Year travel season.
Organisers also began reporting data on positive COVID-19 tests among Games-related personnel, with 177 confirmed cases found among 3,115 international arrivals from Jan. 4 to Jan. 23, just one of which was among an athlete or support staffer, according to Beijing 2022 data released Sunday and Monday.
China's strict COVID-19 protocols have led some team officials to express fear of athletes, including those who have recovered from coronavirus, being blocked from participating.
The changes mean that now only participants whose PCR results show a Cycle Threshold (CT) of less than 35 will be considered positive. Previously, the more sensitive CT of 40 was the threshold for designating those positive, the Games' medical chief, Brian McCloskey, said on Sunday.
The Games are set to take place from Feb. 4 to Feb. 20 inside a ""closed loop"" bubble separating all personnel from the public amid what is effectively a zero-tolerance COVID-19 policy in China that has led it to all but shut its border to international arrivals.
Final preparations are taking place amid the global surge in the highly infectious Omicron coronavirus variant. Organisers said last week that tickets would not be sold to the public.
SMOG WARNING
Meanwhile, the Chinese capital's notorious smog, which has drastically improved in recent years, emerged as a potential Games irritant on Monday when China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment warned that winter weather was ""very unfavourable"" for efforts to keep the air clean.
Beijing has been enveloped for days in thick smog, with concentrations of hazardous airborne particles known as PM2.5 at 205 micrograms per cubic metre on Monday morning. The World Health Organization recommends levels of no more than 5. 
Since China won the bid for the Winter Olympics in 2015, authorities have raised vehicle fuel standards, shut polluting firms and cut coal consumption in a bid to make the Games ""green"".

Authorities will take action against polluters in Beijing and neighbouring Hebei province if there are warnings of heavy pollution during the Olympics to ensure that they will be held in a ""good environment"", environment ministry spokesman Liu Youbin said on Monday.
In addition to COVID-19 and pollution, preparations for the Games have been clouded by a diplomatic boycott by countries including the United States over China's human rights record. China says that betrays Olympic principles and denies rights abuses.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong has told some civil servants to work from home from Tuesday, and some banks have given similar instructions to staff following a spate of COVID-19 infections in the Asian financial hub a week before the busy Lunar New Year holiday.
Health authorities said there were 109 new cases on Monday, out of which 98 were locally transmitted and five were untraceable. Daily cases hit an 18-month high of 140 on Sunday, fuelled by an outbreak in a congested public housing estate.
Responding to the latest covid scare, the government said in a statement on Monday that some employees would ""work from home as much as possible"" and warned that individual departments might have to cut back temporarily on some public services. 
With the Lunar New Year holiday looming, Hong Kong has locked down thousands of people in the Kwai Chung estate for five days. About 35,000 face some curbs and must have daily tests, leader Carrie Lam said over the weekend after a visit. 
The situation is testing Hong Kong's ""zero-COVID"" strategy to eliminate the disease, with schools and gyms already shut, restaurants closing at 6 p.m. and many major air links severed or disrupted. There was only a ""slim chance"" that city-wide restrictions could be lifted on Feb. 4 as had been planned, Lam has said. 
Last week authorities stirred outrage with an order to cull more than 2,000 hamsters in dozens of pet shops, after tracing an outbreak to a worker in a shop where 11 hamsters tested positive. 
EMERGENCY MEASURES 
Some companies have begun to enact contingency measures as the transmissions ripple across the city into hospitals, schools and government offices. 
Standard Chartered said in a statement on Monday that it encouraged all Hong Kong colleagues to work from home, when possible, with staff in critical functions to split teams. Its branch in the covid-hit Kwai Chung area was temporarily closed. 

The move follows UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG)'s decision to shift to work-from-home operations for all except a minimum number of staff who have essential tasks to be completed in the office, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.Just over 70% of Hong Kong's 7.5 million population have been double vaccinated, a far smaller percentage than in similar cities like Singapore, which has 90% vaccinated.
And with the majority of elderly remaining unvaccinated, authorities in Hong Kong are especially cautious of spiraling Omicron transmissions.

Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, has complained for more than a year of repeated missions by China's air force near the democratically governed island, often in the southwestern part of its air defence identification zone, or ADIZ, close to the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands.
Taiwan calls China's repeated nearby military activities ""grey zone"" warfare, designed to both wear out Taiwan's forces by making them repeatedly scramble, and also to test Taiwan's responses.
The latest Chinese mission included 34 fighters plus four electronic warfare aircraft and a single bomber, the Taiwan ministry said.
The aircraft flew in an area to the northeast of the Pratas, according to a map the ministry provided.
Taiwan sent combat aircraft to warn away the Chinese aircraft, while missile systems were deployed to monitor them, the ministry said.
There was no immediate comment from China, which has in the past said such moves were drills aimed at protecting the country's sovereignty.
While it was not clear what might have prompted China to carry out such a large-scale mission, U.S. and Japanese naval forces have been carrying out exercises in the Philippine Sea, a vast area that includes waters to the east of Taiwan.
The U.S. Pacific Fleet said on Sunday those exercises included two carrier strike groups who were ""conducting training to preserve and protect a free and open Indo Pacific"".
China has stepped up pressure on Taiwan to accept its sovereignty claims. Taiwan's government says it wants peace but will defend itself if attacked.
Taiwan reported 148 Chinese air force planes in the southern and southwestern part of its air defence zone over a four-day period beginning on Oct. 1, the same day China marked a key patriotic holiday, National Day.

Taiwan has reported almost daily Chinese air force forays into the same air space since then, but the number of planes on Sunday was the largest on a single day since the October incursions.
No shots have been fired and the Chinese aircraft have not been flying in Taiwan's air space, but in its ADIZ, a broader area Taiwan monitors and patrols that acts to give it more time to respond to any threats.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -A little-known Chinese technology company that took over a WeChat social media account set up for Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Monday it wanted to buy an account with a large fanbase in Australia, and was unaware it was his.
Australian politicians said Morrison's office lost access to the account on the platform, owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd, several months ago. The politicians claimed the move represented censorship amid growing diplomatic tensions https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/australia-says-chinas-alarming-actions-odds-with-peaceful-rhetoric-2021-11-26 between Canberra and Beijing with a national election to be held in Australia by May.
The account, which bore Morrison's photograph and posted information on his policies in Mandarin targeted at Australian voters of Chinese ethnic origin, had 76,000 followers.
The account was renamed 'Australia China New Life' in January by its new Chinese owner, Fuzhou 985 Technology, based in Fujian province, which notified followers the account would instead promote Chinese life in Australia.
An employee from Fuzhou 985 Technology, who only gave his surname as Huang, told Reuters by telephone was not aware the account was previously connected to Morrison. He said the transfer of ownership was conducted with a Chinese male national living in Fuzhou, whose identity he declined to disclose.
""We thought this account had a large fanbase, so we decided to buy it,"" said Huang, adding that the company was looking for an account whose target audience was the Chinese community in Australia. He declined to say how much his company had paid to take over the account. 
Australia's two major political parties have used the Chinese social media platform to communicate with Australian voters of Chinese ethnicity in tightly fought electorates since 2019. The ruling Liberal Party would have aimed to use the Morrison account to promote its policies during the Chinese New Year celebrations starting Feb. 1. 
Both the Liberals and the main opposition Labor Party set up WeChat accounts for their leaders through outsourced agencies. The Scott Morrison account was registered in 2019 using the name of a Chinese citizen in mainland China as its account operator, WeChat records show and a government source confirmed.
The agency handling Morrison's social media account lost access to it last July, and emailed WeChat on Jan. 10 saying it acted on behalf of the Prime Minister, and requesting the account be returned, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. They declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
No response was given by Tencent, the sources confirmed.
In a statement on Monday, Tencent said, ""This appears to be a dispute over account ownership - the account in question was originally registered by a PRC (Chinese) individual and was subsequently transferred to its current operator, a technology services company."" 
Tencent added the dispute would be handled ""in accordance with our platform rules"", and it would look into the matter further.
In Beijing, China's foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular press conference on Monday that, ""The issue of Australian politicians' WeChat accounts is between them and WeChat.""
Meanwhile Liberal Senator James Paterson, Chair of Parliament's Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, told media the incident was an example of ""censorship"" and ""foreign interference"".
""There's 1.2 million Australians of Chinese descent who overwhelmingly use this service and now can no longer access news and information from their Prime Minister,"" he said on Australian radio on Monday. 
Fergus Ryan, senior analyst with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said having the Prime Minister's WeChat account registered under the name of a Chinese citizen was ""always risky and ill-advised"", and appeared to be a breach of WeChat rules.

At Fuzhou 985 Technology, Huang said the company planned to delete the contents of the account, but would wait.
""Originally we wanted to delete [Morrison's previous posts], now we are faced with this situation, we can only wait for Tencent's final reply,"" he said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's COVID-19 infections, led by the Omicron variant, may see a sharp rise in the coming weeks, some top experts said, noting that the variant was already in community transmission and hospitals were seeing more patients despite a decline in cases in major cities. 
India reported 306,064 new infections over the last 24 hours, the health ministry said, about an 8% decline from the average daily cases reported in the last four days. Deaths were 439, the lowest in five days.
But weekly positivity rates have risen to 17.03% in the week to Jan. 24, from about 0.63% Dec. 27, led by the highly-transmissible Omicron variant. 
""Omicron is now in community transmission in India and has become dominant in multiple metros,"" a report by the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) said on Jan. 10 in a report released on Sunday.
Most cases of the Omicron variant have been mild, the advisory group said, although hospitalisations and cases in intensive care were increasing.
In last two weeks major cities such as the capital, Delhi, and financial hub Mumbai in the wealthiest state of Maharashtra, have been reporting big falls in cases after hitting peaks.
That might change, said Dr. Subhash Salunke, a member of the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research and the national taskforce on COVID, as the variant is spreading to semi-urban and rural areas. The state expects to see multiple peaks in the next eight to 10 weeks, said Salunke, who previously advised the Maharashtra government. 

""The number of cases in cities like Mumbai and Pune are the tip of the iceberg,"" Salunke told Reuters, adding that the deadly Delta variant from the previous wave was also circulating.
India's tally of overall infections reached 39.54 million, the second-highest globally behind the United States. The country has seen 489,848 people die of the virus.

WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) -The U.S. State Department announced Sunday it was ordering diplomats' family members to leave Ukraine, as U.S. President Joe Biden weighed options for boosting America's military assets in Eastern Europe to counter a buildup of Russian troops.
The order, which also allowed U.S. diplomats stationed at the embassy in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv to leave voluntarily, was one of the clearest signs yet that American officials are bracing for an aggressive Russian move in the region.
""Military action by Russia could come at any time,"" the U.S. Embassy said https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-orders-departure-ukraine-embassy-staff-family-members-2022-01-23 in a statement. Officials ""will not be in a position to evacuate American citizens in such a contingency, so U.S. citizens currently present in Ukraine should plan accordingly,"" it added.
Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement that it considered the move as ""premature and a manifestation of excessive caution.""
""In fact, there have been no cardinal changes in the security situation recently: the threat of new waves of Russian aggression has remained constant since 2014 and the buildup of Russian troops near the state border began in April last year,"" it said.
Tensions in Ukraine have been increasing for months after the Kremlin massed some 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders, a dramatic buildup the West says is preparation for a war to prevent Ukraine from ever joining the NATO Western security alliance.
The Kremlin has repeatedly denied planning to invade, but the Russian military already tore off a chunk of Ukrainian territory when it seized Crimea and backed separatist forces who took control of large parts of eastern Ukraine eight years ago.
The State Department's announcement comes a day after British authorities said they had information the Russian government was considering a former Ukrainian lawmaker https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-accuses-kremlin-trying-install-pro-russian-leader-ukraine-2022-01-22 as a potential candidate to head a pro-Russian leadership in Kyiv.
The Russian Foreign Ministry dismissed the British allegation as ""disinformation,"" accusing NATO of ""escalating tensions"" over Ukraine. 
TROOPS AND SANCTIONS
Biden has begun considering options for boosting America's military assets in the region, senior administration officials said, after meeting with top national security aides at his Camp David retreat on Saturday.
The New York Times said Biden was mulling plans to send 1,000 to 5,000 troops to Eastern European countries, with the possibility of increasing the number should tensions flare further.
A senior administration official declined to confirm the numbers on Sunday but said ""we are developing plans and we are consulting with allies to determine options moving forward.""
The United States has sent military assistance to Ukraine but has so far held back from sending American personnel. 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has rebuffed calls to immediately impose economic sanctions on Russia, saying on Sunday that doing so would undercut the West's ability to deter potential Russian aggression against Ukraine.
Blinken was due to meet virtually with members of the European Union's Foreign Affairs Committee on Monday.
As U.S. troop deployments were discussed, a separate senior administration official said U.S. economic penalties on Russia would have far-reaching consequences should it drive any further into Ukraine.
The United States would use the Foreign Direct Product Rule to restrict the export to Russia of products incorporating microelectronics based on U.S. equipment, software or technology.
Britain has also promised stiff sanctions, with British Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab telling Sky News there would be ""very serious consequences if Russia takes this move to try and invade."" 
British officials say they have information the Russian government was considering former Ukrainian lawmaker Yevhen Murayev as a potential candidate to head a pro-Russian government in Kyiv. 
Murayev poured cold water on the notion.
""This morning I already read in all the news publications this conspiracy theory: absolutely unproven, absolutely unfounded,"" Murayev told Reuters https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/ukrainian-politician-mocks-stupid-uk-claims-he-could-lead-kremlin-puppet-2022-01-23 in a video call, adding he was considering legal action.
He denied having any contact with Russian intelligence officers and dismissed the idea that he could be in league with the Kremlin as ""stupid,"" given he was placed under Russian sanctions in 2018.
Although he says he wants Ukraine to be independent from Russia as well as the West, Murayev https://www.reuters.com/world/who-is-yevhen-murayev-named-by-britain-kremlins-pick-lead-ukraine-2022-01-23, 45, has promoted some views that align with the Kremlin's narratives on Ukraine.
The British foreign ministry declined to provide evidence to back its accusations. 
In a message to Reuters, Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian adviser to the presidential office, said there was doubt among Ukrainians as to whether Murayev was ""too ridiculous a figure"" to be the Kremlin's pick to lead Ukraine. 

But Russia had propped up previously minor figures in leadership positions in annexed Crimea and separatist-held eastern Ukraine, he added.
Therefore ""one should take this information as seriously as possible,"" he said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea’s flurry of new missile tests, including what it calls “hypersonic” https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkorea-tests-hypersonic-missiles-global-race-new-rockets-2022-01-11 weapons, has underscored the importance of the country’s missile engineers and scientists, a group that is high profile within his government but opaque to outsiders. 
Analysts say Kim Jong Un appears to be taking steps to institutionalize the missile forces, signalling his likely intent to make them a long-term, operational part of his military plans. https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkorea-warns-it-may-rethink-moratorium-nuclear-missile-tests-2022-01-19 Here's what we know – and what we don’t – about these key personnel.
THE SCIENTISTS
Very little is known about the names and positions of the mid-level and working-level scientists and technicians involved in missile research and development.  
Analysts say these individuals appear to have guaranteed job security because of the resources and effort expended to educate and train them, and they are sequestered to special districts so they are neither a defection risk nor a political or social nuisance to the regime.  
“Unlike economic cadres or even military commanders, this is a population that is not easily replaced,” said Michael Madden, a North Korea leadership expert at the Washington-based Stimson Center.
Many of them attend Kim Jong Un National Defense University, a training ground for North Korean defense-related science and technology specialists that has reportedly added a college focused on “hypersonic missile technology.” 
The scientists and engineers often appear split into competing teams designing similar types of weapons, allowing them to go down multiple routes to see which technology is the most promising, said Ken Gause, director of the International Affairs Group at CNA, a non-profit research and analysis organisation based in Arlington, Virginia.
A 2018 study by the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) found North Korean scientists had worked with researchers in other countries to co-write at least 100 published articles that had identifiable significance for dual-use technology, weapons of mass destruction, or other military purposes. 
THE OFFICIALS
Kim Jong Un relies on three top people https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-trio-exclusive-idUSKBN18L302 to lead the secretive country’s rapidly accelerating missile programme. 
They include Ri Pyong Chol, a former top air force general; Kim Jong Sik, a veteran rocket scientist; and Jang Chang Ha, the head of a weapons development and procurement centre. 
A fourth official - Pak Jong Chon, the chief of the General Staff - has also assumed a higher-profile role in the Military Industry Department (MID), which is responsible for production of strategic weapons, Gause said.
""We have seen a lot of changes in the military industry arena in the last few years,"" Gause said.
Pak oversaw many recent tests in the absence of Kim Jong Un, who did not attend any missile launches in 2021, before observing one of the hypersonic missile launches in January.
Last year also saw the appointment of Yu Jim to lead the MID. Yu was previously a representative of North Korea’s primary state arms dealer in Iran, Madden said.
THE ORGANISATIONS
The Academy of National Defense Science (NADS), also known as the Second Academy of Natural Sciences (SANS), oversees North Korea's missile development. 
Madden said the state of a weapon's development can often be divined from who is reported to have attended a test. 
An event where the only personnel are from NADS/SANS means the system is still in the research and development phase, for example. If an event combines NADS and the 2nd Economic Committee, that often means that the system is moving from development to production and manufacturing.  
Finally, if the military’s General Staff Department (GSD) personnel attend a test, such as the recent train mobile missile, this usually indicates that the system is finished and will be deployed.  
There are initial signals that as North Korea completes its missile and nuclear arsenal, it may fold more elements of its Strategic Forces back under GSD, signalling it has moved to an operational role, Madden added.
FOREIGN ASSISTANCE
North Korea’s missile programme has roots in assistance it received from the Soviet Union, and later Russia, analysts say, and the boosters involved in propelling the latest hypersonic warheads are similar to Soviet designs. 
There is debate over how much that assistance has continued since the 1990s.
According to the latest sanctions https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-imposes-sanctions-north-koreans-russian-after-missile-tests-2022-01-12 designations by the United States, North Koreans linked to the NADS in China and Russia continue to procure materials and technical information for North Korea’s WMD and missile programmes, aided by at least one Russian telecommunications company and a Russian national. 

Markus Schiller, a Europe-based missile expert, has argued that North Korea’s success in testing suggests it has had external support.
Schiller notes, however, that under Kim Jong Un, North Korean missiles failed more often than in the past, suggesting that the younger Kim was testing more homegrown designs than his predecessors.

25,"<span>Jan 23, 2022 11:35PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -Firefighters gained greater control on Sunday of a wildfire that closed northern California's scenic coastal highway and threatened a famous bridge, although about 500 people stayed under evacuation orders, officials said.
The so-called Colorado Fire, about 15 miles (24 km) south of Monterey and just north of the area known as Big Sur, broke out on Friday night and crossed the Pacific Coast Highway, burning for a time on the ocean side of the road.
The fire approached, but did not damage, the Bixby Creek Bridge, known for its spectacular concrete arch support that soars 260 feet (80 meters) over the gorge and Pacific Ocean below. 
The fire was 35% contained on Sunday night, up from the morning's figure of 25%, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said in an update.
The blaze was limited to about 700 acres (283 hectares), down from 1,050 acres in the morning, a revision it attributed to ""accurate mapping."" 
Cal Fire said, ""The fire behavior was moderate and made wind-driven runs late Saturday night and into Sunday morning,"" adding that crew efforts to build and improve containment lines and mop up hotspots would continue on Sunday.
One structure, an occupied yurt, was destroyed, said Cal Fire spokesperson Cecile Juliette. Most of those under evacuation orders are believed to have left the area, she added. 
Such fires are atypical for this time of year, as the Colorado Fire has scorched an area that went more than a decade without a January fire across more than 100 acres (40 hectares), Juliette said.
California has long had an active wildfire season, but it has grown longer and more punishing in recent years, fueled at least partly by climate change and a two-decade drought. 

""We've had several fires across northern California in the last few years that have been different than the fires from 10 or 15 years ago,"" Juliette said.
""They've been much bigger, (with) much more energy, much hotter and spread much more quickly. So this is the new California.""

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Honduran lawmakers in rival alliances backed two different people as congressional president on Sunday amid disputes between President-elect Xiomara Castro and dissident members of her party, warning of a new political crisis in the poverty-stricken Central American nation. 
Lawmakers from Castro's leftist Liberty and Refoundation Party (Libre) and two other parties appointed a member of their caucus as president of Congress on Friday, breaking an agreement to appoint a lawmaker from the Partido Salvador de Honduras (PSH), an ally that helped Castro claim victory.
Castro, calling the move a ""betrayal,"" said Friday that her party had expelled the 18 lawmakers who had supported the decision to go against naming a PSH member to the top post of Congress.
The dispute triggered chaotic scenes in Congress, prompting the United States embassy in Honduras to call for calm and dialogue on Saturday.
The dissident lawmakers formed a board backed by Honduras' National Party in a meeting at a social club on the outskirts of Tegucigalpa on Sunday where they swore in lawmaker Jorge Calix (NYSE:CALX) as president of Congress with support that included lawmakers from outgoing president Juan Orlando Hernandez's party. 
Meanwhile, Castro supporters and her allies in PSH elected lawmaker Luis Redondo for the role in a session at congressional headquarters in the capital. 
In a speech, Calix pledged to work with Castro despite political differences. 
""We want to guarantee that we will be vigilant that the legislative agenda of our president Xiomara Castro is fulfilled,"" Calix said. 
Castro later tweeted that she recognizes Redondo as congressional president, and congratulated lawmakers who reject ""12 years of 'Joh' corruption networks,"" referring to outgoing president Hernandez. 

The Honduran Council of Private Enterprise (COHEP) released a statement saying the turn of events by lawmakers is ""putting the function of rule of law and democracy at serious risk"" and called for ""a sincere dialogue urgently.""
Castro has threatened to refuse to be sworn in on Jan. 27 by Calix.

27,"<span>Jan 23, 2022 10:47PM ET</span>",,,,,"(Reuters) - The Tom Brady 'will he, won't he?' retirement debate shifted into high gear on Sunday as NFL fans wondered if the future Hall of Fame quarterback had played his last game after Tampa Bay's 30-27 loss to the Los Angeles Rams in a NFC divisional playoff.
Even in the days leading up to the meeting in Tampa it seemed everyone was trying to read the tea leaves about Brady's future.
Buccaneers head coach Bruce Arians told The Tampa Bay Times that he would be ""shocked"" if Brady did not return for next season while ESPN reported that sources close to the NFL all-time passing leader said he is non-committal about playing.
The 44-year-old has said he wants to play until at least 45 and has offered no hint that he does not plan to honor the final year of his current deal that will pay him $25.4 million.
Based on his performance this season there would seem little reason for Brady not to return.
He played in all 17 games and led the NFL in passing yards with a career high 5,316 and threw 43 touchdown passes.
Asked about his future, Brady told reporters: ""I haven't put a lot of thought into it. We'll just take it day by day and see where we're at.""
Brady added that he felt great physically and brushed off a question on whether he thought the game might be his last.
""I was just thinking about winning. That's just kind of my mentality to go out there and try to win, give my team the best chance to win,"" Brady said.
Brady's fierce competitiveness, that has helped him earn seven-Super Bowl rings, including one last year with Tampa, was on full display on Sunday as he engineered a second-half fight back against the Rams.
Trailing 27-3 in the third quarter, the Buccaneers rallied to tie the contest with 42 seconds remaining on a Leonard Fournette nine-yard touchdown run.

But that was still enough time for Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford to work the ball deep into Tampa territory where kicker Matt Gay sealed victory with a 30-yard field goal.
The Rams advanced to the conference title game next Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers.

(Reuters) - The federal prosecution of three former Minneapolis police officers who took part in the deadly arrest of George Floyd began on Thursday in a trial that turns on when an officer has a duty to intervene in a colleague's excessive use of force.
Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane are charged with violating Floyd's civil rights during the arrest on a road outside a Minneapolis grocery store in May 2020. 
All three men were peripheral characters in a chaotic, violent scene that galvanized some of the largest anti-racism protests in the United States. They can all be glimpsed at times in a widely seen cellphone video that shows their colleague Derek Chauvin with his knee on the handcuffed Black man's neck for more than nine minutes.
A jury found Chauvin, 45, guilty of murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death at the end of a nationally televised state trial in April 2021, and a Minnesota judge sentenced him to 22-1/2 years in prison.
Another jury, chosen in the U.S. District Court in St. Paul on Thursday, will now be asked to decide what, if anything, his colleagues should have done to stop Chauvin kneeling on Floyd, who was suspected of buying cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill.
There are no African-Americans apparent among the 10 women and eight men selected as jurors and alternates, according a reporter providing a pool report for all media. One appears to be an Asian-American woman and another an Asian-American man and the rest are white, the report said. 
Federal prosecutions of U.S. police officers for killing someone while on duty are rare; the prosecution of other officers for willfully violating someone's rights by not stopping a colleague who is using excessive violence is even rarer, legal observers say.
""Now the question is: who else gets held accountable?"" said David Schultz, a law professor at the University of Minnesota. ""Am I my fellow officer's keeper? If I see Derek Chauvin do something wrong, do I have some kind of duty to intervene?""
Mark Osler, a law professor at Minnesota's University of St. Thomas and a former federal prosecutor, said most police misconduct trials, including that of Chauvin, focus on an officer's actions.
""This is about the actions that were not taken,"" he said. ""This is a very different trial.""
Chauvin, who is white, was also charged alongside his colleagues by federal prosecutors with violating Floyd's civil rights. He changed his plea to guilty last December.
Thao, Kueng and Lane, who could face years in prison if convicted, have all pleaded not guilty.
Prosecutors from the U.S. Department of Justice's civil rights division will seek to convince the jury that the men ""willfully failed to aid Floyd"" as he fell unconscious beneath Chauvin's knee. The indictment says https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1392451/download that a person under arrest has a right to ""be free from a police officer's deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs.""
Thao and Kueng face an additional count in the indictment, which says they ""wilfully failed"" to stop Chauvin using excessive force against a prone, handcuffed Floyd, violating Floyd's right to be free from unreasonable seizure.
Lane, who helped Kueng physically restrain Floyd's lower body, avoided being charged with the second count in part because videos record him asking his colleagues whether they should roll Floyd on his side, a position in which it is easier to breathe. Thao, meanwhile, contended with anguished onlookers, who screamed at police that Floyd had stopped breathing, by ordering them to stay on the sidewalk.
In his plea agreement with prosecutors, Chauvin agreed with the prosecution assertion that Thao and Lane did and said nothing to stop Chauvin's use of force. 
Many of the onlookers, who testified at Chauvin's state trial, are expected to be called as witnesses at the federal trial. Neither prosecutors nor defense lawyers have publicly said if they will call Chauvin to testify.
Thao had worked for the Minneapolis Police Department for eight years; Lane and Kueng had joined only a few months prior to the arrest, and Chauvin was their field training officer, something their defense lawyers are expected to emphasize.

Legal experts said the prosecution might accelerate challenges to the ""thin blue line"" culture prevalent in U.S. police departments that discourages individual officers from speaking out against colleagues' misconduct.
""It does run counter to the old-style culture of law enforcement, but it is not new,"" said Candace McCoy, a criminal justice professor at New York's John Jay College. ""We've seen this concept develop over the past decade, with several large police departments that specially train officers on a duty to intervene.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday rebuffed calls to immediately impose economic sanctions on Russia, saying that doing so would undercut the West's ability to deter potential Russian aggression against Ukraine.
Russia's massing of troops near its border with Ukraine has sparked Western concerns that it may invade. If Russia does make an incursion, the West has threatened sanctions with profound economic effects. Moscow has said it has no plans to invade.
""When it comes to sanctions, the purpose of those sanctions is to deter Russian aggression. And so if they are triggered now, you lose the deterrent effect,"" Blinken told CNN in an interview.
Blinken said if one more Russian force entered Ukraine in an aggressive manner, that would trigger a significant response.
The United Kingdom has threatened Russia with sanctions after Britain accused the Kremlin of seeking to install a pro-Russian leader in Ukraine. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the Washington Post last week he supported imposing sanctions now, a view endorsed by Republican lawmakers on Sunday.
""We need to act now. When it comes to pushing back against Russia, we need to show strength and not be in a position of ... appeasement,"" Republican Senator Joni Ernst, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told ABC News.
Democratic Senator Chris Coons, an ally of U.S. President Joe Biden, argued for passing bipartisan U.S. legislation to ""show resolve and determination and apply some sanctions now"" but said it was best to keep the strongest sanctions in reserve.

""The very strongest sanctions, the sorts of sanctions that we use to bring Iran to the table, is something that we should hold out as a deterrent,"" he told ABC News.
Asked if U.S. hands were tied over Ukraine because of a need for Russian support in talks on reining in Iran's nuclear program, Blinken, told CBS News: ""Not in the least.""

VIENNA (Reuters) - The United States is unlikely to strike an agreement with Iran to save the 2015 Iran nuclear deal unless Tehran releases four U.S. citizens Washington says it is holding hostage, the lead U.S. nuclear negotiator told Reuters on Sunday.
The official, U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley, repeated the long-held U.S. position that the issue of the four people held in Iran is separate from the nuclear negotiations. He moved a step closer, however, to saying that their release was a precondition for a nuclear agreement.
""They're separate and we're pursuing both of them. But I will say it is very hard for us to imagine getting back into the nuclear deal while four innocent Americans are being held hostage by Iran,"" Malley told Reuters in an interview. 
""So even as we're conducting talks with Iran indirectly on the nuclear file we are conducting, again indirectly, discussions with them to ensure the release of our hostages,"" he said in Vienna, where talks are taking place on bringing Washington and Tehran back into full compliance with the deal.
In recent years, Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards have arrested dozens of dual nationals and foreigners, mostly on espionage and security-related charges.
Rights groups have accused Iran of taking prisoners to gain diplomatic leverage, while Western powers have long demanded that Tehran free their citizens, who they say are political prisoners.
Tehran denies holding people for political reasons.
MESSAGE SENT
Malley was speaking in a joint interview with Barry Rosen, a 77-year-old former U.S. diplomat who has been on hunger strike in Vienna to demand the release of U.S., British, French, German, Austrian and Swedish prisoners in Iran, and that no nuclear agreement be reached without their release.
Rosen was one of more than 50 U.S. diplomats held during the 1979-1981 Iran hostage crisis.
""I've spoken to a number of the families of the hostages who are extraordinarily grateful for what Mr Rosen is doing but they also are imploring him to stop his hunger strike, as I am, because the message has been sent,"" Malley said.
Rosen said that after five days of not eating he was feeling weak and would heed those calls.
""With the request from Special Envoy Malley and my doctors and others, we've agreed (that) after this meeting I will stop my hunger strike but this does not mean that others will not take up the baton,"" Rosen said.
The indirect talks between Iran and the United States on bringing both countries back into full compliance with the landmark 2015 nuclear deal are in their eighth round. Iran refuses to hold meetings with U.S. officials, meaning others shuttle between the two sides.
The deal between Iran and major powers lifted sanctions against Tehran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear activities that extended the time it would need to obtain enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb if it chose to. Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons.
Then-President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the deal in 2018, reimposing punishing economic sanctions against Tehran. Iran responded by breaching many of the deal's nuclear restrictions, to the point that Western powers say the deal will soon have been hollowed out completely.
LEVERAGE
Asked if Iran and the United States might negotiate directly, Malley said: ""We've heard nothing to that effect. We'd welcome it.""
The four U.S. citizens include Iranian-American businessman Siamak Namazi, 50, and his father Baquer, 85, both of whom have been convicted of ""collaboration with a hostile government"".
Namazi remains in prison. His father was released on medical grounds in 2018 and his sentence later reduced to time served. While the elder Namazi is no longer jailed, a lawyer for the family says he is effectively barred from leaving Iran.
""Senior Biden administration officials have repeatedly told us that although the potential Iranian nuclear and hostage deals are independent and must be negotiated on parallel tracks, they will not just conclude the nuclear deal by itself,"" said Jared Genser, pro bono counsel to the Namazi family.

""Otherwise, all leverage to get the hostages out will be lost,"" he added.
The others are environmentalist Morad Tahbaz, 66, who is also British, and businessman Emad Shargi, 57.

OUAGADOUGOU (Reuters) - Sustained gunfire rang out from military camps in Burkina Faso on Sunday as mutinying soldiers demanded more support for their fight against Islamist militants and protesters ransacked the headquarters of President Roch Kabore's political party. 
The government called for calm, denying speculation on social media that the army had seized power or detained Kabore.
Late on Sunday, it decreed a curfew from 2000 GMT to 0530 GMT until further notice, and issued another statement suspending schools on Monday and Tuesday for security reasons.
A spokesperson for the government said separately that talks were ongoing with the mutinying soldiers. 
A spokesperson for the mutineers said they were demanding ""appropriate"" resources and training for the army in its fight against militants linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State and the resignation of the army and intelligence chiefs. 
Frustration in the West African gold producing country has grown in recent months over deteriorating security. The deaths of 49 military police in a militant attack in November prompted violent protests calling for Kabore to step down.
Demonstrators in the streets of the capital Ouagadougou on Sunday urged the soldiers to go further, chanting ""Free the country!""
The mutiny underlines the threat posed by growing Islamist insurgencies across West Africa's Sahel region, a semi-arid strip of land beneath the Sahara Desert. 
The militants have seized control of swathes of territory across Burkina Faso and its neighbours, Mali and Niger. In some cases, they force residents to abide by their harsh interpretation of Islamic law.
Heavy gunfire was first heard around 5:00 a.m. (0500 GMT) on Sunday at Ouagadougou's Sangoule Lamizana camp, which houses a prison whose inmates include soldiers involved in a failed 2015 coup attempt, Reuters reporters said. 
Hundreds of people later came out in support of the mutineers. At the Lamizana camp, where a crowd of about 100 sang the national anthem and chanted, the soldiers responded by firing into the air. It was not clear whether this was to show support for the demonstrators or to disperse them. 
In downtown Ouagadougou, near the Place de la Nation, police fired teargas to disperse around 300 protesters.
Soldiers also fired into the air at an air base close to Ouagadougou International Airport, according to Reuters reporters. The U.S. embassy also reported gunfire at three other military bases in Ouagadougou and at bases in the northern towns of Kaya and Ouahigouya.
Elsewhere in Ouagadougou, protesters burned and looted the headquarters of Kabore's People's Movement for Progress (MPP), a Reuters reporter said. 
The spokesperson for the mutineers, who addressed reporters in front of Lamizana camp, called for better welfare for wounded soldiers and their families.
COUP FEARS 
Burkina Faso's government confirmed gunfire at some military camps but denied reports on social media that the army had seized power.
Speaking on national television, Defence Minister General Bathelemy Simpore said the reasons for the gunfire were still unclear.
""The head of state has not been detained; no institution of the country has been threatened,"" Simpore said.
Kabore was not seen in public. His Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account issued a tweet to encourage Burkina Faso's national soccer team in its Africa Cup of Nations match against Gabon, then congratulated them later for their victory. It made no mention of events at home. 
NetBlocks, an internet blockage observatory, said web access had been disrupted as of around 10 a.m. A spokesperson for the airport said flights had not been cancelled. 
Governments in West and Central Africa are on high alert for coups after successful putsches over the past 18 months in Mali and Guinea, where the army removed President Alpha Conde last September. 
The military also took over in Chad last year after President Idriss Deby died on the battlefield.
The 15-member Economic Community of West African States said in a statement that it was following the situation with great concern, and called on the Burkina military to favour dialogue with the authorities. 
Burkinabe authorities arrested a dozen soldiers earlier this month on suspicion of conspiring against the government.
The arrests followed a shake-up within the army's leadership in December, which some analysts saw as an effort by Kabore to shore up his support within the military. 
Rising violence in Burkina Faso driven by Islamist attacks killed more than 2,000 people last year. 

Anti-government demonstrations were planned for Saturday, but the government banned them and the police intervened to disperse hundreds of people who tried to assemble in Ouagadougou. 
The government has suspended mobile internet service on several occasions, and the tense situation in November led the U.N. special envoy to West Africa to warn against any military takeover.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people protested in Brussels on Sunday against COVID-19 restrictions, some clashing with police who fired water cannon and tear gas to disperse them near the European Commission's headquarters.
The rally drew about 50,000 people, Belgian police said.
It was peaceful at first as protesters chanted and filled streets, waving placards and balloons with slogans like: ""We want to be free again"" and ""No Covid slave ticket"", a reference to vaccine passes required for certain activities.
Trouble flared later, with a building housing the European diplomatic service and a sandwich shop broken into, a Reuters journalist said. Police said more than 60 people were arrested, with three officers and 12 demonstrators taken to hospital. 
Belgium announced a slight easing of coronavirus restrictions on Friday despite record infections, but also said people must have booster shots after five months to keep passes for bars, cinemas and many other public spaces.
'ANTI-DICTATOR, NOT ANTI-VAXXER'
""I'm angry about the blackmail that the government is doing,"" said protester Caroline van Landuyt, who had herself been vaccinated. Her children did not want to be inoculated but had to so as to travel and play sport, she said.
Sunday's scenes in the Belgian capital were reminiscent of clashes last November, when around 35,000 protesters took to Brussels' streets and there was also violence.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell thanked police and condemned ""the senseless destruction and violence"" in a tweet that showed him standing in front of a broken pane of glass.
Some protesters let off fireworks as police advanced into a park. Riot officers ringed the water cannon. ""I'm not an anti-vaxxer, I'm anti-dictator,"" read another placard.

Belgium is facing a fifth wave of COVID-19 infections, with the peak not expected for at least a couple of weeks. 
Some 89% of Belgian adults are fully vaccinated and 67% have now also received a booster shot.

Berlusconi, a four-times prime minister of Italy, had major heart surgery in 2016 and has also had prostate cancer. He has been repeatedly admitted to hospital over the past year after contracting COVID-19 in 2020.
Alberto Zangrillo said in a statement that Berlusconi was undergoing long-scheduled tests in the hospital.
A spokesperson for Berlusconi, who on Saturday said that he had decided against running for president ahead of a parliamentary vote beginning on Monday, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Zangrillo said Berlusconi was admitted to the San Raffaele hospital on Sunday, after he announced the decision to drop his presidential bid.

Two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters he had been in hospital since Thursday.
Italy's rightist coalition had asked Berlusconi to run, but any bid by him was unlikely to be successful due to difficulties in mustering the broad support traditionally needed among more than 1,000 lawmakers and regional delegates.

KYIV (Reuters) - Former Ukrainian lawmaker Yevhen Murayev derided British allegations that he could be installed as leader of a Kremlin puppet government in Kyiv, and told Reuters in an interview that he was considering legal action. 
Britain's foreign ministry said on Sunday that Moscow was considering Murayev as a potential candidate to lead Ukraine if Russia launched an invasion, and said Russian intelligence officers were in contact with several other former Ukrainian politicians about planning an attack.
Russia blasted the allegations as ""disinformation"" while a Ukrainian official said it should be looked at seriously.
""This morning I already read in all the news publications this conspiracy theory: absolutely unproven, absolutely unfounded,"" Murayev said on a video call. 
He denied having any contact with Russian intelligence officers and dismissed the idea that he could be in league with the Kremlin as ""stupid"", given he was placed under Russian sanctions in 2018. 
""Probably in the UK it was somehow forgotten or missed, or simply not even appreciated,"" said Murayev, adding that the allegations made him doubt the quality of UK intelligence work. 
Earlier he had posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) a picture of himself altered to look like the fictional British spy James Bond.
Kyiv and its Western allies have sounded the alarm over Russia massing troops near Ukraine's borders. Russia denies plans to attack but has pressed for security guarantees, including a block on Ukraine joining the NATO alliance. 
'PEACE, NOT NATO'
Murayev said he was prepared to defend his ""honest name"" against the British allegations. ""Lawyers are preparing a mechanism for me,"" he added. ""I will defend my honour in court.""
Born in 1976, he began his political career in his native city of Kharkiv as an ally of the former President Viktor Yanukovich, who fled to Russia after the 2014 Maidan protests brought a pro-Western leadership to power.
Murayev was a lawmaker from 2014 to 2019. He started in the Opposition Bloc faction, a party formed from fragments of Yanukovich's Party of Regions. In June 2016 he founded his own party, For Life, and in 2018 he launched another party, Nashi.
Though he says he wants Ukraine to be independent from Russia as well as the West, Murayev has promoted some views that align with the Kremlin's narratives on Ukraine.
Speaking to Reuters, he called for a change of power in Ukraine and blamed the ""collective West"" for the war in the eastern Donbass region. Echoing Russia's hostility to the alliance, he said:

""Peace, not NATO, is in our interests, and if the question now is that we will have a war and hundreds of thousands will die because the collective West wants to see us as a launch pad, I think that this goes against our interests.""
Murayev told Reuters he wanted Ukraine to be politically neutral, like Switzerland. He said he believed Russia put him under sanctions at the behest of a prominent pro-Kremlin politician in Ukraine with whom he fell out.

Sarkissian, president since 2018, was in a standoff with Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan last year over a number of issues, including the dismissal of the head of the armed forces.
The role of prime minister is seen as more powerful than that of president.
""I have been thinking for a long time, I have decided to resign from the post of the President of the Republic after working actively for about four years,"" Sarkissian said in a statement published on the president's official website.
""The question may arise as to why the President failed to influence the political events that led us to the current national crisis. The reason is obvious again - the lack of appropriate tools ... - the Constitution. The roots of some of our potential problems are hidden in the current Basic Law.""
At a referendum in December 2015, Armenia became a parliamentary republic, while presidential powers were significantly curtailed.
Sarkissian in his statement did not refer directly to any particular events or issues.
Armenia agreed a ceasefire with Azerbaijan last November at their border, after Russia urged them to step back from confrontation following the deadliest clash since a six-week war in 2020 when Moscow also brokered a peace deal to end the hostilities. 

Prime Minister Pashinyan has since been under pressure, with regular street protests demanding he step down over the terms of the peace agreement. Under the 2020 deal brokered by Russia, Azerbaijan regained control of territory it had lost during a war in the early 1990s.
Armenia seceded from the Soviet Union in 1991 but remains dependent on Russia for aid and investment. Many Armenians accuse the government of corruption and mishandling an economy that has struggled to overcome the legacy of central planning.

The House of Representatives Select Committee on Jan. 6 is looking for evidence that Republican officials in some states sought to nominate their own slates of electors, rather than those chosen by voters in 2020, panel chairman Representative Bernie Thompson told CBS News.
Republicans had publicly pressured then-Vice President Mike Pence to reject official slates of electors to allow Republican state lawmakers to offer an alternate group of electors backing then-President Donald Trump. Pence rejected that plea.
""If we ... determine specifically individuals who did this, we will make the referral to the Justice Department,"" Thompson said in an interview on CBS' ""Face the Nation. ""We are concerned that documents have been filed saying they were individuals responsible for conducting and certifying elections and they're not. And when you falsify documents, in most instances, that's a criminal act.""
Asked if he knew who orchestrated the effort to keep Pence from certifying Trump's loss, Thompson said the committee had received related information from documents recently handed over by the National Archives and was reviewing them.
Thousands of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, after he repeated to a nearby rally his false claims that his defeat was the result of widespread fraud.
CNN reported last week that officials on Trump's re-election campaign, led by his lawyer Rudy Giuliani, oversaw efforts to put forward illegitimate electors from seven states that the former president lost.
The Jan. 6 panel last week subpoenaed Giuliani along with two other Trump lawyers.
Thompson also said the panel was concerned about a draft Trump executive order, reported by Politico, that would have called on the U.S. military to seize election equipment, although the order was never issued. 
""Just the draft itself is reason enough to believe it was being proposed,"" Thompson told CBS. ""If you are using the military to potentially seize voting machines, even though it's a discussion the public needs to know. We've never had that before.""

While the committee can refer possible crimes to the Justice Department, it is up to the department to decide whether to charge anyone. 
Thompson said the panel had already talked to Trump's former attorney general, Bill Barr, as well as people from the U.S. Department of Defense.

LONDON (Reuters) -A British lawmaker has said she was fired from a ministerial job in Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative government partly because her Muslim faith was making colleagues uncomfortable, the Sunday Times reported.
The allegation added to the turmoil https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/first-rebellion-against-johnson-was-doomed-next-may-not-be-2022-01-21 Johnson's government is facing over parties held at his Downing Street office during COVID-19 lockdowns.
Nusrat Ghani, 49, who lost her job as a junior transport minister in February 2020, told the paper that she had been told by a ""whip"" - an enforcer of parliamentary discipline - that her ""Muslimness"" had been raised as an issue in her sacking.
The government's chief whip, Mark Spencer, said he was the person at the centre of Ghani's allegations.
""These accusations are completely false and I consider them to be defamatory,"" he said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""I have never used those words attributed to me.""
Johnson met Ghani to discuss the ""extremely serious"" claims in July 2020, a spokesperson from the prime minister's office said on Sunday.
""He then wrote to her expressing his serious concern and inviting her to begin a formal complaint process,"" the spokesperson said. ""She did not subsequently do so."" 
""The Conservative Party does not tolerate prejudice or discrimination of any kind."" 
Ghani said in response that the Conservative Party complaint process was ""very clearly not appropriate"" because her dismissal related to her position in the government, rather than in the party.
""Now is not the time I would have chosen for this to come out and I have pursued every avenue and process I thought available to me, but many people have known what happened,"" she added in a statement.
Ghani's allegation came after one of her Conservative colleagues said he would meet police to discuss accusations that government whips had attempted to ""blackmail"" lawmakers suspected of trying to force Johnson from office over the lockdown parties.
The scandals have drained public support from both Johnson personally and his party, presenting him with the most serious crisis of his premiership.
COLLEAGUES 'UNCOMFORTABLE'
""I was told that at the reshuffle meeting in Downing Street that 'Muslimness' was raised as an 'issue', that my 'Muslim women minister' status was making colleagues uncomfortable,"" the paper quoted Ghani as saying.
""I will not pretend that this hasn't shaken my faith in the party and I have at times seriously considered whether to continue as an MP (member of parliament)."" 
In his response, Spencer said Ghani had declined to put the matter to a formal internal investigation.
The Conservative Party has previously faced accusations of Islamophobia, and a report in May last year criticised it over how it dealt with complaints of discrimination against Muslims.
The report also led Johnson to issue a qualified apology for any offence caused by his past remarks about Islam, including a newspaper column in which he referred to women wearing burqas as ""going around looking like letterboxes"".
The main opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer said the Conservatives must investigate Ghani's account immediately.
""This is shocking to read,"" he said on Twitter. 
BLACKMAIL ALLEGATIONS
Ghani's comments about the whips' behaviour echoed allegations last week from another senior Conservative, William Wragg, that some of his colleagues had faced intimidation and blackmail because of their desire to topple Johnson.
He has told the Daily Telegraph that he would meet the police early next week to discuss his allegations.
Johnson has said he had neither seen nor heard any evidence to support Wragg's claims. His office has said it would look at any such evidence ""very carefully"".

Johnson, who in 2019 won his party's biggest majority in more than 30 years, is fighting to shore up his authority after the ""partygate"" scandals, which followed criticism of the government's handling of a corruption row and other missteps.
Senior civil servant Sue Gray is expected to deliver a report into the parties next week, with many Conservative lawmakers saying they will await her findings before deciding whether they will take action to topple Johnson.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Beijing Olympics organisers said on Sunday they had confirmed 72 cases of COVID-19 among 2,586 Games-related personnel entering China from Jan. 4 to Jan. 22, with no cases among 171 athletes and team officials arriving in that period.
Final preparations are taking place for the Winter Games amid a global surge in cases of the highly infectious Omicron coronavirus variant. The Games are set to take place from Feb. 4 to Feb. 20 inside a ""closed loop"" bubble that separates all event personnel from the public.
Of the confirmed cases, 39 were found in testing at the airport and 33 inside the loop, organisers said. Participants in the bubble are subject to daily testing, with 336,421 PCR tests administered from Jan. 4 to Jan. 22.
Brian McCloskey, chair of the Beijing 2022 medical expert panel, said that the numbers were consistent with those at last summer's Tokyo Games and in line with expectations.
""We never set a target of zero cases in the closed loop,"" he told an online media briefing on Sunday.
All Games participants need two negative PCR test results within 96 hours of their departure to China, and most are travelling on specially arranged charter flights.
Last week, organisers said that tickets for the Olympics would not be sold to the general public due to COVID-19, and would instead be distributed to groups of people who would be required to undertake strict prevention measures before, during and after attending events.

China has managed to contain domestic outbreaks of COVID-19 since it first emerged in the central city of Wuhan, and has all but shut its borders to international arrivals.
On Sunday, Beijing's city government introduced further measures to contain COVID-19 after finding nine locally transmitted cases the previous day.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Sunday for the first time conferred the lay Roman Catholic ministries of lector and catechist on women, roles that previously many had carried out without institutional recognition.
He conferred the ministries at a Mass in St. Peter's Basilica, where, in an apparent reference to resistance to change by some conservative, he criticised those who need to have rigid regulations and ""more rules"" in order to find God.
Last year, Francis changed Church law on the ministries of lector and acolyte, which mainly had been reserved to seminarians preparing for priesthood, saying he wanted to bring stability and public recognition to women already serving in the roles.
Lectors read from scripture, acolytes serve at Mass, and catechists teach the faith to children and adult converts.
The ministries of lector and acolyte existed before but were officially reserved to men. Francis instituted the ministry of the catechist last year.
At Sunday's Mass the pope installed six women and two men as lectors and three women and five men as catechists. Francis gave a bible to each lector and a crucifix to each catechist.
The formalisation, including a conferral ceremony, will make it more difficult for conservative bishops to block women in their dioceses from taking on those roles.
The change will be particularly important as a recognition for women in places such as the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), where some are the de facto religious leaders of remote communities hit by a severe shortage of priests.
The Vatican stressed that the roles are not a precursor to women one day being allowed to become priests. The Catholic Church teaches that only men can be priests because Jesus chose only men as his apostles.

Supporters of a female priesthood say Jesus was conforming to the customs of his times and that women played a greater role in the early Church than is commonly recognised.
Francis has appointed a number of women to senior jobs in Vatican departments previously held by men.

KYIV (Reuters) - Britain has accused the Kremlin of wanting to install a pro-Russian leader in Ukraine, and said Russian intelligence officers had been in contact with former Ukrainian politicians as part of plans for a military offensive. 
Britain's foreign ministry said Russia was considering the Ukrainian politician Yevhen Murayev to lead a new government, in comments that Russia has denied. Murayev also poured cold water on the claim in comments to the Observer newspaper.
WHO IS YEVHEN MURAYEV? 
Born in the eastern city of Kharkiv near the Russian border in 1976, Murayev is part of a group of politicians in opposition to the pro-Western leadership that took power after the 2014 Maidan street protests.
He began his political career in Kharkiv as an ally of the former President Viktor Yanukovich, who fled to Russia after the Maidan uprising. 
In 2014-2019, Murayev was a lawmaker. He started in the Opposition Bloc faction, a party formed from fragments of the Moscow-backed Yanukovich's Party of Regions. But in June 2016 he distanced himself from Opposition Bloc and founded his own party For Life, with a similar ideology. 
In 2018, he launched another party called Nashi. Murayev registered as a presidential candidate in the 2019 elections, but withdrew his candidacy before the vote.
WHAT ARE MURAYEV'S POLITICAL VIEWS? 
Murayev has promoted views that closely align with Russian narratives on Ukraine. He considered the Maidan protests a Western-backed coup d'etat. 
Last year, he referred to the war in Ukraine's eastern Donbass region as an internal conflict between the government and rebels, counter to Ukraine and the West's view that the conflict is between Ukraine and Russian-backed proxies. 
In 2021, he said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was controlled by the West and suggested, as Russia has, that Ukraine might try to regain territory held by Russian-backed separatists by force. Kyiv denies any such plan. 
""Zelenskiy is a hostage and he is being blackmailed by MI6, the CIA, anyone. Tomorrow they can force him to launch an offensive against the Donbass, which will lead to a full-scale war,"" he said. 
Drawing Russia into an escalation ""will mean the death of thousands of Ukrainians on one side and the other of the line of demarcation.""
HOW MUCH INFLUENCE DOES MURAYEV HAVE? 
Murayev is less prominent than Viktor Medvedchuk, a pro-Moscow businessman and lawmaker who says Russian President Vladimir Putin is godfather to his daughter and who was thrown under house arrest last year in a treason case. 
Murayev nevertheless holds sway through his TV channel, called Nash, which began broadcasting in November 2018 and is officially owned by his father, Volodymyr. 
According to a poll by the Razumkov Centre think tank in December 2021, Murayev ranked seventh with 6.3% support among prospective candidates in the next presidential election in 2024. Another poll by the Rating group put him in fifth place. 
In 2017 he filed an asset declaration, a mandatory requirement as a lawmaker. He declared cash assets of $2 million, 1 million euros ($1.13 million) and 13 million hryvnias ($460,971). 
WHAT DO MURAYEV AND OTHERS SAY ABOUT BRITAIN'S ACCUSATIONS? 
Murayev rubbished Britain's claim, telling the Observer newspaper that the accusation ""isn't very logical"". He promised more comments in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post, accompanied by a photoshopped image of him mocked up as James Bond. 
In a later post, he called for an end to dividing Ukraine into pro-Western and pro-Russian politicians, and said the country needed new leaders.
Russia dismissed Britain's accusation as ""disinformation"". Ukraine's government had no immediate comment. 
Volodymyr Fesenko, a Ukrainian political analyst, found Murayev an odd candidate. 
""Murayev, for all his pro-Russianness, is not a figure who is very close to the Kremlin, especially compared to Medvedchuk,"" Fesenko wrote.

Nine locally transmitted cases were found in Beijing on Jan. 22, the National Health Commission said on Sunday, of which six were in the city's Fengtai district.
Fengtai will organise nucleic acid tests for COVID-19 for all of its residents on Sunday, district health authorities said.
Authorities have asked residents of ""risky areas,"" including a neighbourhood of Fengtai, to not leave the city, a local government spokesman said at a Sunday news conference, adding that Fengtai residents have been asked to avoid mass gatherings.
Beijing city has also asked residents to proactively conduct nucleic acid tests if they find themselves with COVID-19-like symptoms within 14 days of receiving any deliveries from overseas, local authorities said in a statement dated Saturday.
Authorities have suggested Beijing's first case of the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus could have arrived via a package from Canada.
In Fengtai, some kindergartens have told parents that children who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 will not be able to attend, two parents told Reuters.
Reuters could not determine whether the requirement is a government regulation or the kindergartens' own rules.
A mother surnamed Wang, whose child attends at a private kindergarten in Fengtai, said a teacher told her on Friday that unvaccinated children will not be allowed to return from Monday citing new government regulations, without providing Wang any official documents.
""This is not on a voluntary basis. This is coercion,"" Wang told Reuters. She said she has filed a complaint with authorities in the hope of having the requirement removed. 
Reuters could not reach local authorities for comment on a non-business day.
Mainland China reported 56 new COVID-19 cases on Jan. 22, down from 63 a day earlier, the National Health Commission said.
Of the new cases, 19 were locally transmitted, versus 23 a day earlier, it said.
The number of new asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed cases, fell to 34 from 43.

There were no new fatalities, leaving the death toll at 4,636.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australian Open chief Craig Tiley said he does not believe Novak Djokovic will sue Tennis Australia following his deportation from the country, and that he expects the world number one to return to play at the Grand Slam event next year.
Djokovic, who has won the Australian Open on nine occasions including the last three years, was denied the opportunity to defend his title after a federal court dismissed his appeal to stay in the country and play the tournament.
Reports have since surfaced that Djokovic was planning to sue Tennis Australia, but Chief Executive Tiley denied that was the case in an interview with broadcaster ABC on Sunday.
""No,"" Tiley, the tournament director for the major, said when asked about the threat of legal action. 
""There is going to be lots of reports on different things, but we are in a position as we focus on delivering an event right now, and we will continue to deliver a great event.""
While Djokovic could face a three-year ban from travelling to Australia as a result of his deportation, Tiley said he thought the 20-time Grand Slam winner would be at Melbourne Park next year.
""Obviously, he's got to play out this year, but that will be his intention,"" he added. ""At the end of the day, he's the number one player in the world and he really loves the Australian Open.""
Tiley blamed miscommunication with the federal government for the issues that resulted in Djokovic being kicked out of Australia.
""It was an incredibly challenging environment,"" he said.
""One or two bits of communication doesn't define all the amounts of communication that continued to go on leading into the event.
""We knew we were going to have a difficult period and that's why there was a lot of contradiction and complexity with information.""
Victorian Premier Dan Andrews said his message to Djokovic had been clear.
""You want to come here -- get vaccinated. It's pretty simple,"" Andrews said on Sunday.
""Rafa (Nadal) had it right. It could all have been avoided if he just got vaccinated, and that fellow might think he's bigger than the tournament. He's not. That's why the tournament is happening without him. And it's a great success.""
Tiley also played down an incident involving Australia's Nick Kyrgios, who alleged that a coach and trainer of world number one doubles pair Nikola Mektic and Mate Pavic had threatened to fight after their match on Friday.
Kyrgios and compatriot Thanasi Kokkinakis upset Mektic and Pavic in straight sets and Kyrgios said on Saturday that ill will from the match spilled over into the players' gym.
""I have spoken to Nick and the team and this is not unusual, it's not uncommon ... Nick and Thanasi have moved on,"" Tiley told Channel 9.

Pressed further on the incident, Tiley said: ""We'll look closely at that, we'll continue to look closely at that.
""What's not unusual and what's not uncommon is the passion, but certainly there are rules and there's conditions around how you respond at the end of the match.""

DAKAR (Reuters) - Senegal votes in municipal and regional elections on Sunday, amid growing political tensions over whether President Macky Sall will seek to extend his rule beyond the two-term limit in a nation long considered one of Africa's most stable democracies.
For the crowded field of opposition candidates aiming to take control of the main cities, the elections are seen as a test of strength ahead of a legislative election in June and the battle for the presidency in 2024.
Some opposition parties have formed a coalition aiming to head off any attempt by Sall, whose tenure has been plagued by accusations that he unjustly torpedoes political challengers, to seek a third term in power.
""At stake in a broad sense for the political parties as well as coalitions of political parties is that, in the absence of opinion polls... the territorial elections on Sunday are kind of primaries for the 2024 presidential election,"" said Ousmane Khouma of Dakar's Cheikh Anta Diop University.
Sall, 60, came to power in 2012 and won re-election in 2019.
He has not ruled out seeking a third term following a constitutional referendum in 2016 that could be used to reset the clock on his term of office. Similar constitutional devices were used by Guinea's ousted President Alpha Conde and Alassane Ouattara of Ivory Coast to run again despite violent protests in both countries.
Around 6.6 million voters are expected to vote at more than 15,000 polling stations.
The biggest prize is the capital, Dakar, currently in the hands of the opposition, where the ruling party coalition list is led by Senegal's Health Minister Abdoulaye Diouf Sarr.
He will face six opposition lists that include those led by outgoing mayor Soham El Wardini, the first woman to lead the city, and popular opposition mayor of the Dakar Mermoz municipality Barthelemy Dias.
Dias, is in a coalition with 47-year-old firebrand opposition leader Ousmane Sonko, who came third in the 2019 presidential election and is seen as a potential challenger in 2024.
Sonko is leading the opposition charge to take the southern city of Ziguinchor, capital of the Casamance area of Senegal. 

His arrest last year following a rape accusation, which he denied, sparked days of violent protests and stoked fears that President Sall was interfering with the judiciary to target potential challengers.
""The change we want in the 2024 presidential election starts on January 23, 2022,"" Sonko told a recent campaign rally.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican's landmark fraud and embezzlement trial resumes after a long break on Tuesday with the beleaguered prosecution buoyed by two favourable decisions in related cases by Swiss and Italian courts.
The trial, in which defendants are accused of fraud and other crimes around the Vatican's 350 million euro ($400 million) purchase of a luxury building in London, is still mired in procedural wrangling.
Tuesday's hearing, only the sixth since the trial started amid much fanfare in July, will likely do little more than settle several more preliminary issues, meaning the trial won't get going in earnest until February.
At the last hearing on Dec. 14 - which lasted only 10 minutes - a frustrated court president Giuseppe Pignatone said he hoped the preliminary phase could end soon so the hearings could be held more frequently.
Four of original 10 defendants were temporarily removed from the indictment in October after Pignatone found fault with the original investigation. He ordered the prosecution to go back and repeat questioning of the four because procedural steps designed to protect the defendants was not followed the first time around.
At Tuesday's hearing, the prosecution is expected to announce which charges it intends to either keep or drop against each of the four.
All 10 defendants, including a once-powerful Vatican cardinal, have denied wrongdoing.
Lawyers for two Italian brokers for the Vatican's investment in the London building - Raffaele Mincione and Gianluigi Torzi - have insisted that their clients cannot get a fair trial in the Vatican.
Mincione helped the Vatican make the original investment in 2014. In 2018, when the Vatican felt it was allegedly being fleeced by Mincione, it turned to Torzi to try to take total control of the building.
The Vatican has charged Mincione with fraud, embezzlement and money laundering. Torzi is charged with fraud, extortion and money laundering.
This month, the prosecution got a much-needed boost from two foreign courts, which, while ruling on related cases, effectively rejected defence assertions about alleged lack of fairness for their clients in the Vatican judicial system. 
Torzi is in London fighting extradition requests by both Italy and the Vatican for alleged financial crimes. In a decision published this month, Italy's supreme court rejected assertions by Torzi's lawyers attacking the credibility of the Vatican court.
Earlier in January, a Swiss court rejected a request by Mincione to unblock funds that the Vatican prosecutors had asked be frozen while the trial continues. Mincione's lawyers had also cited what they said were defects in the Vatican judicial system.
The Vatican's Secretariat of State sank more than 350 million euros into the London investment. The Vatican is now in the final stages of selling the building at a reported loss of 100 million euros. 

The most prominent defendant is Cardinal Angelo Becciu, a former deputy secretary of state who was sacked by Pope Francis for alleged nepotism before the trial began. Becciu was deputy secretary of state in the early phases of the deal.

That was how he was able to escape before a second bomb fell.
""When they struck Ward 8, the door opened and we walked out... the door opened from the pressure and we walked out. God granted us safety, thank God,"" he said, recounting the strikes that targeted the detention centre where he was held on Friday at dawn.
Others, wrapped in white body bags, weren't that lucky. At least 60 people https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/several-killed-air-strike-detention-centre-yemens-saada-reuters-witness-2022-01-21 were killed when missiles hit a detention centre in the Yemeni province of Saada, the stronghold of the Houthi group that has been at war with a Saudi-led coalition since 2015. 
A Reuters witness said several people, including African migrants, were killed in a raid.
Save the Children said in a statement that three children were also reportedly killed by air strikes on Friday in the western city of Hodeidah.
The strikes, which followed missile and drone strikes on the United Arab Emirates earlier this week, have caused an international uproar https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/several-killed-air-strike-detention-centre-yemens-saada-reuters-witness-2022-01-21 and brought back attention to a forgotten and deadly conflict. 
The Saudi-led coalition denied on Saturday targeting the detention centre, saying the facility was not on no-targeting lists agreed upon with the United Nations and did not meet the standards stipulated by the Third Geneva Convention for Prisoners of War.
The strikes, the deadliest in more than two years, came amid an unprecedented escalation in the seven-year-old conflict with clashes raging over the control of Yemen's oil-rich regions Shabwa and Marib, and uptick in corss-border attacks. 
The strikes on Abu Dhabi followed dozens of similar attacks on Saudi Arabian cities with armed drones and ballistic missiles.
In Saada, hundreds of people gathered around lined-up body bags on Saturday near concrete rubble of the detention centre, seeking information about their relatives. Some were checking the bodies hoping to identify their loved ones.
""We came from Amran province on a visit to find out that the prison has been hit by warplanes. This is a another crime to be added to their other crimes,"" said Salman Badi, one of the relatives. 

Sultan al-Qahim, one of the wounded with burns on his face, said he lost consciousness after a third bomb fell.
""I was setting with my mates in our ward and then the warplane came and hit with a first strike. And a while later, two more air strikes hit. After that, nothing,” he said in the Republican hospital in Saada, where most of the wounded have been treated.

48,"<span>Jan 23, 2022 02:30AM ET</span>","SYDNEY (Reuters) -New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Arden has cancelled her wedding as the nation imposes new restrictions to slow the community spread of the COVID-19 Omicron variant, she told reporters on Sunday.
New Zealand will impose mask rules and limit gathering from midnight on Sunday after a cluster of nine COVID-19 Omicron cases showed community spread from the North to South islands after a wedding.
A family returned to Nelson in the South Island by plane after attending a wedding and other events in Auckland in the North Island. The family and a flight attendant tested positive.
New Zealand will move to a red setting under its COVID-19 protection framework, with more mask wearing. Indoor hospitality settings such as bars and restaurants and events like weddings will be capped at 100 people. The limit is lowered to 25 people if venues are not using vaccine passes, Arden said.
""My wedding will not be going ahead,"" she told reporters, adding she was sorry for anyone caught up in a similar scenario. Ardern had not disclosed her wedding date, but it was rumored to be imminent.
Asked by reporters how she felt about the cancellation of her wedding to longtime partner and fishing-show host Clarke Gayford, Ardern replied: ""Such is life.""
She added, ""I am no different to, dare I say it, thousands of other New Zealanders who have had much more devastating impacts felt by the pandemic, the most gutting of which is the inability to be with a loved one sometimes when they are gravely ill. That will far, far outstrip any sadness I experience.""
New Zealand's borders have been shut to foreigners since March 2020. The government pushed back plans for a phased reopening from mid-January to the end of February out of concern about a potential Omicron outbreak as in neighbouring Australia.

People able to travel to New Zealand under narrow exceptions must apply to stay at state-managed quarantine facilities. The government last week stopped issuing any new slots amid a surge in the number of people arriving with Omicron.
About 94% of New Zealand's population over the age of 12 is fully vaccinated and about 56% of those eligible have had booster shots.

""I have asked Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht to relieve me from my duties with immediate effect,"" Vice Admiral Kay-Achim Schoenbach said in a statement. ""The minister has accepted my request.""
Schoenbach made the remarks to a think-tank discussion in India on Friday, and video was published on social media. The comments came at a sensitive time as Russia has amassed tens of thousands of troops on Ukraine's borders.
Diplomatic efforts are focused on preventing an escalation. Russia denies it is planning to invade Ukraine.
In New Delhi, Schoenbach, speaking in English, said Putin seeks to be treated as an equal by the West.
""What he (Putin) really wants is respect,"" Schoenbach said.
""And my God, giving someone respect is low cost, even no cost... It is easy to give him the respect he really demands - and probably also deserves,"" Schoenbach said, calling Russia an old and important country.
Schoenbach conceded Russia's actions in Ukraine needed to be addressed. But he added that ""the Crimea peninsula is gone, it will never come back, this is a fact,"" contradicting the joint Western position that Moscow's annexation of the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 cannot be accepted and must be reversed.
Prior to Schoenbach's resignation, the defence ministry publicly criticised his remarks, saying they did not reflect Germany's position in either content or wording.
Schoenbach apologized for his comments.
""My rash remarks in India ... are increasingly putting a strain on my office,"" he said. ""I consider this step (the resignation) necessary to avert further damage to the German navy, the German forces, and, in particular, the Federal Republic of Germany.""

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry had called on Germany to publicly reject the navy chief's comments. Schoenbach's comments could impair Western efforts to de-escalate the situation, Ukraine said in a statement.
""Ukraine is grateful to Germany for the support it has already provided since 2014, as well as for the diplomatic efforts to resolve the Russian-Ukrainian armed conflict. But Germany's current statements are disappointing and run counter to that support and effort,"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said separately in tweet.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain on Saturday accused the Kremlin of seeking to install a pro-Russian leader in Ukraine, and said Russian intelligence officers had been in contact with a number of former Ukrainian politicians as part of plans for an invasion.
The British foreign ministry declined to provide evidence to back its accusations, which came at a time of high tensions between Russia and the West over Russia's massing of troops near its border with Ukraine. Moscow has insisted it has no plans to invade.
The British ministry said it had information the Russian government was considering former Ukrainian lawmaker Yevhen Murayev as a potential candidate to head a pro-Russian leadership. 
""We will not tolerate Kremlin plot to install pro-Russian leadership in Ukraine,"" British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""The Kremlin knows a military incursion would be a massive strategic mistake & the UK and our partners would impose a severe cost on Russia."" 
The British statement was released in the early hours of Sunday, Moscow and Kyiv time, and there was no immediate statement from the Kremlin, or from Murayev.
A foreign ministry source said it was not usual practice to share intelligence matters, and the details had only been declassified after careful consideration to deter Russian aggression.
The Russian Foreign Ministry dismissed https://www.facebook.com/MIDRussia/posts/232937249029343 the comments as ""disinformation"", accusing Britain and NATO of ""escalating tensions"" over Ukraine.
""We urge the Foreign Office to cease these provocative activities, stop spreading nonsense and finally concentrate its efforts on studying the history of the Mongol-Tatar yoke,"" the ministry said on its verified Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) account.
DEMANDS
The British claims come a day after the top U.S. and Russian diplomats failed https://www.reuters.com/world/top-diplomats-us-russia-meet-geneva-soaring-ukraine-tensions-2022-01-21 to make a major breakthrough in talks to resolve the crisis over Ukraine, although they agreed to keep talking. Russia has made security demands on the United States including a halt to NATO's eastward expansion and a pledge that Ukraine will never be allowed to join the Western military alliance.
U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne said in a statement: ""This kind of plotting is deeply concerning. The Ukrainian people have the sovereign right to determine their own future, and we stand with our democratically-elected partners in Ukraine.""
Murayev, 45, is a pro-Russian politician who opposes Ukraine's integration with the West. According to a poll by the Razumkov’s Centre think tank conducted in December 2021, he was ranked seventh among candidates for the 2024 presidential election with 6.3% support. 
""You’ve made my evening. The British Foreign Office seems confused,"" Murayev told Britain's Observer newspaper. ""It isn’t very logical. I’m banned from Russia. Not only that but money from my father’s firm there has been confiscated.""
Britain, which this week supplied 2,000 missiles and a team of military trainers to Ukraine, also said it had information that Russian intelligence services were maintaining links with ""numerous"" former Ukrainian politicians, including senior figures with links to ex-President Viktor Yanukovich.
Yanukovich fled to Russia in 2014 after three months of protests against his rule and was sentenced in absentia to 13 years in jail on treason charges in 2019.
'PLANNING FOR ATTACK'
""Some of these have contact with Russian intelligence officers currently involved in the planning for an attack on Ukraine,"" the British foreign office statement said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Downing Street office also said the British leader was planning to ramp up pressure on Russia this week by calling for European counterparts to come together with the United States to face down Russian aggression.
Earlier, RIA news agency reported that British foreign minister Truss would visit Moscow in February to meet her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, while Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and his British counterpart Ben Wallace have also agreed to hold talks.

(Reuters) -One New York City police officer was killed and another was fighting for his life after the pair were shot Friday while responding to a domestic violence call, authorities said. 
Neither of the officers have been identified by police. Authorities said that the policeman who died was a 22-year-old rookie officer. 
A suspect, who police identified as LaShawn McNeil, 47, was also shot. His condition was not known. 
""It is our city against the killers!"" Mayor Eric Adams, a retired police officer, said during a press conference. ""This was just not an attack on three brave officers. This was an attack on the city of New York.""
A spike in violent crime during the pandemic is an early challenge for Adams, who took over the helm of the city on Jan. 1. Adams was elected after putting public safety at the center of his campaign, promising to usher in policies to quickly quell the violence. 
Authorities said three officers responded on Friday evening to a 911 call in Harlem. A woman called saying she was having a fight with one of her sons.
Shortly after police arrived on the scene, two officers were fired upon in a narrow hallway by the woman's adult son. The third officer then shot the suspect McNeil. 
New York City Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell said the officers were trying to help the entire family when the suspect ""suddenly, without warning, opened fire on them"". 
""In a moment, a young, 22-year-old life was ended,"" Sewell said. ""Our department is hurting. Our city is hurting."" 

A total of four New York City police officers have been shot this week. 
One officer was shot in the leg on Tuesday as he scuffled with an armed teenager. Another officer was also shot in the leg on Thursday after a man fired through the door of a home that was being searched for drugs. Neither officer was killed in those shootings.

Police detained Kabas at around 2 a.m. (2300 GMT) and took her first to Istanbul's main police station before transferring her to the city's main courthouse, where a court subsequently ruled in favour of her formal arrest, the broadcaster said.
The alleged insult was in the form of a palace-related proverb that Kabas expressed both on an opposition television channel and on her Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account, drawing condemnation from government officials.
""The honour of the presidency's office is the honour of our country... I condemn the vulgar insults made against our president and his office,"" Fahrettin Altun, head of Turkey's Communications Directorate, wrote on Twitter.
Merdan Yanardag, chief editor of the Tele 1 channel on which Kabas made the comment, sharply criticised her arrest.
""Her detention overnight at 2 a.m. because of a proverb is unacceptable,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""This stance is an attempt to intimidate journalists, the media and society.""
The law on insulting the president carries a jail sentence of between one and four years.
Last October, Europe's top human rights court called on Turkey to change the legislation after ruling that a man's detention under the law violated his freedom of expression.
Thousands have been charged and sentenced over the crime of insulting Erdogan in the seven years since he moved from being prime minister to president.
In 2020, 31,297 investigation were launched in relation to the charge, 7,790 cases were filed and 3,325 resulted in convictions, according to Justice Ministry data. Those numbers were slightly lower than the previous year. 

Since 2014, the year Erdogan became president, 160,169 investigations were launched over insulting the president, 35,507 cases were filed and there were 12,881 convictions.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Saturday warned that COVID-19 infections could be growing exponentially in a congested residential area of the city and that overall cases had also spread due to an outbreak in pet hamsters.
Chief Executive Lam urged Hong Kong people to avoid gatherings ahead of next week's Lunar New Year as officials grappled with an outbreak of the highly-infectious Omicron variant in Kwai Chung, north of the city's Kowloon peninsula.
""We are worried that the exponential growth of cases that we have seen in other parts of the world is now happening in Kwai Chung,"" Lam said.

She said that a second Kwai Chung apartment block, home to more than 2,000 people, would be shut down for five days.
On Friday, officials shut down a first Kwai Chung building for five days after more than 20 cases were linked to it, with food delivered from outside three times a day and mass testing underway.
By Saturday, officials recorded some 105 cases in Kwai Chung, including confirmed and preliminary positive tests.
In total, some 16 buildings in the area would face various restrictions and compulsory testing, affecting some 35,000 residents, Lam added.

(Reuters) -Thich Nhat Hanh, the Zen Buddhist monk, poet and peace activist who in the 1960s came to prominence as an opponent of the Vietnam War, died on Saturday aged 95 surrounded by his followers in the temple where his spiritual journey began.
""The International Plum Village Community of Engaged Buddhism announces that our beloved teacher Thich Nhat Hanh passed away peacefully at Tu Hieu Temple in Hue, Vietnam, at 00:00hrs on 22nd January, 2022, at the age of 95,"" said his official Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account.
His week-long funeral will be held at the temple in a quiet and peaceful manner, according to his followers. 
""Thich Nhat Hanh will be remembered as arguably one of the most influential and prominent religious leaders in the world,"" Chargé d'Affaires Marie C. Damour of the U.S. Mission to Vietnam said in a statement. 
""Through his teachings and literary work, his legacy will remain for generations to come,"" she said, adding that his teachings, in particular on bringing mindfulness into daily life, have enriched the lives of innumerable Americans.
In a body of works and public appearances spanning decades, Thich Nhat Hanh spoke in gentle yet powerful tones of the need to ""walk as if you are kissing the earth with your feet"".
He suffered a stroke in 2014 which left him unable to speak and returned to Vietnam to live out his final days in the central city of Hue, the ancient capital and his place of birth, after spending much of his adult life in exile.
As a pioneer of Buddhism in the West, he formed the ""Plum Village"" monastery in France and spoke regularly on the practice of mindfulness - identifying and distancing oneself from certain thoughts without judgement - to the corporate world and his international followers.
""You learn how to suffer. If you know how to suffer, you suffer much, much less. And then you know how to make good use of suffering to create joy and happiness,"" he said in a 2013 lecture.
""The art of happiness and the art of suffering always go together"".
Born Nguyen Xuan Bao in 1926, Thich Nhat Hanh was ordained as a monk as modern Vietnam's founding revolutionary Ho Chi Minh led efforts to liberate the Southeast Asian country from its French colonial rulers.
Thich Nhat Hanh, who spoke seven languages, lectured at Princeton and Columbia universities in the United States in the early 1960s. He returned to Vietnam in 1963 to join a growing Buddhist opposition to the U.S.-Vietnam War, demonstrated by self-immolation protests by several monks. 
""I saw communists and anti-communists killing and destroying each other because each side believed they had a monopoly on the truth,"" he wrote in 1975. 
""My voice was drowned out by the bombs, mortars and shouting"".
""Venerable Thich Nhat Hanh lived a truly meaningful life. I have no doubt the best way we can pay tribute to him is to continue his work to promote peace in the world,"" the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, said on Twitter.
'LIKE A PINE TREE'
Towards the height of the Vietnam War in the 1960s he met civil rights leader Martin Luther King, whom he persuaded to speak out against the conflict.
King called Thich Nhat Hanh ""an apostle of peace and non-violence"" and nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize.
""I do not personally know of anyone more worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize than this gentle Buddhist monk from Vietnam,"" King wrote in his nomination letter. 
While in the United States to meet King a year earlier, the South Vietnamese government banned Thich Nhat Hanh from returning home.
Fellow monk Haenim Sunim, who once acted as Thich Nhat Hanh's translator during a trip to South Korea, said the Zen master was calm, attentive and loving.
""He was like a large pine tree, allowing many people to rest under his branches with his wonderful teaching of mindfulness and compassion,"" Haemin Sunim told Reuters.
""He was one of the most amazing people I have ever met.""
Thich Nhat Hanh's works and promotion of the idea of mindfulness and meditation have enjoyed a renewed popularity as the world reels from the effects of a coronavirus pandemic that has killed over a million people and upended daily life. 

""Hope is important, because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear,"" Thich Nhat Hanh wrote. ""If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. 
""If you can refrain from hoping, you can bring yourself entirely into the present moment and discover the joy that is already here.""

Tonga's government said drinking water was the priority, and a national emergency team had already distributed 60,000 litres of water to residents. A desalination plant on a New Zealand naval ship that arrived on Friday, capable of producing 70,000 litres a day, has started drawing seawater from Tonga's harbour.
Residents who had lost homes on outlying islands when a tsunami reaching up to 15 metres crashed over the South Pacific archipelago would be relocated to the main island, Tongatapu, because of water and food shortages, the Tongan prime minister's office said in a statement distributed to Tongan officials.
Volcanic fallout on the surface of the ocean was damaging boats and making marine transport between the islands challenging, and domestic flights were suspended, it said.
Ash fall and the tsunami had affected 84 per cent of the population, and inter-island communications remain an ""acute challenge"" with limited satellite and radio links, it said.
Burials were held earlier in the week for a Tongan man and a woman who had died when the tsunami hit the outlying Ha'apai islands. The official death toll is three. A field hospital has been set up on Nomuka Island after the health centre there was swept away.
Faka'iloatonga Taumoefolau, the coordinator for the project to rebuild Tonga's parliament, said the restoration of international money transfer services, for limited hours on Saturday, was important for people to be able to buy essential goods. 
""Tongans have demonstrated their resilience in this calamity and will get back on their feet,"" he said, speaking to Reuters from Tongatapu. 
More naval vessels from Australia, New Zealand and Britain are en-route to Tonga to deliver aid. Two aid flights, from Japan and New Zealand, arrived on Saturday with humanitarian supplies, after two flights from Australia on Friday evening.
COVID PRECAUTIONS
The Tongan government has implemented a strict COVID-19 policy that means people, including aid workers, cannot enter the country unless they have undergone a three-week isolation period. Aid deliveries have been contactless, with pallets quarantined for 72 hours after arrival at the airport before being distributed by Tongan authorities. One Australian aircraft returned to Brisbane midflight on Thursday after being notified of a COVID-19 case among the crew.
An aid delivery expected from China would also be contact-less to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the government said.
Taumoefolau said Tonga had done a good job in avoiding a pandemic outbreak, recording only one case so far, and the border policy would not hinder aid reaching communities. 
""It is doable to get the aid in without compromising efforts on keeping COVID out,"" he said.
An Australian navy vessel, HMAS Adelaide, was expected to arrive in Tonga on Wednesday with more bulk water and a 40-bed field hospital, Australia's minister for international development and the Pacific, Zed Seselja, told reporters in Canberra on Saturday.
The Tongan government was doing ""an extraordinary job on the ground"", he said.
Australia and New Zealand were coordinating an international aid effort with support from Britain, France, the United States, Fiji and Papua New Guinea, he said, and the Tongan government had asked for support to be paced so the small airport was not overwhelmed.
Asked by reporters about China's aid program in the Pacific, Seselja said: ""We welcome offers of support from anyone, including the Chinese government"".
Sione Hufanga, the resident United Nations country coordination specialist, told Reuters that the agency is assisting the government in relief work as more people arrive at shelters and seek food and other supplies. 
""Almost all crops in the country have been badly affected. Farmers have lost their homes and livelihood,"" he told Reuters by phone from Tonga's capital, Nuku'alofa. ""The country will be heavily relying on aid food for some time."" 
The agricultural sector contributed nearly 14% of Tonga’s GDP in 2015/16 and represented over 65% of exports. 
The Tongan government said it is ""deeply appreciative to the international community"" for its assistance, which included US$8 million in funding from the World Bank and US$10 million from the Asia Development Bank.

Reliance, a repair ship due to reconnect the undersea cable that links Tonga to international telecoms networks, left its Port Moresby mooring and was expected in Tonga on Jan. 30, according to Refinitiv data on shipping movements.
The vessel was expected to arrive ""in the next few days"" to repair the fibre-optic cable, the Tongan government said.

KHARKIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Residents in Ukraine's second biggest city Kharkiv said they hoped for the best but would prepare for the worst, as Russia massed tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine's borders and diplomatic talks failed to produce a breakthrough.
Kharkiv, an industrial city in eastern Ukraine that is home to tank, aircraft and tractor factories, lies 42 km (26 miles) from the Russian border. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has identified it as a possible target of a Russian attack.
Russia has denied it plans to attack Ukraine but has pressed the West for security guarantees, including a block on Ukraine joining the NATO alliance. 
Kharkiv's mayor, Igor Terekhov, has said the city of 1.4 million will be ""calm and collected"" and he would not allow anybody to take it. Interviewed this week, some residents said they would stay and fight, others might move.
""I do not have to stay in one place, if anything happens - I can work remotely,"" said project manager Daniella Shatokhina.
""I am trying not to think about it. I hope everything will be okay, I hope for the best. It's better not to panic before time but to decide as it happens, think on my feet.""
Another resident, assistant brand manager Anya Vergeles, compared the situation to 2014, when Russia seized Ukraine's Crimea peninsula. 
""Nobody thought that this could happen to Crimea. Nobody could imagine that. I do not want to believe it, but we do not know what will happen next,"" she said. 
Zelenskiy said in an interview published on Friday that an attack on Kharkiv was ""feasible"", though a spokesman later said the president was laying out a hypothetical scenario.
The top U.S. and Russian diplomats made no major breakthrough at talks on Ukraine on Friday but agreed to keep talking to try to resolve the crisis.
Sales manager Oleksiy Kormylets said he would not leave Kharkiv whatever happened.
""Run? No. No way! I was born here. I grew up here. I am staying no matter what. And if I have to join the city defence, I'll do it,"" he said.

IT programmer Anton Sergeev thought Russia may be just sabre-rattling, and recalled an unsuccessful attempt by Russian-backed separatist forces to capture the city in 2014. 
""They already were 'welcomed' here so they have learned it's better to stay away. Or they will go back home in zinc coffins. And their mothers will cry,"" he said.

WASHINGTON/TOKYO (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida agreed in a virtual meeting on Friday to boost cooperation on pressing economic and security issues, including China, North Korea's missiles and Russia's threat to Ukraine.
The online meeting, their first substantial talks since Kishida became Japan's prime minister in October, followed ""two-plus-two"" discussions this month at which defense and foreign ministers from the longtime allies voiced strong concern about China's growing might and vowed to respond if necessary to destabilizing activity in the Indo-Pacific.
Kishida said he and Biden had agreed to cooperate to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific, to work closely on China and the North Korean missile issue and also to cooperate on Ukraine. 
He also said Japan would host a meeting of the Quad grouping of the United States, Japan, Australia and India in the first half of this year with Biden visiting. 
Biden accepted the invitation and indicated his intention to visit in late spring, a senior U.S. administration official said, adding that one of the aims of the Quad meeting would be to review progress of a pledge to supply a billion COVID-19 vaccine doses to Southeast Asia by the end of 2022 https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-says-delivering-vaccine-pledge-asia-key-quad-credibility-2021-10-20.
Kishida said he and Biden also agreed to set up an economic version of a ""two-plus-two"" ministerial to promote economic cooperation. The U.S. official said this would focus on supply chains, technology investments, standards setting and export controls. 
""We agreed to work together to advance cooperation among like-minded countries to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific,"" Kishida told reporters. ""We agreed to closely cooperate on China-related issues, including the East and South China Seas, Hong Kong, and the Xinjiang Uyghur (Autonomous Region), as well as North Korea's nuclear and missile issues.""
Kishida said he and Biden would work closely to prevent a Russian invasion of Ukraine and ""keep close contact with other allies and partners and continue communicating on the point that any attack will be met with strong action.""In a tweet, Biden said it was ""an honor to meet with Prime Minister Kishida to further strengthen the U.S.-Japan Alliance — the cornerstone of peace and security in the Indo-Pacific and around the world.""
A White House statement said Biden had welcomed Kishida's decision to increase defense spending and ""underscored the importance of sustaining these vital investments over time.""
It said the two stressed the importance of strengthening cybersecurity and resolved ""to push back"" against China's attempts to change the status quo in the East and South China Seas.
The U.S. official told reporters U.S.-Japan solidarity was on ""full display"" in the virtual session of about 90 minutes. 
The two had a ""very in-depth discussion"" on China, sharing concerns about its intimidation of neighbors and ""predatory"" steps in trade and other realms, he said, adding that Kishida was particularly concerned about China's nuclear buildup.
The White House said the leaders condemned North Korea's recent ballistic missile launches, and the U.S. official said Biden had made clear Washington would work closely with Japan and South Korea to discourage ""possible provocations that might follow on."" 
North Korea fired tactical guided missiles this week in its latest of a series of launches and warned on Thursday it might rethink a moratorium on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests.
The U.S. official said Biden and Kishida had had a ""robust"" discussion on the need for the United States to play an active role in trade and commercial architecture in Asia.
The Biden administration has been criticized for lacking a solid economic pillar to its strategy for Asia after then-President Donald Trump quit a regional trade framework now known as CPTPP in 2017, but it has been wary of returning to a pact critics say threatens U.S. jobs. 
A senior U.S. policy official for China said on Wednesday Washington aims to establish ""common goals"" on economic cooperation with Indo-Pacific countries in early 2022. 
The Chinese embassy in Japan issued a statement on Saturday in which it said that Biden and Kishida's video meeting made ""groundless attacks"" on China and ""grossly interfered"" in its internal affairs, adding that it had lodged stern representations. 
""We urge Japan and the United States to follow the trend of the times, abandon narrow policies of zero-sum game and beggar-thy-neighbor, stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and stop drawing small circles based on ideologies.
Friday's summit followed other security-related meetings involving Indo-Pacific leaders - two-plus-two talks between Japan and France on Thursday and between Australian and British foreign and defense ministers on Friday. 
Biden last year hosted a first in-person summit of the Quad grouping at which the leaders vowed to pursue a free and open Indo-Pacific ""undaunted by coercion.""

China has stepped up military and diplomatic pressure to assert its sovereignty over Taiwan, which it claims as its own.
Kishida said this week Japan would beef up its defenses of islands near Taiwan, comments that followed a promise in October to revise security strategy so as to consider ""all options, including possession of so-called enemy-strike capabilities.""

A bipartisan group of U.S. senators also promised weapons to Ukraine, which could include missiles, small arms and boats, to help the country defend itself from a potential invasion amid a Russian military build-up https://www.reuters.com/world/top-diplomats-us-russia-meet-geneva-soaring-ukraine-tensions-2022-01-21 on its borders.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, however, has stressed Berlin's policy of not supplying lethal weapons to conflict zones. 
""I can understand the wish to support Ukraine, and that's exactly what we are doing already,"" Lambrecht told the Welt am Sonntag weekly. 
""Ukraine will receive a complete field hospital together with the necessary training in February, all co-financed by Germany for 5.3 million euros ($6.01 million),"" she said, noting that Germany has been treating severely injured Ukrainian troops in its military hospitals for years.
But Berlin is not ready to supply Kyiv with weapons for the time being, the minister said.
""We have to do everything to de-escalate. Currently, arms deliveries would not be helpful in this respect, there is agreement on this in the German government,"" Lambrecht said.
With her remarks, she sided with German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock who said Germany would not criticize other countries for being ready to supply weapons to Ukraine. 
""But I don't think it is realistic that such deliveries could tip the military balance,"" Baerbock told Sueddeutsche Zeitung. 

""The most powerful weapon...is for NATO allies, EU member states and the G7 to make it clear (to Russia) that every fresh aggression will be answered with massive consequences.""

""In this procedure, the heart and the arteries of the president were found to be healthy and functioning appropriately,"" the statement said.
Lopez Obrador, 68, who had a serious heart attack in 2013 and recently recovered from his second coronavirus infection, underwent the procedure as part of a check-up every six months that include lab tests, electrocardiograms, stress tests and CT scans, the government said.
The medical team said the latest results indicated the need for a cardiac catheterization, without providing further details on why they performed what they described as a 30-minute procedure. 
The government said ""no other type of intervention"" was needed and that Lopez Obrador was in ""perfect health.""
The procedure inserts a thin tube into a large blood vessel leading to the heart and can detect how well the heart is working. 

Lopez Obrador said he had mild symptoms from both bouts of COVID-19. In the most recent case earlier this month, he went into isolation for a week before returning to public activities, including lengthy daily news conferences.
On his first day back, he praised honey, pain reliever paracetamol and VapoRub, a topical ointment popular in Mexico, for helping ease his symptoms.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Tens of thousands of anti-abortion advocates gathered in Washington on Friday for the annual ""March for Life,"" their mood boosted by the possibility that the U.S. Supreme Court could soon upend https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-consider-rolling-back-abortion-rights-2021-12-01 the Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.
Despite freezing temperatures, the activists -- many attending with their school and church groups from around the country -- assembled on the National Mall carrying signs that read ""I am the post-Roe generation"" and ""The future is anti-abortion.""
The event marks the 49th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. Attendees were optimistic that this would be the last march to occur before the overturn of the landmark 1973 ruling that established a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy before the fetus is viable, at around 24 weeks.
Rachel Young, 19, came from northeastern Ohio with fellow students at Franciscan University of Steubenville, a Roman Catholic school that sent several busloads of students on the five-hour trip to Washington. 
Young said it was her third time attending the march but that it was a uniquely exciting occasion because of how close the Supreme Court seemed to overturning Roe. 
""I just can’t even believe it,"" she said. ""I am so thankful that God has brought us here. And that we are so, so close.""
In December, the Supreme Court signaled its openness to overturning Roe during arguments for a case out of Mississippi. The conservative justices, like Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh, indicated sympathy for Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban, which violates Roe's precedent.
If the conservative-leaning court rules in Mississippi's favor, it could overhaul abortion rights protected in the United States for nearly half a century. A ruling is expected by the end of June.
The anti-abortion movement also is celebrating a Texas law that banned abortion https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-allows-challenge-texas-six-week-abortion-ban-2021-12-10 after six weeks and empowered private citizens to sue anyone who assists someone getting an abortion past that gestational limit. The Supreme Court has allowed that law, which took effect in September, to stand as it's challenged in lower courts.
ABORTION ACCESS SHRINKING
Marchers walked from the center of the National Mall to the steps of the Supreme Court on Friday, some singing hymns along the way. A few people waved Trump flags and signs amid the sea of anti-abortion banners. 
Several members of the white nationalist group Patriot Front attended, bearing shields and jackets with their group's insignia and lifting a banner that said ""Strong Families Make Strong Nations."" Police officers surrounded the group, keeping them cordoned off from onlookers and the rest of the anti-abortion march. 
Abortion has long been a politically divisive issue in the United States, with abortion opponents concerned about preserving life from conception and abortion rights advocates standing for a woman's bodily autonomy. 
In recent years, Republican-controlled states have advanced legislation and policies making it harder for women to get an abortion. The Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights organization, found that 2021 saw the most restrictions of U.S. abortion rights in decades, with 108 abortion restrictions enacted in 19 states as of Dec. 31.
Liberate Abortion, a national coalition of more than 100 abortion rights advocacy groups, did not stage an in-person counterprotest at the March for Life because of the recent spike in COVID-19 cases, coalition campaign director Sharmin Hossain said. The coalition instead was holding a series of virtual events to mark the anniversary of Roe v. Wade this week.
""I think it's ironic that they call themselves March for Life because they ideologically do not support people living their best lives, lives filled without shame and stigma,"" Hossain said, adding that mobilizing large unmasked gatherings disregards public safety.
Miriam Rohe, 47, flew with her 16-year-old daughter Isabel from St. Louis to attend the march after her daughter's high school group canceled their planned trip due to COVID-19. 

Rohe said the thought of the court overturning Roe was ""fantastic"" but also ""a little scary"" because she assumes some women will seek out unsafe illegal abortions. 
""I do worry about the lives of those who end up in back alleys,"" she said, adding that she hoped to work to change those women's minds about abortion.

Garry Orelien was assigned in August as the investigative judge in the case. His mandate ended in December, and he said his request for an extension was rejected.
Orelien said he relinquished the probe ""around the facts of the assassination of the President of the Republic Jovenel Moise, this for personal reasons,"" according to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters. Orelien confirmed in a telephone interview he wrote the letter and declined further comment. 
His probe did not result in charges against any of the dozens of suspects arrested by Haitian police. Orelien in an interview this week blamed the lack of progress on inadequate support from other Haitian institutions. 
Moise was killed on July 7 when gunmen stormed his home. A Haitian police report in August concluded that a little-known Haitian-American doctor hired a group of former Colombian soldiers to kill the president and seize power. 
The next steps in the Haitian probe were not clear. But the United States has taken a growing role in investigating the crime.
Bernard Saint-Vil, head of the Port-au-Prince tribunal who assigned Orelien to the investigation, on Tuesday said in an interview with a local radio station that Orelien was off the job because he did not complete his investigation on time. 
Orelien had initially insisted he would remain on the case.

Saint-Vil did not respond to requests for comment.
Moise's killing further undermined Haiti's precarious political and security situation, emboldening gangs to expand territory and escalate kidnappings - including the two-month abduction of a group of Canadian and American missionaries.

By Laura Sanicola
(Reuters) - Renewable diesel is touted as a cleaner-burning fuel, but a recent study has shown the fuel falls short on one measure of reducing pollution from new truck engines - giving pause to California regulators who support increased production.
The state, the largest vehicle market in the country, has aggressively moved to curtail fossil fuel emissions from all vehicles while also encouraging production of renewable diesel - seen as key for reducing emissions in hard-to-electrify sources like trucking. 
The efforts are part of California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), a rule designed to decrease the carbon intensity of the state's transportation fuel.
Renewable diesel lowers greenhouse gas emissions compared with petroleum-based diesel. The fuel has also been promoted as a way to cut emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), a harmful pollutant that contributes to ozone deterioration and causes respiratory problems.
However, engines made more recently emit more NOx when running on renewable diesel when blended with 35% biodiesel or more, compared with conventional diesel, according to a study released by California Air Resources Board (CARB) in November.
CARB found in these new technology diesel engines, or NTDEs, running on 100% renewable diesel, NOx emissions increases were not statistically significant compared with CARB diesel, 
That could affect the way regulators revise the LCFS, which spurred investment in renewable diesel, made from fats and vegetable oils. 
State regulators are considering changes to the LCFS that align with a 2022 update on how to bring the state to carbon neutrality by 2045. The study means regulators could have to consider whether renewable diesel increases emissions in areas with worse air quality.
CARB said it has ""identified several questions about the study results"" that require further evaluation, and will be accepting public comment on the study until the end of January. 
Regulators did not respond to a request for comment. 
Heavy-duty vehicles are one of the largest contributors to NOx emissions - a precursor of ozone and particulate matter formation. Improved emissions control technology has helped NOx emissions fall by 60% between 1990 and 2019 nationwide, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
Companies and regulators had previously purported that renewable diesel reduced NOx emissions by 10%, citing the results of earlier studies that examined the fuel's performance in older engines. 
But trucks with newer engines that ran renewable diesel did not meaningfully lower NOx emissions, according to the study. While these NTDEs are present in only 43% of the state’s commercial vehicle registrations, they account for more than 75% of the miles traveled among the state's heavy-duty fleet.
“CARB threw caution to the wind and opened the door to renewable diesel's unlimited use without having properly studied NOx emissions impact in NTDEs,” said Pat McDuff, chief executive officer at Glendale-based California Fueling, in a public comment submitted in January.
He urged California regulators to reverse regulatory changes that prohibit his company from selling fuel additives meant to decrease NOx emissions in biodiesel.
The state is trying to bring 19 regions into compliance with air quality standards enacted in 2015. In two regions - the south coast and the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin - CARB has targeted lowering NOx emissions as one way of improving air quality. In 2020 regulators adopted a new regulation to reduce NOx emissions 90% by 2027.

Renewable diesel generally cuts greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants, said Tristan Brown, associate professor of energy resource economics at SUNY and advisor on New York's Climate Action Council. 
Brown noted most biodiesel blending in the United States is 20% or less. ""The real question is what amount of NOx is emitted by NTDE engines at volumes of 10% and 20% biodiesel blend levels, and that is not reported by the study,"" Brown said.

In handing down the sentence of 12 months and one day, U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken said Fruman's solicitation of money from a Russian businessman to donate to U.S. political campaigns was serious because it ""undermines democracy,"" but that the Belarus-born businessman was unlikely to commit a similar offense again. 
""This is the sort of crime that's serious not because it involves any particular financial victims ... but because it undermines the integrity of elections in our country,"" Oetken said. ""It adds to cynicism in the eyes of the public and to the perception that the system may be corrupt."" 
Fruman, 55, who pleaded guilty last year, said the two years he spent under home confinement had given him ""a chance to reflect on my action."" 
""I can assure your honor, my family, the government that I will never appear before yourself or another courtroom again,"" he said in court before Oetken read the sentence. 
Fruman, whose four children were present in the federal courtroom in Manhattan on Friday, must surrender on March 14.
He was also ordered to pay a $10,000 fine. 
The sentence was below prosecutors' recommendation that Fruman spend 37 to 46 months in prison.
Fruman, who pleaded guilty last year, had sought no time behind bars, saying he had already accepted responsibility and spent the more than two years in home confinement since his October 2019 arrest
The government originally charged the Belarus-born Fruman and another former Giuliani associate, Ukraine-born Lev Parnas, with concealing an illegal $325,000 donation to support Trump's 2020 failed bid to be re-elected U.S. president.
Fruman's plea related to an effort to obtain legal, recreational marijuana distribution licenses by donating to candidates in U.S. states where he sought to do business.
Last year, Fruman said he understood that foreign nationals could not contribute to U.S. political campaigns, but nonetheless sent a list of officials to whom he planned to donate to a foreign national backing the cannabis venture. 
Prosecutors identified the foreign national as Andrey Muraviev, a Moscow-based businessman. 
Parnas was convicted of violating campaign finance laws in an October trial.

Before the charges against Fruman and Parnas were brought, Giuliani had enlisted the pair to help uncover dirt on Biden and Biden's son Hunter during Trump's re-election bid. 
Giuliani has not been charged and denies wrongdoing.

Lindenbaum, a Democrat, is a lawyer in Washington, D.C., where she has counseled clients on complying with state and federal campaign finance laws and represented them before the FEC. 
Her nomination as one of the FEC's six commissioners comes after Biden and congressional Democrats failed to pass voting rights legislation amid Republican opposition. The legislation would have strengthened the FEC's enforcement powers. 

By law, no more than three FEC commissioners can represent the same political party, and at least four votes are required for any official FEC action. Commissioners serve in staggered six-year terms.
Lindenbaum replaces Vice Chair Steven Walther, an independent who was generally seen as aligned with the FEC's two Democrats. The other three commissioners are Republicans, meaning Lindenbaum's appointment maintains the FEC's 3-3 split.

GENEVA (Reuters) -The top U.S. and Russian diplomats made no major breakthrough at talks on Ukraine on Friday but agreed to keep talking to try to resolve a crisis that has stoked fears of a military conflict.
After the talks in Geneva, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned of a ""swift, severe"" response if Russia invades Ukraine after massing troops near its border. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow was still waiting for a written response to its demands for security guarantees.
But both said they were open to further dialogue, and Blinken saw grounds to hope that mutual security concerns could be addressed.
""Based on the conversations we've had - the extensive conversations - over the past week and today here in Geneva I think there are grounds for and a means to address some of the mutual concerns that we have about security,"" Blinken said.
He described the talks as ""frank and substantive"" and said Russia now faced a choice.
""It can choose the path of diplomacy that can lead to peace and security, or the path that will lead only to conflict, severe consequences and international condemnation,"" Blinken told reporters, adding that diplomacy would be preferable.
""We've been clear - if any Russian military forces move across Ukraine's border, that's a renewed invasion. It will be met with swift, severe and a united response from the United States and our partners and allies.""
Lavrov said the ball was in Washington's court.
Describing the meeting as open and useful, he said Moscow would understand whether talks were on the right track once it had received a written response to its sweeping security demands from the United States.
Russia's demands include a halt to NATO's eastward expansion and a pledge that Ukraine will never be allowed to join the Western military alliance. 
""I can't tell you if we're on the right track or the wrong track. We'll understand this when we receive the American response on paper to all the points in our proposal,"" Lavrov said.
Tatiana Stanovaya, head of political analysis firm R.Politik, commented on Telegram: ""This is partly a trap, of course, because any such written response will be used to discredit the U.S. negotiating position.""
Blinken said he expected to share with Russia ""our concerns and ideas in more detail and in writing next week"" and said he and Lavrov had ""agreed to further discussions after that"".
Russia and the United States could hold another meeting next month to discuss Moscow's demands for security guarantees, Russia's RIA news agency quoted a source in the Russian delegation as saying.
'LET'S NOT GET AHEAD OF OURSELVES'
Lavrov said Russia had worries of its own, ""not about invented threats, but real facts that no one hides - pumping Ukraine with weapons, sending hundreds of western military instructors"".
Asked about the possibility of a summit between President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden, Lavrov was circumspect.
""Let's not get ahead of ourselves, President Putin is always ready for contacts with President Biden, it's clear these contacts need to be seriously prepared,"" he said.
Blinken said of another potential meeting between Biden and Putin: ""If we conclude, and the Russians conclude, that the best way to resolve things is through a further conversation between them, we're certainly prepared do that.""
The two presidents met in Geneva in June last year.
Washington’s hopes of building a united front of opposition to Moscow were complicated by Biden's comments at a news conference on Wednesday in which he suggested that allies might be divided on how to respond to a ""minor incursion"" by Russia into Ukraine. 
Biden and his administration sought to row back on that on Thursday, with the president saying that ""if any, any assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border that is an invasion"".
Before Friday's meeting, Blinken swung through Europe to try to shore up U.S. allies' commitments to hit Russia with economic sanctions if it goes ahead with an invasion of Ukraine.
In Kyiv on Wednesday, Blinken assured Ukraine of U.S. support. Blinken, before meeting German, French and British officials in Berlin on Thursday, said Putin could order an invasion imminently.

Blinken spoke with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba over the phone on Friday and briefed him on his meetings with European and Russian officials, the State Department said in a statement, reaffirming Washington's support for Kyiv.
Blinken’s deputy, Wendy Sherman, and Lavrov’s deputy, Sergei Ryabkov, also met in Geneva last week, without a breakthrough.

LONDON (Reuters) - A rebellion against Prime Minister Boris Johnson by some of his Conservative Party's newest members of parliament (MPs) quickly collapsed this week - but might just be a foretaste of the trouble ahead.
If nothing else, the revolt showed that lawmakers' loyalty to Johnson is heavily conditional on his reputation as a vote-winner, and that that reputation is in severe jeopardy.
Next week, a civil service report is expected to be published on a series of gatherings that appeared to fly in the face of coronavirus lockdowns and have already battered Johnson's standing among voters - and that could be the cue for more seasoned and formidable rivals to move against him.
Many of the rebels were elected as first-time MPs in 2019 by constituencies that had not voted for the Conservatives for decades, and felt they owed those surprise victories to Johnson.
But dissent had been growing for months before the rebels met twice early in the week to gauge the appetite for trying to force Johnson out, according to lawmakers, some of whom attended the meetings. All asked to remain anonymous.
They agreed to start the process of forcing a parliamentary no-confidence vote against Johnson, who is under huge personal pressure over revelations about gatherings at his official Downing Street premises, and has urged critics to await the outcome of civil servant Sue Gray's investigation.
One of the new MPs said they had been struggling with the direction of the party and Johnson's government since November. With the steady drip-feed of reports of lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street, they became bolder. 
Some were frustrated at having to vote for policies they disagreed with, some felt Johnson's administration was failing to engage with Conservative MPs, and many were angry at how missteps, scandals and policy were being dealt with.
Johnson has repeatedly said no COVID-19 rules were broken at Downing Street, but did apologise for attending a gathering on May 20, 2020, for which staff had invited by one of his aides to ""bring your own booze"". 
""OVEREXCITED""
One disgruntled lawmaker described Johnson's responses to the allegations, including his argument that he was not aware the event was anything other than a work meeting, as ""bullshit"".
By Tuesday, some thought they might have collected enough support to pass the 54 written expressions of discontent needed to trigger a vote of no-confidence in Johnson in the parliamentary party.
But their plot was flawed. They failed to agree on a successor, did not work out a game plan to gather the numbers they lacked, and were confronted by a party machine that undermined their attack, the sources told Reuters.
Within a day, it became clear that the threshold of 54 letters had not been met. A few hours later one of their colleagues, Christian Wakeford, quit the Conservatives to join the opposition Labour Party.
Several older Conservatives were less than surprised when the plot failed.
One veteran Conservative MP who has been involved in training potential candidates said the new intake had not been hardened by the experience of previous unsuccessful campaigns to get elected.
In addition, the fact that much of their parliamentary work has been conducted virtually, because of coronavirus restrictions, means they have missed out on a more usual initiation into their parliamentary party and the work of an MP.
""When they are getting emails and letters from disaffected voters, some of whom would never vote Tory (Conservative) anyway, they are getting spooked,"" said one senior Conservative lawmaker, adding that the new cohort did not know enough other older members in parliament from whom to seek advice.

""They are all a bit overexcited,"" said another senior Conservative. 
But ""overexcited"" is not the same as ""wrong"". Sue Gray's civil service report is awaited more keenly than most.

Speaking in Australia, British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Britain and its allies in the ""free world"" must respond together to global threats, deepen ties with democracies in the Indo-Pacific and ""face down global aggressors"" who were using economic dependence to try to get what they want. 
Truss and Britain's defence secretary, Ben Wallace, met their Australian counterparts in Sydney for the annual Australia-United Kingdom Ministerial Consultations (AUKMIN), where a deal for Australia to acquire nuclear submarines was discussed.
Australia's defence minister, Peter Dutton, said there was no plan to establish a British military base in Australia. The two countries signed deals to fund infrastructure in the region as a counter to Beijing's influence. 
In a joint statement, the ministers expressed concern at Russia's military build-up on the border with Ukraine and ""their absolute support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity"". Russia denies planning to invade Ukraine.
In a speech at the Lowy Institute foreign affairs think tank, Truss said Putin should ""desist and step back from Ukraine before he makes a massive strategic mistake.""
Truss said ""invasion will only lead to a terrible quagmire and loss of life, as we know from the 1979-1989 Soviet-Afghan war and conflict in Chechnya.""
Global aggressors ""are emboldened in a way we haven’t seen since the Cold War,"" Truss said. 
""They seek to export dictatorship as a service around the world ... That is why regimes like Belarus, North Korea and Myanmar find their closest allies in Moscow and Beijing.""
Britain should work with allies such as Australia, Israel, India, Japan and Indonesia to ""face down global aggressors"", especially in the Pacific.
China's ""economic coercion"" of Australia was ""one of the wake-up calls"" to Britain that Beijing was using its economic might to exert control over other countries, she said.
Beijing, which imposed trade sanctions on Australian goods after Canberra called for an international investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, has denied accusations of economic coercion.

Asked about the UK-Australia talks and their focus on countering China's growing clout, the foreign ministry in Beijing rejected such conclusions.
""On the so-called China threat, it is also based on nonsense, China firmly objects to this, we urge relevant parties not to go further on the wrong path of creating division and confrontation,"" Zhao Lijian, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman told a daily briefing on Friday.

WELLINGTON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Life-saving water supplies from a New Zealand navy ship were distributed across Tonga's main island on Friday, as other countries battled the logistics of delivering aid to one of the world's remotest communities.
Six days after the South Pacific archipelago was devastated by a volcanic eruption and tsunami that deposited a blanket of ash and polluted its water sources, the HMNZS Aotearoa docked in the capital, Nuku’alofa.
The ship carried 250,000 litres of water and desalination equipment able to produce 70,000 litres more per day, New Zealand's High Commission said.
""Trucks ... have begun collecting and delivering water supplies from Aotearoa,"" the Commission said on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
The first flights from Australia and New Zealand landed on Thursday with some water as well as shelter, communication equipment and generators.
On Thursday, an Australian flight was forced to return to base because of a positive COVID-19 case onboard, while on Friday technical problems delayed one of two Japanese C-130 transporters carrying 5,000 litres of drinking water, Japan's Self-Defence Forces said.
Underlining the complexity of mounting a contactless international aid operation to one of the few countries free of COVID-19, the Australian plane was turned around mid-flight after PCR tests showed a positive result, an Australian defence spokeswoman told Reuters.
All crew had earlier returned negative rapid antigen tests, she said. The supplies were moved to another flight that took off on Friday.
The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano eruption last Saturday triggered a tsunami that destroyed villages and resorts and knocked out communications for the nation of about 105,000 people. Three people have been reported killed, authorities said.
The salt water from the tsunami spoiled most sources of water and Tongans have been struggling to find clean water as they clear away the ash.
""We are cleaning the ash and have been since Monday,"" said Branko Sugar, 61, who runs a bottle shop and fishing charter business from Nuku'alofa.
""Everything is so dusty, and we are running out of water,"" he said over a patchy telephone line. ""We only have the tap water, and it's been contaminated. We... can hardly breathe for all the dust.""
URGENT ASSISTANCE NEEDED
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center has said the force of the eruption was estimated to be equivalent to 5-10 megatons of TNT, or more than 500 times that of the nuclear bomb the United States dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima at the end of World War Two.
Astronaut Kayla Barron said she could see the volcanic ash in the atmosphere from the International Space Station.
""I opened the window shutter to see if we could see any effects of the eruption, and saw this dramatic, high-altitude plume blocking out the sun,"" Barron said on Facebook.
NASA released photographs showing a huge grey smudge over the blue Pacific.
United Nations spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told a briefing Tonga had asked for urgent assistance.
""We remain seriously concerned about access to safe water for 50,000 people ... Water quality testing continues, and most people are relying on bottled water,"" he said, speaking before the Aotearoa arrived.
Dujarric said there were reports of fuel shortages, while some 60,000 Tongans have been affected by damage to crops, livestock and fisheries due to ashfall, saltwater intrusion and the potential for acid rain.
Many have turned to social media to post images of the destruction by the tsunami and give accounts of their shock after the massive explosion, while tales of incredible escapes from the disaster have also emerged.
Sea-borne assistance was also en route for the archipelago.
Australia's HMAS Adelaide was due in Tonga next week after leaving Brisbane.
Reliance, a repair ship due to reconnect the undersea cable that links Tonga to international telecoms networks, left its Port Moresby mooring and was expected in Tonga on Jan. 30, according to Refinitiv data on shipping movements. 
The Reliance's operator, SubCom, did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for confirmation.

Telephone links between Tonga and the outside world were reconnected late on Wednesday, although restoring full internet services https://tmsnrt.rs/3qzVPyy is expected to take a month or more.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk asked in a post on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) if Tongans would like help from his Starlink project, which provides internet connection through satellites.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) -A Japanese-Australian venture producing hydrogen from brown coal is set to start loading its maiden cargo on the world's first liquid hydrogen carrier on Friday, in a test delayed by nearly a year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The Suiso Frontier, built by Japan's Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI), arrived Australia this week from Kobe, following a longer trip than the expected 16 days as the ship dodged bad weather and rough seas, said a spokesperson for the Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain (HESC) venture. The ship is scheduled to head back to Japan in about a week.
Led by KHI, HESC is a A$500 million ($360 million) coal-to-hydrogen project backed by Japan and Australia as a way to switch to cleaner energy and cut carbon emissions.
Hydrogen, seen as a path to decarbonising industries that rely on coal, gas and oil, is key to Japan's goal to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Australia aims to become a major exporter of the fuel. 
The Australian government on Friday committed a further A$7.5 million for HESC's A$184 million pre-commercialisation phase, and A$20 million for testing a capture and storage project for carbon dioxide released in the coal-to-hydrogen process to create a carbon neutral product. 
Last year, HESC started extracting 70 kg of hydrogen a day from brown coal in the Latrobe Valley, about 135 km (84 miles) east of Melbourne, where brown coal mines have long fuelled some of Australia's most polluting power stations. 
The hydrogen is produced by reacting coal with oxygen and steam under high heat and pressure. It is then trucked to a port site where it is cooled to minus 253 degrees Celsius (minus 423 Fahrenheit), liquefying it for export. 
The partners are looking to produce up to 225,000 tonnes of hydrogen a year. 
They will need to make a final investment decision by 2025, with Australia racing against countries in the Middle East and elsewhere to produce carbon neutral hydrogen, said Jeremy Stone, a director of J-Power, one of the HESC partners. 

Partners in the project include Japan's Electric Power Development Co, Iwatani Corp, Marubeni Corp, Sumitomo Corp and Australia's AGL Energy (OTC:AGLXY) Ltd, whose mine is supplying the brown coal.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia's central bank on Thursday proposed banning the use and mining of cryptocurrencies on Russian territory, citing threats to financial stability, citizens' wellbeing and its monetary policy sovereignty.
The move is the latest in a global cryptocurrency crackdown as governments from Asia to the United States worry that privately operated and highly volatile digital currencies could undermine their control of financial and monetary systems. 
Russia has argued for years against cryptocurrencies, saying they could be used in money laundering or to finance terrorism. It eventually gave them legal status in 2020 but banned their use as a means of payment nL1N2T110W.
In a report published on Thursday, the central bank said speculative demand primarily determined cryptocurrencies' rapid growth and that they carried characteristics of a financial pyramid, warning of potential bubbles in the market, threatening financial stability and citizens. 
The bank proposed preventing financial institutions from carrying out any operations with cryptocurrencies and said mechanisms should be developed to block transactions aimed at buying or selling cryptocurrencies for fiat currencies. 
The proposed ban includes crypto exchanges. Cryptocurrency exchange Binance told Reuters it was committed to working with regulators and hoped the report's release would spawn dialogue with the central bank on protecting the interests of Russian crypto users.
Restrictions on owning cryptocurrency are not envisaged, said Elizaveta Danilova, head of the central bank's financial stability department. 
Active cryptocurrency users, Russians have an annual transaction volume of about $5 billion, the bank said.
SHADOWING CHINA?
The central bank said it would work with regulators in countries where crypto exchanges are registered to collect information about the operations of Russian clients. It pointed to steps taken in other countries, such as China, to curb cryptocurrency activity.
In September, China intensified its crackdown nL1N2QQ0MG on cryptocurrencies with a blanket ban on all crypto transactions and mining, hitting bitcoin and other major coins and pressuring crypto and blockchain-related stocks. 
""For now there are no plans to ban cryptocurrencies similar to the experience of China,"" Danilova said. ""The approach we have proposed will suffice.""
Joseph Edwards, head of financial strategy at crypto firm Solrise Group, played down the report's significance, saying no one outside Russia would be losing sleep over it. 
""Moscow, like Beijing, is always rattling its sabre over 'crypto bans', but Russia has never been a pillar of any facet of the industry in the same way as China has been at times,"" he said. 
CRYPTO MINING
Russia is the world's third-largest player in bitcoin mining, behind the United States and Kazakhstan, though the latter may see a miner exodus over fears of tightening regulation following unrest earlier this month.
The Bank of Russia said crypto mining created problems for energy consumption. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are ""mined"" by powerful computers that compete against others hooked up to a global network to solve complex mathematical puzzles. The process guzzles electricity and is often powered by fossil fuels. 
""The best solution is to introduce a ban on cryptocurrency mining in Russia,"" the bank said. 
In August, Russia accounted for 11.2% https://ccaf.io/cbeci/mining_map of the global ""hashrate"" - crypto jargon for the amount of computing power being used by computers connected to the bitcoin network.

Moscow-based BitRiver, which operates data centres in Siberia hosting bitcoin miners, said it did not consider a complete crypto ban likely, expecting a balanced position to develop once different ministries have discussed the proposals. 
The central bank, which is planning to issue its own digital rouble, said crypto assets becoming widespread would limit the sovereignty of monetary policy, with higher interest rates needed to contain inflation.

(Reuters) -The prosecutor for Georgia's biggest county on Thursday requested a special grand jury with subpoena power to aid her investigation into then-President Donald Trump's efforts to influence the U.S. state's 2020 election results. 
In a letter to Fulton County's chief judge, first reported by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, District Attorney Fani Willis wrote that multiple witnesses being probed have refused to cooperate absent a subpoena requiring their testimony. 
""Therefore, I am hereby requesting ... that a special purpose grand jury be impaneled for the purpose of investigating the facts and circumstances relating directly or indirectly to possible attempts to disrupt the lawful administration of the 2020 elections in the State of Georgia,"" Willis wrote.
The investigation https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-georgia-investigations-idINKBN2AB0BR by Willis, a Democrat, is the most serious probe facing Trump in Georgia after he was recorded in a phone call pressuring Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to overturn the state's election results based on unfounded claims of voter fraud.
Willis specifically mentioned that Raffensperger, whom she described as an ""essential witness,"" had indicated he would only take part in an interview once presented with a subpoena. 
In a statement, Trump defended what he called his ""perfect"" phone call and repeated false allegations of voter fraud in the 2020 election. 
In a separate legal woe for the Trump family, the U.S. House of Representatives' panel investigating the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol on Thursday requested an interview https://www.reuters.com/world/us/jan-6-panel-plans-seek-testimony-ivanka-trump-cnn-2022-01-20 with Trump's daughter and former White House aide Ivanka Trump. 
And earlier this week, New York state's attorney general accused Trump's family business of repeatedly misrepresenting the value of its assets https://www.reuters.com/business/ny-attorney-general-seeks-testimony-trump-his-children-legal-action-over-2022-01-19 to obtain financial benefits, citing what it said was significant new evidence of possible fraud.
Trump critics hope that his legal problems may ultimately stymie a potential presidential run in 2024. 
""It begins,"" Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island tweeted after news of the Georgia request.
'FINDING' VOTES 
In her letter, Willis said a special grand jury, which can subpoena witnesses, was needed because jurors can be impaneled for longer periods and focus exclusively on a single probe. 
A spokesperson for the superior courts in Fulton County, which encompasses most of the state capital Atlanta, said there was no immediate timeline for a response to Willis' request.

During the Jan. 2, 2021 call, Trump urged Raffensperger, a fellow Republican, to ""find"" enough votes to overturn his Georgia loss to Democrat Joe Biden. The transcript quotes Trump telling Raffensperger: ""I just want to find 11,780 votes,"" which is the number Trump needed to win Georgia.
Legal experts have said Trump's phone calls may have violated at least three state election laws: conspiracy to commit election fraud, criminal solicitation to commit election fraud and intentional interference with performance of election duties. The possible felony and misdemeanor violations are punishable by fines or imprisonment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators is discussing a scaled-back law focused on safeguarding election results and protecting election officials from harassment following Democrats' twin defeats on a voting-rights bill.
Lawmakers led by Republican Senator Susan Collins and including conservative Democrats Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, are due to meet virtually on Friday to discuss reform of the 1887 Electoral Count Act, sometimes called the ECA, which allows members of Congress to dispute presidential election results.
The ECA provided the basis for an effort by former President Donald Trump and his Republican allies to overturn the presidential election on Jan. 6, 2021, when thousands of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol and interrupted the certification of election results.
Collins, who said her group includes six Democrats, told reporters that the aim is ""an election reform bill that is truly bipartisan, that would address many of the problems that arose on Jan. 6 and that would help restore confidence in our elections."" 
Senator Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, is separately preparing to introduce ECA reform legislation that would curb the role of Congress and place responsibility for resolving disputes and challenges with states, according to an aide.
The White House welcomed the efforts but made clear it did not regard ECA reform as a substitute for broad voting-rights legislation. 
""Certainly, the president is open to engaging with, talking with, as we are, even though it's not a substitute, Republicans and others who are interested in moving forward,"" White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters.
Lawmakers believe there is bipartisan support in Congress for such initiatives.
""We see what happened in the insurrection,"" said Manchin, who is leading the Democratic side of the bipartisan effort. ""We're going to get a bunch of people together, Democrats and Republicans, and get a good piece of legislation that protects the counting of the vote.""
Manchin spoke a day after he and Sinema stymied an attempt by their fellow Democrats to overturn the Senate's 60-vote threshold for most legislation and pass sweeping voting rights legislation with a simple majority. 
The Jan. 6 Capitol riot and a wave of new restrictive voting laws in Republican-led states spawned by Trump's false claims of a stolen 2020 election have raised concerns about the integrity of the U.S. election system.
Manchin said he wants threatening or accosting an election official to be a federal crime. 
After the Democratic voting-rights effort failed on Wednesday, senators said there could be scope to meet the 60-vote threshold with more limited legislation aimed at curbing congressional intervention in presidential elections through ECA reform.
""The people who tried to overturn the last election focused on using that act in a way that would have subverted the will of the people. And so there's interest in clarifying the act,"" Republican Senator Mitt Romney, a member of the Collins group, told reporters.
Collins provided no timeline for producing a bill and said the group has many issues to resolve up front. But she added that their model is the bipartisan talks that produced last year's $1 trillion infrastructure bill. 
Time is running short for lawmakers to act. Campaigning is already under way ahead of the Nov. 8 elections when Republicans are favored to regain a majority in at least one chamber of Congress, and the first nominating contests take place in Texas on March 1.
The Collins group is also considering proposals to protect elected officials from harassment and unwarranted removal from office, address election security and improve election management, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has said that ECA reform is worth discussing in comments that Democrats including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer later dismissed.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) -The United Nations General Assembly on Thursday agreed on a definition of denial of the Holocaust, when the Nazis killed 6 million Jews during World War Two, and urged social media companies ""to take active measures"" to combat antisemitism.
""The General Assembly is sending a strong and unambiguous message against the denial or the distortion of these historical facts,"" said Germany's U.N. Ambassador Antje Leendertse. ""Ignoring historical facts increases the risk that they will be repeated.""
The 193-member General Assembly adopted the resolution - drafted by Israel and Germany - without a vote. However, Iran disassociated itself.
Speaking to the General Assembly, Israel's U.N. Ambassador Gilad Erdan made a veiled reference to Iran. 
""Nations with seats in this hall openly deny the Holocaust, casting doubt on its occurrence and praising its perpetrators,"" he said. ""In fact, those that most blatantly deny that Jews suffered a genocide are the ones now threatening Jews with another genocide.""
Later, an Iranian diplomat, who Iran's U.N. mission did not identify, accused Israel of exploiting ""the sufferings of the Jewish people in the past as a cover for the crimes it has perpetrated"" and questioning the resolution for ""an awkward approach towards historical studies."" 
Israel's U.N. mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Iran's statement to the General Assembly.
The General Assembly resolution spelled out that distortion and denial of the Holocaust refers to: 
* Intentional efforts to excuse or minimize the impact of the Holocaust or its principal elements, including collaborators and allies of Nazi Germany.
* Gross minimization of the number of the victims of the Holocaust in contradiction to reliable sources.
* Attempts to blame the Jews for causing their own genocide.
* Statements that cast the Holocaust as a positive historical event.
* Attempts to blur the responsibility for the establishment of concentration and death camps devised and operated by Nazi Germany by putting blame on other nations or ethnic groups.

It ""urges member states and social media companies to take active measures to combat antisemitism and Holocaust denial or distortion by means of information and communications technologies and to facilitate reporting of such content.""
The General Assembly meeting on Thursday coincided with the 80th anniversary of the Wannsee Conference, when the Nazis met to coordinate the ""final solution"" - their plan to exterminate the Jews.

BERLIN/KYIV (Reuters) - The United States and Western countries sought to project unity and a tough stance over Ukraine on Thursday, after U.S. President Joe Biden suggested allies were split over how to react to any potential ""minor incursion"" from Russia.
Biden rowed back on his comments, made during a Wednesday news conference, saying on Thursday that ""I have been absolutely clear with President (Vladimir) Putin, he has no misunderstanding. If any, any assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border that is an invasion"". 
Such an invasion would be met by a ""severe and coordinated response, economic response as discussed in details with our allies, as laid out very clearly with President Putin,"" Biden told reporters.
His remarks echoed efforts from other members of the administration earlier on Thursday and late on Wednesday, as the White House sought to scotch any suggestion that a smaller-scale Russian military incursion would meet a weaker U.S. response.
Russia has massed tens of thousands of troops on its borders with Ukraine, and Western states fear Moscow is planning a new assault on a country it invaded in 2014. Russia denies it is planning an attack, but says it could take unspecified military action if a list of demands are not met, including a promise from NATO never to admit Ukraine as a member.
At his Wednesday news conference, Biden said he expected Putin to launch some kind of action, and appeared to suggest Washington and its allies might disagree over the response if Moscow stopped short of a major invasion.
""It's one thing if it's a minor incursion and we end up having to fight about what to do and what to not do, et cetera,"" the president said, adding that an invasion would be a ""disaster"" for Russia.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy responded sharply to that on Thursday, tweeting in English and Ukrainian:
""We want to remind the great powers that there are no minor incursions and small nations. Just as there are no minor casualties and little grief from the loss of loved ones,"" 
Biden's remarks on Wednesday sent his administration and allies quickly into damage control mode, with a stress on unity.
""No matter which path Russia chooses, it will find the United States, Germany, and our allies, united,"" said Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking at a press conference with German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock during a visit to Berlin to meet ministers from Britain, France and Germany.
""We urgently demand that Russia takes steps towards deescalation. Any further aggressive behaviour or aggression would result in serious consequences,"" Baerbock told the news conference.
NO GREEN LIGHT FOR INVASION
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Biden's ""minor incursion"" comment was not a green light to a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""Be in no doubt that if Russia were to make any kind of incursion into Ukraine, or on any scale, whatever, I think that that would be a disaster, not just for Ukraine, but for Russia.""
Moscow, for its part, said U.S. threats of sanctions were not calming the situation.
With Western countries having long emphasised their united position in public, some officials privately expressed frustration at Biden's remarks on Wednesday, although they described them as a gaffe, unlikely to alter Moscow's calculations.
""It was not helpful, in fact it was a gift to Putin, but we should not read too much into it. Biden has not given Moscow the green light for an attack on Ukraine. It was a slip of his tongue, and the official Western position will prevail,"" said one Western security source.
Moscow presented the West with a list of security demands at talks last week that produced no breakthrough.
Western countries have imposed repeated rounds of economic sanctions since Russian troops seized and annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014. 
But such moves have had scant impact on Russian policy, with Moscow, Europe's main energy supplier, calculating that the West would stop short of steps serious enough to interfere with gas exports. 
U.S. and European officials say there are still strong financial measures that have not been tried. Germany has signalled that it could halt Nord Stream 2, a new gas pipeline from Russia that skirts Ukraine, if Moscow invades.

But Germany could find itself in a no-win situation if Russia invades Ukraine, pitting Berlin's main gas supplier against its most important security allies.
Meanwhile, Turkish diplomatic sources said on Thursday that both Russia and Ukraine are open to the idea of Turkey playing a role to ease tensions between the two countries, as proposed by Ankara in November.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A judge on Thursday refused to release from jail a member of the far-right Oath Keepers group charged with seditious conspiracy https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-arrests-far-right-militia-group-oath-keepers-leader-jan-6-probe-nyt-2022-01-13 over allegations he helped plan the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Edward Vallejo, one of 11 people prosecutors have linked to the Oath Keepers and accused of seditious conspiracy, lost an attempt to be released from jail while he awaits trial.
""You are a serious danger at this time,"" U.S. Magistrate Judge John Boyle in Phoenix, Arizona, said during a court hearing and ruled pretrial detention was necessary for Vallejo, 63.
In a Jan. 18 court filing, the Justice Department said Vallejo was a co-conspirator in a plot orchestrated by Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes to attack Congress and forcefully oppose the transfer of power between then-President Donald Trump, a Republican, to his successor, Biden, a Democrat. The riot was fueled by Trump's false claims that his November 2020 election defeat was the result of fraud.
""Vallejo played a central role in the planned use of force in this plot, agreeing and preparing to usher firearms and other related equipment into Washington, D.C., to his co-conspirators,"" the Justice Department said in the court filing.
The judge said the evidence suggests Vallejo would have ushered the firearms into the District of Columbia if Rhodes had given such an order.
""I think if Mr. Rhodes had given that order, you would have complied,"" Boyle said in court on Thursday.
Prosecutors said that Vallejo ""also poses a risk of obstruction of justice should he be released.""

Vallejo's lawyer said at the court hearing that he would plead not guilty to all charges. 
An indictment released on Jan. 13 against the 11 was the first time suspected participants in the attack were charged with seditious conspiracy, which is defined as attempting ""to overthrow, put down or to destroy by force the government of the United States.""

By Steve Gorman
(Reuters) - NASA on Wednesday embarked on a months-long, painstaking process of bringing its newly launched James Webb Space Telescope into focus, a task due for completion in time for the revolutionary eye in the sky to begin peering into the cosmos by early summer.
Mission control engineers at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore began by sending their initial commands to tiny motors called actuators that slowly position and fine-tune the telescope's principal mirror.
Consisting of 18 hexagonal segments of gold-plated beryllium metal, the primary mirror measures 21 feet 4 inches (6.5 m) in diameter - a much larger light-collecting surface than Webb's predecessor, the 30-year-old Hubble Space Telescope.
The 18 segments, which had been folded together to fit inside the cargo bay of the rocket that carried the telescope to space, were unfurled with the rest of its structural components during a two-week period following Webb's launch on Dec. 25.
Those segments must now be detached from fasteners that held them in place for the launch and then moved forward half an inch from their original configuration - a 10-day process - before they can be aligned to form a single, unbroken, light-collecting surface.
The alignment will take an additional three months, Lee Feinberg, the Webb optical telescope element manager at Goddard, told Reuters by telephone.
Aligning the primary mirror segments to form one large mirror means each segment ""is aligned to one-five-thousandth the thickness of a human hair"", Feinberg said.
""All of this required us to invent things that had never been done before,"" such as the actuators, which were built to move incrementally at minus 400 Fahrenheit (minus 240 Celsius) in the vacuum of space, he added.
The telescope's smaller, secondary mirror, designed to direct light collected from the primary lens into Webb's camera and other instruments, must also be aligned to operate as part of a cohesive optical system.
If all goes as planned, the telescope should be ready to capture its first science images in May, which would be processed over about another month before they can be released to the public, Feinberg said.
The $9-billion telescope, described by NASA as the premier space-science observatory of the next decade, will mainly view the cosmos in the infrared spectrum, allowing it to gaze through clouds of gas and dust where stars are being born. Hubble has operated primarily at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths.
Webb is about 100 times more powerful than Hubble, enabling it to observe objects at greater distances, thus farther back in time, than Hubble or any other telescope.

Astronomers say this will bring into view a glimpse of the cosmos never previously seen - dating to just 100 million years after the Big Bang, the theoretical flashpoint that set in motion the expansion of the observable universe an estimated 13.8 billion years ago.
The telescope is an international collaboration led by NASA in partnership with the European and Canadian space agencies.  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC) was the primary contractor.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Days after U.S. President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, two of his top immigration advisors outlined bold plans, including a major immigration reform bill, a 100-day deportation moratorium, and a strategy to restore protections for asylum seekers that were degraded under former President Donald Trump.
One year later, those goals remain unfulfilled after Biden officials spent much of his first year in office grappling with record-breaking border arrests, unfavorable court decisions on immigration, Republican opposition in Congress and internal divisions https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-children-insight-idCAKBN2C21FH between liberals and moderates within his own administration.
Now, the two White House officials who touted the plans, Tyler Moran and Esther Olavarria, are preparing to leave the administration, a White House spokesperson confirmed to Reuters. Both previously worked for immigration advocacy groups and underscored Biden's move away from Trump policies. 
Their departures are part of a greater exodus of senior Biden immigration staffers that suggests planned reforms could be put on hold or abandoned altogether as power tips to more security-minded White House officials. In the remaining camp is Susan Rice, director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, who has tended to push for tougher enforcement at the border.
A White House spokesperson contested reports of internal divisions, saying that ""everyone in this administration from the president on down is committed to building  a fair, humane and lawful immigration system and bringing it into the 21st century.""
U.S. immigration officials faced the highest illegal border crossings in two decades during Biden's first year in office. Border arrests this fiscal year could surpass last year's 1.7 million, according to current and former officials. 
Another chaotic year at the border could provide ammunition to Republicans, who are expected to focus on immigration https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-see-election-opportunity-biden-border-struggles-2021-12-21, an issue that strongly animates their supporters according to Reuters/Ipsos polling, in the run-up to November congressional elections. 
While several people close to Moran and Olavarria say they are leaving the White House for personal reasons, other U.S. immigration officials who spoke to Reuters have grown frustrated with Biden's decision to retain some controversial Trump policies.
Lise Clavel, currently chief of staff at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, is expected to replace Moran, according to two people familiar with the move. 
Clavel was one of the lead Biden officials tasked with addressing the sudden rise in unaccompanied children arriving at the border in March 2021, but has less of an established connection to advocacy groups than Moran or Olavarria.
Whether the White House has found Olavarria's replacement remains unclear. 
REBUILDING
In a phone interview with Reuters this week, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas defended the Biden administration's immigration record. 
""In this first year, we have been dedicated to rebuilding an immigration system that was dismantled, virtually in its entirety, by the prior administration,"" he said. ""We have had to rescind cruel policies, bring offices back to life, issue new policies, and rebuild entire operations.""
Citing accomplishments away from the U.S.-Mexico border, Mayorkas touted what he called a ""profound shift"" in how federal immigration officers prioritize who to arrest within the interior of the United States.
""We are not targeting non-citizens who have been contributing members of our communities for years and years,"" he said, adding that the focus is now on security threats and recent arrivals.
Mayorkas told Reuters he planned to issue a memorandum that would similarly reform immigration detention practices, but did not provide details or a timetable.
The homeland security secretary highlighted as an ""extraordinary accomplishment"" the efforts to resettle about 80,000 Afghans in the United States since the U.S. military withdrew from the country in late August. 
But at the U.S. southwestern border, Biden has not been able to reverse major Trump-era policies that allow border crossers, including families and asylum seekers, to be sent back to Mexico. 
Heidi Altman, policy director at the National Immigrant Justice Center, which provides legal services to refugees and asylum seekers, said that as senior Biden immigration officials leave, the White House should ""bring in replacements who are committed to making good on those campaign promises that have been broken."" 
Some U.S. officials viewed the Biden administration's decision to deport thousands of asylum-seeking Haitians who set up camp under a bridge in Del Rio, Texas, in September as an embrace of Trump's hardline approach.

About 14,000 Haitians arrived just weeks after the Biden administration had finished a chaotic evacuation from Afghanistan and close to 8,000 were expelled https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-immigration-border-idUKKBN2GD1SL under the Title 42 health policy in the weeks that followed.
According to one State Department official who requested anonymity to discuss internal operations, decisions were made in part because of optics. ""I think people in the White House just felt like they couldn't afford to have another issue on which they seemed to be out of control.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian-backed separatists in east Ukraine would expect Russia's army to fight with them against Ukrainian government forces if Moscow follows through on a parliamentary proposal to recognise their independence, a pro-Kremlin lawmaker said on Thursday. 
Alexander Borodai made the comment after 11 lawmakers proposed that parliament ask President Vladimir Putin to recognise https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/might-russia-recognise-independence-breakaway-east-ukraine-regions-2022-01-20 the independence of the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk regions.
Such a move would mark a major escalation by Russia after weeks of mounting tensions around Ukraine. A Russian military buildup and threatening rhetoric have stoked Western fears of a looming invasion, though Moscow denies any such plan. 
Borodai, a former Donetsk political leader who is now a member of the Russian parliament, said the separatists would look to Russia to help them wrest control of parts of the territory they claim that are now held by Ukrainian forces.
""In the event of (the republics) being recognised, a war will become a direct necessity,"" Borodai told Reuters.
""Russia would have to take on some security responsibilities"" and defend the territories, he said, as it did after recognising the independence of two breakaway Georgian regions after a 2008 war between Russia and Georgia.
The separatists took control of a swathe of eastern Ukraine in 2014 in a conflict that continues to simmer and has killed 15,000 people, according to Kyiv. Ukraine has long accused Russia of having regular troops in the region, something Moscow denies.
Borodai, a lawmaker for the ruling, pro-Putin United Russia party, served as prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic in east Ukraine at the height of the conflict in 2014. He now leads an organisation of war veterans.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Thursday responded cautiously to the proposal on recognition, saying he could not comment until parliament had voted on it. The lawmakers behind it are from the Communist Party, which casts itself as an opposition force but actually often backs the Kremlin.
Two sources familiar with government discussions of the proposal told Reuters the idea of recognising the regions was being seriously considered. 
But a source close to the separatist leadership said the likelihood of such a move was low because it could provoke punitive measures against Russia, potentially entailing serious economic damage.

Orysia Lutsevych, a Ukraine analyst at Chatham House think-tank in London, said recognition could create a legal pretext for a Russian invasion of Donbass to ""protect"" it from Ukraine.
She said it would be a ""clear step of escalation"" requiring a Western response in the form of sanctions against Russia or bolstering NATO forces on the alliance's eastern flank.

(Reuters) - The first aid flights reached Tonga on Thursday with more en route, five days after a devastating volcanic eruption and tsunami, as communities awaited a ship with equipment to scale up supplies of much-needed drinking water. 
A Royal New Zealand Air Force C-130 Hercules carrying disaster relief supplies landed at the South Pacific island nation's Fua'amotu International Airport, a defence spokesperson said, after volcanic ash was cleared off the runway.
Ash has blanketed the archipelago and spoiled much of its drinking water.
An Australian Globemaster C-17A military transporter also landed, carrying desalination equipment, shelter and kitchens, Australian Defence Minister Peter Dutton said. He praised the ""tireless efforts of Tongan authorities"" to clear away ash deposited by the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai.
It erupted with a deafening explosion on Saturday, triggering tsunamis that destroyed villages, resorts and many buildings and knocked out communications for the nation of about 105,000 people.
The tsunamis killed at least three people, authorities said.
Accounts of miraculous escapes also emerged, including that of a 57-year-old being hailed as a ""real life Aquaman"" after recounting how he had to swim for about 27 hours after being swept away.
""I just floated, bashed around by the big waves that kept coming,"" Lisala Folau, who lived on the small, isolated island of Atata, told Tongan radio station Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Broadcasting.
Rachael Moore, Australia's high commissioner to Tonga, said the loss of property had been ""catastrophic"", that parts of the shoreline resembled a ""moonscape"" and that drinking water was ""an extremely high priority"".
One New Zealand navy ship arrived on Thursday and a second, carrying 250,000 litres of water and desalination equipment able to produce 70,000 litres a day, was due on Friday, its High Commission said. 
Speaking to Reuters from the capital Nuku'alofa, journalist Marian Kupu said Tongans were cleaning up all the dust from the volcanic eruption but feared they may run out of drinking water.
""Each home has their own tanks of water supply but most of them are filled with dust so it's not safe,"" Kupu said.
'THERE'S A REAL COMMUNAL EFFORT'
Telephone links between Tonga and the outside world were reconnected late on Wednesday, though restoring full internet services is likely to take a month or more, according to the owner of the archipelago's sole sub-sea communications cable. 
Tongans abroad were frantically calling families back home to ensure they were safe.
""It was very relieving to hear from them,"" said Fatafehi Fakafanua, the speaker of Tonga's legislative assembly, who was in New Zealand when the disaster struck, after making contact with his family.
The government had advised them to drink bottled water and wear masks outside because of the ash.
""There's a fine layer of, a blanket of ash, everywhere and I hear that the public are generally out on the streets trying to clean it up,"" Fakafanua added. ""So there's a real communal effort...It's going to be a long, long, long road to recovery.""
In a radio address, Tonga King Tupou VI urged courage and hard work for the rebuilding process.
The king also received a message of condolence on Thursday from a fellow monarch, Britain's Queen Elizabeth, who said she was ""shocked and saddened"" by the devastation.
""It must be incredibly difficult for those who are unable to contact friends and family while communications are disrupted, and I hope that they will soon be restored,"" Elizabeth said.
The United Nations said that about 84,000 people – more than 80% of the population - has been badly affected by the disaster with safe water ""the biggest life‑saving issue"".

The volcano erupted about 40 miles (65 km) from the Tongan capital with a blast heard 2,300 km away in New Zealand.
Waves reaching up to 15 metres (49 feet) hit the outer Ha'apai island group, destroying all houses on the island of Mango, as well as the west coast of Tonga's main island, Tongatapu, where 56 houses were destroyed or seriously damaged.

""As the current archbishop, I apologise on behalf of the archdiocese for the suffering inflicted on people in the area of the church in recent decades,"" Marx said in a statement.
Earlier, Munich law firm Westpfahl Spilker Wastl published a report into allegations of sexual abuse in the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising between 1945 and 2019. The report, commissioned by the archdiocese, said there were at least 497 victims of abuse, mainly young males. 
The report said the archbishop, a leading progressive in the Church, had mishandled two suspected cases. He is not under suspicion of having participated in abuse or cover-ups.
Marx said changes had already been started in the last 10 years but more was needed, and stressed the importance of pushing ahead with the ""Synodal Path"", a movement aimed at giving lay Catholics more influence over the running of the church.
""Now is the time to pick up the momentum that the report gives and to take further steps into the future,"" said Marx whose offer of resignation last year over the abuse crisis was rejected by Pope Francis.

Marx said the archdiocese would carefully read and analyse the report and present a full response next week.
A spokesperson for Benedict did not immediately respond to a request for comment while the Vatican said it would evaluate the full report and examine its details.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) -An Australian court said on Thursday it dismissed tennis superstar Novak Djokovic's challenge to his visa cancellation as the minister who revoked it reasonably believed Djokovic, who is not vaccinated against COVID-19, may be a risk to the community.
The Federal Court also rejected the argument there was no evidence that Djokovic had ever urged anyone not to get vaccinated, saying it was open to infer that the public would perceive that he was opposed to vaccinations, since he said he had not been vaccinated.
""An iconic world tennis star may influence people of all ages, young or old, but perhaps especially the young and the impressionable, to emulate him. This is not fanciful; it does not need evidence,"" the judges said.
Djokovic's saga has fuelled global debate over the rights of people who opt not to get vaccinated as governments look to protect the community from the coronavirus pandemic.
Djokovic was deported from Australia on Sunday night, just hours after the court dismissed his effort to stay in the country to play at the Australian Open, where he hoped to win a record 21st major title.
That followed an 11-day rollercoaster involving two visa cancellations, two court challenges and five nights in two stints at an immigration detention hotel where asylum seekers are held.
His lawyers had argued the cancellation should be quashed on the grounds that Immigration Minister Alex Hawke's decision was irrational, he lacked evidence that Djokovic's presence in Australia may stoke anti-vaccination sentiment, and had failed to consider that deporting Djokovic might inflame anti-vax sentiment.
The Federal Court said while another minister might have decided not to cancel the visa, Immigration Minister Alex Hawke had followed the right steps under the law which allows him to cancel a visa as long as he is satisfed the visa holder ""may be a risk to the health or good order of the Australian community"".
""The minister reached that state of satisfaction on grounds that cannot be said to be irrational or illogical or not based on relevant material,"" Chief Justice James Allsop and judges Anthony Besanko and David O'Callaghan said in their reasons handed down on Thursday.

The court dismissed the case last Sunday after an emergency weekend hearing, saying it would release reasons later, as it wanted to ensure Djokovic had the decision ahead of the start of the Australian Open the next day. 
The Serbian now risks missing the next tennis Grand Slam event - the French Open - as the country's Sports Ministry has said there would be no exemption from a new vaccine pass law approved on Sunday.

""We solemnly demand that the U.S. side immediately stop such provocative actions, otherwise it will bear the serious consequences of unforeseen events,"" it added.
The U.S. Navy rejected the idea that the Benfold was warned away but appeared to confirm the ship was operating in the area, saying the mission reflected the U.S. Navy's commitment to defend freedom of navigation. 
""The PRC's statement about this mission is false,"" 7th Fleet spokesman Mark Langford said in a statement. The 7th Fleet is part of the U.S. Navy's Pacific force.
The Benfold was conducting what the navy called a freedom of navigation operation ""in accordance with international law,"" the statement said. The ship then ""continued on to conduct normal operations in international waters.""
The U.S. Navy frequently carries out such missions in the South China Sea to challenge Chinese territorial claims.
""The United States is defending every nation's right to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows, as USS Benfold did this week. Nothing the PRC says otherwise will deter us,"" the statement further added.
China has established military outposts on artificial islands in the waters of the South China Sea, which are crossed by vital shipping lanes and also contain gas fields and rich fishing grounds.

The South China Sea has become one of many flashpoints in the testy relationship between China and the United States, with Washington rejecting what it calls unlawful territorial claims by Beijing.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Russia's troop buildup near Ukraine is galvanising NATO defences in Europe that President Vladimir Putin wants to dismantle, giving the alliance a sense of renewal after failures in Afghanistan.
Despite intense diplomacy https://www.reuters.com/world/blinken-arrives-berlin-ukraine-talks-with-european-allies-2022-01-20 with Russia, the United States and its NATO allies say they cannot consider demands that Moscow is making for security guarantees while it masses troops near its neighbour's border and holds live-fire exercises in Belarus. https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/belarus-says-joint-drills-with-russia-run-feb-10-20-2022-01-18
Instead, Western officials, diplomats and former officials say NATO - created in 1949 to deter the Soviet threat - is obliged to consider reinforcements that go against Putin's demand that the alliance must not expand further eastwards.
Neutral countries Finland and Sweden, which have deepened collaboration with the Western alliance, have restarted a debate about joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. 
French President Emmanuel Macron has offered to send troops to Romania, an offer welcomed by Romania's president, and there is the prospect of more NATO troops being sent to the Black Sea region and the Baltics.
Although NATO is under no treaty obligation https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/best-supporting-actor-nato-secondary-role-if-russia-invades-ukraine-2022-01-18 to defend Ukraine, as the former Soviet republic is not a NATO member, the tensions with Russia have united member states around what one former alliance official called ""a common sense of purpose"". 
It is a turnaround for an alliance criticised internationally following the chaotic Western withdrawal from Afghanistan in August, which one German politician called NATO's ""biggest debacle"" since its creation. 
""One of the things that's so striking to me about this is that ... Russia's actions have precipitated exactly what President Putin says he wants to prevent,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters this week before leaving for Ukraine, where he said support for NATO membership had grown. 
""Certainly NATO's defensive posture, we'll have to strengthen even further,"" Blinken said.
That could entail more NATO troops, ships and planes in the Black Sea area and in the Baltics and shifting from a strategy of rotating troops to a permanent force presence there, including more U.S. soldiers and weapons. 
""I think the U.S. moving additional capabilities to Europe now is definitely in the works, because the situation demands it,"" said Lithuanian Defence Minister Arvydas Anusauskas.
Troop decisions could happen as early as a NATO summit in Madrid in June, diplomats and officials said, although any pull-back by Moscow would be likely to give pause.
Russia rejects U.S. accusations that it is preparing to invade Ukraine and says it is free to train its troops anywhere on its territory. Moscow accuses NATO of threatening the stability of Europe with its policy of offering membership to Ukraine and Georgia, which Russia considers its backyard.
The Kremlin demands that NATO retrench behind what were its boundaries before central and eastern European nations joined from 1997.
ONCE 'OUT OF BUSINESS', 'BRAIN DEAD'
After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the alliance lacked a meaningful role, with one U.S. senator, Richard Lugar, quipping that NATO needed to look beyond collective defence and go ""out of area or out of business"".
The U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 created bitter disputes between Washington, Berlin and Paris. As recently as July 2018, Donald Trump, then U.S. president, threatened to pull out of the alliance. NATO-member Turkey has pursued its own, often- conflicting, foreign policy in Syria and Libya. Macron once described NATO as ""brain dead"".
Former NATO officials see a clear link between Russian aggression and allied unity in an often-fractious organisation of 30 member states with different perspectives and priorities.
Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 set in motion NATO's biggest modernisation since the Cold War. NATO sees itself duty-bound to defend itself in the Baltics through to the Black Sea - Russia has a base in Kaliningrad and has missiles in the Black Sea area that can cover huge areas.
European allies, Turkey and Canada have increased defence spending by $260 billion since 2014, according to allied data.

Ten NATO allies meet the goal of spending 2% of economic output on defence, up from just three in 2014. NATO has also stood up a new spearhead force of 5,000 troops.
""There's no doubt about it: the Russians are uniting NATO around a common sense of purpose,"" said Jamie Shea, a former senior NATO official now at the Friends of Europe think tank in Brussels. ""Given the situation, NATO really has no choice.""

BEIJING/SYDNEY (Reuters) - When Dwight Law's father died in November, the Shanghai-based U.S. expat flew back to Kansas, leaving his wife and dog behind in China while he attended to matters relating to his father's death.
Law, who runs an architecture and design firm, has lived in Shanghai for 20 years and had expected to return last week.
But with dozens of flights between China and the United States suspended by Chinese authorities because of passengers testing positive for COVID-19 on arrival, finding a flight back even in February is proving near-impossible and posing a threat to Law's company.
""Now with no flights scheduled, I am currently locked out of China, away from my wife and family and not able to attend to business,"" Law said. ""I have 50 employees in China. Without my presence, the business will suffer and so will the livelihoods of each employee.""
Even before the latest flight cancellations, international capacity to and from China was running at just 2% of pre-COVID levels as the country sticks to a strict zero-COVID policy of stamping out all cases while other parts of world open up.
The zero-COVID mentality is likely to stay for most of 2022, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities analysts said in a note on Tuesday, in bad news for the 845,000 foreign passport holders in China, a number already reduced since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. 
China's aviation regulator in January alone cancelled 143 return flights as the highly transmissible Omicron variant spreads across the globe, according to a report from Chinese aviation data provider flight master last Friday. 
That was the most in a month since it introduced a policy of suspending flights when positive cases were found in June 2020.
The flight suspensions, which also include some services to Europe and other parts of Asia, are one of the biggest challenges faced by companies doing business in China, said a spokesperson for the Europe Chamber of Commerce in China.
""The recent cancellations send a clear message that China will not deviate from its current strategy,"" the spokesperson said, referring to the zero-COVID policy. 
Graphic: China's international flight suspensions - https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-AVIATION/USA-FLIGHTS/lbvgnjerbpq/chart.png 
China now requires passengers to have started costly COVID tests seven days before boarding in the departure city of their direct flight into China. That creates a headache for travellers like Law who are not based in U.S. cities with direct flights. 
Tough travel policies in transit hubs for U.S.-China travellers like Taiwan, Korea and Japan also effectively rule out less costly indirect flights.
A Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Flights search by Reuters shows no flights from San Francisco to Shanghai are available for booking until late March at any price. 
Jing Quan, minister of the Chinese embassy in the United States, said Beijing is working closely with the U.S. State Department to strike a balance on the number of commercial flights to China. Charter flights for Olympics athletes have not been affected, he said.
There has also been less of an impact on cargo. China Southern Airlines plans to fly its A380 superjumbos with cargo only from Los Angeles to Guangzhou, while carrying passengers in the other direction, it told the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT).
Hainan Airlines has received U.S. approvals for cargo-only flights using passenger planes and China Eastern is seeking a similar nod, according to DOT filings.

While that is a comfort to exporters, it provides little solace to stranded travellers like Law.
""COVID will not go away I am afraid. It is here to stay,"" he said. ""What's China going to do, close its borders for the next five or 10 years while the world outside of China learns to manage, live and gain herd immunity? It's nuts.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ghislaine Maxwell's lawyers late on Wednesday formally asked for a new trial after the British socialite's lawyers raised concern about a juror's possible failure to disclose before the trial that he was sexually abused as a child. 
Maxwell, 60, was convicted https://www.reuters.com/world/us/maxwell-jury-resume-deliberations-after-judge-warns-omicron-risk-2021-12-29 on Dec. 29 on five counts of sex trafficking and other crimes for recruiting and grooming teenage girls to have sexual encounters with the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell faces up to 65 years in prison. 
""Today, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell filed her motion for a new trial,"" her defense lawyer, Bobbi C. Sternheim, said in a letter to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan.
In the letter, Sternheim asked that all submissions pertaining to ""Juror No. 50"" remain under seal until the court rules on the motion.
Maxwell's lawyers said this month there were ""incontrovertible grounds https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ghislaine-maxwells-prosecutors-seek-inquiry-into-jurors-sexual-abuse-claim-2022-01-05"" for a new trial after a juror, who asked to be identified by his first and middle names, Scotty David, told Reuters and other news media that he described being abused as a child during jury deliberations.
The next day Maxwell's lawyer wrote to the judge seeking a new trial and New York attorney Todd Spodek filed an appearance in Maxwell's case on behalf of Juror No. 50. Spodek did not respond to a request for comment and has not disclosed his client's name in the Maxwell case.
Concerns have been raised that Scotty David did not disclose his abuse during pretrial screening. 
Prospective jurors were asked in a questionnaire whether they had ever been a victim of sexual abuse. Scotty David told Reuters https://www.reuters.com/world/us/some-ghislaine-maxwell-jurors-initially-doubted-accusers-juror-says-2022-01-05 he did not remember the question, but that he would have answered honestly.
Prosecutors, who have requested that U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan conduct an inquiry into the juror's statements, will have until Feb. 2 to respond to Maxwell's motion.
Legal experts told Reuters that Maxwell would not be guaranteed https://www.reuters.com/world/us/no-guarantee-new-maxwell-trial-after-jurors-revelations-experts-say-2022-01-07 a new trial even if the juror did not disclose his abuse on the questionnaire, noting that cases of juror dishonesty that led to verdicts being overturned generally involved jurors who deliberately lied in order to be selected.

Nathan last week scheduled Maxwell's sentencing hearing for June 28. 
Epstein killed himself in 2019 at the age of 66 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A six-year cold case investigation into the betrayal of Anne Frank has identified a surprising suspect in the mystery of how the Nazis found the hiding place of the famous diarist in 1944.
Anne and seven other Jews were discovered by the Nazis on Aug. 4 of that year, after they had hid for nearly two years in a secret annex above a canal-side warehouse in Amsterdam. All were deported and Anne died in the Bergen Belsen camp at age 15.
A team that included retired U.S. FBI agent Vincent Pankoke and around 20 historians, criminologists and data specialists identified a relatively unknown figure, Jewish notary Arnold van den Bergh, as a leading suspect in revealing the hideout.
Some other experts emphasised that the evidence against him was not conclusive. 
Investigating team member Pieter van Twisk said the crucial piece of new evidence was an unsigned note to Anne's father Otto found in an old post-war investigation dossier, specifically naming Van den Bergh and alleging he passed on the information.
The note said Van den Bergh had access to addresses where Jews were hiding as a member of Amsterdam's wartime Jewish Council and had passed lists of such addresses to the Nazis to save his own family.
Twisk said only four out of initial 32 names remained following the research, with Van den Bergh the lead suspect.
Investigators confirmed that Otto, the only member of the family to survive the war, was aware of the note but chose never to speak of it publicly.
Van Twisk speculated that Frank's reasons to remain silent about the allegation were likely that he could not be sure it was true, that he would not want information to become public that could feed further anti-Semitism, and that he would not want Van den Bergh's three daughters to be blamed for something their father might have done.
Otto ""had been in Auschwitz,"" Van Twisk said. ""He knew that people in difficult situations sometimes do things that cannot be morally justified."" 
While other members of the Jewish Council were deported in 1943, Van den Bergh was able to remain in the Netherlands. He died in 1950.
Historian Erik Somers of the Dutch NIOD institute for war, holocaust and genocide studies praised the extensive investigation, but was sceptical of its conclusion.
He questioned the centrality of the anonymous note in the arguments for Van den Bergh's responsibility and said the team made assumptions about wartime Amsterdam Jewish institutions that are not supported by other historical research.
According to Somers there are many possible reasons Van den Bergh was never deported as ""he was a very influential man"". 
Miep Gies, one of the family’s helpers, kept Anne’s diary safe until Otto returned and first published it in 1947. It has since been translated into 60 languages and captured the imagination of millions of readers worldwide. 
The Anne Frank House Foundation was not involved in the cold case investigation but shared information from its archives to assist. 
Director Ronald Leopold said the research had ""generated important new information and a fascinating hypothesis that merits further research"".
Using modern research techniques, a master database was compiled with lists of Dutch collaborators, informants, historic documents, police records and prior research to uncover new leads.
Dozens of scenarios and locations of suspects were visualised on a map to identify a betrayer, based on knowledge of the hiding place, motive and opportunity.
The findings of the new research will be published in a book by Canadian author Rosemary Sullivan, ""The Betrayal of Anne Frank"", which will be released on Tuesday.

The director of Dutch Jewish organisation CIDI which combats anti-Semitism told Reuters she hoped the book would provide insight into the war-time circumstances of Amsterdam's Jewish population.
""If this turns into 'the Jews did it' that would be unfortunate. The Nazis were ultimately responsible,"" Hanna Luden of CIDI said.

97,"<span>Jan 20, 2022 03:51AM ET</span>",,,,,,"KABUL (Reuters) - In a small tailoring workshop in Kabul, 29-year-old Afghan entrepreneur Sohaila Noori looks on as her dramatically reduced workforce of around 30 women sew scarves, dresses and baby clothes.
A few months ago, before the hardline Islamist Taliban movement seized power in August, she employed more than 80 people, mostly women, across three different textile workshops.
""In the past, we had so much work to do,"" said Noori, who was determined to keep her business running in order to employ as many women as she could.
""We had different types of contracts, we could easily pay a salary to our master tailors and other workers, but currently we have no contracts.""
With Afghanistan's economy deep in crisis - billions of dollars in aid and reserves have been cut off and ordinary people have little money even for basics - enterprises like Noori's are struggling to stay afloat.
Making matters worse, the Taliban will only allow women to work subject to their interpretation of Islamic law, prompting some to leave jobs out of fear of punishment by a group that severely restricted their freedom the last time it ruled.
Hard-won gains in women's rights over the last two decades have been quickly reversed, and reports from international rights experts and labour organisations this week painted a bleak picture for female employment and access to public space.
Though the economic crisis is hitting the entire country - some agencies predict it will leave almost the entire population in poverty in the coming months - the effect is disproportionately felt by women.
(Open https://tmsnrt.rs/3tEN2gt for a graphic on employment levels under the Taliban)
""The crisis in Afghanistan has made an already challenging situation for women workers even worse,"" said Ramin Behzad, Senior Coordinator of the International Labour Organization (ILO) for Afghanistan.
""Work in key sectors has dried up while newly imposed restrictions on women's participation in some economic areas are also hitting home.""
Afghan women's employment levels fell by an estimated 16% in the third quarter of 2021, according to an ILO report released on Wednesday, relative to 6% for men.
Women's employment was expected to be 21% lower than it was before the Taliban takeover by mid-2022 if current conditions continued, according to the ILO.
For the workers at Noori's workshop, the opportunity to make some money outweighed other worries.
""Mostly our families are worried about our safety. They repeatedly call us when we don't reach home on time, but we all continue to work ... because we have economic problems,"" said Lailuma, who only gave one name out of fear for her safety.

Another worker, Saleha, now provides for her entire family.
""My monthly income is around 1,000 Afghanis ($10), and I'm the only person working in my family ... Unfortunately, since the Taliban have come to power, there is (virtually) no income at all.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - For the South Pacific island nation of Tonga, the tsunami unleashed by Saturday's volcanic eruption laid bare some of the ways that climate change is threatening the islands' very existence.
By increasing temperatures and driving up sea levels, climate change will likely worsen disasters wrought by tsunamis, storm surges, and heat waves, experts say.
Acutely aware of this risk, Tonga has been a key voice representing climate-vulnerable nations, saying at the U.N. climate talks in November that global warming ""beyond the 1.5 C threshold would spell absolute catastrophe for Tonga"" and other Pacific Islands as they are subsumed by the sea.
Their plea for global climate action is especially desperate, given that Pacific island nations account for only 0.03% of global carbon emissions, according to the World Bank.
""While we are resilient and trying to adapt, it only takes a few extra meters of water to cover a house, to kill a child or family,"" said Shairana Ali, CEO of the international charity Save the Children, in neighbouring Fiji.
RISING SEAS
Tonga reported that waves of up to 15 meters crashed ashore on its outer islands after the volcanic eruption https://tmsnrt.rs/3qCTwKY, flattening homes and killing at least three people. The eruption triggered tsunami warnings across the Pacific.
As sea levels continue to rise in coming decades, tsunamis and storm surges will likely be reaching further inland with even more risk of damage. 
""Tsunami surge and storm surge sit on top of sea level,"" said Benjamin Horton, who has studied global sea-level rise and is chief of the Earth Observatory of Singapore. So with higher seas, ""you won't need such big natural disasters to cause widespread devastation.""
Sea levels around the archipelagic nation of 105,000 people are increasing by about 6 mm per year, nearly twice the average global rate, according to the U.N.'s Global Sea Level Observing System. This is because the islands sit in warmer waters near the equator, where sea level rise is more pronounced than at the poles. 
The damage from tsunamis and storm surges doesn't stop at wave destruction. Sea water that washes ashore can taint agricultural soil and leave it useless for years. Tsunami waves also exacerbate coastal erosion and destroy natural buffers against rising seas, such as coral reefs and mangroves.
With climate change warming the ocean's surface, such storm surges are more likely as the warm water fuels increasingly powerful cyclones. Tonga and neighboring countries were battered by two category five cyclones in the last four years, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.
HOTTER TEMPERATURES 
Tongan temperatures are already rising, with the average daily temperature now 0.6°C higher than it was in 1979. The frequency of hot days and hot nights has gone up across the Pacific. 
That continued warming is likely to make the soil drier as high temperatures cause more evaporation and affect regional rainfall patterns, according to the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 
The country will likely experience more heat waves in the next few decades, with temperatures frequently breaching 35°C, the report found. That extreme heat can be especially dangerous when combined with tropical humidity. 
Sea waters are heating up too, at three times the rate of the global average, World Meteorological Organization data shows. And marine heatwaves – which can kill fish and corals – are becoming more frequent, more intense, and lasting longer in most of the Pacific Ocean. 
Tonga itself saw a large blob of ocean heat form southeast of its islands in January 2020, with surface water temperatures registering 6 degrees Celsius above average for that month. 
REBUILD OR MOVE ON? 
Pacific Islanders are expected to be among the first groups of global climate refugees, as the effects of climate change push them out of their homelands. 
""Maybe it will eventually come to that. But I hope not,"" said Josephine Latu-Sanft, a Tongan who now lives in London and works as a climate communicator. ""People don't want to move."" 

Tongans have already rebuilt their communities twice in recent years - following Cyclone Gita in 2018, and again after Cyclone Harold in 2020. 
""Tongans are very resilient,"" and are reluctant to leave the islands despite the risks, Latu-Sanft said. ""We've lived there for centuries. Our roots and identity are in the land and in the sea.""

CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - British Columbia is rolling out the big guns - literally - to control avalanches that are forcing closures on some major roads for the first time in decades as the Western Canadian province grapples with a snowier-than-usual winter.
B.C. was rocked in 2021 by extreme weather events, including a record-breaking heatwave, wildfires and unprecedented rains that washed out highways and cut off Vancouver, its main city and home to Canada's busiest port, from the rest of the country.
The province, Canada's third-largest by population, uses bombs thrown from helicopters, remote-triggered explosives, and a howitzer gun manned by Canada's military to keep roads safe. But frequent closures for avalanche control are disrupting critical routes to Vancouver.
At the start of this month, B.C.'s alpine snowpack was 15% higher than average, according to the Weather Network channel.
Extreme winter weather, including November's torrential precipitation, a deep freeze in late December and an early January thaw, has created weak layers in the snowpack, making steep mountain slopes more prone to avalanches that can release without warning onto valleys below.
""It's been such a volatile fall and winter season so far, we have had rare 'extreme' avalanche warnings go out for parts of (B.C.'s) south coast in December and the risk is still considerable in the interior,"" said Tyler Hamilton, a Weather Network meteorologist.
Avalanche control missions involve closing sections of highways while teams use explosives to pre-emptively trigger smaller slides, preventing the snowpack from becoming too deep and unstable.
This winter a section of Highway 1 through the Fraser Canyon, 150 km (93 miles) northeast of Vancouver, needed avalanche control for the first time in 25 years, B.C.'s Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure said. 
Along Highway 99 north of Vancouver, avalanche control and risk-reduction activities are three times the seasonal average, with some slide paths producing avalanches big enough to hit the highway for the first time in more than a decade.
Avalanche control in Allison Pass further south on Highway 3, another key route connecting Vancouver to the rest of Canada, has also been above average, the ministry said. 
'BALANCING ACT'
All three highways were damaged by the November floods, and a busy avalanche control season is putting further strain on provincial resources. The Coquihalla Highway near Hope only reopened to regular traffic on Wednesday, and provincial authorities said record snow and avalanche risk had delayed repairs to Highway 1 through the Fraser Canyon.
Further east in the province, avalanche teams in Rogers (NYSE:ROG) Pass, a rugged 40-km section of Highway 1 running beneath 135 slide paths in Glacier National Park, are dealing with nearly 30% more snowfall than usual and control missions are also above average.
Highway 1 is Canada's main east-west artery and approximately 3,000 vehicles traverse Rogers Pass every day in winter. A major  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) rail line runs parallel to the highway. 
Avalanche control missions involve soldiers from the 1st Regiment of the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, which is stationed in Rogers Pass in winter. They use a howitzer to fire shells packed with 4 kg (8.8 lbs) of explosives in the direction of loaded avalanche paths at 17 different locations along the highway.
""Our goal is to bring down as much snow as we can and bring the hazard down to a point where it's safe to open the highway,"" said Jim Phillips, acting avalanche operations coordinator for Parks Canada, which runs avalanche control in the national parks.
The Rogers Pass program has been running since the highway opened in 1961. Before that, CP trains crossing the Selkirk Mountains in winter ran a higher risk of deadly snow slides, including one that killed 62 railway workers in 1910. 
So far this winter the team has fired 333 howitzer rounds, produced 197 controlled avalanches and closed the highway for 43 hours over seven separate days. 
Phillips said his team also uses heli-bombing and remote-trigger systems to set off detonations, and spends C$600,000 ($480,346) a year on explosives alone.
""It's a balancing act. You want to keep traffic moving and minimize closures, but also minimize risk to people using the transportation corridor,"" he added.
And winter weather in Canada is far from over.
Avalanche control is typically needed until late April or early May, depending on the snowpack, and the Weather Network forecasts above average winter storm systems returning to B.C. in February and March.

""We're still in a La Niña situation,"" said the Weather Network's Hamilton, referring to a weather pattern that tends to result in above-average precipitation and cold temperatures in B.C.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea will bolster its defences against the United States and consider resuming ""all temporally-suspended activities"", state news agency KCNA said on Thursday, an apparent reference to a self-imposed moratorium on tests of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.
Tension has been rising over a recent series of North Korean missile tests. A U.S. push for fresh sanctions was followed by heated reaction from Pyongyang, raising the spectre of a return to the period of so-called ""fire and fury"" threats of 2017.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un convened a meeting of the powerful politburo of the ruling Workers' Party on Wednesday to discuss ""important policy issues,"" including countermeasures over ""hostile"" U.S. policy, the official KCNA news agency said.
The politburo ordered a reconsideration of trust-building measures and ""promptly examining the issue of restarting all temporally-suspended activities,"" while calling for ""immediately bolstering more powerful physical means,"" KCNA said. 
The decision appears to be a step beyond Kim's previous remarks at the end of 2019 that he would no longer be bound by the moratorium on testing nuclear warheads and long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), after the United States did not respond to calls for concessions to reopen negotiations. 
Washington's hostility and threats had ""reached a danger line,"" the report said, citing joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises, the deployment of cutting-edge U.S. strategic weapons in the region, and the implementation of independent and U.N. sanctions. 
""We should make more thorough preparation for a long-term confrontation with the U.S. imperialists,"" the politburo concluded.
North Korea's warning came hours before the United Nations Security Council was due to convene a closed-door meeting on Thursday to discuss the recent missile tests, at the request of the United States and several other countries. 
President Joe Biden made no mention of North Korea during a nearly two-hour news conference on Wednesday held to mark his first year in office.
When asked how the United States would respond if North Korea resumed ICBM and nuclear testing, a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council declined ""to get into hypotheticals"" but said its goal remains the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
""We remain prepared to engage in serious and sustained diplomacy without preconditions to make tangible progress,"" the spokesperson said, adding that Washington would continue its efforts in coordination with the international community to prevent advances in North Korea's weapons programmes.
South Korea's defence ministry said it is monitoring the North's winter drills while maintaining readiness posture, calling the recent missile tests ""serious threats."" 
The Unification Ministry handling inter-Korean ties warned of further escalation, saying the peninsula should not go back to the confrontational past, and dialogue and diplomacy are the only way forward. 
""We should brace for more sabre-rattling designed to create a warlike atmosphere — and possibly more provocation testing,"" said Jean Lee, a fellow at the Washington-based Wilson Center, adding that Kim will use every opportunity to justify further weapons testing.
'VICIOUS CYCLE'
North Korea could possibly test a long-range missile or other powerful weapon in time for the 80th and 110th anniversaries of the birthdays of Kim's late father and grandfather in February and April, both major holidays in the country, said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.
""It's possible that the situation could go back to the vicious cycle of provocations and sanctions we saw in 2017,"" he said.
After test firing a ballistic missile capable of striking the U.S. mainland in 2017, North Korea launched a flurry of diplomacy and has not tested its ICBMs or nuclear weapons since.
But it began testing a range of new short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) after denuclearisation talks stalled and slipped back into a standoff following a failed summit in 2019.
Pyongyang has defended the missile launches as its sovereign right to self-defence and accused Washington of applying double standards over weapons tests. 
On Monday, North Korea conducted its fourth missile test this year, following two launches of ""hypersonic missiles"" capable of high speed and manoeuvring after lift-off, and another one involving a railway-borne missile system.
The unusually rapid pace of launches prompted U.S. condemnation and a push for new U.N. sanctions, and Pyongyang threatened stronger actions.
Jenny Town, director of the Washington-based Stimson Center's 38 North programme, said despite its strong language, the politburo report left room for Kim to ""ratchet rhetoric up or down as he sees fit"" depending on future developments.

The Biden administration needs to lead more concerted, high-level international efforts to restart negotiations on step-for-step actions toward peace and denuclearisation, said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington.
""The North Korean nuclear and missile problem has not disappeared and will only grow worse in the absence of active, serious diplomacy,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday his administration is considering re-designating Yemen's Houthi movement as an international terrorist organization following drone and missile attacks on the United Arab Emirates claimed by the group.
His comment at a news conference came shortly after the Emirati Embassy said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that UAE Ambassador Yousef Al Otaiba urged the Biden administration to restore the designation in response to Monday's strikes on Abu Dhabi airport and a fuel depot.
Asked if he supported returning the Iran-aligned Houthis to the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations, from which they were removed nearly a year ago, Biden replied, ""The answer is, it's under consideration.""
But he conceded that ""it's going to be very difficult"" to end the conflict pitting the Houthis against Yemen's internationally recognized government and a Saudi-led military coalition, to which the UAE belongs.
Biden's comment reflected the lack of progress toward ending the war since he launched an initiative shortly after taking office a year ago to bolster U.N. efforts to restart peace talks and end what the United Nations calls the world's worst humanitarian disaster.
The UAE welcomed Biden’s comment, the Emirati Embassy said on Twitter. The “case is clear – launching ballistic and cruise missiles against civilian targets, sustaining aggression, diverting aid to Yemeni people,” it said.
Saudi Arabia's ambassador to Yemen, Mohammed Al-Jaber, said on Twitter on Thursday that the United Nations and global community must not show leniency and hold the Houthi movement accountable because ""it encourages other terrorist organisations to act similarly"".
As part of the initiative he launched last year, Biden appointed veteran U.S. diplomat Timothy Lenderking a special envoy. The State Department also reversed a last-minute Trump administration decision placing the Houthis on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist groups, subjecting them to financial sanctions.
Three people were killed in Monday's drone and missile attack claimed by the Houthis.
In response, the Saudi-led coalition on Tuesday staged air strikes on the Houthi-held capital, Sanaa, killing at least 20 people including civilians, according to Houthi media and residents - one of its deadliest attacks since 2019.
Otaiba held ""broad"" consultations with Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, on the situation that included discussions of the Houthi attack, a National Security Council spokesperson said.
The Emirati Embassy said that Otaiba was accompanied by the top UAE intelligence official, Ali al Shamsi.
The embassy, in a second Twitter post responding to Biden's consideration of the terrorist designation, said Otaiba pressed the case for re-designating the Houthis in his meeting with Sullivan.
Lenderking began a new mission to the Gulf on Wednesday in a bid to reinvigorate the peace process and tamp down the surge in violence, the State Department said in a statement. 
The envoy ""will press the parties to de-escalate militarily and seize the new year to participate fully in an inclusive U.N.-led peace process,"" it said.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Wednesday spoke with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the Pentagon said. 
""Austin conveyed his condolences for the loss of life, and underscored his unwavering support for the security and defense of UAE territory against all threats,"" the Pentagon said.

WASHINGTON/KYIV (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden predicted on Wednesday that Russia will make a move on Ukraine, saying Russia would pay dearly for a full-scale invasion but suggesting there could be a lower cost for a ""minor incursion.""
Biden's comments at a White House news conference injected uncertainty into how the West would respond should Russian President Vladimir Putin order an invasion of Ukraine, prompting the White House later to seek to clarify what Biden meant.
""My guess is he will move in,"" Biden said of Putin at a news conference. ""He has to do something.""
""Russia will be held accountable if it invades - and it depends on what it does. It's one thing if it's a minor incursion and we end up having to fight about what to do and what to not do, et cetera,"" Biden said. ""But if they actually do what they're capable of doing ... it is going to be a disaster for Russia if they further invade Ukraine.""
Russian officials have repeatedly denied planning to invade, but the Kremlin has massed some 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders, a buildup the West says is preparation for a war to prevent Ukraine from ever joining the NATO Western security alliance.
Shortly after the nearly two-hour news conference ended, the White House stressed any Russian military move into Ukraine would elicit a tough response.
""If any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border, that's a renewed invasion, and it will be met with a swift, severe, and united response from the United States and our allies,"" said White House press secretary Jen Psaki.
But cyberattacks and paramilitary tactics by Russia ""will be met with ""a decisive, reciprocal, and united response,"" she said.
Republicans expressed concern about Biden's remarks. 
""Any incursion by the Russian military into Ukraine should be viewed as a major incursion because it will destabilize Ukraine and freedom-loving countries in Eastern Europe,"" said Republican Senator Rob Portman.
SUMMIT 'A POSSIBILITY'
Biden said a third summit with Putin ""is still a possibility"" after the two leaders met twice last year. He said he was concerned that a Ukraine conflict could have broader implications and ""could get out of hand."" 
Speaking to reporters at length about the crisis threatening to engulf his presidency, Biden said he believed Putin would test Western leaders. The response to any Russian invasion, he said, would depend on the scale of Moscow's actions and whether U.S. allies squabbled over how to react.
Biden and his team have prepared a broad set of sanctions and other economic penalties to impose on Russia in the event of an invasion and the U.S. president said Russian companies could lose the ability to use the U.S. dollar. 
Pressed on what he meant by a ""minor incursion,"" Biden said NATO allies are not united on how to respond depending on what exactly Putin does, saying ""there are differences"" among them and that he was trying to make sure that ""everybody's on the same page.""
""Big nations can't bluff, number one. Number two, the idea that we would do anything to split NATO ... would be a big mistake. So the question is, if it's something significantly short of a significant invasion or ... just major military forces coming across. For example, it's one thing to determine if they continue to use cyber efforts; well, we can respond the same way,"" Biden said.
Biden said Putin had asked him for guarantees on two issues: that Ukraine would never join NATO and that ""strategic"" or nuclear weapons never be stationed on Ukrainian soil.
U.S. officials see limiting NATO expansion as a non-starter, but Biden noted there was little chance of Ukraine joining the alliance soon and he suggested there could be a deal under which the West might not station nuclear forces in Ukraine.
""We can work out something on the second piece,"" depending on Russia's own posture, Biden said. 
Visiting Kyiv in a show of support, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia could launch a new attack on Ukraine at ""very short notice"" but Washington would pursue diplomacy as long as it could, even though it was unsure what Moscow really wanted.
The Kremlin said tension around Ukraine was increasing and it still awaited a written U.S. response to its sweeping demands for security guarantees from the West, including a halt to further NATO expansion and a withdrawal of alliance forces from central and eastern European nations that joined it after 1997.
The pessimistic statements highlighted the U.S.-Russian gulf ahead of talks between Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday that one Russian foreign policy analyst called ""probably the last stop before the train wreck."" 
Russia has also moved troops to Belarus for what it calls joint military exercises, giving it the option of attacking neighboring Ukraine from the north, east and south.

Eight years ago it seized Crimea and backed separatist forces who took control of large parts of eastern Ukraine, but it has consistently denied any intention of invading now.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Western weapons deliveries to Ukraine, military maneuvers and NATO aircraft flights were to blame for rising tensions around Ukraine.

""The first explosion .. .our ears were ringing and we couldn't even hear each other, so all we do is pointing to our families to get up, get ready to run,"" local journalist Marian Kupu told Reuters in one of the first eyewitness accounts to emerge from the South Pacific nation.
""We evacuated and then we, all our families, were just running away from the Kolovai area, because the Kolovai is right beside the seashore,"" said Kupu, explaining the chaotic scenes just outside the capital Nuku'alofa on Saturday evening.
The explosion, which has killed at least three people, sent tsunami waves some 15 metre(50 feet) high crashing ashore on one small island and badly damaged villages, resorts and many buildings on others. It also cut domestic and overseas communications, severing an undersea internet cable.
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center has said the force of the eruption was estimated to be the equivalent of five to 10 megatons of TNT, or more than 500 times that of the nuclear bomb the United States dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima at the end of World War Two.
Five days later communications have only been partially restored and eyewitness accounts have begun to be reported.
Standing on the side of the road in the capital, Kupu is wearing a mask and white scarf to protect herself from the volcanic dust that shrouds Tonga and has contaminated drinking water supplies.
""The dust is on rooftops, trees, everywhere,"" she said.
""What we are concerned about now is clean drinking water. Most of our drinking water has been contaminated from the volcanic dust.""
When asked about food supplies for Tonga's estimated 105,000 people, Kupu said: ""Maybe we can survive for the next few weeks but I'm not sure about water"".
Power to the capital and elsewhere was still fragile.
""Electricity is back, but it's on and off. This is due to a lot of ash on transformers and street lights have been damaged. Some outages last for hours, some lasts for days,"" said Kupu.
Around the capital and on the outer islands people on Thursday sifted through rubble and dust as they began the long task of rebuilding and waited for foreign aid to arrive.

Kupu said a few villages on the western side of Tonga were very badly hit.
""I won't say we are expecting more deaths but as we are speaking the government is trying to fly to the other islands to check over them,"" she said.

Christian Wakeford, who represents the Bury South constituency in northern England, said Johnson's policies were doing nothing to help the people he represents and that he was joining the main opposition Labour Party.
Wakeford was one of several lawmakers elected for the first time in 2019 who has expressed concerns over Johnson. 
The prime minister has faced growing calls to quit for a series of missteps, including attending a gathering in the garden of his Downing Street office and residence in May 2020, when strict COVID-19 rules forbade almost all socialising.
Johnson has apologised, but for some lawmakers in the party, the damage has already been done, leading some to write letters of no confidence in him.
""My decision is about much more than your leadership and the disgraceful way you have conducted yourself in recent weeks,"" Wakeford said.
""I can no longer support a government that has shown itself consistently out of touch with the hard working people of Bury South and the country as a whole,"" he added.
Answering questions in parliament, Johnson was defiant about the defection, saying his party would regain the seat.

""The Conservative Party won Bury South for the first time in generations under this prime minister with an agenda of uniting and levelling up and delivering for the people of Bury South,"" he said.
""And we will win again in Bury South at the next election under this prime minister.""

""The virus is spreading more actively than ever before,"" PAHO Director Carissa Etienne told a briefing.
The Caribbean has had the steepest increase in infections since the start of the two-year-old pandemic, the regional agency said. In North America, the United States and Canada are experiencing a surge of COVID-19 hospitalizations. 
Given a shortage of testing, PAHO recommended that countries prioritize rapid antigen tests for people with COVID-19 symptoms and who are at risk of spreading the virus.
Even though more than 60% of people in Latin America and the Caribbean have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, Omicron is spreading rapidly in all regions, said PAHO Incident Manager Sylvain Aldighieri.
The variant's advance in coming weeks and months will depend on public health measures to contain it, including use of masks and social distancing and above all vaccinations, to reduce the severity of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, he said.

Brazil reported a record 137,103 cases of the coronavirus in 24 hours as Omicron spread in Latin America's largest country, the Health Ministry said on Tuesday, as new infections soared above the previous daily record of 115,228 in June last year.
Brazil has the world's third highest death toll from COVID-19 after the United States and Russia, according to a Reuters tally.

(Reuters) - People who had previously been infected with COVID-19 were better protected against the Delta variant than those who were vaccinated alone, suggesting that natural immunity was a more potent shield than vaccines against that variant, California and New York health officials reported on Wednesday.
Protection against Delta was highest, however, among people who were both vaccinated and had survived a previous COVID infection, and lowest among those who had never been infected or vaccinated, the study found.
Nevertheless, vaccination remains the safest strategy against COVID-19, according to the report published in U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.
The results do not apply to the Omicron variant of the virus, which now accounts for 99.5% of COVID-19 cases in the United States.
""The evidence in this report does not change our vaccination recommendations,"" Dr. Ben Silk of the CDC and one of the study's authors told a media briefing.
""We know that vaccination is still the safest way to protect yourself against COVID-19,"" he said. 
For the study, health officials in California and New York gathered data from May through November, which included the period when the Delta variant was dominant. 
It showed that people who survived a previous infection had lower rates of COVID-19 than people who were vaccinated alone.
That represented a change from the period when the Alpha variant was dominant, Silk told the briefing. 
""Before the Delta variant, COVID-19 vaccination resulted in better protection against a subsequent infection than surviving a previous infection,"" he said. 
In the summer and fall of 2021, however, when Delta became the predominant circulating iteration of the virus in the United States, ""surviving a previous infection now provided greater protection against the subsequent infection than vaccination,"" he said.
But acquiring immunity through natural infection carries significant risks. According to the study, by November 30, 2021, roughly 130,781 residents of California and New York had died from COVID-19.
The analysis did not include information on the severity of initial infection, nor does it account for the full range of illness caused by prior infection. 
One important limitation to the study was that it ended before administration of vaccine booster doses was widespread. 
Dr. Erica Pan, state epidemiologist for the California Department of Public Health, said in an email that the study ""clearly shows"" that vaccines provide the safest protection against COVID-19 and they offer added protection for those with prior infections.

""Outside of this study, recent data on the highly contagious Omicron variant shows that getting a booster provides significant additional protection against infection, hospitalization and death,” Pan said.
Silk said the CDC is studying the impact of vaccination, boosters and prior infection during the Omicron surge and expects to issue further reports when that data becomes available.

The ""Equestrian Statue of Theodore Roosevelt,"" commissioned in 1925 and unveiled to the public in 1940, depicts Roosevelt on a horse, with a Native American man and an African man on foot at his side. It has been criticized by some as a symbol of colonialism and racism. 
The New York City Public Design Commission voted last June to remove it, the museum said on its website. Its new destination will be the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library in Medora, North Dakota, the New York Times reported.

The museum on its website said it was proud of its long association with the Roosevelt family, adding: ""At the same time, the statue itself communicates a racial hierarchy the Museum and members of the public have long found disturbing.""
Roosevelt, who was president from 1901 to 1909, was known for his exuberant and daring manner. He implemented antitrust and conservationist reforms, though critics said he took an interventionist approach to foreign policy, including projecting U.S. naval power around the world.

SAN GERONIMO, Calif. (Reuters) - The heavy rains that soaked California late last year were welcomed by farmers, urban planners - and endangered coho salmon.
""We've seen fish in places that they haven't been for almost 25 years,"" said Preston Brown, director of watershed conservation for Salmon Protection And Watershed Network (SPAWN). 
California received more precipitation from October to December than in the previous 12 months, according to the National Weather Service.
The abundance of rain and snow arrived in time for the November-to-January spawning season in the resource-rich Tomales Bay watershed north of San Francisco, enabling some fish to reach tributaries to the Lagunitas Creek at least 13 miles (20 km) inland in Marin County.
Some fish have been spotted a mile upstream from where the San Geronimo Creek had been dammed until little more than a year ago, experts say.
The rain could easily be a mere pause in the state's epic, 20-year drought, which has complicated efforts by water officials to keep fish, farms and growing cities supplied. Experts say the state needs several wet years in a row to replenish reservoirs.

In the meantime, the fish are benefiting, laying eggs in nests where babies will hatch and spend most of their juvenile life. They will then swim out to the ocean as adults, later returning to the same area to spawn.
""They like these really tiny small streams, and that's where their survival is the highest,"" said Todd Steiner, executive director of Turtle Island Restoration Network, the parent group to SPAWN. ""If we give the fish a fighting chance at survival, they will come back.""

(Reuters) -Conservative U.S. Supreme Court justices on Wednesday appeared sympathetic toward Republican Senator Ted Cruz's challenge to a provision of a major campaign finance law that caps the amount of money political candidates can be reimbursed after an election for personal loans to their own campaign organizations.
Cruz, backed by fellow Republicans, has argued that the $250,000 loan repayment cap violates the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech by unjustifiably burdening political expression. The federal agency that enforces election laws has called the cap an anti-corruption measure.
The provision is part of a bipartisan 2002 law that already has been chipped away at by the Supreme Court including in a landmark 2010 ruling https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-politics/landmark-supreme-court-ruling-allows-corporate-political-cash-idUSTRE60K3SK20100121 that allowed unlimited independent spending by corporations and unions during elections as constitutionally protected free speech. 
The court has a 6-3 conservative majority.
The justices heard about 90 minutes of oral arguments in an appeal by Democratic President Joe Biden's administration, acting on behalf of the Federal Election Commision (FEC), of a Washington-based three-judge panel's 2021 ruling unanimously striking down the provision on free speech grounds.
The only potential impediment to a Cruz victory appeared to be concerns by some justices, including conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, that the lower court should have tackled a separate challenge to a related regulation before addressing the constitutional question at issue. 
The FEC has said the cap was enacted to deter corruption by preventing political donors from making contributions after an election that flow directly to a candidate.
Cruz, first elected to represent Texas in the Senate in 2012, sued the FEC after his successful 2018 re-election race against Democratic rival Beto O'Rourke. Cruz had lent his campaign organization $260,000 but was limited by the law to a $250,000 reimbursement from his campaign. 
The FEC argued that Cruz lacked the proper legal standing to bring the challenge because he deliberately loaned his campaign more than the cap specifically in order to justify his lawsuit.
Conservative Justice Clarence Thomas appeared dismissive of that argument, noting that people challenging unconstitutional laws often use such tactics. Thomas cited Homer Plessy, a Black man who sat in a ""whites only"" car on a train in Louisiana so he could challenge racial segregation in the South. The Supreme Court later upheld segregation in the notorious 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson ruling that was overturned six decades later.
If Plessy wanted to avoid litigation, ""all he has to do is go to another car,"" said Thomas, the court's only Black member.
Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the cap appears to impose ""a chill on your ability to loan your campaign money,"" which would potentially violate free speech rights under court precedents.
Kavanaugh also questioned why corruption fears are triggered only after a loan reaches $250,000, noting that individual donors can give just $2,900 to a campaign during each election cycle. Loans above the cap can also be paid using money raised before the election.
Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett said there was no evidence of corruption concerning repayment of loans before the provision was enacted.
Liberal Justice Elena Kagan, who as a senior U.S. Justice Department lawyer represented the FEC in the Citizens United case, defended the provision, saying post-election contributions aimed at paying off a loan are a direct gift to a candidate.
The law does not impose any restrictions on a candidate's ability to spend his own money, it merely ""limits the amount of speech a candidate can make on somebody else's dime,"" Kagan said.
The Supreme Court has struck down various provisions of the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA), often called the McCain-Feingold law in recognition of its main sponsors, former Senators John McCain and Russ Feingold. 

Campaign finance watchdogs have said lifting the cap would increase expectations by political donors for official favors by letting people and corporations donate directly to a winning candidate after Election Day. Cruz's lawyers counter that the cap serves no anti-corruption purpose. Like a related provision struck down in 2008, they said, it was aimed to protect incumbents facing wealthy challengers.
Cruz unsuccessfully sought his party's 2016 presidential nomination, later becoming a prominent supporter of former President Donald Trump.

(Reuters) -Two New Zealand navy vessels will arrive in Tonga on Friday carrying critical water supplies for the Pacific island nation reeling from a volcanic eruption and tsunami and largely cut off from the outside world.
At least three people were killed and hundreds of homes in Tonga's smaller outer islands destroyed after Saturday's huge eruption triggered tsunami waves that rolled over the islands, home to 105,000 people.
With Tonga's airport smothered in volcanic ash and communications hampered https://www.reuters.com/markets/funds/undersea-cable-fault-could-cut-off-tonga-rest-world-weeks-2022-01-18 by the severing of an undersea cable, information on the scale of devastation has come mostly from reconnaissance aircraft.
But photographs posted on social media revealed more of the devastation on Wednesday, showing coastal areas where trees and buildings had been swept away and neighbourhoods covered with a thick coating of ash. People worked together to clear the debris and inspect the ruins of their homes.
The Red Cross said its teams in Tonga had confirmed that salt water from the tsunami and volcanic ash were polluting the drinking water of tens of thousands of people. 
""Securing access to safe drinking water is a critical immediate priority ... as there is a mounting risk of diseases such as cholera and diarrhoea,"" said Katie Greenwood of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
New Zealand said Tonga, one of the few countries to be free of the new coronavirus, had agreed to receive two of its ships, the Aotearoa and the Wellington, despite concerns about importing a COVID-19 outbreak that would exacerbate its crisis.
Simon Griffiths, captain of the Aotearoa, said his ship was carrying 250,000 litres of water, along with other supplies, and had the capacity to produce another 70,000 litres a day. 
The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano erupted about 40 miles (65 km) from the Tongan capital with a blast heard 2,300 km (1,400 miles) away in New Zealand, and sent tsunamis across the Pacific Ocean.
James Garvin, chief scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said the force of the eruption was estimated to be the equivalent of five to 10 megatons of TNT, or more than 500 times that of the nuclear bomb the United States dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima at the end of World War Two.
Waves reaching up to 15 metres (49 feet) hit the outer Ha'apia island group, destroying all the houses on the island of Mango, as well as the west coast of Tonga's main island, Tongatapu, where 56 houses were destroyed or seriously damaged, the prime minister's office said.
ASH AND RUBBLE
Tongan communities abroad have already posted images from families on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), giving glimpses of homes reduced to rubble, fallen trees, cracked roads and sidewalks and everything coated in grey ash.
Tonga has been largely offline since the volcano damaged its sole undersea fibre-optic communication cable. Its owner said it would probably take a month https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/tonga-likely-spend-month-without-internet-cable-2022-01-19 or more to fix.
Telecommunications operator Digicel said it had restored some international phone service to Tonga through a satellite link, though numerous attempts by Reuters to get through were unsuccessful.
The archipelago has 176 islands, 36 of them inhabited. Its main airport, Fua'amotu International, was not damaged by the tsunami but was covered in ash, which has had to be cleared by hand.
A Tongan official said it might be possible for aid flights from New Zealand and Australia to begin on Thursday.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison spoke with Tongan Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni.
He said two Hercules aircraft were ready to go with humanitarian supplies and telecommunications equipment, and that a naval ship, the Adelaide, was preparing to depart from Brisbane with water purification equipment and additional humanitarian supplies.
Australia and New Zealand have also promised immediate financial assistance.
The U.S. Agency for International Development approved $100,000 in immediate assistance, and Japan said it would give more than $1 million in aid as well as drinking water and equipment to clear ash.

The Asian Development Bank was discussing with Tonga whether it would declare a state of emergency to draw on a $10-million disaster facility, senior bank official Emma Veve told Reuters.
China said it would send help including water and food when the airport opened.

""I ask all governments, especially Islamic countries, that they should start recognition,"" Akhund said, in his first major public broadcast appearance since he assumed the role in September.
Akhund was addressing a major economic conference in Kabul where senior administration officials gathered with representatives of 20 countries and the United Nations.
Foreign powers have been reluctant to recognise the Taliban administration which took over Afghanistan in August while Western nations led by the United States have frozen billions of dollars worth of Afghan banking assets and cut off development funding that once formed the backbone of Afghanistan's economy.
Akhund and other Taliban administration officials made an appeal at the news conference, also attended by United Nations officials, for a loosening of restrictions on money into the country, blaming its growing economic crisis on the freezing of funds.
""Short-term aid is not the solution; we must try to find a way to solve problems fundamentally,"" he said.
The international community has ramped up humanitarian aid, designed to address urgent needs and largely bypass official channels. But as the country faces a cash crunch and a deteriorating economy over the harsh winter, millions of people have plunged into poverty.
The UN Secretary General's Special Representative for Afghanistan Deborah Lyons also spoke at the event, saying Afghanistan's economic crisis was a serious problem that needed to be addressed by all countries.
""The United Nations is working to revitalise Afghanistan's economy and fundamentally address Afghanistan's economic problems,"" she said.
The country's Deputy Prime Minister Mullah Baradar asked that more efforts be made to help Afghanistan overcome its economic crisis, including enabling its banking system to operate.
""Now the world and international organizations know about Afghanistan's problems, therefore we ask that the world especially the UN not wastes more time on doing their responsibility about Afghanistan,"" he said. 

He echoed calls for economic solutions to go beyond humanitarian aid and emphasised the importance of the private sector. 
""The private sector is very important. If this sector stands up, Afghanistan's economic problem largely will be solved,"" he said. ""We want to make Afghanistan self-sufficient, and it is not possible without a private sector.""

ByteDance had divided its external investment arm into financial and strategic wings, with the latter aimed at funding businesses that could find synergies with its own.
Employees on the financial investments team have been told by ByteDance executives that the team will be disbanded and they have been encouraged to look for opportunities elsewhere, internally or externally, two of the sources told Reuters.
ByteDance said in a statement that it was disbanding its group-level strategic investment team and moving employees to various business units, after a review earlier this month highlighted investments with ""low synergies"". 
It did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the dissolving of the financial investments team. 
ByteDance's six business units, which it created in October in a major organisational reshuffle, include TikTok and its Chinese version Douyin. 
The overhaul of its strategic investment team is designed to ""enhance collaborations between strategy research and business operations,"" the company said.
The Beijing-based company has been reducing the size of its investment team as Beijing has been strengthening anti-monopoly efforts to rein in corporate giants, four people familiar with the situation said. 
Over the past year, Beijing has clamped down on antitrust violations, banned private tuition groups and reined in a debt binge by property developers, wiping hundreds of billions off the market capitalisations of some of its largest companies, including e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and social media giant Tencent.

Late last Friday the government cancelled his visa again on the grounds that he might foster anti-vaccination sentiment if he was allowed to stay. Djokovic challenged the cancellation on the grounds the minister had acted irrationally, but the court dismissed the case.

""Under the new election system, I believe every capable and reliable patriot can join the new chief executive election,"" Sin said. ""I believe that I have the ability to win.""
With the election just weeks away, the silence from leader Lam and other heavyweights is unusual. Local media have speculated that potential candidates include Lam, Financial Secretary Paul Chan and former chief of the World Health Organisation, Margaret Chan. Lam has repeatedly declined to comment on whether she will run for a second term. 
Sin, who produced the film Ip Man, has been an active promoter of martial arts in the city. He heads the World Wing Chun Union, which focuses on the traditional southern Chinese kung fu style which was popularised in Hong Kong by Ip Man and Bruce Lee. 
Shares of National Arts Group, from which Sin resigned as chairman last July, soared more than 50% on Wednesday in their highest percentage gain since 2006. The company's market value is around HK$102 million ($13 million).
Hong Kong-born Sin has his own YouTube channel with 155,000 subscribers and posts online every few days on topics ranging from politics to the Beijing Olympics. In 2021, one of his shows focused on what he called 'Western hypocrisy' on Hong Kong. 

He first started his online commentary in October 2019 at the height of Hong Kong's anti-government protests where he strongly sided with the government and the police force.
The nomination period runs from Feb 15- March 2 and candidates must get nominations from at least 188 of the 1,500 people in the election committee, according to a document from city's legislature.

119,"<span>Jan 19, 2022 01:05AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -A smartphone app built by China to monitor the health of attendees at the Beijing Winter Olympics next month contains security flaws that makes it vulnerable to privacy breaches and hackers, according to a report https:// released by Canadian researchers on Tuesday.
The MY2022 app was built by the Beijing Organising Committee mainly to track and share COVID-19-related medical information among the athletes during the Games.
Researchers with Toronto's Citizen Lab project said MY2022 failed to properly encrypt the transfer of personal data, leaving it vulnerable to hackers. They also found that MY2022's privacy policy does not specify which organisations it would share the users' information with.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it had conducted independent assessments on the application and had not found any ""critical vulnerabilities"".
""It is not compulsory to install 'My 2022' on cell phones,"" the IOC said in a statement.
Yu Hong, the director general of the committee's technology department, said on Wednesday that the main function of the app is to monitor people's health and the country follows strict rules to protect data.
All of the MY2022 app's technology aspects have been validated by relevant app stores, the Beijing 2022 official said at a briefing hosted by the Chinese embassy in the United States. She was speaking via video from Beijing.
Yu also said that technology vulnerabilities were natural when developing this kind of an app, which her department was constantly updating in order to remove such issues.
The Citizen Lab researchers said they found the flaws in the iOS version of the app after creating an account in it. They were unable to set up an account in the Android version but said the security flaws existed in both versions of MY2022.
The report said MY2022 failed to validate SSL certificates, which are needed to authenticate a website's identity and enable encrypted connection. This can be exploited by hackers to transmit the data to malicious sites.
Non-encrypted data is transmitted to ""tmail.beijing2022.cn"" by MY2022.
""Such data can be read by any passive eavesdropper, such as someone in range of an unsecured WiFi access point, someone operating a WiFi hotspot, or an Internet Service Provider or other telecommunications company,"" the report said.

Citizen Lab said it had informed the Beijing Winter Olympics Organising Committee on Dec. 3 of its security concerns but had not received any response.
The Winter Olympics are set to begin on Feb. 4. Several countries including the United States, Britain, Japan and Australia have announced diplomatic boycotts of the Games over concerns about human rights in China.

No cause of death was given.
""We are deeply saddened to share the news that our angel, matriarch, sister, mother, grandmother, Olympic medalist, 'The Queen of Basketball', Lusia Harris has passed away unexpectedly today in Mississippi,"" the family said in a statement.
""She will be remembered for her charity, for her achievements both on and off the court, and the light she brought to her community, the State of Mississippi, her country as the first woman ever to score a basket in the Olympics, and to women who play basketball around the world.""
Harris, the 10th of 11 children, was a standout high school player before attending Delta State, where she won three consecutive national championships and was a three-time MVP. She graduated with a college record of 109-6.
She led the U.S. national team to a gold medal at the Pan American Games in 1975 and a silver the next year at the Montreal Games, which was the first Olympics to have a women's basketball tournament.
She was drafted by the NBA's New Orleans Jazz in 1977 but never played in the league, instead choosing to focus on raising a family. She was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 1992 and the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame in 1999.
Her life story was chronicled in a critically-acclaimed documentary last year entitled ""The Queen of Basketball.""
""When I got the call and they said they wanted to do this documentary, I was really kind of surprised,"" she told Good Morning America in June. 
""That was just unreal.""

Five of those injured were police officers who raced into the burning structure to help usher residents to safety, and one was a woman who was rescued from her dwelling by police, officials said.
Police body-camera video posted to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) by the New York City Fire Department showed officers freeing the trapped woman from beneath an overturned sofa and other debris and carrying her to safety as flames engulfed the adjacent apartment unit.
""We saved lives today,"" Mayor Eric Adams, a former police officer himself, told a news conference in lauding the actions of emergency first-responders.
The cause of the blast is under investigation, but John Hodgens, FDNY chief of fire operations, said, ""we had a report of somebody who did smell gas"" before the explosion. 
The mayor said gas service was shut off for the entire block after the incident.
Hodgens said there was no immediate evidence of foul play.
The fiery blast in the south Bronx neighborhood of Longwood came just nine days after 17 people died and dozens were injured in a fire that sent smoke coursing through a public housing complex in the Fordham Heights area of the Bronx, a few miles away. That blaze was believed to have been sparked by a faulty space heater.
Video from the scene of Tuesday's incident posted online showed flames and plumes of smoke outside the three-story building as police officers urged bystanders to move away from the site.
In footage posted on Twitter by the New York Fire Department, firefighters could be seen training streams of water on the smoking, blackened exterior of the building. A large section of the structure's facade appeared to be missing.
Hodgens told reporters that the apartment where the explosion occurred and the two units on either side were destroyed. Two or three other dwellings were heavily damaged, he said. All the row house units were connected under a single roof.
One woman who was inside the apartment at the center of the explosion was killed, and her sister was hospitalized with severe injuries, Hodgens said. Both women, in their 60s, were found laying on the ground outside, he said, apparently blown clear of the structure by the force of the blast.
The woman rescued from inside the adjoining apartment also was hospitalized, and one civilian was treated at the scene for minor injuries, while one firefighter was injured along with the five police officers, an FDNY spokesman told Reuters.

Authorities earlier in the day had reported one fatality and eight injuries.
A neighbor identified as Bonnie Salgado, interviewed at the scene by local station WNBC-TV, said she heard a ""big boom,"" then saw the rear of the building ""tumbling down"" and debris blown into the backyard before a second explosion shook the building.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's Democrats took their push to protect U.S. voting rights to the floor of the Senate on Tuesday, where legislation is roundly expected to fail in the face of united Republican opposition.
Democrats argue the legislation, backed by civil rights groups https://www.reuters.com/world/us/family-martin-luther-king-jr-lead-washington-march-voting-rights-2022-01-17, is needed to counter a Republican-led drive to make it more difficult to vote at the state level, especially for Black and other minority voters. 
Republicans are again expected to block passage of the sweeping legislation, arguing it is a partisan effort that would undermine local control of elections. Three times last year Republicans stood in the way of Democratic voting rights legislation.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, cited the urgency of what he called an onslaught of new state limits to poll access. He said a showdown vote on a bill establishing new minimum standards for federal elections administered by states would be held sometime this week.
The outcome could come as soon as Wednesday if all 100 senators agree to that expedited timing. Otherwise, it is expected on Thursday.
""Democrats are prepared to fight on this issue until we succeed,"" Schumer said. ""We have not reached the place where every person can vote easily and openly and honestly,"" he added.
Democrats are scrambling to act while they still narrowly control both chambers of Congress. Republicans are favored to take a majority in at least one chamber in next November's mid-term elections.
With other elements of Biden's domestic agenda stalled on Capitol Hill, Biden has called the vote a significant moment https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-biden-idUKKBN2JL1DA for a U.S. democracy facing crisis. 
A Republican vote to block the legislation would trigger an attempt to change the Senate's filibuster rule so that a simple majority of the 100-member Senate, instead of 60 votes, would be needed to pave the way for passing the bill, Schumer said.
At an evening news conference following a closed-door meeting of the 50-member Senate Democratic Caucus, Schumer announced that the rules change proposal would require a ""talking filibuster."" That means that senators trying to kill legislation would have to come to the chamber and actually stand and talk -- possibly for hours or days -- and not just passively oppose limiting endless debate time. 
The rules change, possible if backed by all 50 Democratic votes and with Vice President Kamala Harris as the tie breaker, is also likely to fail amid opposition from at least two Democratic senators. 
Those two conservative Democrats, Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin, met with Biden to discuss the matter on Thursday, but have given no indication since that their opinion has shifted. 
""I've never changed my mind on (altering) the filibuster,"" Manchin told reporters Tuesday evening.
If the effort fails, the Senate could attempt to cobble together a far narrower election-reform bill, as some Republicans say https://www.reuters.com/world/us/top-senate-republican-signals-interest-narrow-approach-us-election-reform-2022-01-05 they would like to avoid a repeat of the chaos that followed the 2020 U.S. presidential election when then-President Donald Trump falsely claimed he lost due to fraud. 

The legislation https://news.trust.org/item/20220113182721-f9syv now before the Senate would expand access to mail-in voting, tighten campaign finance rules, and strengthen federal oversight of elections in states that have a history of racial discrimination.

123,"<span>Jan 18, 2022 05:02PM ET</span>","ADEN, Yemen (Reuters) -Air strikes by the Saudi-led coalition fighting Yemen's Houthi group on the capital Sanaa killed at least 20 people overnight, including civilians, Houthi media and residents said, in one of its deadliest attacks since 2019.
Around 14 people were killed when coalition planes struck the home of a high-ranking Houthi military official, including his wife and son, according to neighbours and a medic. 
The air strikes followed Monday's drone and missile attack https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/uae-says-suspects-drones-behind-abu-dhabi-fires-yemens-houthis-claim-attack-2022-01-17 on coalition partner the United Arab Emirates that was claimed by the Iran-aligned Houthis and killed three people. 
The coalition also said it intercepted eight Houthi drones launched toward Saudi Arabia on Monday. 
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres ""expresses his concern and deplores"" the coalition air strikes, his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Tuesday. Dujarric said on Monday that Guterres condemned the drone and missile attack on the UAE. 
""The secretary-general again calls upon all parties to exercise maximum restraint and prevent further escalation and intensification of the conflict,"" Dujarric said on Tuesday. 
The UAE on Tuesday requested that the U.N. Security Council discuss Monday's drone and missile attack. ""We hope for a strong Security Council statement condemning this,"" said UAE Ambassador to the U.N. Lana Nusseibeh. Diplomats said the council would likely meet behind closed doors later this week. 
Early on Tuesday, the coalition said it had begun air strikes against strongholds and camps in Sanaa belonging to the Houthi group, Saudi state media said.
Houthi media named the Houthi military official whose home was struck as Abdullah Qassim al-Junaid, the former head of the Houthis' aviation college. 
The strike killed him, his wife, his 25-year-old son, other family members and other unidentified people, the medical source and residents told Reuters. 
On Tuesday men at the aftermath combed through rubble, strewn with belongings, books and twisted metal, as well as debris from heavily damaged neighbouring houses.
At the scene Ahmad al-Ahdal said his uncle's house was hit after the strike on Junaid's home. 
""My uncle went in with rescuers to extract the victims in Junaid's house,"" he said. ""We have been unable to find him since then.""
Junaid was among over 170 Houthi officials sentenced to death by firing squad in August by a court in the province of Marib, which remains under the control of the Saudi-backed, internationally recognised Yemeni government.
The court found the defendants, most of whom were tried in absentia, guilty of staging a military coup and committing war crimes, state media reported at the time. 
Coalition strikes around the city overnight killed a total of about 20 people, the deputy foreign minister for the Houthi administration, which holds much of northern Yemen, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
The UAE armed and trained Yemeni forces that recently joined fighting against the Houthis in Yemen's energy-producing regions of Shabwa and Marib.

Monday's Houthi-claimed attack on two sites in Abu Dhabi set off explosions in fuel trucks and ignited a blaze near Abu Dhabi airport.
In response, the UAE said it reserved the right to respond to ""terrorist attacks and criminal escalation"".

(Reuters) -U.S. Supreme Court justices on Tuesday appeared inclined to rule in favor of a Christian group that sued on free speech grounds over a refusal by Boston officials to fly a flag bearing the image of a cross at City Hall in a challenge backed by Democratic President Joe Biden's administration. 
The justices heard oral arguments in an appeal by the group, Camp Constitution, and its director, Harold Shurtleff, over Boston's 2017 denial of their application to raise the Christian cross flag due to concerns that it could appear as an unconstitutional government endorsement of a particular religion. Lower courts sided with the city. 
The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has taken an expansive view of religious rights and has been increasingly receptive to arguments that governments are acting with hostility toward religion.
The dispute arose over Boston's practice of allowing private groups to hold flag-raising events using one of three flagpoles on the plaza in front of City Hall to promote inclusion and the diversity of the city's residents. From 2005 to 2017, Boston approved all 284 applications it received before rebuffing Camp Constitution. The vast majority of flags were those of foreign countries, but also one commemorating LGBT Pride in Boston. 
At issue is whether the flagpole became a public forum meriting free speech protections under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment to bar discrimination based on viewpoint, as the plaintiffs claimed, or whether it represented merely a conduit for government speech not warranting such protection, as Boston claimed.
Liberal and conservative justices questioned the city's stance.
Liberal Justice Elena Kagan doubted that in this particular case the cross flag could violate the First Amendment's so-called establishment clause prohibiting the government from establishing a state religion.
""In the context of a system where flags go up, flags go down, different people have different kinds of flags, then it is a violation of the free speech part of the First Amendment and not an establishment clause violation - the end,"" Kagan told a lawyer for Boston. 
Conservative Justice Samuel Alito noted that Boston's policy appeared to exclude flags that were discriminatory, offensive or religious. 
""When you say anybody can speak by putting up a flag, with these few exceptions, are you not creating a forum for private speech rather than speaking your own mind?"" Alito asked a lawyer for Boston. 
But liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor voiced concern about the potential for confusion by average observers, saying it is a ""fiction"" that people would think a raised flag outside City Hall relates to an event not sponsored by the city. 
""If you see a flag on the pole, you think it's City Hall speaking,"" Sotomayor said.
Camp Constitution, whose mission is ""to enhance understanding of our Judeo-Christian moral heritage"" as well as ""free enterprise,"" sued in 2018 over its rejection. 
Among other topics, Camp Constitution's website posts materials questioning the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, claiming that last year's U.S. Capitol attack was actually a cover up for ""massive"" 2020 election fraud and calling Japan's 1941 Pearl Harbor attack and al Qaeda's Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States ""carefully orchestrated false flags.""
The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the city's control of the flag-raising program made it government speech. 
Biden's administration backed Camp Constitution in the case, arguing in court papers that because Boston treated the flagpole as a forum for private speech it cannot approve ""private civic and social groups while excluding otherwise-similar groups with religious views.""

Boston said that requiring it to open the pole to ""all comers"" could force it to raise flags promoting division or intolerance, such as a swastika, or a terrorist group. Given that risk, Boston last October halted applications to use the flagpole, at least while the case plays out. 
Biden's administration and some justices said Boston could create and closely control a more limited flag-raising program going forward to avoid those concerns.

SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korea fired tactical guided missiles on Monday, state media KCNA said on Tuesday, the latest in a series of recent tests that highlighted its evolving missile programmes amid stalled denuclearisation talks. 
The missile test was the North's fourth in 2022, with two previous launches involving ""hypersonic missiles https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkorea-says-launch-wednesday-was-hypersonic-missile-yonhap-2022-01-05"" capable of high speed and manoeuvring after lift-off, and another test on Friday using a pair of SRBMs fired from train cars https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-used-railway-born-missile-fridays-test-kcna-2022-01-14. 
The U.N. Security Council is likely to meet behind closed-doors on Thursday on the continued missile launches, diplomats said. The United States, Britain, France, Ireland and Albania made the request on Tuesday for a Council discussion.
South Korea's military said on Monday that North Korea launched https://www.reuters.com/article/northkorea-missiles-idINL1N2TX006 two short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) from an airport in its capital, Pyongyang, which flew about 380 km (236 miles) to a maximum altitude of 42,000 meters (137,800 feet). 
The Academy of Defence Science conducted a test of tactical guided missiles from the country's west, and they ""precisely hit an island target"" off the east coast, the official KCNA news agency said on Tuesday, without elaborating. 
""The test-fire was aimed to selectively evaluate tactical guided missiles being produced and deployed and to verify the accuracy of the weapon system,"" KCNA said. 
It ""confirmed the accuracy, security and efficiency of the operation of the weapon system under production.""
The unusually rapid sequence of launches has drawn U.S. condemnation and a push for new U.N. sanctions while Pyongyang warns of stronger actions, raising the spectre of a return to the period of ""fire and fury https://www.reuters.com/article/northkorea-missiles-idAFL4N1KU4QA"" threats in 2017.
U.S. Special Representative for North Korea Sung Kim urged Pyongyang to ""cease its unlawful and destabilising activities"" and reopen dialogue, saying he was open to meeting ""without preconditions,"" the State Department said after a call with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts. 
South Korea's defence ministry said on Tuesday that it takes all North Korean missile launches as a ""direct and serious threat,"" but its military is capable of detecting and intercepting them. 
U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric also called the North's tests ""increasingly concerning"" during a briefing, calling for all parties to return to talks to defuse tension and promote a ""very verifiable denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula."" 
'SHOW OF FORCE'
North Korea used Pyongyang's Sunan airport to test-fire the Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) in 2017, with leader Kim Jong Un in attendance.
North Korea has not tested its longest-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) or nuclear weapons since 2017, as a flurry of diplomacy with Washington unfolded from 2018. But it began testing a range of new SRBM designs after denuclearisation talks stalled and slipped back into a standoff https://www.reuters.com/article/northkorea-missiles-idAFL4N1KU4QA following a failed summit in 2019. 
Kim did not attend the latest test.
A photo released by KCNA showed a missile rising into the sky above a cloud of dust, belching flame. 
Kim Dong-yup, a former South Korea Navy officer who teaches at Seoul's Kyungnam University, said North Korea appears to have fired KN-24 SRBMs, which were last tested in March 2020 and flew 410 km (255 miles) to a maximum altitude of 50,000 meters (164,042 feet).
The KN-24 resembles the U.S. MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and is designed to evade missile defences and carry out precision strikes, he said.

""The North seems to have already deployed and begun mass production of the KN-24,"" Kim said, referring to the KCNA report. 
""But essentially, the test could be another show of force to underline their recent warning of action.""

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -A six-year cold case investigation into the betrayal of Anne Frank has identified a surprising suspect in the mystery of how the Nazis found the hiding place of the famous diarist in 1944.
Anne and seven other Jews were discovered by the Nazis on Aug. 4 of that year, after they had hid for nearly two years in a secret annex above a canal-side warehouse in Amsterdam. All were deported and Anne died in the Bergen Belsen camp at age 15.
A team that included retired U.S. FBI agent Vincent Pankoke and around 20 historians, criminologists and data specialists identified a relatively unknown figure, Jewish notary Arnold van den Bergh, as a leading suspect in revealing the hideout.
Some other experts emphasised that the evidence against him was not conclusive. 
Investigating team member Pieter van Twisk said the crucial piece of new evidence was an unsigned note to Anne's father Otto found in an old post-war investigation dossier, specifically naming Van den Bergh and alleging he passed on the information.
The note said Van den Bergh had access to addresses where Jews were hiding as a member of Amsterdam's wartime Jewish Council and had passed lists of such addresses to the Nazis to save his own family.
Twisk said only four out of initial 32 names remained following the research, with Van den Bergh the lead suspect.
Investigators confirmed that Otto, the only member of the family to survive the war, was aware of the note but chose never to speak of it publicly.
Van Twisk speculated that Frank's reasons to remain silent about the allegation were likely that he could not be sure it was true, that he would not want information to become public that could feed further anti-Semitism, and that he would not want Van den Bergh's three daughters to be blamed for something their father might have done.
Otto ""had been in Auschwitz,"" Van Twisk said. ""He knew that people in difficult situations sometimes do things that cannot be morally justified."" 
While other members of the Jewish Council were deported in 1943, Van den Bergh was able to remain in the Netherlands. He died in 1950.
Historian Erik Somers of the Dutch NIOD institute for war, holocaust and genocide studies praised the extensive investigation, but was sceptical of its conclusion.
He questioned the centrality of the anonymous note in the arguments for Van den Bergh's responsibility and said the team made assumptions about wartime Amsterdam Jewish institutions that are not supported by other historical research.
According to Somers there are many possible reasons Van den Bergh was never deported as ""he was a very influential man"". 
Miep Gies, one of the family’s helpers, kept Anne’s diary safe until Otto returned and first published it in 1947. It has since been translated into 60 languages and captured the imagination of millions of readers worldwide. 
The Anne Frank House Foundation was not involved in the cold case investigation but shared information from its archives to assist. 
Director Ronald Leopold said the research had ""generated important new information and a fascinating hypothesis that merits further research"".
Using modern research techniques, a master database was compiled with lists of Dutch collaborators, informants, historic documents, police records and prior research to uncover new leads.
Dozens of scenarios and locations of suspects were visualised on a map to identify a betrayer, based on knowledge of the hiding place, motive and opportunity.
The findings of the new research will be published in a book by Canadian author Rosemary Sullivan, ""The Betrayal of Anne Frank"", which will be released on Tuesday.

The director of Dutch Jewish organisation CIDI which combats anti-Semitism told Reuters she hoped the book would provide insight into the war-time circumstances of Amsterdam's Jewish population.
""If this turns into 'the Jews did it' that would be unfortunate. The Nazis were ultimately responsible,"" Hanna Luden of CIDI said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Maltese lawmaker Roberta Metsola secured overwhelming support to become president of the European Parliament on Tuesday, making her the first woman to hold the post for 20 years.
She succeeds Italian socialist David Sassoli https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-parliament-president-sassoli-has-died-spokesperson-2022-01-11, who died this month, in presiding over the 705-member parliament, which adopts and amends EU legislative proposals and decides on the bloc's budget.
Metsola, who campaigned as a student for Malta to become a member of the EU in 2004, said she wants to use her mainly ceremonial role to help the parliament connect better with European citizens.
""I want people to believe in Europe. To re-capture that sense of hope & enthusiasm in our project. To stand up for those values that unite us as Europeans,"" Metsola said in a message posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Metsola, who turned 43 on Tuesday and is also the youngest president of the European Parliament, has been a member of the assembly since 2013 for the centre-right European People's Party (EPP).
She defeated two other candidates for the presidency election, winning 458 of the 616 validly cast votes in the first round, meaning no run-off rounds were required. 
Sassoli had been due to step down this week as part of a power-sharing deal under which the parliament's socialist group would make way halfway through the assembly's five-year term for a candidate from the EPP grouping.
The European Parliament has had only two previous female presidents, Simone Veil and Nicole Fontaine, both French, since it became a directly elected assembly in 1979.
Metsola has consistently voted against European Parliament resolutions that call for women to have access to safe abortion.

Asked on Tuesday about her stance, Metsola said she had been bound by Malta's position on the issue. Staunchly Catholic Malta is the only EU member state to prohibit abortion and women undergoing the procedure can face up to three years in jail.
As EU Parliament president, Metsola said she would defend the assembly's views on sexual and reproductive health and rights. That includes resolutions calling for all member states to ensure women can get safe access to abortion services.

SYDNEY/WELLINGTON (Reuters) -All the homes on one of Tonga's small outer islands have been destroyed by a massive volcanic eruption and tsunami, with three people so far confirmed dead, the government said on Tuesday in its first update since the disaster struck.
With communications https://tmsnrt.rs/3qzVPyy badly hampered by the severing of an undersea cable https://www.reuters.com/markets/funds/undersea-cable-fault-could-cut-off-tonga-rest-world-weeks-2022-01-18, information on the scale of the devastation after Saturday's eruption had so far mostly come from reconnaissance aircraft.
But the office of Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni said in a statement that every home on Mango island, where around 50 people live, had been destroyed, only two houses remained on Fonoifua, and Namuka island had suffered extensive damage. 
Tonga’s deputy head of mission in Australia, Curtis Tu’ihalangingie, earlier said pictures taken by the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) showed ""alarming"" scenes of a village destroyed on Mango and buildings missing on Atata island, which is closer to the volcano.
""People panic, people run and get injuries. Possibly there will be more deaths and we just pray that is not the case,"" Tu’ihalangingie told Reuters.
Sovaleni's office said a 65-year-old woman on Mango and a 49-year-old man on Nomuka island had been killed, in addition to the British national whose body was found on Monday. A number of injuries were also reported.
Tsunami waves reaching up to 15 metres hit the Ha’apia island group, where Mango is located, and the west coast of Tonga’s main island, Tongatapu, the office said. Residents were being moved to evacuation centres as 56 houses were destroyed or seriously damaged on that coast.
Atata and Mango are between about 50 km and 70 km from the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai https://graphics.reuters.com/TONGA-VOLCANO/mopanwordva/Tonga-Volcano.jpg volcano, which sent tsunami waves across the Pacific Ocean when it erupted with a blast heard 2,300 km (1,430 miles) away in New Zealand.

Satellite images from Sunday show the caldera of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai has collapsed and the island has lost a substantial percentage of its initial surface area, said the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
A rescue operation began on Sunday for Atata, which has a population of about 100 people, with an evacuation under way.
""Challenges to sea and air transportation remain due to damage sustained by the wharves and the ash that is covering the runways,"" the PM's office said.
A thick layer of ash blankets the islands, the aerial images provided to Tonga by New Zealand and Australia showed.
The archipelago's main Fua’amotu International Airport was not damaged but the ash was having to be manually cleared from the runway, with the earliest opening being on Wednesday, the OCHA said.
As well as the damage locally, scientists say the eruption could have a long lasting impact on coral reefs, coastlines and fisheries in the wider region, as well as causing acid rain https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/tongas-volcanic-eruption-may-harm-environment-years-scientists-say-2022-01-18.
Parts of Peru's coast were dirtied by oil https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/peru-says-oil-spill-affects-least-2-kilometers-pacific-coast-beaches-2022-01-18 spilled from a discharge ship rocked by waves caused by the eruption, Peruvian Environment Minister Ruben Ramirez said. 
Clean water sources remain a concern and Tonga's government has advised people to drink only bottled water as sources may be contaminated with ash, debris and the sea, the OCHA said.
The Tongan navy has deployed with health teams and water, food and tents to the Ha'apai islands, with more aid sent on Tuesday, the prime minister's office said.
The NZDF images, posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and confirmed by Tu’ihalangingie, showed tarpaulins being used as shelter on Mango, one of the kingdom's 176 islands https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/tonga-its-volcanic-eruption-2022-01-18.
UNDERSEA CABLE
Tonga is expected to issue formal requests for aid soon but in the meantime New Zealand said two ships, HMNZS Wellington and HMNZS Aotearoa, had set off with water supplies, survey teams and a helicopter. U.N. teams are on standby, the OCHA said.
Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said C-130 aircraft from Australia could deliver humanitarian assistance including water purification kits, while the HMAS Adelaide, which would take five days to get to Tonga, was ready to take engineering and medical teams and helicopter support.
The PM's office said some limited communications had been made with satellite phones, but some areas remained cut off.
For families waiting for news, the silence was deafening. ""The worst fear is always that you're not going to see the people that you love again,"" said Seini Taumoepeau, a Tongan-Australian in Sydney who has relatives across the islands.
International mobile phone network provider Digicel has set up an interim system on the main island using the University of South Pacific’s satellite dish, New Zealand said. 

Subcom, a U.S. based private company contracted to repair subsea cables in the Asia-Pacific, said it was working with Tonga Cable Ltd to repair the link that runs from Tonga to Fiji. 
Samiuela Fonua, the chair of Tonga Cable, said there were two cuts in the undersea cable that would not be fixed until volcanic activity ceased, allowing repair crews access.

130,"<span>Jan 18, 2022 07:07AM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) -Prime Minister Boris Johnson has apologised for attending a ""bring your own booze"" gathering at his official residence during Britain's first coronavirus lockdown, and an internal inquiry is being carried out to establish the facts.
British media have reported that at least 11 gatherings took place at Johnson's 10 Downing Street residence or in other government departments between May 2020 and April 2021, when COVID-19 rules limited how many people could meet socially.
Sue Gray, a senior civil servant, is leading an inquiry. She has not said when her findings will be published.
Below is a timeline of the party reports and what Johnson has said about them:
Nov. 30 - First lockdown Christmas party report
The Mirror newspaper reports that Christmas parties took place in government offices, including Johnson's own in Downing Street, in December 2020, when such gatherings were banned.
Later media reports include a photo of Johnson hosting an online Christmas quiz for his staff, seated alongside an official draped in tinsel.
Dec. 1 - Johnson denial
Asked by the leader of the opposition Labour Party about reports of a December 2020 Christmas party, Johnson tells parliament: ""All guidance was followed completely in No. 10.""
Dec. 7 - Video of staff joking about party
 ITV  (LON:ITV) News publishes a leaked video showing Johnson's staff laughing and joking during a mock news conference over how to explain a gathering in Downing Street. 
In the video, Allegra Stratton, then Johnson's press secretary, says: ""This fictional party was a business meeting, and it was not socially distanced.""
Dec. 8 - Johnson apologises, aide resigns
Johnson tells parliament: ""I apologise unreservedly for the offence that (the Stratton clip) has caused up and down the country, and I apologise for the impression that it gives.
""I have been repeatedly assured since these allegations emerged that there was no party and that no COVID rules were broken... if those rules were broken, there will be disciplinary action for all those involved."" 
Stratton resigns.
Dec. 9 - Details of inquiry published
The government says Britain's top civil servant, Simon Case, will lead an inquiry into three alleged gatherings. After additional media reports, it is broadened to cover further gatherings.
Dec. 17 - Lead investigator steps down
Case steps down after reports that an event was held in his own office. The government says the investigation will be concluded by Gray.
Dec. 19 - Garden party photo published
The Guardian newspaper publishes a photograph of Johnson and more than a dozen others drinking wine in the Downing Street garden that it said was taken during lockdown on May 15, 2020. 
Dec. 20 - Johnson says garden party was work
""Those were people at work talking about work,"" Johnson said when asked about the Guardian picture.
Jan. 10 - Party invitation from Johnson's aide published
ITV publishes an email sent by Johnson's Principal Private Secretary Martin Reynolds to over 100 Downing Street employees on May 20, 2020, inviting them ""after what has been an incredibly busy period... (to) some socially distanced drinks in the No10 garden this evening ... and bring your own booze!""
ITV said around 40 staff gathered, including Johnson and his partner Carrie, even though at the time social mixing between households was limited to two people outdoors.
Jan. 12 - PM says he attended lockdown gathering
Johnson tells parliament he attended a gathering on May 20, 2020, in the Downing Street garden and apologises.
""When I went into that garden... to thank groups of staff before going back into my office 25 minutes later to continue working, I believed implicitly that this was a work event,"" he said. His press secretary says he did not see Reynolds' email.
The Times newspaper cites Conservative lawmakers saying Johnson later told them he did not believe he had personally done anything wrong and said ""we're taking hits for something we don't deserve"".
Jan. 13 - Police decline to investigate gatherings
British police say they will not investigate the Downing Street gatherings unless Gray's inquiry finds evidence of potential criminal offences.
Jan. 14 - PM apologises to Buckingham Palace
Johnson's office apologises to Queen Elizabeth after it emerged staff partied late into the night in Downing Street on the eve of her husband Prince Philip's funeral in April 2021, when mixing indoors was banned. Johnson was at his country residence that day, his spokesman says.
One of those parties was a leaving event for James Slack, a former director of communications, who apologises and says the gathering ""should not have happened at the time that it did"".
Jan. 17 - Former aide says Johnson knew about May 2020 party

Dominic Cummings, a former senior adviser to Johnson, says he is willing to ""swear under oath"" the prime minister knew about the May 20, 2020 party. 
Cummings says he and at least one other adviser told Reynolds the drinks should not go ahead and that this warning was sent via email. According to Cummings, Reynolds said he would check with Johnson if he was happy for the drinks to go ahead, and he is sure Reynolds did so.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO would be likely to reinforce its troop presence in the Black Sea and the Baltics while fending off cyberattacks if Russia were to invade Ukraine, diplomats and former officials said.
But with the Western military alliance under no treaty obligation to defend Ukraine, which is not a NATO member, some of the toughest decisions could fall on the European Union. 
They include how to hit Moscow with any new economic sanctions, the fallout from any shortage of Russian natural gas to Europe and taking in refugees fleeing war.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov has said that diplomacy last week over legally binding security demands had come to a ""dead end"". Envoys and experts are divided over whether Russia will invade Ukraine.
The Kremlin has massed 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders, a buildup https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-belarus-plan-joint-military-drills-february-lukashenko-2022-01-17 that the West says is preparation for a war to stop Ukraine ever joining NATO. Russia denies planning an invasion.
NATO is already intensifying the strategy it has employed since Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014, with more defensive military planning, modernising deterrents, supporting Ukraine with cyberwarfare teams and seeking dialogue with Moscow.
As there is a risk of any conflict spilling over into NATO territory around the Black Sea, the alliance faces the dilemma of how much more to prepare and how to support Kyiv. 
Even though NATO agreed at a summit in Bucharest in 2008 that Ukraine would one day become a NATO member, the alliance is not bound by its founding treaty to defend Ukraine.
U.S. President Joe Biden has ruled out sending U.S. troops to Ukraine to fight Russian soldiers. 
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Nov. 30: ""It is important to distinguish between NATO allies and partner Ukraine ... Ukraine is a partner, a highly valued partner."" 
Two NATO diplomats said Western steps to support Ukraine could range from more U.S. weaponry and drones for the Ukrainian armed forces to intensified training of Ukrainian forces - especially in ways to react to any Russian missile attacks. Britain has begun supplying Ukraine with anti-tank weapons.
Stoltenberg said the Western military alliance would sign an agreement on closer cybersecurity cooperation with Kyiv in the coming days, without giving more details, after cyberattacks https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/exclusive-ukraine-suspects-group-linked-belarus-intelligence-over-cyberattack-2022-01-15 on Ukrainian government websites last week.
NATO'S BALTIC FOCUS
Hans-Lothar Domroese, a retired German general who led one of the highest NATO commands until 2016, said that if Russia invaded Ukraine, NATO would ""raise the alert levels."" 
""NATO might reinforce the eastern front, sending bigger military units to Poland and the Baltic states, something NATO has ruled out so far. NATO might also base troops in south-eastern Europe,"" he told Reuters.
That would still be in defence of NATO territory, but would send a message of resolve to Russia.
Since 2014, NATO has prioritised reinforcing the Baltics, and has deployed four multinational battalion-size battlegroups led by Canada, Germany, Britain and the United States in Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Poland.
Estonia's prime minister told Reuters last week that the Baltic states were talking to allies about increasing military deployments on their soil, and Stoltenberg has said any Russian attack on Ukraine would spur a decision.
Denmark agreed last week to send four more F-16 warplanes to Lithuania and a frigate to help patrol the Baltic Sea.
The troops serve as a ""trip wire"" for NATO's 40,000-strong response force to come in quickly and bring more U.S. troops and weapons from across the Atlantic. 
POSSIBLE SPILLOVER IN BLACK SEA REGION
Retired U.S. General Ben Hodges, who commanded U.S. army forces in Europe from 2014 until 2017, said NATO allies should prepare for broader consequences from any Russian invasion of Ukraine. He warned that the militarised Crimea peninsula has become Russia's ""unsinkable aircraft carrier"". 
""I would expect that if there is a new offensive on a significant scale, there is a chance of a spillover, whether at sea, in the air, in cyber,"" Hodges told Reuters. 
""If there is a new offensive, then we have three NATO allies in the Black Sea region: Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey ... We should be taking all steps for our collective defence.""
The two NATO diplomats said allied defence ministers were likely next month to discuss sending more forces to NATO's multinational division headquarters in Romania. Although operational since 2017, it remains only a land command, without immediate air, maritime or special forces.

Hodges said a more substantial operational centre would include more naval and air exercises, intelligence sharing, greater monitoring of Russian submarines and commercial port visits to Crimea, and ultimately better preparation for conflict. 
Romania has pushed for a bigger NATO naval presence on the Black Sea, but its neighbour Bulgaria is wary of provoking Russia. The involvement of Turkey, a member of NATO but not of the EU, would be crucial.

MADRID (Reuters) - World men's tennis No. 1 Novak Djokovic will have to comply with Spanish health rules to be able to travel to Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Monday.
Answering a question on whether Djokovic would be allowed to enter Spain to compete after Australia deported him for being unvaccinated against COVID-19, Sanchez said: ""Any sportsperson who wishes to compete in our country must comply with the health rules of Spain"".
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who was visiting Spain on Monday and stood beside Sanchez during the news conference, also insisted the different rules in the different countries must be respected. ""We all have to abide by them, no matter who we are,"" he said.
Djokovic travels regularly to Spain where he owns a house in the southern resort of Marbella. He spent a few days in late December and early January and video footage showed him training there. 

Spanish rules currently require people to have either a vaccine certificate, a PCR negative test or a certificate of having recovered from COVID. The country imposes strict quarantines on people who test positive.
During the same news conference, the Spanish Prime Minister made an impassioned call for vaccination. Even though vaccination is not mandatory in Spain, the vaccination rate is one of the highest in Europe.

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine's former president, Petro Poroshenko, landed in Kyiv on Monday to face treason charges in a case he says was trumped up by allies of his successor, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. 
In a brief stand-off at border control after arriving on a flight from Warsaw, Poroshenko accused border guards of taking away his passport. He later greeted a crowd of thousands of cheering and flag-waving supporters outside the airport. 
Poroshenko's return sets up a showdown with President Zelenskiy's government in what critics say is an ill-judged distraction as Ukraine braces for a possible Russian military offensive and seeks the support of its Western allies.
Western diplomats called for political unity in Ukraine before the arrival of Poroshenko, who was president from 2014 until 2019.
Poroshenko, 56, is being investigated for alleged treason linked to the financing of Russian-backed separatist fighters through illegal coal sales in 2014-15. He could face 15 years in prison if convicted. His party accused Zelenskiy of a reckless attempt to silence political opposition.
Zelenskiy's administration says the prosecutors and judiciary are independent and accuses Poroshenko of thinking he is above the law. Zelenskiy trounced Poroshenko in an election in 2019. He ran on a ticket to tackle corruption and curb the influence of oligarchs in the former Soviet republic.
""We are not here to protect Poroshenko, but to unite and protect Ukraine,"" Poroshenko told the crowd, before heading to the Pechersk court in central Kyiv for a hearing into his case, as supporters chanted outside the building.
During a break in the court session, he told the crowd: ""The authorities are confused, weak, and instead of fighting (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, they are trying to fight us."" 
Tetiana Sapyan, a spokeswoman for the State Bureau of Investigations (DBR), told a separate briefing that the DBR was apolitical. 
The court eventually deferred a decision on whether to order Poroshenko's arrest after a session lasting nearly 12 hours. The former president and supporters broke out in song after the hearing ended. The hearing resumes on Wednesday. 
""Today we did not win the war, we did not win the battle, but we kept our positions, preventing them from advancing,"" Poroshenko told the crowd.
RUSSIAN TROOP BUILDUP 
On Friday, Zelenskiy's chief of staff batted away suggestions that Zelenskiy was behaving like Viktor Yanukovich, a former president who was backed by Russia and whose political rival Yulia Tymoshenko was jailed in a case that Western countries widely condemned as politicised. 
Ukraine has tried to rally Western support in its standoff with Moscow after sounding the alarm about a build-up of tens of thousands of Russian troops near its borders.
A confectionary tycoon, Poroshenko was elected as head of a pro-Western government after the Maidan street protests that ousted Yanukovich in 2014.

Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed in 2014 after Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula and backed separatist fighters in a conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Prosecutors asked a Ukrainian court in December to arrest Poroshenko, with the possibility of bail set at 1 billion hryvnia ($37 million).

DUBAI (Reuters) - Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group attacked the United Arab Emirates in what it said was an operation using missiles and drones, setting off explosions in fuel trucks that killed three people and causing a fire near the airport of Abu Dhabi, capital of the region's commercial and tourism hub.
The strike on a leading Gulf Arab ally of the United States takes the war between the Houthi group and a Saudi-led coalition to a new level, and may hinder efforts to contain regional tensions as Washington and Tehran work to rescue a nuclear deal.
""The UAE condemns this terrorist attack by the Houthi militia on areas and civilian facilities on Emirati soil...(It) will not go unpunished,"" its foreign ministry said. ""The UAE reserves the right to respond to these terrorist attacks and criminal escalation.""
The UAE, a member of the coalition, has armed and trained local Yemeni forces that recently joined fighting against the Houthis in Yemen's energy-producing Shabwa and Marib regions.
""With (nuclear) negotiators running out of time, the risk of a deterioration in the region's security climate is rising,"" said Torbjorn Soltvedt, principal MENA analyst at risk intelligence company Verisk (NASDAQ:VRSK) Maplecroft.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in a phone call with his Emirati counterpart, condemned the attack, the UAE state news agency reported. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Washington would work to hold the Houthis accountable.
The Houthis have frequently launched cross-border missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia, but have claimed few such attacks on the UAE, mostly denied by Emirati authorities.
Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said the group fired five ballistic missiles and ""a large number"" of drones at Dubai and Abu Dhabi airports, an oil refinery in Musaffah and several ""sensitive"" sites in the UAE. [C6N2TI01B]
Abu Dhabi police said three people were killed and six wounded when three fuel tanker trucks exploded in the industrial Musaffah area near storage facilities of oil firm ADNOC. State media said those killed were two Indians and a Pakistani.
Police said initial investigations found parts of small planes that could possibly be drones at the sites in Musaffah and Abu Dhabi airport, but they made no mention of missiles.
ADNOC said an incident at its Mussafah Fuel Depot at 10 a.m. resulted in a fire. Police closed the road leading to the area, where unverified footage on social media had shown thick smoke. 
""ADNOC is deeply saddened to confirm that three colleagues have died. A further six colleagues were injured and received immediate specialist medical care,"" it said. 
ADNOC added that it had activated business continuity plans to ensure an uninterrupted supply of products to local and international customers.
An Etihad Airways spokesperson said a small number of flights were briefly disrupted at Abu Dhabi airport due to ""precautionary measures"", but normal operations quickly resumed.
PROXY FIGHT
The Saudi-led alliance carried out air strikes on Yemen's Houthi-held capital Sanaa, Reuters witnesses said, following the strike on the UAE and after the coalition intercepted eight drones launched toward Saudi Arabia on Monday.
One of the air strikes hit the home of a former military official, killing him and his 25-year-old son, a medical source and two neighbours told Reuters. 
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the attack on the UAE and urged ""all parties to exercise maximum restraint and prevent any escalation"", his spokesperson said.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the attack threatened regional stability. 
There was no immediate comment from Iranian officials, but Iran's Tasnim news agency reported it as an ""important operation"".
Riyadh and Abu Dhabi had moved to engage directly with Iran in recent months to avoid any wider conflict that could hurt regional economic ambitions. The Yemen war is widely seen as a proxy war between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Iran.
The Houthi strike could derail UAE and wider Gulf dialogue with Iran, said UAE political analyst Abdulkhaleq Abdulla.

""The UAE is not going to take this very lightly,"" he said.
The attack coincided with a visit to the UAE by South Korean President Moon Jae-in. A Blue House official said a summit between Moon and Abu Dhabi's crown prince was cancelled.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Worshippers invited a stranger into a Texas synagogue when he knocked on their door and offered him tea before he brandished a gun and held them hostage in a 10-hour siege the FBI called a ""terrorism-related matter, in which the Jewish community was targeted.""
Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker, who was among the four congregants taken captive on Saturday, the Jewish sabbath, told CBS on Monday that he and others managed to escape after he threw a chair at the hostage-taker and then rushed for an exit door. 
The FBI identified the man as Malik Faisal Akram, a 44-year-old British citizen.
""When I took him in, I stayed with him. Making tea was an opportunity for me to talk to him. And in that moment, I didn't hear anything suspicious. Some of his story didn't quite add up, so I was a little bit curious, but that's not necessarily an uncommon thing,"" the rabbi said.
The rabbi returned to prayer, after which he said he ""heard a click - and it could have been anything - but it turned out it was his gun.""
One hostage was released unharmed after six hours of tense negotiations aided by the suspect's family. The incident ended in gunfire with the suspect dead as members of an FBI hostage rescue team raided the synagogue.
It was unclear whether the gunman took his own life or was killed by members of the FBI team. The FBI said its Joint Terrorism Task Force was investigating the incident.
Cytron-Walker, the rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, west of Dallas, Texas, said he drew on hostage training from the FBI to determine when to try to escape. 
""When I saw an opportunity where he wasn't in a good position, I made sure that the two gentlemen who were still with me, that they were ready to go, (and that) the exit wasn't too far away,"" Cytron-Walker said. 
""I told them to go. I threw a chair at the gunman, and I headed for the door, and all three of us were able to get out without even a shot being fired.""

Police in England said they detained two teenagers for questioning in connection with the case.
Hate crimes targeting the U.S. Jewish community constitute over half of all religion-based crimes nationwide, the Anti-Defamation League said.

(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Monday handed a defeat to abortion clinics by delaying a legal challenge to a Texas law banning most abortions in that state.
In a 2-1 ruling, the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the Texas Supreme Court should address enforcement questions related to the law before the Texas clinics' challenge could resume.
The Republican-backed law bans abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, a time many women remain unaware they are pregnant, and is one of the country's most restrictive abortion measures.
Lawyers for the clinics had urged the 5th Circuit to let the case continue before a federal judge who had previously blocked the ban. They cited a U.S. Supreme Court order in December that allowed the lawsuit to continue against certain licensing officials even as the law took effect.
Marc Hearron, a lawyer for the Center for Reproductive Rights representing the clinics, told the appeals court at a Jan. 7 hearing ""any further delay would be inconsistent with how the Supreme Court has handled this case.""
Hearron did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. A lawyer at the office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton did not immediately respond to a similar request.
Circuit Judges Edith Jones and Kyle Duncan, both appointed by Republican presidents, voted to send the case to the Texas Supreme Court. They asked the state court to consider whether the Texas attorney general, the Texas Medical Board and other licensing officials can take action to enforce the law if it is violated. 
In dissent, Circuit Judge Stephen Higginson, a Democratic appointee, said sending the case to the Texas Supreme Court would ""contravene"" the U.S. Supreme Court's mandate, adding, ""Justice delayed is justice denied.""

The Supreme Court is expected by June to decide the constitutionality of a Mississippi law that bans abortions at 15 weeks of pregnancy.
Mississippi and other abortion opponents asked the justices in that case to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that made abortion legal nationwide.

(Reuters) - Tonga’s massive underwater volcanic eruption could deliver long-lasting damage to coral reefs, erode coastlines and disrupt fisheries, say scientists studying satellite images and looking to the past to project the future of the remote region:
ACID RAIN
Since the initial eruption, the volcano has been releasing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide — two gases that create acid rain when they interact with water and oxygen in the atmosphere. 
With Tonga’s tropical climate, “there is likely to be acid rain around Tonga for a while to come,” said volcanologist Shane Cronin at the University of Auckland. 
Acid rain causes widespread crop damage, and could ruin Tongan staples like taro, corn, bananas and garden vegetables. “Depending on how long the eruptions last, food security could be compromised,” Cronin said. 
Satellite imagery shows the plume spreading westward, which means Tonga could be spared some of this acid rain though Fiji could then be in its path. 
In a bulletin on Monday, the U.N. humanitarian affairs office said Fiji was monitoring its air quality, and has advised people to cover their household water tanks and stay indoors in the event of rain. 
FISH DIE-OFFS
Tonga’s exclusive economic zone of nearly 700,000 marine square kilometres (270,271 square miles) is 1,000 times larger than its land area. And most Tongans get their food — and livelihood — from the ocean.
While scientists have yet to investigate on the ground, “the few pictures that are available seem to show a blanket ... of ash” on land, said Marco Brenna, a geologist at the University of Otago in New Zealand.
In the ocean, that ash can be harmful to marine life. Weeks before Saturday’s eruption, Tonga Geological Services had warned that nearby seawater was contaminated with toxic volcanic discharge, and that fishermen should “assume fish in these waters are poisoned or poisonous.”
Inevitably, the eruption has made the situation worse. Murky, ash-filled water near the volcano will deprive fish of food and wipe out spawning beds. Some fish will perish, and survivors will be forced to migrate, scientists said. Further changes in the structure of the sea floor could create new obstacles for fishing vessels.
“It will be a while before the same or new fishing grounds will be restored,” Brenna said.
SMOTHERED CORALS
Falling ash can also smother coral reefs, which in Tonga are the mainstay of a tourism industry that brought in up to $5 million per year before the coronavirus pandemic.
Even before the eruption, Tonga’s reefs were threatened by disease outbreaks and the effects of climate change including coral bleaching and increasingly strong cyclones.
Now, “vast areas of the reefs in the immediate impact area at Hunga Tonga are probably buried and smothered by large deposits of volcanic ash,” said Tom Schils, a marine biologist at the University of Guam who has studied volcanic eruptions and corals in the Northern Mariana Islands.
Such eruptions also release more iron into the water, which can boost the growth of blue-green algae and sponges that further degrade reefs.
Reefs may have to start over - a process that could take years, said Brian Zgliczynski, a coral reef ecologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. “Species more tolerant of poor water quality will arrive first,” while hard corals and fish would take longer to return, he said.
ERODED COASTLINES
A loss of coral reefs would also affect Tonga's ability to cope with rising waters and storm surges. This is a concern for Tonga, where climate change is driving the sea level to rise by about 6 millimeters (0.2 inches) per year — double the global average. 
In a 2015 report https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leanne-Fernandes/publication/317341776_National_marine_ecosystem_service_valuation_summary_Tonga/links/5bbe5828299bf1010178adac/National-marine-ecosystem-service-valuation-summary-Tonga.pdf, Tonga valued its natural storm buffers including coral reefs as well as coastal seagrasses and mangroves at some $11 million annually.

With the latest eruption, a Tongan sea level gauge recorded a tsunami wave of 1.19 metres (nearly four feet) before it stopped reporting. Tsunamis are known to cause rapid coastal erosion. And before communication systems went down, videos revealed damage to manmade seawalls.
“Coastal defences and reclaimed land could all be strongly impacted by the tsunami waves, leaving the islands more vulnerable,” Cronin said.

Western countries say they fear Russia is preparing a pretext for a new assault on Ukraine, which it invaded in 2014.
Moscow denies any plans for an attack, but has said it could take unspecified military action unless the West agrees to a list of demands, including banning Ukraine from ever joining NATO. Talks last week ended with no breakthrough. Kyiv has asked Western countries for arms to help it protect itself.
""We have taken the decision to supply Ukraine with light anti-armour defensive weapon systems,"" British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told parliament, saying the first systems were already delivered on Monday and a small number of British personnel would provide training for a short period of time.
He did not specify the number or type of weapons that were being sent, but said: ""They are not strategic weapons and pose no threat to Russia. They are to use in self-defence.""
""These are short-range .... but nevertheless it would make people pause and think what they were doing and if tanks were to roll into Ukraine, invade it, then they would be part of the defence mechanism.""
Ukraine's defence minister welcomed Wallace's announcement. 
""Ukraine highly appreciates Britain's decision to provide a new security package with light, anti-armour, defensive weapon systems!"" Oleksii Reznikov said in a tweet. 
Britain has previously warned Russia of severe consequences if it launched a new military assault on Ukraine, while offering financing to enhance Ukraine's naval capabilities.

Wallace said he had invited Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu to visit London in the next few weeks to discuss the crisis, though he did not know whether the Russians would accept.
""The current gap is wide but not unbridgeable,"" Wallace said, voicing the hope that diplomacy would prevail and adding, ""It is President (Vladimir) Putin’s choice.""

The United States has been Ukraine's most powerful backer in its standoff with Moscow after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the outbreak of the war in eastern Ukraine.
""I think Vladimir Putin has made the biggest mistake of his career in underestimating how courageously the people of Ukraine will fight him if he invades,"" Senator Richard Blumenthal told reporters. 
""And we will impose crippling economic sanctions, but more important we will give the people of Ukraine the arms, lethal arms they need to defend their lives and livelihoods,"" he said after the delegation met President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

These weapons could include Javelin anti-tank missiles, Stinger missiles, small arms and boats, he said.
""And so our message is: there will be consequences if he chooses to violate the sanctity of this democracy,"" Senator Amy Klobuchar added.

140,"<span>Jan 17, 2022 02:20PM ET</span>",,,,,,"LONDON (Reuters) - A former senior adviser to Britain's Boris Johnson said on Monday he was willing to ""swear under oath"" that the prime minister knew a party was being held at his residence during a COVID-19 lockdown, accusing him of lying to parliament. 
British media have reported that at least 11 gatherings took place at 10 Downing Street - the prime minister's official residence and office - or in other government departments between May 2020 and April 2021, when COVID-19 rules limited how many people could meet socially. An internal inquiry is being carried out to establish the facts.
Johnson last week apologised to parliament for attending a ""bring your own booze"" gathering in the garden of Downing Street on May 20, 2020, but said he had thought it was a work event.
Dominic Cummings, an architect of Britain's departure from the European Union and a former senior adviser to Johnson who left government under acrimonious terms in November 2020, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that the prime minister had agreed that the drinks party should go ahead. 
""Not only me but other eyewitnesses who discussed this at the time would swear under oath this is what happened,"" he said on his blog.
Last week  ITV  (LON:ITV) News published an email invitation from Johnson's Principal Private Secretary Martin Reynolds to a May 20, 2020 event, asking attendees to ""bring your own booze"".
Cummings said that after Reynolds was told to cancel the invite by at least two people Reynolds checked with Johnson if it should go ahead.
""The PM agreed it should,"" Cummings said in his blog.

Johnson's spokesman denied earlier on Monday that the prime minister had been made aware of the May 20 event.
""It's untrue to say that the prime minister was told or warned ahead of that,"" the spokesman said.

Judge Tarek Bitar's investigation into the massive blast, which killed more than 215 people and deepened Lebanon's economic crisis, has been suspended repeatedly by lawsuits brought by senior politicians who he has sought to question.
Hezbollah, a powerful group with an armed militia, has led the campaign to remove Bitar, accusing him of bias after he pursued some of its political allies.
In the latest twist, a lawsuit brought by former minister Youssef Finianos, one of the senior figures Bitar wants to interrogate, has been left in limbo by the retirement last week of Judge Roukoz Rizk, who was hearing it, judicial sources say.
""While this lawsuit is not decided, the investigating judge cannot issue the indictment,"" a judicial source said.
There can be no ruling in the case, which the source said accuses Bitar of ""a grave error"" in conducting the probe, until a replacement is found for Rizk, who reached mandatory retirement age.
Politicians typically pick judges in Lebanon, which Nizar Saghieh of watchdog Legal Agenda said could allow them to leave the position open and the case pending.
Such a move could stymie the probe.
Bitar's opponents accuse him of bias and of overstepping his powers. His supporters see his efforts as a bold attempt to hold senior officials to account in a country where impunity has been entrenched since the end of the 1975-1990 civil war.
The investigation is currently frozen due to a separate lawsuit.
Families of blast victims protested outside the Beirut headquarters of the judiciary on Monday to demanding the probe move more quickly and for the swift replacement of Rizk.
""We want to reach justice, we don't want to wait for years,"" said Kayan Tlais, who lost his brother in the blast.
Hezbollah and its allies had been boycotting cabinet meetings for three months, saying they wanted Bitar removed. On Saturday, a few days after Rizk retired, the group and its allies said they were ending the boycott. 

Heiko Wimmen of Crisis Group said described lawsuits that have been hindering progress as ""legal theatre"" and said obstructing the probe would further damage public trust in the nation's institutions.
""It's very clear that Judge Bitar will not be allowed to summon anybody, let alone indict anybody,"" he said. ""Whoever doesn't want this investigation to go anywhere has succeeded in that.""

Angela Glover, 50, had been living in the South Pacific archipelago with her husband James since the couple married and set up the Tonga Animal Welfare Society to provide shelter and rehabilitation to stray dogs before rehoming them.
""I understand that this terrible accident came about as they tried to rescue their dogs,"" her brother Nick Eleini said.
""She loved people and she loved animals and this went right back to her childhood,"" he said. ""And the strange thing was was the uglier the dog, the more she loved it.""
New Zealand state broadcaster TVNZ earlier reported she was missing after being swept away by a wave while her husband managed to hold onto a tree.
Eleini confirmed her body had been found, saying the family were shattered by the news.

""Angela was the heart of our family. She was the emotional heart of our family. And, you know, that heart is now gone,"" he said.

SYDNEY/WELLINGTON (Reuters) -A distress signal has been detected in an isolated, low-lying group of islands in the Tonga archipelago following Saturday's massive volcanic eruption and tsunami, the United Nations said, prompting particular concern for its inhabitants.
Initial reports suggested no mass casualties on the main island of Togatapu, but two people were reported missing and the capital Nuku'alofa was badly damaged, as were resorts and homes along the island's western beaches, it said.
""Further volcanic activity cannot be ruled out,"" the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in the update on Monday, reporting only minor injuries but emphasising that formal assessments, especially of the outer islands, had yet to be released with communications badly hit.
The uninhabited volcanic island of Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai all but disappeared following the blast, according to satellite images from around 12 hours later. The Pacific archipelago was blanketed in ash and volcanic ash clouds spread to countries thousands of kilometres to the west.
The OCHA said there had been no contact from the Ha’apai group of islands and there was ""particular concern"" about two small low-lying islands - Fonoi and Mango, where an active distress beacon had been detected. According to the Tonga government, 36 people live on Mango and 69 on Fonoi. 
Experts said the volcano, which last erupted in 2014, had been puffing away for about a month before rising magma, superheated to around 1,000 degrees Celsius, met with 20-degree seawater, causing an instantaneous and massive explosion.
The unusual ""astounding"" speed and force of the eruption indicated a greater force at play than simply magma meeting water, scientists said. 
Australia and New Zealand sent surveillance flights on Monday to assess damage and Australia's Minister for the Pacific Zed Seselja said Australian police had visited beaches and reported significant damage with ""houses thrown around"".
British woman Angela Glover, who ran a dog charity in Tonga, was killed, her brother told British media. 
The impact of the eruption was felt as far away as Fiji, New Zealand, the United States and Japan. Two people drowned off a beach in northern Peru due to high waves caused by the tsunami.
Tonga's deputy head of mission in Australia, Curtis Tu'ihalangingie, said Tonga was concerned about the risk of aid deliveries spreading COVID-19 to the island, which is COVID-free. 
""We don't want to bring in another wave - a tsunami of COVID-19,"" Tu'ihalangingie told Reuters by telephone.
""When people see such a huge explosion they want to help,"" he said, but added Tonga diplomats were also concerned by some private fundraising efforts and urged the public to wait until a disaster relief fund was announced.
Any aid sent to Tonga would need to be quarantined, and it was likely no foreign personnel would be allowed to disembark aircraft, he said.
International communication has been severely hampered by damage to an undersea cable, which could take more than a week to restore, and Australia and New Zealand were assisting with satellite calls, he said.
Telephone networks in Tonga have been restored but ash was posing a major health concern, contaminating drinking water.
""Most people are not aware the ash is toxic and bad for them to breathe and they have to wear a mask,"" Tu'ihalangingie said.
'COMPLETELY DESTROYED'
The Ha’atafu Beach Resort, on the Hihifo peninsula, 21 km (13 miles) west of the capital Nuku’alofa, was “completely wiped out”, the owners said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
The family that manages the resort had run for their lives through the bush to escape the tsunami, it said. “The whole western coastline has been completely destroyed along with Kanukupolu village,” the resort said.
The Red Cross said it was mobilising its network to respond to what it called the worst volcanic eruption the Pacific has experienced in decades.
Katie Greenwood, the Pacific head of delegation for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, told Reuters up to 80,000 people could have been affected by the tsunami.
Alexander Matheou, the federation's Asia Pacific regional director, said water purification, providing shelter and reuniting families were the priorities - but they had yet to establish direct contact with colleagues on the ground and were relying on estimates based on previous such disasters.
Scientists https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tonga-volcano-science-explainer/explainer-scientists-struggle-to-monitor-tonga-volcano-after-massive-eruption-idUSKBN2JR0IS were struggling to monitor the volcano, after the explosion destroyed its sea-level crater and drowned its mass, obscuring it from satellites.

Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai has erupted regularly over the past few decades. Early data suggests the eruption was the biggest blast since Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines 30 years ago, New Zealand-based volcanologist Shane Cronin told Radio New Zealand.
""This is an eruption best witnessed from space,"" Cronin said.

PARIS (Reuters) -Novak Djokovic risks being frozen out of tennis as he chases a record 21st Grand Slam title, with rules on travellers who are unvaccinated against COVID-19 tightening in the third year of the pandemic and some tournaments reconsidering exemptions.
The Serbian, who has not been vaccinated, was deported from Australia on Sunday ahead of the Australian Open after losing a court case to have the cancellation of his visa overturned.
Under Australian law, Djokovic cannot get another visa for three years - denying him the chance to add to his nine titles at Melbourne Park - but the government has left the door open nL1N2TX010 for a possible return next year.
The world number one, however, faces more immediate hurdles in his bid to overtake Swiss Roger Federer and Spaniard Rafa Nadal, with whom he is tied on 20 major titles, as he could be barred from the French Open as things stand.
The French Sports Ministry said on Monday there would be no exemption from a new vaccine pass law approved on Sunday, which requires people to have vaccination certificates to enter public places such as restaurants, cafes and cinemas.
""This will apply to everyone who is a spectator or a professional sportsperson. And this until further notice,"" the ministry said.
""As far as Roland Garros is concerned, it's in May. The situation may change between now and then and we hope it'll be more favourable. So we'll see but clearly there's no exemption.""
The ministry's stance was welcomed by Germany's world number three Alexander Zverev.
""At least it's clear what's going to happen,"" he told reporters after winning his opening match at Melbourne Park on Monday. ""At least they're saying, 'OK, no unvaccinated players are allowed to play in the French Open.'
""We know that now in advance, and I can imagine there's not going to be any exemptions, and that's OK.""
NEXT UP
The next tournament on Djokovic's calendar is likely to be the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships from Feb. 21-26. 
A spokesperson for the event told Reuters that all players would need to provide negative PCR tests before being allowed into the United Arab Emirates.
""(Players) will then need to adhere to the testing protocols and processes stipulated by the ATP and the WTA,"" the spokesperson added.
Organisers of the Monte Carlo Masters, which Djokovic has won twice, are awaiting French government guidelines for the next edition in April, while Wimbledon organisers AELTC are also yet to finalise safety arrangements for the major.
However, England's Lawn Tennis Association said entry requirements for its events, some of which serve as Wimbledon warm-ups, would be determined by the government.
Currently, unvaccinated people can enter England but must isolate for 10 days.
A U.S. Open representative said last week that the year's final major would follow New York City Department of Health guidelines.
Djokovic could have trouble even getting into the United States, because foreign air travellers have had to be fully vaccinated since November and provide proof before boarding flights, with limited exceptions.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said there are no exceptions for vaccine requirements ""for religious reasons or other moral convictions.""
That rule could also impact Djokovic's participation in U.S. hardcourt tournaments at Indian Wells and Miami in March.
The Serbian, who is among three ATP players in the top 100 yet to be vaccinated, could also face issues ahead of the Italian Open in Rome in May due to tough anti-COVID restrictions in Italy.

Madrid Mayor Jose Luis Martinez-Almeida told La Sexta TV station on Monday that it would ""be great"" to have Djokovic play in the April 26-May 8 Madrid Open, which he has won three times, though the government would be the arbiter.
Spain requires visitors to prove they have been vaccinated, had a recent negative test, or have immunity based on recovery.

The ""Allied Resolve"" exercises will be held near Belarus's western rim, the borders of NATO members Poland and Lithuania, and its southern flank with Ukraine, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko said. 
""Set an exact date and let us know, so we aren't blamed for massing some troops here out of the blue, as if we are preparing to go to war,"" he told top military officials. 
Troop movements by Russia are being closely scrutinised as a military buildup near Ukraine's borders and a barrage of threatening rhetoric have stirred Western fears that Russia is planning to invade.
Moscow denies any such plan, but has used the standoff https://www.reuters.com/world/us-rallies-united-front-against-russia-putin-seeks-cracks-2022-01-14 to campaign for security guarantees from the West, including a halt to NATO expansion and a formal veto on Ukraine https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/exclusive-ukraine-suspects-group-linked-belarus-intelligence-over-cyberattack-2022-01-15, a former Soviet republic, ever joining the military alliance. 
The Belarusian leader, a pariah in the West since a sweeping crackdown in 2020 and last year's migrant crisis with the European Union, said the drills were needed as Ukraine had built up troops near Belarus. 
He said Poland and the Baltics had more than 30,000 soldiers near Belarus's borders. 
'NORMAL EXERCISES'
Lukashenko has led the former Soviet republic that Moscow sees as a buffer state to the West since 1994 and strengthened ties with Moscow during mass protests that erupted in 2020 as the West imposed sanctions. 
""These should be normal exercises to work out a certain plan for confronting these forces: the West, the Baltics and Poland, and the south - Ukraine,"" he said in comments circulated by state media. 
The Kremlin said separately that reports that Estonia was prepared to host up to 5,000 NATO troops showed Moscow was right to be worried. 
""It's exactly things like that which prove we have grounds to be concerned and it proves we're not the reason for escalating tensions,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. 
He was asked on a conference call to comment after a senior Russian official declined to rule out or confirm whether Russia could deploy missiles in Venezuela or Cuba if the West refused to deliver Moscow's security guarantees. 

""For Latin America - we're talking about sovereign states there, let's not forget that. And in the context of the current situation, Russia is thinking how to ensure its own security... We are ... reviewing different scenarios,"" he said.
Separately, Russia's Western Military District said its tank army was holding command-staff training exercises in five regions, involving 800 servicemen and more than 300 pieces of hardware, the Interfax news agency reported.

BELGRADE/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Novak Djokovic returned to a rapturous welcome in Serbia on Monday after Australia deported the world men's tennis No. 1 for being unvaccinated against COVID-19, a stance jeopardising his quest for a record 21st Grand Slam title.
Most Australians had wanted him gone, but Serbian fans cheered and waved national flags as Djokovic touched down at Belgrade airport then headed to his own apartment. 
""You are our champion, Novak!"" and ""We love you, Nole!"" they chanted, using an affectionate diminutive.
The 34-year-old ""King of Melbourne"" had won nine previous Australia Opens, is level with Rafa Nadal and Roger Federer on 20 titles, and was top men's seed for the tournament that got underway on Monday.
But instead of beginning his title defence as scheduled at Melbourne Park, he flew to Belgrade via Dubai after being twice detained in a hotel with asylum-seekers and then unceremoniously booted out by Australian immigration.
""Whoever wins it now, doesn't really count,"" said Alek Drakoo, a member of the Australian Serbian community, disappointed to miss seeing him in Melbourne.
The Australian government's decision was in tune with majority public opinion, but authorities drew flak for the chaotic handling of the issue. 
""I am uncomfortable that the focus of the past weeks has been on me and I hope that we can all now focus on the game and the tournament I love,"" Djokovic said, expressing disappointment but respect for a court decision against him.
BACK TO AUSTRALIA? 
Under Australian law, he cannot return for three years unless the immigration minister accepts there are compelling or compassionate reasons. Prime Minister Scott Morrison hinted there may be a way to let him in next year. 
""There is the opportunity for (a person) to return in the right circumstances, and that will be considered at the time,"" he told 2GB radio. 
France said Djokovic would be barred from playing the French Open in May as things stand because of a new vaccine pass law. 
""This will apply to everyone who is a spectator or a professional sportsperson,"" the ministry said in a statement.
It said, however, that the pandemic situation could change by then. 
Australia's Federal Court ruling to uphold the cancellation of Djokovic's visa - originally granted on a medical exemption as he recently had COVID-19 - dismayed his family and supporters, who portray him as a persecuted underdog.
""I think he entered history as a hero, as a man and as a fighter against this evil which is called corona-circus,"" said Marko Strugalovic, 60, at Belgrade airport.
Djokovic was first detained by immigration authorities on Jan. 6, ordered released by a court on Jan. 10 and then detained again on Saturday before Sunday's court hearing.
He wore a mask and took selfies with fans on transit in Dubai but avoided fans and media at Belgrade airport, going straight to his apartment in the Novi Beograd district. 
Australian Immigration Minister Alex Hawke had said Djokovic could be a threat to public order because his presence would encourage anti-vaccination sentiment.
His case has stoked a global debate over the rights to decline vaccination as authorities around the world push that as the main route out of the two-year-old pandemic that has killed 5.5 million people. 
'YOU HAVE TO COMPLY'
Many Australians, who have endured some of the world's toughest lockdowns and have an adult vaccination rate of more than 90%, saw him as arrogant and dismissive of health risks. 
It was a tricky situation for Morrison, who faces an election by May, but he defended his handling of it.
""If you’re someone coming from overseas, and there are conditions for you to enter this country, then you have to comply with them,"" he said. 

Spain's Nadal said the tournament would not be the same without his great rival. 
""If Novak Djokovic is playing here, it's better for everybody, no doubt about that,"" he told reporters after trouncing American Marcos Giron 6-1 6-4 6-2 to sail into the second round.

""She seemed well. We chatted merrily,"" Yao said when asked in Beijing on Monday about his impressions of Peng at a cross-country skiing event they both attended last month in Shanghai.
The Women's Tennis Association has suspended tournaments in China due to what it says are concerns over Peng's safety, which it says have not been alleviated by her public appearances. The issue has cast a shadow over the upcoming winter Olympics in Beijing.
Yao said he and Peng had known each other for nearly 20 years. However, he did not comment directly on the controversy that flared up last year after Peng, a former world No. 1 doubles player, appeared to allege that a former vice premier, Zhang Gaoli, had sexually assaulted her in the past.
After that post, she was absent from public view for nearly three weeks. At the December event also attended by Yao, Peng told a media outlet she had never accused anyone of sexually assaulting her, and that her social media post had been misunderstood. She has not spoken publicly since.
Zhang has not commented on the matter, and Beijing has censored discussion of it on the internet.

Speaking with media less than three weeks before the Olympics are due to open, Yao said he expects China to win medals in speed skating and snowboarding, but asked Chinese fans to be patient given the country is relatively new to winter sports.
Yao, China's most globally famous athlete, was the face of the 2008 Beijing Summer Games. He has retired from basketball and now acts as an ice and snow sports ambassador for China.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea fired two suspected short-range ballistic missiles (SRBM) on Monday from an airport in its capital city of Pyongyang, South Korea's military reported, the fourth test this month to demonstrate its expanding missile arsenal.
Japan also reported the launch, with chief cabinet secretary Hirokazu Matsuno condemning it as a threat to peace and security while China urged all sides to preserve for stability.
""We call on relevant sides to keep in mind the overall peace and stability on the peninsula,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a daily briefing in Beijing when asked about the suspected launch.
Nuclear-armed North Korea had already conducted three other missile tests in less than two weeks before Monday, an unusually rapid series of launches. It said two of them involved single ""hypersonic missiles"" capable of high speed and manoeuvring after launch, while a test on Friday involved a pair of short-range ballistic missiles fired from train cars.
Monday's launch appeared to involve two SRBMs fired east from Sunan Airfield in Pyongyang, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said in a statement.
North Korea used the airport to test fire the Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) in 2017, with leader Kim Jong Un in attendance.
The missiles fired on Monday travelled about 380 km (236 miles) to a maximum altitude of 42 km (26 miles), the JCS said in a statement.
Japanese Defence Minister Nobuo Kishi said the missiles appeared to have landed in the ocean off North Korea's east coast and it was evident that North Korea was using the frequent launches to improve its missile technology.
""The repeated launching of North Korea's ballistic missiles is a grave problem for the international community, including Japan,"" Kishi told reporters, noting that the tests were a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions that ban North Korea from all ballistic missile development.
The U.S. military's Indo-Pacific Command said that the launch did not pose an immediate threat to the United States or its allies, but that ""these missile launches highlight the destabilising impact of (North Korea's ) illicit weapons programme"".
The pace of testing suggested that North Korea had enough missiles to feel comfortable about using them on tests, training, and demonstrations, and they reinforced its deterrent credibility by emphasizing the volume of its missile force, said Mason Richey, a professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul.
North Korea has not tested its longest-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) or nuclear weapons since 2017, but after denuclearisation talks stalled in 2019, it began testing a range of new SRBM designs.
Many of the latest SRBMs, including the hypersonic missiles, appear designed to evade missile defences. North Korea has also vowed to pursue tactical nuclear weapons, which could allow it to deploy nuclear warheads on SRBMs.
""Every tactical missile launch flaunts how little sanctions have constrained the Kim regime, and how the U.S. ... has failed to make North Korea pay a sufficient cost for short-range missile programme development,"" Richey said.
'ISOLATING AND STIFLING'
The latest launches have drawn both condemnation and an appeal for dialogue from a U.S. administration that has imposed new sanctions over North Korean missile launches and is pushing for more.
President Joe Biden's administration imposed its first new sanctions on Pyongyang on Wednesday, and called on the U.N. Security Council to blacklist several North Korean individuals and entities. It also repeated calls for North Korea to return to talks aimed at reducing tension and persuading it to surrender its arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
North Korea has defended the missile tests as its sovereign right to self-defence and accused the United States of intentionally intensifying confrontation with new sanctions. 
In a statement before Friday's tests, the North Korean foreign ministry said that although the United States might talk of diplomacy and dialogue, its actions showed it was engrossed in its policy of ""isolating and stifling"" North Korea.
South Korea's national security council held an emergency meeting after Monday's test, with members stressing it was essential to start dialogue as soon as possible to stop the situation from becoming more strained and to restore stability, the presidential Blue House said in a statement.
The launches came as North Korea, more isolated than ever under self-imposed border closures aimed at preventing a COVID-19 pandemic, appeared to be preparing to open at least some trade across its land border with China.
Freight trains connecting China with North Korea have resumed for the first time since a 2020 coronavirus border lockdown, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Monday
Zhao Tong, a Beijing-based nuclear policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said North Korea had few reasons to hold back its missile development.
Leader Kim appeared to have little hope of a breakthrough with the United States, and China's sympathy for North Korea and antipathy towards the United States could encourage North Korea to think that China was unlikely to support any effort by the international community to censure it for the tests, he added. 

""North Korea may think this is a safe time to advance its missile development,"" Zhao said.
Last week, China criticised the new U.S. sanctions but also called on all sides to act prudently and engage in dialogue to reduce tensions.

Timur Kulibayev, Nazarbayev's billionaire son-in-law, also resigned on Monday as chairman of the Central Asian nation's main business lobby group.
Nazarbayev, 81, who was considered the most powerful politician in the oil-rich country even after stepping down in 2019, has not appeared in public since the beginning of mass protests early this month which evolved into the bloodiest unrest in Kazakhstan's post-Soviet history.
President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who once renamed Kazakhstan's capital city after Nazarbayev, took over the latter's role as chairman of the security council during the unrest, putting an end to their de facto ruling tandem.
He also appointed a new No.2 at the National Security Committee at the time, but did not immediately sack Abish.
Last week, Tokayev said those who had made fortunes during Nazarbayev's three-decade rule must now share them with the public. Kazakhstan's sovereign fund on Saturday removed two of Nazarbayev's sons-in-law from senior positions at state oil and gas pipeline companies.
Kulibayev, who together with his wife owns Kazakhstan's biggest bank, Halyk, did not explain why he was leaving his job at Atameken, an influential business lobby group.

At least 225 people were killed in this month's unrest, which engulfed half of the country and forced Tokayev to turn to a Russia-led military bloc for help.
The authorities have detained Karim Masimov, the former head of the National Security Committee, and two of his deputies, on charges of treason and said the bout of violence was an attempted coup d'etat.

150,"<span>Jan 17, 2022 01:11AM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING (Reuters) -Mainland China's birth rate dropped to a record low in 2021, data showed on Monday, extending a downward trend that led Beijing last year to begin allowing couples to have up to three children.
China scrapped its decades-old one-child policy in 2016, replacing it with a two-child limit to try to avoid the economic risks from a rapidly aging population, but the high cost of urban living has deterred couples from having more children.
The 2021 rate of 7.52 births per 1,000 people was the lowest since 1949, when the National Statistics Bureau began collating the data, adding further pressure on officials to encourage more births.
The natural growth rate of China's population, which excludes migration, was only 0.034% for 2021, the lowest since 1960, according to the data.
""The demographic challenge is well known but the speed of population aging is clearly faster than expected,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset management.
""This suggests China's total population may have reached its peak in 2021. It also indicates China's potential growth is likely slowing faster than expected,"" Zhang said.
In addition to allowing couples to have three children, China has been adopting policies aimed at reducing the financial burden of raising children, including banning for-profit after-school tuition, a massive industry, last year. 
China's working-age population is already declining, which will add pressure on the country's ability to pay and care for an increasingly elderly country. 
There were 10.62 million births in 2021, the data showed, compared with 12 million in 2020.
Huang Wenzheng, a demography expert with the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization, said birth numbers are likely to fluctuate in the 10 million range before declining further in the absence of more policy changes.
""But policies will provide greater support for the birth rate in the longer run,"" Huang said.

""Career advancements could be tied to whether you have children or not; economic incentives; or even direct cash payouts by society to meet the cost of raising a family.""

Authorities have warned the highly contagious Omicron adds to the increased risk of COVID-19 transmission as hundreds of millions of people travel around China for the Lunar New Year on Feb. 1. 
Cities such as Luoyang in central China and Jieyang in the south said on Sunday travellers need to report to communities, employers or hotels their trips three days ahead of arrival. 
The southwestern city of Yulin said on Saturday those who want to enter should fill in an online form, including their health credentials and trip details, one day in advance. 
Over the weekend, the capital Beijing and the southern technology hub Shenzhen each detected one domestically transmitted Omicron case. 
The possibility that the Omicron case in Beijing was infected through imported goods can't be ruled out, Pang Xinghuo, an official at the city's disease control authority, said on Monday. 
Li Ang, vice director at the Beijing Municipal Health Commission, said a local hospital had admitted nine Omicron infections, with six still being treated. He did not say when the infections arrived or why they hadn't been disclosed earlier. 
The city of Meizhou in Guangdong province found one Omicron infection linked to an outbreak in Zhuhai, state television said on Monday. 
So far, at least five provinces and municipalities reported local Omicron infections, while 14 provincial areas found the variant among travellers arriving from overseas.
China is yet to show any solid sign of shifting its guideline of quickly containing any local infections, despite a high vaccination rate of 86.6%. The strategy has taken on extra urgency in the run-up to the Winter Olympics, to be staged in Beijing and neighbouring Hebei province starting Feb. 4. 
Many local governments have already advised residents not to leave town unnecessarily trips during the holiday, while dozens of international and domestic flights have been suspended.
China's aviation regulator said on Monday it would suspend two flights from the United States over COVID-19 cases, bringing the total number of cancelled flights this year from the country, where Omicron is spreading, to 76. 
China reported 163 locally transmitted infections with confirmed symptom for Sunday, official data showed on Monday, up from 65 a day earlier.

Sunday's increase in infections was mainly driven by more cases in the cities of Tianjin and Anyang, where Omicron has been found in local clusters. 
Tianjin and Anyang reported slightly more than 600 local symptomatic infections from the current outbreaks, smaller than many clusters overseas, but authorities there still have limited movement within the cities and trips to outside.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Monday the shortages of at-home antigen tests were ""not unique"" to the country as authorities deal with a runaway Omicron outbreak that has driven up hospitalisation rates and strains testing systems.
Australia is facing a shortage of at-home rapid antigen test kits after asymptomatic close contacts were told to bypass government-funded testing hubs, where high volumes delayed results by several days, and take their own tests.
""The rapid antigen tests are in short supply all around the world. This is not something that is unique to Australia going through it,"" Morrison told radio station 2GB on Monday. ""It's part of dealing with Omicron. Omicron has disrupted everything.""
The country's competition regulator, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), on Monday flagged ""significant concerns"" about reports of price gouging https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-regulator-flags-significant-concerns-price-hike-covid-19-antigen-tests-2022-01-16 of testing kits amid reports of stockpiling and called inflated prices ""clearly outrageous"". 
ACCC Chair Rod Sims said there were reports of kits costing even up to A$500 ($361) at online retailers, and A$70 per test at stores when they were available for around A$10 at pharmacies weeks ago. 
Morrison, under pressure in an election year for his handling of the Omicron outbreak and not procuring enough supplies of antigen tests, early this month had agreed to provide 10 free kits for low-income earners.
Doctors and trade unions are demanding free tests for everyone, but Morrison has resisted those calls saying the government would not cover the cost, citing a heightened role for ""personal responsibility"". 
Australian Council of Trade Unions Secretary Sally McManus said dozens of unions will meet later on Monday to respond ""to the failure of the Federal Government to keep us safe"". A survey by the Australian Institute on Monday showed almost three-quarter of Australians believe they should get free antigen tests.
In a bid to ease pressure on its testing hubs, Victoria from Monday began rolling out 3 million antigen tests to frontline workers and the vulnerable population, while many other states awaited millions of testing kits to be delivered. 
After successfully containing the virus earlier in the pandemic, Australia has reported nearly 1.3 million cases over the last two weeks, overwhelming hospitals and testing clinics.
Daily infections on Monday dipped in New South Wales and Victoria, Australia's most populous states, amid expectations the Omicron wave had neared its peak https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-nears-omicron-peak-daily-infections-hover-around-records-2022-01-15 in the country. But net new hospitalisations remain elevated, with more people admitted than at any other time in the pandemic.

Nearly 74,000 cases were reported on Monday, the country's lowest tally in a week. National daily numbers had touched a record 150,000 last Thursday but have been steadily falling since then.
So far, Australia has reported around 1.6 million infections and 2,699 deaths since the pandemic began.

(Reuters) - Retired Brigadier General Charles McGee, part of the pioneering all-Black Tuskegee Airmen during World War Two and one of its most decorated pilots, died on Sunday at the age of 102, his family said in a statement.
McGee, who flew 409 combat missions spanning World War Two, Korea and Vietnam, died in his sleep Sunday morning, a family spokesperson said. ""He had his right hand over his heart and was smiling serenely,"" his youngest daughter Yvonne McGee said in a statement released by the spokesperson.
""Today, we lost an America hero,"" Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""While I am saddened by his loss, I'm also incredibly grateful for his sacrifice, his legacy and his character. Rest in Peace, General."" 
McGee was born Dec. 7, 1919 in Cleveland, Ohio. His plane was hit twice in combat, once during the Korean conflict and again years later near Laos, both times on his right wing.
McGee battled racism and segregation during his military career. He was called to service in 1942 at age 23 and became one of the first Black military aviators known as the Tuskegee Airmen https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tuskegee/tuskegee-airman-reflects-on-all-black-units-founding-75-years-ago-idUSKCN0WJ2YE.
""Being brought up, they say African-American or Black, but we're American and our country was at war,"" McGee told Reuters in 2016. 
""We were just as interested in supporting that effort as anybody else at that time and so we turned our back on the fact that there was segregation, if you will, and took advantage of the opportunity to prove that we can fly airplanes,"" he added.
The Tuskegee Airmen's success helped lay the groundwork for the civil rights movement and influenced then-President Harry Truman's decision to desegregate the armed forces in 1948.
Then-President George Bush honored the Tuskegee Airmen in 2007 with the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award given by Congress.
After flying as a Tuskegee Airman in World War Two, he built a legacy for the next three decades as an Air Force pilot during the North Korea and Vietnam wars. He retired about 50 years ago.
""We're saddened by the loss of Brigadier General Charles McGee, a trailblazer who served as a Tuskegee Airman and flew 409 combat missions,"" NASA also said in a tweet on Sunday after his death was announced.

After his military career, McGee worked as a business executive and an airport manager in Kansas City, Missouri. He also served as president of the Tuskegee Airmen association.
McGee is survived by his three children, 10 grandchildren and 14 great grandchildren.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) -Tsunami-hit Tonga remained largely uncontactable on Sunday with telephone and internet links severed, leaving relatives in faraway New Zealand praying for their families on the Pacific islands as casualty reports had yet to come through.
An underwater volcano off Tonga erupted on Saturday, triggering warnings of 1.2-metre tsunami waves and evacuation orders on the shores of Tonga as well as several South Pacific islands, where footage on social media showed waves crashing into coastal homes.
Internet and phone lines went down at about 6.40 p.m. local time on Saturday, leaving the 105,000 residents on the islands virtually uncontactable.
There are no official reports of injuries or deaths in Tonga as yet although communications are limited and contact has not been established with outlying coastal areas beyond the capital Nuku'alofa and closer to the volcano, Jacinda Ardern the Prime Minister of New Zealand told a news conference on Sunday.
Tonga, an island nation with around 105,000 residents, lies 2,383 kilometres (1,481 miles) northeast of New Zealand. 
""Nuku'alofa is covered in thick plumes of volcanic dust but otherwise conditions are calm and stable,"" Ardern said.
""There are parts of Tonga where we just don't know yet... we just haven't established communication,"" she said.
Satellite images captured the volcanic eruption on Saturday as the explosion sent plumes of smoke into the air and about 12 miles above the sea level. The sky over Tonga was darkened by the ash.
Concerns were growing among the Tongan community in New Zealand, desperate to make contact with their families back home. Some churches organised community prayers in Auckland and other cities.
""We pray God will help our country at this sad moment. We hope everybody is safe,"" Maikeli Atiola, the Secretary of the Wesleyan Church of Tonga in Auckland said, Radio New Zealand reported. 
Ardern said the main undersea communications cable has been impacted, likely due to loss of power. 
Power was being restored in some areas on the islands and local mobile phones were slowly starting to work, she added.
Official damage assessments were not yet available, she said, but the New Zealand high commission in Nuku'alofa had told her the tsunami has had a significant impact on the foreshore on the northern side of Nuku'alofa, with boats and large boulders washed ashore.
""Shops along the coast have been damaged and a significant cleanup will be needed,"" she said.
Australia said it will send a P8 surveillance aircraft to Tonga on Monday to assess damage to critical infrastructure such as roads, ports and power lines, which will determine the next phase of the response effort. 
In the United States, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the country stands prepared to provide support.
PACIFIC IMPACT
The Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai volcano has erupted regularly over the past few decades but Saturday's eruption was so loud that residents parts of faraway Fiji and New Zealand said they heard it.
""My entire house was shaking,"" said Sanya Ruggiero, a Consulting Communications Advisor based in Suva, the capital of Fiji, some 750 kms from Tonga.
""My doors, windows were all rattling like hell. And mine was not even as bad as others. Hundreds of people ran out of their homes,"" said Ruggiero, who consults for several agencies including the United Nations.
Rumblings and eruptions from the volcano continued to be heard through the night, Ruggiero said. Hundreds of people were moved to evacuation centres in Suva. Fiji Airways had to cancel all its flights due to the ash clouds.
""This is the worst disaster Tonga has had in living memory and the recovery from this is going to take years,"" Ruggiero said.
Experts said the ash fallout could contaminate drinking water and cause respiratory issues.
""Help will be needed to restore drinking water supplies. People of Tonga must also remain vigilant for further eruptions and especially tsunami with short notice and should avoid low lying areas,"" said Shane Cronin, professor at the School of Environment, University of Auckland.

The eight-minute eruption on Saturday triggered tsunami warnings and evacuations in several countries. The eruption caused flooding across portions of coastal Alaska and California in the United States.
Floods from the tidal waves were also reported in Chile, some 10,000 kilometres away, and hundreds of thousands of Japanese citizens were advised to evacuate as waves of more than a metre hit coastal areas.

The death of two people by drowning occurred on Saturday on a beach located in the Lambayeque region, Peru's National Institute of Civil Defense (Indeci) said in a statement.
The underwater volcano off Tonga erupted on Saturday, prompting tsunami warnings and evacuation orders in Japan and causing huge waves on several South Pacific islands, where images on social media show waves crashing against homes on the shores.
More than 20 Peruvian ports were temporarily closed as a precautionary measure amid warnings that the volcano was causing abnormally high waves, Indeci said.
The Peruvian police said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that the two victims were found dead by officers from a Naylamp beach police station. The tweet said ""the waves were abnormal"" in the area and that it had been declared unsuitable for bathers.
TV images showed several homes and businesses flooded by seawater in coastal areas in northern and central Peru.
The Peruvian Navy had reported that a tsunami alert was ruled out for the Pacific Coast country. 

In Japan, hundreds of thousands of people were advised to evacuate on Sunday as waves of more than a meter hit coastal areas, public broadcaster NHK reported.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Tennis superstar Novak Djokovic flew out of Australia on Sunday after a court upheld the government's decision to cancel his visa, capping days of drama over the country's COVID-19 entry rules and his unvaccinated status.
The unanimous ruling by a three-judge Federal Court bench dealt a final blow to Djokovic's hopes of chasing a record 21st Grand Slam win at the Australian Open that starts on Monday, dismaying his family and supporters.
The Serbian player went to the airport in Melbourne just hours later. Federal agents escorted him and his team from the business lounge to the gate, where he boarded an Emirates flight bound for Dubai. The flight took off shortly before 11 p.m. (1200 GMT).
In a rollercoaster ride, the world's top men's player was first detained by immigration authorities on Jan. 6, ordered released by a court on Jan. 10 and then detained on Saturday again pending Sunday's court hearing.
Djokovic said after the ruling he was extremely disappointed as it meant he could not take part in the tournament.
""I respect the Court’s ruling and I will cooperate with the relevant authorities in relation to my departure from the country,"" he said in a statement, wishing the tournament well.
Djokovic, 34, had appealed against Immigration Minister Alex Hawke's use of discretionary powers to cancel his visa. The minister had said Djokovic could be a threat to public order because his presence would encourage anti-vaccination sentiment amidst Australia's worst coronavirus outbreak.
Chief Justice James Allsop said the court ruling was based on the lawfulness and legality of the minister's decision in the context of the rounds of appeal lodged by Djokovic's legal team.
""It is no part of the function of the court to decide upon the merits or wisdom of the decision,"" Allsop said, adding that the three judges were unanimous in their ruling. Full reasoning behind the ruling would be released in coming days, he said.
The player's family said they were ""very disappointed"" by the decision and the fact Djokovic had to leave Australia.
""Despite the scandalous behavior towards Novak, we believed that the sport would win,"" they said in a statement.
'KEEP BORDERS STRONG'
The player's visa saga has fuelled global debate over the rights of people who opt to remain unvaccinated as governments take measures to protect people from the two-year pandemic. 
The controversy became a political touchstone for Prime Minister Scott Morrison as he prepares for an election due by May. His government has faced criticism for its handling of Djokovic's visa application.
Morrison welcomed the court's ruling, saying the decision will help keep borders strong and Australians safe.
""It's now time to get on with the Australian Open and get back to enjoying tennis over the summer,"" he said in a statement.
Djokovic had been granted a visa to enter Australia, with a COVID-19 infection on Dec. 16 providing the basis for a medical exemption from Australia's requirements that all visitors be vaccinated. The exemption was organised via Tennis Australia.
That exemption prompted widespread anger in Australia, which has undergone some of the world's toughest COVID-19 lockdowns and where more than 90% of adults are vaccinated. The government said recent infection alone did not meet its standards for an exemption.
WEEPING FANS
But the player also had some support, especially in his native Serbia and from Serbians living in Australia.
Serbian prime Minister Ana Brnabic said https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/serbia-says-australias-decision-deport-djokovic-scandalous-2022-01-16: ""I think that the court decision is scandalous, I am disappointed, I think it demonstrated how the rule of law is functioning or - better to say - not functioning in some other countries.""
In the Serbian capital Belgrade, Djokovic's hometown, many support him though some felt he should have been vaccinated.
""I think Australia should be ashamed of itself and that the decision was not a just one. I am sorry for Novak as a tennis player and as a person,"" said Danilo Mircic, a student.
""If I were him, I would get vaccinated and avoid problems in the future,"" said Aleksandar Janjic, a middle-aged computer programmer.
In Melbourne, around 70 Djokovic fans, including young children, sang folk songs and chanted in the Federal Court plaza while they waited for the court’s ruling. 
They gathered around a loudspeaker to hear the judge reading out the decision. Afterward, two women were weeping, while others started up chants for a short while before the crowd dispersed.
""What they did today is everything except justice,” said Natasha Marjnovic, 44, a Djokovic supporter wiping away tears. ""They killed a beautiful sportsman and his career and for all of us who love tennis.""
DISRUPTION TO TENNIS
The men's tennis governing body ATP said ""today's decision to uphold Novak Djokovic's Australian visa cancellation marks the end of a deeply regrettable series of events"".
It added in a statement that decisions of legal authorities regarding public health must be respected.
Tennis Australia said it respected the decision.

On the tennis circuit, fellow players had become impatient for the media circus to end. But several voiced sympathy for Djokovic following his legal defeat.
""The situation has not been good all round for anyone. It feels everything here happened extremely last minute and that's why it became such a mess,"" said former world No. 1 Andy Murray.

BAMAKO (Reuters) -Former Malian president Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, who was ousted by the military in 2020 after a turbulent seven-year rule, has died, officials said on Sunday. He was 76. 
Known by his initials IBK, Keita ran the West African country from September 2013 until August 2020, during which Islamist insurgents overran large areas and ethnic violence flared.
Disputed legislative elections, rumours of corruption and low economic growth also fuelled public anger and drew tens of thousands onto the streets of the capital Bamako in 2020 to demand his resignation.
He was eventually forced out by a military coup, whose leaders remain in charge despite strong international objections.
The interim government issued a statement on Sunday that read: ""The government of Mali and the Malian people salute the memory of the illustrious deceased.""
Leaders from the region including Senegalese President Macky Sall and Burkina Faso's president, Roch Kabore, sent condolences. 
The cause of death was not immediately clear. A former adviser said Keita, who frequently travelled abroad for medical attention, had died at home in Bamako.
He was detained and put under house arrest during the coup, but those restrictions were lifted amid pressure from the West African political bloc ECOWAS.
Known for his white flowing robes and a tendency to slur his words, Keita came to power in a resounding election victory in 2013. He vowed to take on the corruption that had eroded support for his predecessor Amadou Toumani Toure, also toppled in a coup.
INSECURITY AND CORRUPTION
Keita had a reputation for firmness forged when he was prime minister in the 1990s, when he took a hard line with striking trade unions. 
As president, he enjoyed strong international support, especially from former colonial ruler France, which poured in money and troops to counter al Qaeda-linked jihadists who in 2012 hijacked an ethnic Tuareg rebellion and swept across the desert north. 
But continued insecurity ultimately marred his presidency. 
French forces pushed back the insurgents in 2013. But they recovered, and have since killed hundreds of soldiers and civilians, driven out local leaders and in some areas set up their own systems of government. 
The jihadist attacks also stoked ethnic violence between rival herding and farming communities, which claimed hundreds more lives and underscored the government's lack of control. Abuses by the army bred more resentment, rights groups say. 
Keita was also dogged by allegations of corruption.
In 2014, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund froze nearly $70 million in financing after the IMF expressed concern over the purchase of a $40 million presidential jet and the transparency of Mali's defence spending.
When word got out in 2020 that Keita had been toppled, thousands celebrated on the streets.
With promises to end nepotism and corruption, the military struck a chord with millions of impoverished Malians who wanted a break from the past. 

On Friday, 18 months on, thousands demonstrated in Bamako against strict sanctions imposed by ECOWAS on the transitional government for trying to extend its hold on power.
""IBK was a man who loved his country,"" said a woman who came to Keita's house on Sunday to pay her respects. ""A good man who never betrayed Mali and who did everything so it did not fall.""

WARSAW (Reuters) - Former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said on Sunday he planned to return to Ukraine on Monday despite the threat of arrest in a treason case he says was trumped up by allies of current President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
Poroshenko's return sets up a showdown with Zelenskiy's government in what critics say is an ill-judged distraction at a time when Ukraine is bracing for a possible Russian military offensive and appealing to Western allies for support.
Western diplomats have called for political unity in Ukraine ahead of Poroshenko's arrival. 
Poroshenko is being investigated for alleged treason linked to the financing of Russian-backed separatist fighters through illegal coal sales while in office in 2014-15. His party accused Zelenskiy of a reckless attempt to silence political opposition.
""If you ask me if I will be arrested, definitely not. Not because I am so confident but because I have no, absolutely zero reason for tha...I return to Ukraine to fight for Ukraine, not to fight with Zelenskiy,"" Poroshenko told reporters in Warsaw.
Zelenskiy's administration has distanced itself from the investigation, saying the prosecutors and judiciary are independent and accusing Poroshenko of thinking he was above the law. 
On Friday, Zelenskiy's chief of staff Andriy Yermak batted away suggestions that Zelenskiy was behaving like the Russian-backed former president Viktor Yanukovich, whose political rival Yulia Tymoshenko was jailed in December 2010. 
Ukraine and its allies have sounded the alarm about tens of thousands of Russian troops massed near its borders. 
After days of diplomacy last week achieved no breakthrough, the United States said on Friday Russia was preparing a pretext for an attack, something the Kremlin dismissed as ""unfounded"".
""At this time more than ever it seems to me that all political leaders in #ukraine need to show unity, avoiding actions that may polarise,"" Melinda Simmons, the British ambassador to Ukraine, said in a tweet on Saturday.
""We are demanding unity of the whole democratic forces to protect Ukraine...I am absolutely optimistic about the possibility of this unity, of democratic, responsible opposition forces,"" Poroshenko said. 
Poroshenko's return to Kyiv from Warsaw on Monday coincides with the whistle-stop visit from the new German foreign minister, who will then head to Moscow for talks on Tuesday. 
A confectionary tycoon and one of Ukraine's richest citizens, Poroshenko was elected as head of a pro-Western government after the 2014 Maidan street protests ousted Yanukovich.
Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed after Russia's annexation of Crimea and support for separatist fighters in a war in eastern Ukraine that broke out the same year. 

Zelenskiy trounced Poroshenko in a landslide election in 2019 on a ticket to tackle corruption and curb the influence of oligarchs in the former Soviet republic. 
Prosecutors in December asked a Ukrainian court to arrest Poroshenko, with the possibility of bail set at 1 billion hryvnia ($37 million).

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is negotiating a plea bargain to end his corruption trial, a source briefed on the matter said on Sunday, but talks have snagged over a condition that would remove him from politics.
Netanyahu, who lost power in June after 12 consecutive years as premier and is now opposition leader, has pleaded not guilty to charges of bribery, breach of trust and fraud in three cases for which he was indicted in 2019. All are being tried together.
The source said Netanyahu, 72, was discussing a deal with Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit under which he would plead guilty to reduced charges and have any resulting jail term commuted to community service. 
But the talks have hit a bump over Netanyahu's demand to be spared a conviction carrying a ""moral turpitude"" clause, which under Israeli law would force him to quit politics for years, said the source, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity.
The State Attorney's Office declined to comment. A lawyer for Netanyahu, who has denied all wrongdoing and accused prosecutors of a politically motivated witch-hunt, did not immediately reply to a request for a comment. 
Netanyahu has vowed to unseat his successor, Naftali Bennett, a nationalist straddling a coalition of highly diverse parties.
Likud failed to form a new government last year in part because kindred parties refused to join Netanyahu, citing the ongoing trial.
With his legal troubles behind him, Netanyahu might in theory be able to muster a broad new rightist coalition. If he were barred from politics, right-wing members of Bennett's coalition could opt to form a new government with a Likud party under new leadership.
The idea of a plea bargain was promoted by a former Supreme Court president, Aharon Barak.

He told Kan radio it would ease the pressure on the justice system, which has spent years defending itself against allegations from Netanyahu loyalists that he was being denied due process.
A spokesperson for Netanyahu's conservative Likud party said he did not know about any such negotiations.

(Reuters) - The Canadian government is urging its citizens to avoid non-essential travel to Ukraine, in a new advisory citing ""Russian aggression.""
Moscow has stationed more than 100,000 troops near the border with Ukraine, and the United States said on Friday it feared Russia was preparing a pretext to invade if diplomacy failed to meet its objectives.
""We have changed the risk level for Ukraine to avoid non-essential travel due to ongoing Russian aggression and military buildup in and around the country,"" the Canadian government said in a travel advisory https:// issued late Saturday.
Canada, with a sizeable and politically influential population of Ukrainian descent, has taken a hard line with Russia since its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.
Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly is to visit Kyiv next week to reaffirm Canada's support for Ukrainian sovereignty and reinforce efforts to deter ""aggressive actions"" by Russia, Ottawa said earlier.
Joly will meet Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmygal and travel to the west of the country to speak to a 200-strong Canadian training mission that has been there since 2015.
Canadian Deputy Foreign Minister Marta Morgan and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman spoke on Friday and pledged continued close coordination to deter further Russian aggression against Ukraine and called for Russian de-escalation, a U.S. State Department spokesperson said on Saturday.
In an interview with Canadian broadcaster CBC published https:// Sunday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg described Russia as ""the aggressor."" He told CBC News it was up to Russia to de-escalate and that NATO was willing to sit down again and listen to Moscow's concerns.
Russia denies plans to attack Ukraine, but says it could take unspecified military action unless its demands - including a promise by the NATO alliance never to admit Kyiv - are met.
After talks between the United States, its European allies and Russia ended last week, U.S. officials warned that the risk of a Russian invasion of Ukraine remained high.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Tuesday and ""emphasized that any military incursion into Ukraine would have serious consequences, including coordinated sanctions."" 
Canada has imposed punitive measures on more than 440 individuals and entities over the annexation of Crimea.

COLLEYVILLE, Texas (Reuters) -An FBI Hostage Rescue Team stormed a synagogue in Colleyville, Texas on Saturday night to free three remaining hostages of a gunman who had disrupted a religious service and began a standoff with police more than 10 hours earlier.
All the hostages were safely released on Saturday night and the gunman was dead, Colleyville Police Chief Michael Miller told a news conference. 
The gunman had initially taken four people hostage, including the rabbi, at the Congregation Beth Israel, officials said. One hostage was released unharmed six hours later. 
Reporters said they heard the sound of explosions, possibly flashbangs, and the sound of gunfire shortly before Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced the crisis was over.
""Prayers answered. All hostages are out alive and safe,"" Abbott said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). The FBI said they have confirmed the identity of the gunman but said they would not yet disclose it. The FBI declined to confirm the cause of his death, saying it was still under investigation.
Britain's foreign office confirmed the death of a British man in Texas, when asked to respond to a Sky News report that the gunman was a British national. The foreign office did not explicitly say the dead Briton was the gunman.
The Colleyville Police Department said it first responded to the synagogue with SWAT teams in response to emergency calls beginning at about 10:41 a.m. during the Shabbat service, which was being broadcast online. FBI negotiators soon opened contact with the man, who said he wanted to speak to a woman held in a federal prison.
No injuries were reported among the hostages.
In the first few hours, the man could be heard having a one-sided conversation in what appeared to be a phone call during a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) livestream of the service of the Reform Jewish synagogue in Colleyville, which is about 16 miles (26 kms) northeast of Fort Worth. The livestream cut off around 3 p.m. EST (2000 GMT).
'COURAGEOUS WORK'
Before the livestream was ended, the man could be heard ranting and talking about religion and his sister, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported. The man could be heard repeatedly saying he did not want to see anyone hurt and that he believed he was going to die, the newspaper said.
President Joe Biden, who was briefed on the crisis as it unfolded, praised the ""courageous work"" of state, local and federal law enforcement in freeing the hostages.
""There is more we will learn in the days ahead about the motivations of the hostage taker. But let me be clear to anyone who intends to spread hate — we will stand against anti-Semitism and against the rise of extremism in this country,"" he said in a statement.
Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said https://twitter.com/naftalibennett/status/1482463339385171970?s=20 he was praying for the safety of the hostages.
Barry Klompus, a member of the congregation since it opened in 1999, said he tuned into the livestream.
""It was horrible listening and watching,"" Klompus said in a telephone interview.
A U.S. official briefed on the matter told ABC News the hostage-taker had claimed to be the brother of Pakistani neuroscientist Aafia Siddiqui, who is serving an 86-year U.S. prison sentence for her 2010 conviction for shooting at soldiers and FBI agents, and that he demanded she be freed.
Siddiqui is being held at a federal prison in the Fort Worth area. A lawyer representing Siddiqui, Marwa Elbially, told CNN in a statement the man was not Siddiqui's brother. He implored the man to release the hostages, saying Siddiqui's family condemned his ""heinous"" actions. 
The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a U.S. Muslim advocacy group, condemned the man's actions.
""This latest antisemitic attack on Jewish Americans worshipping at a synagogue is an act of pure evil,"" CAIR said in a statement. 

Klompus said he did not know of any significant previous threats to the congregation. 
""We don't have a security officer on staff but we have what I would say is a very good relationship with the local police,"" he said.

BEIJING/SEOUL (Reuters) -Chinese brokers said they expect the resumption of regular trade with North Korea as soon as Monday, after a North Korean train pulled into a Chinese border town on Sunday in the first such crossing since anti-coronavirus border lockdowns began in 2020.
""My business partner in North Korea told me on Friday that the land border will reopen to cargo freight on Jan. 17,"" a Chinese commodities trader in the border town of Dandong told Reuters.
""By Saturday the whole import-export community here has heard about this and people have began snapping up carriages to move their cargo over,"" he said.
North Korea has not officially reported any COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began in early 2020, and has imposed strict anti-virus measures, including border closures and domestic travel curbs.
Another Chinese trader said she can arrange for cargo to be loaded onto a train in Dandong which is scheduled to cross over to North Korea on Monday.
On Sunday she posted three photos of freight carriages taken inside a railway station on social media, and said that the first batch of cargo for the resumption of rail link between Dandong and North Korea was being loaded.
Both traders refused to be named, citing the sensitivity of the matter.
China has not officially announced the reopening of border. Previous reports of imminent border reopening citing traders and logistics had not materialised.
The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request on Sunday for confirmation of the border's reopening.
Citing multiple unnamed sources, South Korea's Yonhap news agency earlier on Sunday reported the arrival of what it said was a North Korean freight train in Dandong, saying it marked the formal reopening of North Korea's land border with China.
It was unclear whether the train was carrying any cargo into China, but was likely to return to North Korea on Monday with a load of ""emergency materials"", the sources told Yonhap, without elaborating.
Japan's Kyodo news agency also reported the train's arrival, citing an informed source.
While Chinese data show some limited trade https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/chinas-nov-exports-north-korea-fall-previous-month-customs-data-2021-12-20 has continued, most shipments appear to be using North Korean seaports, not trains across its land borders.
Officials in Seoul said late last year they were watching closely for a resumption in cross-border rail traffic as a signal that restrictions might be loosening.

After nearly two years of border closures, some humanitarian aid https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/trickle-humanitarian-aid-enters-north-korea-border-closure-drags-2022-01-13 is trickling into North Korea, though shipments of key supplies including food remain blocked, according to United Nations organisations.
Several shipments of nutrition and medical aid have entered the country after up to three months of quarantine at Nampo sea port, but there had been no confirmation of major shipments being transported by train.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) -Hundreds of Hondurans and Nicaraguans on Saturday reached the Guatemalan border but were prevented from crossing by Guatemalan security forces, the first such U.S.-bound migrant caravan to be formed this year in Central America.
Some migrants at the Izabel border crossing in Guatemala threw objects at Guatemalan security forces, who pushed them back with riot shields, according to a video shared by Guatemalan authorities.
The caravan set off days before leftist President-elect Xiomara Castro takes office in Honduras on Jan. 27. She has vowed to revive the economy and combat corruption that stokes waves of mass migration to the United States.
Earlier in the day, the migrants, mostly young people carrying backpacks on their shoulders and women with children, left a bus terminal in the northern city of San Pedro Sula for the Honduran border post of Corinto, across from Izabel. Some were pushing children in baby carriages.
""There is no work,"" said Pablo Mendez, a Honduran carrying his 2-year-old daughter in his arms. ""That is why people are leaving in this caravan.""
Reuters video footage showed large groups of hundreds of people walking across San Pedro Sula, with many crossing busy highways on foot. Another group had set off in the dark early in the morning.
Guatemalan authorities said about 100 people crossed into Guatemala at unauthorized border crossings, and later added that some 36 people have been returned to Honduras.
Previously, Honduran police have formed roadblocks to prevent many such caravans from reaching the border crossing. Guatemalan security forces have also clashed with migrant groups when they tried to force their way across without documents.
The first caravan of the year comes after deep economic hardship and poverty that plagues 62% of the Honduran population, made worse by the coronavirus pandemic and two back-to-back hurricanes in 2020 that hobbled the economy. 
In Nicaragua, political crackdowns by President Daniel Ortega's government before and after the Nov. 7 presidential elections have led to a surge in migration.

Euclides Mendes, a Nicaraguan migrant, said the size of the caravan gave him hope that the treacherous journey would be safe.
""It's true that we're going to walk a lot, but we're going, and the important thing is to get to the finish line,"" Mendes added.

KYIV (Reuters) -Kyiv believes a hacker group linked to Belarusian intelligence carried out a cyberattack https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/expect-worst-ukraine-hit-by-cyberattack-russia-moves-more-troops-2022-01-14 that hit Ukrainian government websites this week and used malware similar to that used by a group tied to Russian intelligence, a senior Ukrainian security official said.
Serhiy Demedyuk, deputy secretary of the national security and defence council, told Reuters that Ukraine blamed Friday's attack - which defaced government websites with threatening messages - on a group known as UNC1151 and that it was cover for more destructive actions behind the scenes.
""We believe preliminarily that the group UNC1151 may be involved in this attack,"" he said. 
His comments offer the first detailed analysis by Kyiv on the suspected culprits behind the cyberattack on dozens of websites. Officials on Friday said Russia was probably involved but gave no details. Belarus is a close ally of Russia.
The cyberattack splashed websites with a warning to ""be afraid and expect the worst"" at a time when Russia has massed troops https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-crisis-what-next-after-week-talks-tension-2022-01-14 near Ukraine's borders, and Kyiv and Washington fear Moscow is planning a new military assault on Ukraine. 
Russia has dismissed such fears as ""unfounded"". 
The office of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Demedyuk's remarks. 
Russia's foreign ministry also did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his remarks. It has previously denied involvement in cyberattacks, including against Ukraine. 
""The defacement of the sites was just a cover for more destructive actions that were taking place behind the scenes and the consequences of which we will feel in the near future,"" Demedyuk said in written comments. 
In a reference to UNC1151, he said: ""This is a cyber-espionage group affiliated with the special services of the Republic of Belarus.""
'TRACK RECORD' 
Demedyuk, who used to be the head of Ukraine's cyber police, said the group had a track record of targeting Lithuania, Latvia, Poland and Ukraine and had spread narratives decrying the NATO alliance's presence in Europe. 
""The malicious software used to encrypt some government servers is very similar in its characteristics to that used by the ATP-29 group,"" he said, referring to a group suspected of involvement in hacking the Democratic National Committee before the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
""The group specializes in cyber espionage, which is associated with the Russian special services (Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation) and which, for its attacks, resorts to recruiting or undercover work of its insiders in the right company,"" Demedyuk said. 
The messages left on the Ukrainian websites on Friday were in three languages: Ukrainian, Russian and Polish. They referred to Volhynia and Eastern Galicia, where mass killings were carried out in Nazi German-occupied Poland by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA). The episode remains a point of contention between Poland and Ukraine.

Demedyuk suggested the hackers had used Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Translate for the Polish translation.
""It is obvious that they did not succeed in misleading anyone with this primitive method, but still this is evidence that the attackers 'played' on the Polish-Ukrainian relations (which are only getting stronger every day),"" he said.

(Reuters) -An underwater volcano off Tonga erupted on Saturday, triggering tsunami warnings and evacuation orders in Japan and causing large waves in several South Pacific islands, where footage on social media showed waves crashing into coastal homes.
Japan's meteorological agency issued tsunami warnings in the early hours on Sunday and said waves as high as three metres (9.84 feet) were expected in the Amami islands in the south. Waves of more than a metre were recorded there earlier.
Public broadcaster NHK said no damage or casualties had been reported, interrupting its regular programming to report on the tsunami advisory spanning the entire eastern coast of the Japanese archipelago https://www.jma.go.jp/bosai/map.html#3/15.096/153.862/&elem=warn&contents=tsunami⟨=en issued by the country's meteorological agency.
In a briefing, a Japan Meteorological Agency official urged people not to go near the sea until the tsunami advisory and more serious tsunami warnings had been lifted. The warnings - the first in more than five years - covered several specific areas.
He said the change in sea levels observed did not follow a familiar pattern of tsunamis following earthquakes.
""We do not know yet whether these (waves) are actually tsunami,"" he told the briefing.
Tsunami waves were observed in Tonga's capital and the capital of American Samoa, a U.S.-based tsunami monitor said, following the eruption at 0410 GMT of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai underwater volcano.
The volcano, which lies about 65 km (40 miles) north of Nuku'alofa, caused a 1.2-metre (four-foot) tsunami wave, Australia's Bureau of Meteorology said.
The bureau said it continued to monitor the situation but no tsunami threat had been issued to the Australian mainland, islands or territories.
Tsunami waves of 83 cm (2.7 feet) were recorded by gauges in the Tongan capital of Nuku'alofa and two-foot waves were seen at Pago Pago, the capital of American Samoa, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said.
Fiji issued a tsunami warning, urging residents to avoid the shorelines ""due to strong currents and dangerous waves"".
Jese Tuisinu, a television reporter at Fiji One, posted a video on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) showing large waves crashing ashore, with people trying to flee in their cars.
""It is literally dark in parts of Tonga and people are rushing to safety following the eruption,"" he said.
There were no immediate reports of casualties.
In New Zealand, the emergency management agency issued an advisory on tsunami activity for the country's north and east coasts, forecasting strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges along shorelines in those areas.
On Friday, the volcano sent ash, steam and gas up to 20 km (12 miles) into the air, Tonga Geological Services said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post. It has a radius of 260 km (160 miles).
A tsunami advisory was also in effect for the U.S. and  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) coast, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu said.

The National Weather Service said tsunami waves along the Oregon and southern Washington coast were expected imminently. High waves were reported in Alaska and Hawaii earlier.
In the San Francisco Bay Area of northern California, small parts of the cities of Berkeley and Albany near the bay were ordered to evacuate.

WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who previously served as the Ethiopian health minister and foreign minister, said earlier this week that aid was being blocked from getting through to his home region of Tigray, where rebellious forces are fighting the central government. 
""Tedros Adhanom's moral, legal and professional standing that threatened WHO's organisational standing,"" Ethiopia said in a statement late on Thursday. ""He has spread harmful misinformation and compromised WHO's reputation, independence, credibility which is evident from his social media postings.""
The WHO said in an emailed response to Reuters request for comment that it was aware that Ethiopia's foreign affairs ministry had sent a diplomatic communication, called a note verbale. 
It said the WHO ""will continue to ask the Ethiopian government to allow access to deliver humanitarian supplies and services to the 7 million people in Tigray, Ethiopia..."" 
The ""WHO and partners have been repeatedly calling for urgent and unimpeded access to deliver humanitarian heath supplies and services to the people in Tigray.""
The government has denied blocking aid and has accused the rebellious forces of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) of requisitioning trucks sent in previously. 
Ethiopia's army chief has previously accused https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-conflict-who-idUSKBN27Z13Z Tedros of trying to procure arms and diplomatic backing for the TPLF. He denied that.
Thousands have been killed in the conflict in Tigray, which spread to two neighbouring regions in northern Ethiopia before Tigrayan forces were forced to withdraw back to Tigray in December.
The United Nations says the government is operating a de facto blockade of humanitarian aid to Tigray; no trucks have entered the region since Dec. 15. More than 90% of the population needs food aid and doctors told Reuters last week that many people - including malnourished children - are dying because no medicine has been permitted to enter Tigray. 
On Thursday, Tedros tweeted ""People in #Tigray #Ethiopia, living under de facto blockade for over a year, are dying from lack of medicine & food, & repeated drone attacks. @WHO & partners call for safe, unimpeded access to deliver humanitarian aid to the millions of people in great need.""
The WHO said that its main call and that of the international community was to get access to those affected and for all parties to use political action to achieve peace and security.
""This is true for Tigray and elsewhere in northern Ethiopia,"" it said. 
Ethiopia's foreign ministry said Tedros failed to show integrity and professionalism and was a member of the TPLF, which dominated Ethiopian politics for nearly 30 years before Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's appointment in 2018.
""Tedros encourages the TPLF in his media engagements and celebrates what is presumed to be a military success of the group, besides engaging in selective outrage where he discriminately addresses the humanitarian concerns in Ethiopia,"" the ministry said.

The government designated TPLF a terrorist group after the war erupted in November 2020. Tedros, a Tigrayan, was a member of the TPLF. Abiy also served as an intelligence chief under the previous TPLF-led government. 
Tedros was elected the WHO's first African director general in May 2017 with strong Ethiopian and African support. He ran again as the sole nominee in October. Ethiopia withheld its support and 28 other countries appointed Tedros for a second five-year term.

Jamaica Constabulary Force spokesman Dennis Brooks told Reuters that John Joel Joseph, a well-known Haitian politician named by the authorities as a suspect in Moise's killing, was arrested by the authorities on Friday.
Brooks declined to comment on whether the arrest was following a request by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations, which is also investigating the murder. It was also unclear where Joseph was arrested in Jamaica.
Moise was shot dead when assassins armed with assault rifles stormed his private residence in the hills above Port-au-Prince on July 7, sparking a major man hunt and investigations across several countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.
Days after Moise murder the then-National Police Chief Leon Charles said Joseph was a key player in the plot, alleging he supplied weapons and planned meetings, and that police were searching for him.

Haiti has arrested dozens of people following the July murder that left a political vacuum in the Caribbean nation. But it has not charged anyone, and the investigation has drawn complaints in that country about delays and intimidation of officials.
U.S. authorities this month charged a Colombian man with conspiracy to commit murder or kidnapping outside the United States in connection with the assassination of Moise, the first official charges in the brazen crime.

LONDON (Reuters) -British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's office apologised to Queen Elizabeth on Friday after it emerged that staff partied late into the night in Downing Street on the eve of Prince Philip's funeral, when mixing indoors was banned.
Johnson is facing the gravest crisis of his premiership after almost daily revelations of social gatherings during COVID-19 lockdowns, some held when ordinary people could not bid farewell in person to dying relatives.
As an opinion poll showed the opposition Labour Party pulling into a 10-point lead over Johnson's Conservatives, a report said he had encouraged staff to ""let off steam"" during regular ""wine-time Friday"" gatherings.
After building a political career out of flouting accepted norms, Johnson is now under growing pressure from some of his own lawmakers to quit. Opponents say he is unfit to rule and has misled parliament by denying COVID-19 guidance was breached.
In an extraordinary twist to a saga that has been widely lampooned by comedians and cartoonists, the Daily Telegraph said drinks parties were held inside Downing Street on April 16, 2021, the day before Prince Philip's funeral.
""It is deeply regrettable this took place at a time of national mourning and No. 10 (Downing Street) has apologised to the Palace,"" Johnson's spokesman told reporters.
Johnson was at his Chequers country residence that day and was not invited to any gathering, his spokesman said. 
Such was the revelry in Downing Street, the Telegraph said, that staff went to a nearby supermarket to buy a suitcase of alcohol, spilled wine on carpets, and broke a swing used by the prime minister's son.
The next day, Queen Elizabeth bade farewell to Philip, her husband of 73 years, following his death aged 99.
Dressed in black and in a white trimmed black face mask, the 95-year-old Elizabeth cut a poignant figure as she sat alone, in strict compliance with coronavirus rules, during his funeral service at Windsor Castle. 
'LEAVE THE STAGE'
Opponents have called for Johnson, 57, to resign, casting him as a charlatan who demanded the British people follow some of the most onerous rules in peacetime history while his staff partied at the heart of government.
A small but growing number in Johnson's Conservative Party have echoed those calls, fearing it will do lasting damage to its electoral prospects. 
""Sadly, the Prime Minister's position has become untenable,"" said Conservative lawmaker Andrew Bridgen, a former Johnson supporter. ""The time is right to leave the stage.""
In the latest report of rule-breaking, the Mirror newspaper said staff had bought a large wine fridge for Friday gatherings, events that were regularly observed by Johnson as he walked to his apartment in the building.
""If the PM tells you to 'let off steam', he's basically saying this is fine,"" it quoted one source as saying. 
Separately, the former head of the government unit behind COVID restrictions, Kate Josephs, apologised for holding her own drinks gathering when she left the job in December 2020. 
Johnson has given a variety of explanations of the parties, ranging from denials that any rules were broken to expressing understanding for the public anger at apparent hypocrisy at the heart of the British state. 
The Independent newspaper said Johnson had dubbed a plan to salvage his premiership as ""Operation Save Big Dog"". 
Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, seen as a possible successor, said ""real mistakes"" had been made.
""We need to look at the overall position we're in as a country, the fact that he (Johnson) has delivered Brexit, that we are recovering from COVID... He has apologised.""
""I think we now need to move on.""
To trigger a leadership challenge, 54 of the 360 Conservative members of parliament must write letters of no confidence to the chairman of the party's 1922 Committee.
The Telegraph said as many as 30 such letters had been submitted.

Johnson faces a tough year ahead: beyond COVID-19, inflation is soaring, energy bills are spiking, taxation will rise in April and his party faces local elections in May. 
British police said on Thursday they would not investigate gatherings held in Johnson's residence during a coronavirus lockdown unless an internal government inquiry finds evidence of potential criminal offences.

The court identified the six men as Mikhail Golovachuk, Ruslan Khansvyarov, Dmitry Korotayev, Alexei Malozemov, Artyom Zayets and Daniil Puzyrevsky.
In a rare apparent demonstration of U.S.-Russian collaboration at a time of high tensions between the two over Ukraine, Russian authorities detained and charged the REVil group's members this week. 
A police and FSB domestic intelligence operation searched 25 addresses, detaining 14 people, the FSB said on Friday, listing assets it had seized including $600,000 of computer equipment and 20 luxury cars.
The United States welcomed the arrests.

The United States said in November it was offering a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the identification or location of anyone holding a key position in the REvil group.
A source familiar with the case told Interfax the group's members with Russian citizenship would not be handed over to the United States.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly will visit Kyiv next week to reaffirm support for Ukrainian sovereignty and reinforce efforts to deter ""aggressive actions"" by Russia, Ottawa said on Saturday.
Moscow has stationed more than 100,000 troops near the border with Ukraine and the United States said on Friday it feared Russia was preparing a pretext to invade if diplomacy failed to meet its objectives.
Canada, with a sizeable and politically influential population of Ukrainian ethnic descent, has taken a hard line with Moscow since the annexation of Crimea in 2014.
""The amassing of Russian troops and equipment in and around Ukraine jeopardizes security in the entire region. These aggressive actions must be deterred,"" Joly said in a statement.
""Canada will work with its international partners to uphold the rules-based international order.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea tested a railway-borne missile in its firing drills on Friday, state media KCNA said on Saturday, amid a U.S. push for fresh sanctions against the isolated state following its recent series of weapons tests. 
South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said two short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) travelled about 430 km (267 miles) to a maximum altitude of 36 km (22 miles) after being launched eastward on the northwest coast of North Korea. 
The official KCNA news agency did not specify the missiles' range, or trajectory, but said a firing drill was held in North Pyongan Province to ""check and judge the proficiency in the action procedures of the railway-borne regiment."" 
The country tested the rail-based system for the first time last September, saying it was designed as a potential counter-strike to any threatening forces. 
Since New Year's Day, North Korea has launched three ballistic missiles in an unusually fast sequence of weapons tests. The previous two launches involved what state media called ""hypersonic missiles"" capable of high speeds and manoeuvring after launch.
Hours before the latest test drill, North Korea slammed the United States for pursuing new sanctions in response to its recent missile launches, calling it a ""provocation"" and warning of a strong reaction.
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration imposed its first sanctions against Pyongyang on Wednesday, and called on the U.N. Security Council to blacklist several North Korean individuals and entities. 
North Korea has defended the missile tests as its sovereign right to self-defence and accused the United States of intentionally escalating the situation with new sanctions. 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un did not attend the drill. KCNA said the military leadership had ordered the test ""at short notice"" and the system precisely struck the target set in the east coast with ""two tactical guided missiles.""
The system ""demonstrated high manoeuvrability and rate of hits,"" KCNA said, adding its success led to discussions to ""set up proper railway-borne missile operating system across the country."" 
North Korea has been steadily developing its weapons systems, raising the stakes for stalled talks aimed at dismantling its nuclear and ballistic missile arsenals in return for U.S. sanctions relief.
South Korean Chung Eui-yong and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned the latest launch during their phone call on Saturday and coordinated responses to the North's recent missile tests, the State Department said.
Both sides highlighted the importance of maintaining firm combined readiness posture and urged Pyongyang to return to a negotiating table, Seoul's foreign ministry said. 
'AT SHORT NOTICE'
Cheong Seong-chang, director for North Korean studies at South Korea's Sejong Institute, said the test could be an ""instant display of force"" to protest against the U.S. sanctions push, noting that it was not planned in advance and unusually took place in the afternoon. 
""It's a message that they would take an 'eye to eye' approach if Washington presses for sanctions for testing non-long-range missiles,"" Cheong said. 
KCNA released photographs showing a missile trailing a column of smoke and flame as it was launched from the top of an olive-green train in a mountainous area, before arrowing down on a small island, sending up a cloud of smoke and debris as it hit. 
Despite North Korea's limited and sometimes unreliable rail network, rail mobile missiles are a relatively cheap and efficient option to improve the survivability of their nuclear forces, making it difficult for enemies to detect and destroy them before being fired, analysts said.

Kim Dong-yup, a former South Korea Navy officer who teaches at Seoul's Kyungnam University, said North Korea appears to have fired KN-23 SRBMs, which were also test fired in September, when they flew 800 km (497 miles). 
First tested in May 2019, the KN-23 resembles Russia's Iskander-M SRBM visually, and is designed to evade missile defences and conduct a precision strikes, experts said.

The figure included civilians and armed ""bandits"" killed by security forces, Serik Shalabayev, the head of criminal prosecution at the prosecutor's office, told a briefing. 
He did not provide an exact breakdown of the figures and said numbers could be updated later.
Violent protests began in the oil-producing Central Asian state this month after a jump in car fuel prices. The toll provided by Shalabayev confirmed the violence was the deadliest in the country's post-Soviet history.
Shalabayev said 50,000 people joined the riots throughout the former Soviet republic at their peak on Jan. 5 when crowds stormed and torched government buildings, cars, banks and shops in several major cities.

President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev turned to a Russia-led military bloc for help during the unrest and sidelined his former patron and predecessor Nursultan Nazarbayev by taking over the national security council.
After complaints about beatings and torture of those detained in the aftermath, Tokayev ordered police on Saturday to avoid abuses and told prosecutors to be lenient to those who have not committed grave crimes.

(Reuters) - A leader of the right-wing Proud Boys group, Enrique Tarrio, was released from jail on Friday after serving four months and a week for burning a Black Lives Matter banner at a historic African American church in Washington in December 2020.
Tarrio was among a group of Proud Boys who stole the banner during a demonstration in Washington on Dec. 12, 2020. Tarrio then set it on fire, according to comments he made afterward. He pled guilty in July, was sentenced in August and began serving his jail sentence in September.
Tarrio did not take part in the deadly Jan. 6, 2021 riots at the U.S. Capitol. He was arrested when he arrived in Washington two days before the failed bid to prevent Congress' certification of Democrat Joe Biden's November 2020 election win over then-President Donald Trump, a Republican.

The FBI has said his January 2021 arrest was to try to pre-empt the events of Jan. 6 when several other members of the Proud Boys were taken into custody.
Those members of the right-wing group face charges including obstruction of law enforcement, destruction of government property and conspiracy.

In a meeting on Friday in the city of Wuxi, in Jiangsu province, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi also backed efforts to revive a 2015 nuclear deal between major powers and Iran. 
A summary of the meeting between Wang and Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian was posted on China's foreign ministry website on Saturday. 
Wang, who is also State Councillor, said the U.S. bore primary responsibility for the ongoing difficulties with Iran, having unilaterally withdrawn from a 2015 nuclear deal between the major powers and Iran.
Under the terms of that deal, in return for the lifting of international sanctions, Iran would limit uranium enrichment activity, making it harder to develop nuclear arms - although Tehran denies having plans for nuclear weapons.
Wang said China would firmly support a resumption on negotiations on a nuclear pact.
But he said China firmly opposes unilateral sanctions against Iran, political manipulation through topics including human rights, and interference in the internal affairs of Iran and other regional countries.
The United States reimposed sanctions that badly damaged Iran's economy after withdrawing from the nuclear pact in 2018, saying the terms did not do enough to curb Iran's nuclear activities, ballistic missile program and regional influence.
A year later, Iran began to gradually breach the accord, rebuilding stockpiles of enriched uranium, refining it to higher fissile purity and installing advanced centrifuges to speed up output. 
China and Iran, both subject to U.S. sanctions, signed the 25-year cooperation agreement last March, bringing Iran into China' Belt and Road Initiative, a multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure scheme intended to stretch from East Asia to Europe. 
The project aims to significantly expand China's economic and political influence, and has raised concerns in the United States and elsewhere.
The foreign ministry summary said the agreement would deepen Sino-Iranian cooperation in areas including energy, infrastructure, agriculture, health care and culture, as well as cyber security and cooperation with other countries.

Iran and the U.S. remain locked in talks over whether a compromise can be found to renew the deal and dispel fears of a wider Middle East War. A source close to negotiations said on Friday that many issues remain unresolved.
Wang, who earlier in the week met with several counterparts from Gulf Arab countries concerned about the potential threat from Iran, also said China hopes to set up a dialogue mechanism with Gulf countries to discuss regional security issues.

176,"<span>Jan 15, 2022 12:31AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Baltimore's top prosecutor, Marilyn Mosby, said on Friday she was innocent of wrongdoing, a day after she was indicted on federal charges of perjury and filing false loan applications related to the purchase of two Florida vacation homes.
Mosby, elected state's attorney in 2015, said she was the victim of a ""ploy"" by political adversaries seeking to unseat her and was determined to ""fight with every ounce in my being and to clear my name.""
""I’m here before you today to state unequivocally that I am innocent,"" she said in a 10-minute statement delivered to reporters as she choked back tears. She took no questions at the end.
Mosby, 41, is accused of falsely claiming twice to have suffered a work-related financial hardship from COVID-19 in order to request two early withdrawals totaling $90,000 from her city employee retirement account.
Prosecutors said Mosby used the money she received - $36,000 in May 2020 and $45,000 on Dec. 31 of that year - toward down payments on vacation homes in Kissimmee and Long Boat Key.
The two counts of perjury stem from Mosby's allegedly false statements of coronavirus-related financial duress at a time when she was earning a gross annual salary of nearly $248,000 in full, the indictment asserts.
She is also charged with two counts of making false statements on mortgage applications seeking a total of more than $900,000 in loans to buy the Florida properties. The indictment says Mosby failed to disclose federal tax delinquencies resulting in a $45,000 lien imposed by the Internal Revenue Service in 2020.
Mosby denied both sets of allegations, saying, ""I did not defraud anyone to take my money from my retirement savings, and I did not lie on any mortgage application.""
Baltimore television station WBAL-TV cited Mosby's attorney, A. Scott Bolden, as saying in a media interview that his client had other business interests, including a travel company affected by the pandemic, and that she had consulted with financial advisers before making the mortgage application.
According to Mosby, prosecutors refused her offer to personally present evidence on her own behalf to the grand jury that ultimately indicted her. 
Mosby said political opponents ""have had a target on my back"" since she made national headlines in 2015 by filing criminal charges against six police officers in the death of Freddie Gray, a young Black man who suffered a fatal spinal injury while being transported in the back of a police van. None of the six officers charged in his death was convicted.

Mosby ran for office as a part of a movement of ""progressive prosecutors"" promising to address systemic racism in the U.S. criminal justice system.
U.S. Attorney Erek Barron, a former state delegate who was nominated to his post by President Joe Biden, has declined to comment on the case, according to the independent, nonpartisan news site Maryland Matters.

Public broadcaster NHK said three people were conscious after being injured in the morning when another student attacked them with a bladed object as they gathered to take their entrance exam. 
The alleged assailant, a 17-year old high school student, was arrested, the Asahi newspaper said.
Half a million high school students across Japan are taking the annual university entrance exams this weekend in hundreds of venues across the country. 
Tokyo's Metropolitan Police Department said it could not comment on the details of the attack nor confirm any arrests.

Violent crimes are exceedingly rare in Japan, but there have been a spate of knife attacks by assailants unknown to the victims. 
In October, a man dressed in Batman's Joker costume dressed in Batman's Joker costume stabbed more than a dozen people on a train carriage in Tokyo, sending passengers screaming down the aisles of train carriages and scrambling out of windows to escape. A few months earlier, a man wounded several people in a knife attack on a Tokyo commuter train.

PLANO, Texas (Reuters) -The founder and leader of the far-right Oath Keepers group, Stewart Rhodes, on Friday pleaded not guilty to seditious conspiracy charges for his alleged role in the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Rhodes made a brief initial appearance in federal court in Plano, Texas. He was in the custody of U.S. Marshals, wearing handcuffs and leg irons.
Rhodes and 10 other associates or members of the group were accused by the Justice Department on Thursday https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-arrests-far-right-militia-group-oath-keepers-leader-jan-6-probe-nyt-2022-01-13 of plotting to storm the Capitol by force, in a failed bid to block Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.
Rhodes, 56, is the most high-profile defendant of more than 725 charged so far for allegedly taking part in the attack on the Capitol by former President Donald Trump's supporters. The riot was fueled by Trump's false claims that his election defeat was the result of fraud.
The Justice Department will request that Rhodes be detained while he awaits trial, a prosecutor said at Friday's hearing.
James Lee Bright, a lawyer for Rhodes, told reporters Rhodes intends to fight the charges.
""He believes he will be found not guilty,"" Bright said, adding that Rhodes will oppose the government's request for pretrial detention.
""He has no reason to flee. He has no passport. He has nowhere to go,"" Bright said.
Rhodes and his associates are the first people charged with seditious conspiracy for their alleged role in the attack. That charge can carry a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.
Another Oath Keeper, Edward Vallejo, appeared in a Phoenix courtroom to face seditious conspiracy charges.
A judge scheduled a follow-up court hearing for Vallejo on Jan. 20 to determine whether the 63-year-old will be detained while he awaits trial. A lawyer for Vallejo indicated he planned to enter a not guilty plea at a future hearing.
A prosecutor said during Friday's hearing that the Justice Department will request pretrial detention for Vallejo. 
Rhodes founded the Oath Keepers, which believes the federal government is encroaching on its rights. Its membership is largely made up of current and retired military and law enforcement officials.
The indictment portrayed Rhodes as a ringleader who warned his members to prepare for a ""bloody and desperate fight https://www.reuters.com/world/us/a-bloody-desperate-fight-us-prosecutors-release-oath-keepers-communications-2022-01-13"" to prevent Democrat Joe Biden from becoming president. 

It says he helped rally his members to go to Washington and played a key role in organizing and helping stage logistics for the group, including the establishment of so-called ""quick reaction force"" teams that stashed firearms outside the city limits.
The indictment also says Rhodes spent thousands of dollars stockpiling gear and weapons, including an AR-15 rifle, night vision goggles and ammunition.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The judge in British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell's sex abuse trial on Friday set a sentencing date of June 28 but said she is still weighing Maxwell's request to overturn her conviction because of concerns about a juror's conduct.
Maxwell, 60, was convicted https://www.reuters.com/world/us/maxwell-jury-resume-deliberations-after-judge-warns-omicron-risk-2021-12-29 on Dec. 29 on five counts of sex trafficking and other charges for recruiting and grooming teenage girls for the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein to abuse between 1994 and 2004. Maxwell faces up to 65 years in prison when she is sentenced by U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in New York.
Maxwell's lawyers said last week they would request a new trial https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ghislaine-maxwells-prosecutors-seek-inquiry-into-jurors-sexual-abuse-claim-2022-01-05 after one of the jurors in the case told Reuters and other media that he shared his experience of being sexually abused as a child during deliberations, and that his account helped sway jurors who were skeptical of Maxwell's accusers.
Maxwell's lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. The U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan declined to comment.
The juror's comments to media raised concerns he did not disclose his abuse when asked on a pre-trial screening questionnaire whether he or anyone in his family had been the victim of sexual abuse. 
The juror, who asked to be identified by his first and middle names, Scotty David, said https://www.reuters.com/world/us/some-ghislaine-maxwell-jurors-initially-doubted-accusers-juror-says-2022-01-05 he did not remember seeing the question. He said he was not asked about any personal experiences with sexual abuse during follow-up questioning in November by Nathan.
Maxwell would not be guaranteed https://www.reuters.com/world/us/no-guarantee-new-maxwell-trial-after-jurors-revelations-experts-say-2022-01-07 a new trial even if the juror indicated on the form that he had not been sexually abused, legal experts told Reuters last week. Instances in which judges overturned verdicts for juror dishonesty tended to involve jurors who deliberately lied to get on the panel, the experts said.

Maxwell's attorneys have until Jan. 19 to submit a formal motion for a new trial, and prosecutors will then have until Feb. 2 to respond. Prosecutors have requested that Nathan conduct an inquiry into the juror's actions. 
Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 at age 66 while awaiting trial on sex crimes charges.

(Reuters) - Hackers who defaced and interrupted access to numerous Ukrainian government websites https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/exclusive-hackers-likely-used-software-administration-rights-third-party-hit-2022-01-14 on Friday could be setting the stage for more serious cyberattacks that would disrupt the lives of ordinary Ukrainians, experts said. 
""As tensions grow, we can expect more aggressive cyber activity in Ukraine and potentially elsewhere,"" said John Hultquist, an intelligence analyst at U.S. cybersecurity company Mandiant, possibly including ""destructive attacks that target critical infrastructure.""
""Organizations need to begin preparing,"" Hultquist added.
Intrusions by hackers on hospitals, power utility companies, and the financial system were until recently rare. But organized cybercriminals, many of them living in Russia, have gone after institutions aggressively in the past two years with ransomware, freezing data and computerized equipment needed to care for hospital patients.
In some cases, those extortion attacks have led to patient deaths, according to litigation, media reports and medical professionals.
Friday's attack on Ukrainian websites included a warning to ""be afraid and expect the worst"", at a time when Russia has amassed about 100,000 troops near Ukraine, raising fears in the West that it is considering an invasion. Moscow denies it wants to invade.
Russia has repeatedly rejected hacking allegations leveled by Ukraine and other countries over the years. While a suspect in the new web defacements, Russia has not been directly accused by Ukraine.
In 2014 Russian troops went into the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and annexed it from Ukraine. If Russia invades again, more cyberattacks would occur too, predicted former CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) cybersecurity executive Dmitri Alperovitch.
They would most likely be disruptive, not fatal, Alperovitch said. ""It will be a sideshow. The main show will be on the ground.""
Ukraine has already borne the brunt of some of the largest hacks on infrastructure to date.
In December 2015, a first-of-its-kind cyber attack cut the lights to 225,000 people in western Ukraine, with hackers also sabotaging power distribution equipment, complicating attempts to restore power.
The average temperature during the winter in Ukraine is bellow freezing and losing heat is potentially lethal. Outages in the 2015 attack reportedly lasted six hours in some towns.
In the last two months of 2016, hackers targeted Ukrainian state institutions about 6,500 times, officials said. The cyberattacks showed Russian security services were waging a cyberwar against Ukraine, the government said.

An attack on the State Treasury halted its systems for several days, meaning state workers and pensioners had been unable to receive their salaries or payments on time.
The attacks against Ukraine’s power grid are considered by experts as the first examples of hackers shutting off critical energy systems supplying heat and light to millions of homes.

TUNIS (Reuters) -Tunisian police sprayed water cannons into crowds and beat back protesters with batons as they dispersed more than 1,000 demonstrators trying to reach central Tunis on Friday, while journalists covering the protests against the president complained of police violence and abuse.
A heavy police presence prevented many protesters who were demonstrating against President Kais Saied from gathering in Habib Bourguiba Avenue, the main street in central Tunis that is the traditional focal point for protests, including during the 2011 revolution that brought down former President Ben Ali Zine El Abidine and ushered in a period of democratic transition.
On Jan. 14th, the 12th anniversary of the date of Ben Ali's exile and formerly a national holiday in Tunisia, police dispersed several different groups of protesters, at least one of which had hundreds of demonstrators, Reuters witnesses said, kicking and pushing them to force them back. Reuters images shows police firing water cannons at people sitting down in the street. 
The Interior Ministry said 1,200 people had protested and said its forces had exercised restraint.
""Today Saied's only response to opponents is with force and the security forces... it is so sad to see Tunisia like an army barracks on the date of our revolution,"" said opposition activist Chayma Issa, referring to the large presence of security forces.
Opposition parties are protesting against President Saied's suspension of parliament last year, and his assumption of executive power and moves to rewrite the constitution, which they call a coup.
""Preventing free Tunisians from protesting on the revolution anniversary is shameful... and is an attack on freedoms and represents a big decline under the coup authorities,"" said Imed Khemiri, an Ennahda member of the suspended parliament. 
REPORTS OF ATTACKS ON THE PRESS
The French newspaper Liberation said that its reporter in Tunisia Mathieu Galtier was subjected to severe violence by policemen when he was filming a violent attack on a protester and they confiscated his phone later.
""They started hitting me, I was on the ground, curled up in a fetal position. I was screaming that I was a journalist. One of them doused me with gas ... They kicked me and they took my phone, my press card,"" the newspaper quoted its reporter.
Hakaekonline, a local news website, said also that the police seized the phone of its correspondent and viewed her private messages and photos while she was filming during the protest.
Earlier on the day, the owner of the Business News newspaper Nizar Bahloul said that a videographer was arrested before he was later released.
The interior ministry was not immediately available for comment on these allegations. 
Friday's protest was in defiance of a ban on all indoor or outdoor gatherings the government put in place on Tuesday to address a new wave of COVID-19 cases. 
Though Saied's assumption of power in July appeared popular at first among some Tunisians after years of economic stagnation and political paralysis, growing demonstrations indicate he has since lost some support. 

Tunisia's economy remains mired by the pandemic, and there has been little progress in gaining international support for the fragile public finances, while the government Saied appointed in September has announced an unpopular 2022 budget.
Friday falls on what Tunisians had previously marked as the anniversary of the revolution, the day former autocratic Ben Ali fled the country. Saied decreed last year the anniversary would fall on the December date of a street vendor's suicide that triggered the uprising.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors said on Friday that Igor Fruman, a one-time associate of Donald Trump's former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani who helped collect damaging information about Joe Biden, should spend 37 to 46 months in prison after pleading guilty in an unrelated campaign finance case.
In a Manhattan federal court filing, prosecutors called the sentence sufficient to punish Fruman over his ""lead role"" in soliciting $1 million in foreign contributions ""for the express purpose of using that money to influence U.S. elections.""
The proposed sentence mirrors recommended federal sentencing guidelines. U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken is scheduled to sentence Fruman on Jan. 21.
Todd Blanche, a lawyer for Fruman, declined to comment.
Last Friday, he recommended that his client receive no prison time, citing among other reasons Fruman's more than two years in home confinement and acceptance of responsibility.
Oetken also presided over an October trial where co-defendant Lev Parnas, another former Giuliani associate, was found guilty https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ex-giuliani-associate-parnas-found-guilty-violating-us-campaign-finance-law-2021-10-22 of violating campaign finance laws.
Another co-defendant, Andrey Kukushkin, was also found guilty at that trial.
The Belarus-born Fruman and Ukraine-born businessman Parnas had originally been charged in October 2019 with concealing an illegal $325,000 donation to support former President Trump's 2020 re-election campaign.
Fruman's plea related to a separate effort to obtain legal, recreational marijuana distribution licenses.
In his allocution https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/igor-fruman-ex-associate-giuliani-says-he-will-plead-guilty-2021-09-10, Fruman said he had envisioned making donations to Democratic and Republican officials in U.S. states where he wanted to operate, and sent a list of those officials to the foreign national.
He said he had ""little experience"" with rules governing political donations, but ""generally understood"" that foreign nationals were not to make such donations in the United States.

Before the charges were brought, Giuliani had enlisted Fruman and Parnas to help uncover dirt on Biden, then a presidential candidate and now U.S. president, and his son Hunter.
Giuliani has not been charged and has denied wrongdoing.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia has dismantled ransomware crime group REvil at the request of the United States in an operation in which it detained and charged the group's members, the FSB domestic intelligence service said on Friday. 
The arrests were a rare apparent demonstration of U.S.-Russian collaboration at a time of high tensions between the two over Ukraine. The announcement came as Ukraine was responding to a massive cyber attack that shut down government websites, though there was no indication the incidents were related.
The United States welcomed the arrests, according to a senior admininstration official, adding ""we understand that one of the individuals who was arrested today was responsible for attack against Colonial Pipeline last spring."" 
A May cyberattack https://www.reuters.com/technology/ransomware-gangs-disrupted-by-response-colonial-pipeline-hack-2021-05-14/?enowpopup on the Colonial Pipeline that led to widespread gas shortages on the U.S. East Coast used encryption software called DarkSide, which was developed by REvil associates.
A police and FSB operation searched 25 addresses, detaining 14 people, the FSB said, listing assets it had seized including 426 million roubles, $600,000, 500,000 euros, computer equipment and 20 luxury cars.
A Moscow court identified two of the men as Roman Muromsky and Andrei Bessonov and remanded them in custody for two months. Muromsky could not be reached for comment and his phone was off. Reuters could not immediately reach Bessonov. 
Two Muscovites told Reuters Muromsky was a web developer who had helped them with websites for their businesses. 
Russia told Washington directly of the moves it had taken against the group, the FSB said. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow said it could not immediately comment. 
""The investigative measures were based on a request from the ... United States,"" the FSB said. ""... The organised criminal association has ceased to exist and the information infrastructure used for criminal purposes was neutralised.""
The REN TV channel aired footage of agents raiding homes and arresting people, pinning them to the floor, and seizing large piles of dollars and Russian roubles.
The group members have been charged and could face up to seven years in prison, the FSB said.
A source familiar with the case told Interfax the group's members with Russian citizenship would not be handed over to the United States. 
The United States said in November it was offering a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the identification or location of anyone holding a key position in the REvil group.
The United States has been hit by a string of high-profile hacks by ransom-seeking cybercriminals. A source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters in June that REvil was suspected of being the group behind a ransomware attack on the world's biggest meat packing company,  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY).
Washington has repeatedly accused the Russian state in the past of malicious activity on the internet, which Moscow denies.
REvil has not been associated with any major attacks for months.
John Shier, a threat researcher at the UK-based Sophos cybersecurity company, said there was no independent confirmation the self-identified leaders of the ""defunct"" group had been arrested. 
""If nothing else, it serves as a warning to other criminals that operating out of Russia might not be the safe harbor they thought it was,"" he said. 
'NORMAL PROGRAMMER'
A former client of Muromsky who only gave the name Sergei described him as a regular worker who did not appear wealthy.
Sergei runs a shop called Motohansa selling motorcycle spare parts. Muromsky created its website and supported it for some time charging him around 15,000 roubles ($196) per month, he said. 
""He is a smart person and I can imagine that if he wanted to do it (hacking) he could, but he charged very little money for his services. Several years ago he had a Rover car. That's not an expensive car at all,"" Sergei said.
Muromsky is in his thirties and was born in Anapa in Russia's south, he said. ""He worked as a normal programmer.""

Another client, Adam Guzuyev, described Muromsky as ""a regular normal worker"" who proved unable to install all the features Guzuyev wanted on his website. 
""He earned no more than 60,000 roubles. I can't say he has genius abilities,"" he said, adding Muromsky spent three months working on his website.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) -Novak Djokovic was poised to take his fight to stay in Australia unvaccinated to a federal court on Saturday, after the government again cancelled his visa over COVID-19 entry rules and as the clock to this year's first tennis major ticked down.
The government undertook not to deport the world's top-ranked player until the case was over, though he was ordered to return to pre-deportation detention at 8 a.m. on Saturday (2100 GMT on Friday) prior to his hearing.
Hoping the Serbian will still be able to begin the defence of his Australian Open title on Monday, his legal team submitted their appeal soon after Immigration Minister Alex Hawke used discretionary powers to revoke the visa.
The lawyers said they would argue Djokovic's deportation could be as much a threat to public health, by fanning anti-vaccine sentiment, as letting him stay and exempting him from Australia's requirement that all visitors be vaccinated.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government has won support at home for its tough stance on border security during the pandemic but not escaped criticism for the handling of Djokovic's visa application, and the saga has fuelled a global debate over vaccination rights and obligations.
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on Friday criticised Australia's government for what he called the ""harassing and bullying (of) ... the best tennis player ever.""
""(You'll) never come even close not only to (him), but to any ordinary person in our and your proud nations,"" Vucic said on Instagram.
A Serbian health ministry official defended Djokovic against doubts over the positive COVID-19 test the player used as the basis for his exemption document, whose QR code German news magazine Der Spiegel said had first displayed a negative and then a positive result.
Zoran Gojkovic said a ministry analysis showed the document to be ""absolutely valid.""
World tennis' governing body, the International Tennis Federation, called the situation ""disappointing for all involved"", saying countries' COVID-19 protocols needed to be communicated clearly, but also reserved criticism for Djokovic.
""While the ITF believes that full vaccination is a personal decision, we believe this is the responsible action we must all take in order to ease restrictions and avoid such occurrences happening in the future,"" it said in a statement.
Djokovic, 34 and bidding for a record 21st Grand Slam title, was told on arrival on Jan. 5 that the medical exemption that enabled him to travel was invalid. A court revoked that decision on procedural grounds.
But Hawke on Friday exercised his prerogative to cancel Djokovic's visa ""on health and good order grounds.""
Hawke said he had considered information from Djokovic and the authorities, and that the government was ""firmly committed to protecting Australia's borders, particularly in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic"".
Judge Anthony Kelly, who revoked the first cancellation, said the government had agreed not to deport Djokovic – who has opposed compulsory vaccination but not campaigned against vaccination in general - before the case concluded, and that the player could meet his lawyers.
'PROTECTING BORDERS'
The controversy has become a political touchstone for Morrison as he prepares for an election due by May.
""Australians have made many sacrifices during this pandemic, and they rightly expect the result of those sacrifices to be protected,"" he said in a statement. ""This is what the minister is doing in taking this action today.""
Australians have endured some of the world's longest lockdowns, and the country has seen a runaway Omicron outbreak bring nearly a million cases in the last two weeks.
More than 90% of Australian adults are vaccinated, and an online poll by the News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) media group found that 83% favoured deportation for Djokovic.
His cause was not helped by an incorrect entry declaration, where a box was ticked stating he had not travelled abroad in the two weeks before leaving for Australia.
In fact, he had travelled between Spain and Serbia. 
Djokovic blamed the error on his agent and also acknowledged he should not have done an interview and photoshoot for a French newspaper on Dec. 18 while infected with COVID-19.
But the player has been hailed as a hero by anti-vaccination campaigners. 
'PATENTLY IRRATIONAL' 
Djokovic's legal team said the government was arguing that letting him stay in Australia would incite others to refuse vaccination.
One of his lawyers told the court that this was ""patently irrational"" because Hawke was ignoring the effect that forcibly removing ""this high profile, legally compliant, negligible risk ... player"" might have on anti-vax sentiment and public order.
Djokovic, looking relaxed as he practised at a Melbourne Park on Friday, was included in the draw for the open as top seed and is due to face fellow Serb Miomir Kecmanovic on Monday.
Greek world number four Stefanos Tsitsipas, speaking before Hawke's decision, said Djokovic was ""playing by his own rules"" and making vaccinated players ""look like fools"".
In Belgrade, some already appeared resigned to Djokovic missing the tournament. 

""He is a role model to all of us, but rules must clearly be set,"" Milan Majstorovic told Reuters TV. ""I am unsure how big the involvement of the politics is in that.""
Another passer-by, Ana Bojic, said: ""He can either vaccinate to remain world number one - or he can be stubborn and end his career.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A week of diplomacy by U.S. President Joe Biden failed to defuse tensions between Russia and Ukraine, but has maintained unity with European allies against Moscow as Russian President Vladimir Putin seeks to expose cracks, foreign policy analysts say.
After former U.S. President Donald Trump openly disparaged NATO and left Europe questioning Washington's commitment to the alliance, some analysts said Putin appeared to be testing Biden's declaration that ""America is back"" on the world stage. 
""He's probably counting on divisions in the West,"" veteran former U.S. diplomat Daniel Fried, who worked on the response to Russia's seizure of Crimea in 2014, said of Putin. ""He's going to keep pushing and things could get worse. But had we caved (this week), it would be much worse.""
Russia did not walk out of meetings with the United States and European nations this week, but the talks ended with U.S. officials warning that the risk of a Russian invasion of Ukraine remains high with no sign that Moscow will return some 100,000 troops near the Ukrainian border to their barracks.
Russia denies it plans to attack Ukraine but says it could take unspecified military action unless its demands - including a promise by the NATO alliance never to admit Ukraine - are met.
Biden took office in January 2021 calling for ""predictable"" ties with Russia and playing down Moscow's global influence. 
""There has been a systematic underestimation (in Washington) of the ability of Russia to disrupt things,"" said Tom Schwartz, a professor of history, political science and European studies at Vanderbilt University. 
But Putin flexed his muscles, moving troops and military hardware close to Russia's border with Ukraine over the past year and prompting intensified U.S. diplomacy with Moscow. 
Putin would not let himself ""be deprioritized"" by Washington, said Schwartz, adding that the Russian leader was attempting to demonstrate that ""the American-led international order is really quite fragile now. It's a testing moment.""
Biden's bid to rebuild U.S. leadership globally was also hindered by a chaotic withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in August that prompted the European Union to consider ways to become more independent of the U.S. military.
'ALL IN THIS TOGETHER'
When asked if the Biden administration was faced with any kind of Trump hangover among NATO allies, a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was no ""lack of unity or confidence among NATO allies.""
""We are all in this together and they've responded very well to the administration's approach, which is definitely nothing about Europe, without Europe, nothing about NATO, without NATO,"" the official said.
Biden has faced lingering doubts about America's reliability https://www.reuters.com/world/us/america-may-be-back-g7-allies-doubts-about-us-democracy-linger-2021-06-11 as a partner. Leaders from the Group of Seven advanced economies, NATO and the European Union are worried about the pendulum of U.S. politics swinging yet again. 
While in office Trump threatened to withdraw from NATO and accused Europeans of contributing too little to their defense. 
Although Biden pledged to continue giving military aid to Ukraine and to boost support if Russia invades, Washington's response has been almost entirely diplomatic, and the West is not in a position to defend Ukraine militarily.
The main attempt to deter a Russian invasion is a U.S. threat of ""unprecedented"" sanctions, including export controls and measures targeting Russia's financial system. 
U.S. officials have spent weeks trying to ensure Europe would match Washington's planned sanctions response, but no clear agreement has been reached on what specific sanctions will be leveled. 
While the European Union imposed sanctions on Russia when it annexed Ukraine's Crimea in 2014, the bloc has shown divisions over how to deal with Moscow, which accounts for one-third of EU gas imports. 
The United States said Moscow's behavior towards Ukraine will play a crucial role in the fate of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, meant to transport natural gas from Russia to Germany. But Germany on Thursday warned against drawing a link between the pipeline and the Russian tensions.

""I think the Europeans would be united behind serious sanctions in the event of a full-scale Russian invasion,"" said Anatol Lieven, senior research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. 
""If it's something short of (invasion) - one has to remember that America does not depend on Russia for gas; Europe does,"" Lieven said.

KYIV/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States said it feared Russia was preparing a pretext to invade Ukraine if diplomacy fails to meet its objectives, after a massive cyberattack splashed Ukrainian government websites with a warning to ""be afraid and expect the worst"".
Moscow dismissed such warnings, though it has amassed more than 100,000 troops on its neighbour's frontiers and on Friday released pictures of more of its forces on the move.
The cyberattack - which Kyiv's state security service said showed signs of Russian involvement - unfolded hours after security talks https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-crisis-what-next-after-week-talks-tension-2022-01-14 wrapped up on Thursday with no breakthrough between Moscow and Western allies.
Ukraine said its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had proposed a three-way meeting with the leaders of Russia and the United States. Zelenskiy's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said the ""life and death"" of his country hung in the balance.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters the United States was concerned that Russia was preparing for the possibility of a new military assault https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/keep-defender-guessing-russias-military-options-ukraine-2022-01-14 on a country it invaded in 2014.
""As part of its plans, Russia is laying the groundwork to have the option of fabricating a pretext for invasion, including through sabotage activities and information operations, by accusing Ukraine of preparing an imminent attack against Russian forces in eastern Ukraine,"" Psaki said.
A U.S. official said the United States had information that indicated Russia had already positioned a group of operatives to conduct ""a false-flag operation"" in eastern Ukraine.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed such reports as based on ""unfounded"" information, TASS news agency reported.
Russia denies plans to attack Ukraine but says it could take unspecified military action unless its demands - including a promise by the NATO alliance never to admit Kyiv - are met.
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russia hoped security talks with the United States would resume but that this would depend on Washington's response to Moscow's proposals.
""We categorically will not accept the appearance of NATO right on our borders, especially so given the current course of the Ukrainian leadership,"" he said.
Asked what Moscow meant by threatening this week to take ""military-technical action"" if talks fail, Lavrov said: ""Measures to deploy military hardware, that is obvious. When we take decisions with military hardware we understand what we mean and what we are preparing for.""
Russian Defence Ministry footage released by RIA news agency showed armoured vehicles and other military hardware being loaded onto trains in Russia's far east, in what Moscow called an inspection drill to practice long-range deployments.
""This is likely cover for the units being moved towards Ukraine,"" said Rob Lee, a military analyst and a fellow at the U.S.-based Foreign Policy Research Institute.
'EXPECT THE WORST'
Ukrainian officials were investigating the cyberattack, which they said hit around 70 internet sites of government bodies including the security and defence council.
Ukraine's state security service, SBU, said it saw some signs pointing to the involvement of hacker groups associated with the Russian intelligence services.
A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said it was not yet clear who was responsible. ""We are in touch with the Ukrainians and have offered our support,"" the spokesperson said.
Russia did not comment, but has previously denied being behind cyberattacks, including against Ukraine.
""Ukrainian! All your personal data was uploaded to the public network. All data on the computer is destroyed, it is impossible to restore it,"" said a message visible on hacked government websites, written in Ukrainian, Russian and Polish. 
""All information about you has become public, be afraid and expect the worst. This is for your past, present and future.""
The message was peppered with references that echoed long-running Russian state allegations, rejected by Kyiv, that Ukraine is in thrall to far-right nationalist groups.
The Ukrainian government said it had restored most of the affected sites and no personal data had been stolen.
NATO responded by announcing that it would sign a new agreement within days with Kyiv on closer cooperation in cyber defence, including giving Ukraine access to the Western military alliance's system for sharing information on malicious software.
Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement that NATO cyber experts were already working with the Ukrainian authorities to respond to the attack.
The European Union's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said the EU's political and security committee and cyber units would meet to see how to help Kyiv.
""I can't blame anybody as I have no proof, but we can imagine,"" he said.

On the streets of Ukraine, there was growing resignation to the prospect of renewed fighting. Kyiv resident Ruslan Kavatsyuk, 39, said he saw the cyberattack as a ""positive"", since it would stiffen the resolve of the Ukrainian public.
""It reminds us that we live during military times, that Russia is an enemy who will kill us physically,"" he said.

KYIV (Reuters) - Hackers who launched strikes against Ukrainian government websites appear to have used the software administration rights of a third party company that developed the sites, a top Ukrainian security official told Reuters on Friday. 
Serhiy Demedyuk, the deputy secretary of the national security and defence council, said Ukraine was working to establish who obtained such access, whether it was done externally or through an insider. 
The comments are the first detailed explanation of how multiple Ukrainian websites were hit by a cyber strike that left a warning to ""be afraid and expect the worst"", at a time when Russia has amassed troops near Ukraine's borders.
""According to the preliminary conclusions of our experts ... today's attack occurred due to the use by third parties of access to the software administration rights of a company that had an advantage in developing websites for government agencies,"" Demedyuk said in written comments. 
""The specified software has been used since 2016 to create websites for government agencies, most of which became victims of today's incident,"" said Demedyuk, who used to be the head of Ukraine's cyber police.
He did not name the third party company. 
Ukraine said on Friday the cyberattack hit around 70 internet sites of government bodies including the security and defence council https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/expect-worst-ukraine-hit-by-cyberattack-russia-moves-more-troops-2022-01-14.
Demedyuk said his statements were preliminary findings. 
""But for the final conclusion, law enforcement agencies need to conduct many examinations of the seized digital evidence, as well as to establish how and who exactly received such privileged administrative access, through outside interference or as a result of the illegal activities of an insider in this company,"" he said. 

Demedyuk did not say who might have been behind the attack, though Ukraine's foreign ministry and its state security service pointed the finger of suspicion towards Russia. 
Russia did not comment, but has previously denied being behind cyberattacks, including against Ukraine.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Friday announced the reopening of stores, hairdressers and gyms, partially lifting a lockdown despite record numbers of new COVIC-19 cases.
""We are taking a big step and that also means we're taking a big risk,"" Rutte told a televised press conference.
Non-essential stores, hairdressers, beauty salons and other service providers will be allowed to reopen under strict conditions until 5 p.m. local time (1600 GMT) for the first time since mid-December.
Rutte added that the uncertainties meant that bars, restaurants and cultural venues would have to remain closed until at least Jan. 25. 
Earlier on Friday restaurants in one Dutch city reopened on and others said they would open on Saturday regardless of government plans as popular support for the month-long lockdown evaporates despite the strain on hospitals and record new infections.
""We are taking a calculated risk because we have to. Lockdowns are very hard on everyone and keeping everything closed is also bad for our health,"" Health Minister Ernst Kuipers said. 
Rutte's government ordered the lockdown in mid-December as a wave of the Delta variant forced the health system to cancel all but the most urgent care and it appeared rising Omicron cases would overwhelm it.
On Friday the Netherlands Institute for Health (RIVM) announced a record high of more than 35,000 infections in 24 hours. Infections have continued to rise despite the lockdown, which bans all public gatherings, with a record of more than 200,000 in the week through Jan. 11.
But hospitalizations declined slightly.
A poll by Hart van Nederland published on Friday found that 89% of people supported reopening stores and a majority also support reopening restaurants and cultural institutions.
More than 86% of Dutch adults are fully vaccinated and nearly 50% received a booster shot in a major campaign during the lockdown.
In the southern city of Valkenburg, restaurants opened on Friday in defiance of the rules and with support from the city's mayor, and 15 other municipalities said they would follow suit on Saturday.
Rutte said he viewed the actions as one-off protests and had talked to municipal authorities about enforcing the new rules after this weekend. 

Primary and secondary schools reopened on Jan. 10 after a longer-than-planned winter holiday, but have been plagued by frequent class dismissals due to illness or exposure of teachers or students.
On Friday the government said universities and vocational schools would also reopen and announced a shorter quarantine period after an exposure and an expansion of the use of masks.

(Reuters) - A safety panel of the European drug regulator on Friday recommended adding a rare spinal inflammation called transverse myelitis as a side effect of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine.
The European Medicines Agency's (EMA) safety committee also recommended a similar warning be included for Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s one-shot vaccine in October, and reiterated the decision on Friday.
Transverse myelitis is an inflammation of one or both sides of the spinal cord and can cause weakness in the arms or legs, sensory symptoms or problems with bladder or bowel function.
""There is currently no confirmed mechanism that has been verified by which a COVID-19 vaccine could cause the very rare event transverse myelitis,"" an AstraZeneca spokesperson said.
The EMA's committee, after reviewing data, concluded there was a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the two vaccines and transverse myelitis. 
However, it added the benefit-risk profile of both vaccines remains unchanged.
The regulatory agency did not provide any information on how many such cases were reported after the vaccination was given but said transverse myelitis has been added as an adverse reaction of unknown frequency to the product information.
AstraZeneca's vaccine has faced several setbacks, including production delays and probes by regulators following rare cases of severe side effects such as blood clots with low platelets, which led to several countries restricting or stopping its use.
Transverse myelitis was also at the heart of trial halts in the early stages of development for both AstraZeneca and J&J's shots, which are based on similar technology.

EMA also recommended updating the product information for AstraZeneca's vaccine regarding rare blood clotting with a low platelet count following the first shot, to say fewer such side effects were observed after the second dose.
Among 1,809 cases of the condition called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome reported worldwide, it said 1,643 were reported after the first dose and 166 after the second.

(Reuters) -The Ohio Supreme Court on Friday struck down the state's new congressional map for illegally favoring Republicans over Democrats and ordered new lines drawn, a decision that could have a significant impact on the battle for control of Congress in November's elections.
Electoral analysts had said the Republican-backed map would ensure the party won at least 12, and perhaps 13, of the state's 15 congressional seats, in part by splitting Cincinnati's county into multiple districts to dilute Democratic voting power there.
In a 4-3 decision, the state's high court found that the map violated new provisions in the Ohio Constitution that were approved by voters in 2018, including language that prohibits any map that ""favors or disfavors a political party or its incumbents.""
""When the dealer stacks the deck in advance, the house usually wins,"" Justice Michael Donnelly wrote for the majority. ""That perhaps explains how a party that generally musters no more than 55 percent of the statewide popular vote is positioned to reliably win anywhere from 75 percent to 80 percent of the seats in the Ohio congressional delegation.""
The court's three Democrats were joined in the majority by Chief Justice Maureen O'Connor, a Republican. Three Republican justices dissented from the decision, arguing that the court was encroaching on the authority of the state legislature.
Under U.S. law, states must redraw congressional lines every 10 years to account for changes in population. In most states, legislatures oversee the process, leading to the practice of gerrymandering, in which one party engineers political maps for partisan advantage.
There are more than a dozen pending lawsuits challenging congressional maps in several states. In North Carolina, a three-judge panel earlier this week rejected Democratic claims that the state's new congressional map illegally favored Republicans, though the plaintiffs are appealing the decision to the state Supreme Court.
Republicans need to flip only a few seats in the Nov. 8 elections to retake control of the U.S. House of Representatives, where Democrats hold a 221-212 edge including vacancies.

Two days ago the Ohio Supreme Court also invalidated Republican-drawn maps for the state legislature's two chambers, finding they, too, were unconstitutional gerrymanders.
The office of Republican Governor Mike DeWine, who approved the map, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The state's Republican legislative leaders could not immediately be reached for comment.

The New York congressman, who was the first member of the House Republican caucus to announce he would vote for impeachment, said he decided not to run again so he could enjoy time with his family. 
""My conscience, principles, and commitment to do what's right have guided every decision I've made as a member of Congress, and they guide my decision today,"" Katko said. He is in a fourth two-year term representing parts of northern New York.

Even with one of the world's highest per capita death rates, Poland has introduced much more limited measures than many European countries to curb the spread of the coronavirus during the latest wave of infections.
""The discrepancy between scientific and medical rationale and practice has become especially glaring in the context of the very limited efforts in the face of the autumn wave and then the threat of the Omicron variant, despite the enormous number of deaths expected,"" the 13 council members said in a statement to Reuters, confirming a report by the PAP state news agency.
Poland's government said it often had to deal with opposing opinions from various bodies, not just those of the advisers.
""It is the role of government to make decisions on the basis of the differing views of experts - the Medical Council, economists, experts from other areas affected by the epidemic,"" the government said in a statement.
It said the council's ways of functioning would change, without elaborating.
Poland has vaccinated 56.4% of the population, well below the level of the European Union as a whole and vaccine hesitancy is widespread, particularly in the conservative rural areas that form the government's heartland.
Enforcement of the limited restrictions in place, such as wearing masks in enclosed spaces or limits on numbers in bars and restaurants, is very lax. 
The total number of COVID-19 deaths surpassed 100,000 this week, with doctors blaming the low vaccination rate and a reluctance to follow regulations.

""We observed a growing tolerance of the behaviour of people who deny the risk posed by COVID-19 and the importance of vaccinations in the fight against the pandemic, which was also reflected in the statements of members of the government or officials,"" the resigning council members wrote.
While ministers have repeatedly called on Poles to get vaccinated, the recent refusal of the government to fire an education official who called vaccinations an ""experiment"" was widely condemned by doctors.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's deployment of tens of thousands of troops to the north, east and south of Ukraine https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/expect-worst-ukraine-hit-by-cyberattack-russia-moves-more-troops-2022-01-14 is fuelling fears in Kyiv and Western capitals that Moscow is planning a new attack. Russia denies any such plans.
Western military analysts have suggested Russia cannot keep such troops deployed where they are indefinitely for financial and logistical reasons and would need to pull them back by summer. 
Estimates of the numbers of new Russian troops moved closer to Ukraine vary from 60,000 to around 100,000, with a U.S. intelligence document suggesting that number could be ramped up to 175,000.
U.S. officials have said Russia might attack Ukraine as early as this month when the ground will be harder, making it easier for tanks and other armour to move swiftly. 
At talks this week with the United States and NATO, Russia has sought security guarantees to defuse the crisis. 
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Friday Moscow was not ready to wait forever for a response and that it wanted a detailed written response to every Russian proposal. 
But what might a Russian attack look like and what could it seek to achieve? 
""The current deployments are versatile. They keep Russia's options open and therefore keep the defender guessing,"" said Keir Giles, an Associate Fellow at Chatham House. 
Here are some possible scenarios. 
DONBASS ESCALATION
Heavily armed Russian-backed separatists have controlled a swath of eastern Ukraine since 2014 and continue to exchange fire with Ukrainian government forces despite a 2015 ceasefire that ended major hostilities. 
The conflict in Donbass has killed 15,000 people, Kyiv says. Ukraine has long accused Russia of having regular troops in the region, something Moscow denies. 
Russia has accused Kyiv of harbouring plans to retake the region by force, something Ukraine denies. 
In such a febrile atmosphere, the risk of a misunderstanding or unplanned escalation is greater, and Russia could use such an incident as a casus belli. 
A source familiar with the Russian Defence Ministry's thinking said this was the most likely scenario if Moscow decided to attack, but that he was unaware of any such decision. Kyiv might also be provoked into attacking by the separatists who could then ask Russia to send troops to help, he said. 
Russian forces could expand the fighting in Donbass to draw Ukraine into a conventional conflict, said Neil Melvin, director of International Security Studies at the RUSI think-tank in London. He said Moscow could try to seize Ukrainian coastal areas on the Sea of Azov, creating a land bridge from the Russian city of Rostov through Donbass to Crimea, adding: ""That would put the Ukrainian government under a lot of pressure.""
ASSAULT FROM CRIMEA
Russia has brought in new forces to Crimea, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014. 
Moscow could launch an attack on Ukraine from Crimea and seize territory up to the Dnieper River that could serve as a natural barrier against any Ukrainian counter-offensive, said Konrad Muzyka, director of the Poland-based Rochan consultancy. 
The operation could begin with artillery, missile and air strikes on Ukrainian units in the south, and special forces units might seize bridges and railway junctions, allowing troops and tanks to advance, he said. There are only two roads from Crimea that could be blocked or destroyed, a potential weakness, he said. 
Forces would secure control of a canal that provided Crimea with fresh water supplies until Russia annexed the region and Ukraine stopped the flow, he said. 
MULTI-FRONT ATTACK
A publicly available U.S. intelligence document said Russia could stage an invasion this month with up to 100 battalion tactical groups (BTGs) or some 175,000 troops. It said about 50 BTGs were already in place to the north and east of Ukraine and in Crimea to the south.
Seizing southern Ukraine could cut Kyiv off from the coast and NATO's presence in the Black Sea, Melvin said, and could play well with Russian nationalists who see the area as the historic ""Novorossiya"" lands or ""New Russia"". 
A multi-front assault might also involve a move into northeastern Ukraine, encircling but perhaps not entering cities where forces could get bogged down in urban fighting. Russian troops could also move into Belarus, opening a northern front for Ukraine that would put Russian forces closer to Kyiv, Giles said. 
""This of course would be the most costly economically, politically and in terms of human lives and that's probably why it's least likely,"" Melvin said of an all-out invasion. 
Military analysts said even if it overwhelmed Ukraine's army, which is half the size of its own, Russia could face guerrilla-type resistance, making it hard to hold on to captured territory. 
MISSILE STRIKES OR CYBER-ATTACK

Giles said some scenarios could involve long-range missile attacks or cyber-attacks targeting critical infrastructure. Missile attacks would take advantage of Ukraine's weaker anti-missile defences. 
""The different scenarios for how exactly Russia might seek to persuade the West to meet its (security) demands by punishing Kyiv don't even necessarily include a land incursion,"" he said.

BREST, France (Reuters) -Sweden will withdraw troops this year from a European special forces mission to the Sahel region and will review its participation in a U.N. force in Mali over the presence of private Russian military contractors, the foreign minister said.
Foreign Minister Ann Linde (NYSE:LIN) criticized Mali's military junta for trying to extend its grip on power and for hiring the Russian mercenaries.
""We have already decided that this year we will withdraw (from) the force of Takuba,"" Ann Linde told reporters on Friday on the sidelines of an EU foreign ministers meeting in western France, referring to the European task force.
""The question is what do we do with Minusma,"" she said, referring to the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali.
The Swedish parliament approved the deployment of up to 150 soldiers to Takuba in 2020 and it has some 250 military personnel as part of Minusma, which runs until 2024. 
France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Sweden's departure from Takuba in March was in line with Stockholm's commitments and had nothing to do with the arrival of mercenaries or the political situation in the country. 
A French military source said Sweden had always planned to withdraw troops after two years and that its mandate ended in March. The source said Swedish officers would remain part of the mission. 
Takuba was established as a partial successor to a French counter-terrorism operation in the West African Sahel region that French President Emmanuel Macron has started to reduce from its initial 5,000-strong force.
It comprises some 14 European countries, which provide special forces, logistical and tactical support to work alongside regional troops for targeted operations against Islamist militants.
RUSSIAN MERCENARIES
Mali's military-led interim government, which wants to extend its mandate for five years, has accused Paris of abandoning it. Citing security needs, Mali hired private military contractors from the Russian Wagner Group, whose members are mostly ex-service personnel. 
France and its allies have said Mali's use of the Wagner Group was incompatible with their military presence.
The arrival of Russian mercenaries in Mali has added to tensions between Europe and Russia amid a crisis on Ukraine's border.
French officials have said Paris will discuss with its partners how to respond operationally to the arrival of Wagner in Mali. 
Most of Takuba's operations are in the west African country.
Linde said the confirmed arrival of Wagner and the junta's efforts to stay in power were unacceptable.
""We now know (there) is the Wagner group ... and if they have a stronger impact then it will not be possible to continue with those large numbers of troops from us,"" she said, adding that the Swedish parliament would debate Sweden's operations in Mali next week.

""Of course it will have consequences.""
The European Union will impose sanctions on Mali in line with measures already taken by the ECOWAS grouping of West African states over the junta's delay in holding elections following the 2020 coup, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Thursday.

SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -North Korea fired at least two ballistic missiles on Friday, drawing both condemnation and an appeal for dialogue from a U.S. administration that has imposed new sanctions over previous North Korean missile launches and is pushing for more.
The third North Korean missile launch in less than two weeks and indignant statements by both sides raised the spectre of a return to 2017's days of ""fire and fury"" https://www.reuters.com/article/northkorea-missiles-idAFL4N1KU4QA threats before a flurry of diplomacy that stalled and slipped back into a standoff https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa-document-exclusive/exclusive-with-a-piece-of-paper-trump-called-on-kim-to-hand-over-nuclear-weapons-idUSKCN1RA2NR.
The United States condemned the latest launch, saying it posed a threat to North Korea's neighbours and the international community. But in an emailed statement a State Department spokesperson repeated calls for dialogue. 
""We remain committed to a diplomatic approach to the DPRK and call on them to engage in dialogue. Our commitment to the defence of the Republic of Korea and Japan remains ironclad,"" the statement said, referring to North Korea by the initials of its official name.
South Korea's National Security Council held an emergency meeting and expressed ""strong regret"" over the test and called on Pyongyang to return to talks. The presidential Blue House urged North Korea to respond to calls for dialogue.
South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it had detected what it presumed were two short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) launched eastward from Uiju, in North Pyongan province on North Korea's west coast, near its border with China.
Japan's coast guard said North Korea fired what could be a ballistic missile. Japanese broadcaster NHK citing an unnamed Japanese defence ministry official as saying that the landing point was in the sea outside Japan's exclusive economic zone.
Japan's chief cabinet secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told a regular news conference that the repeated ballistic missile launches were ""a threat to the safety of our nation and the region, and they are an important issue for all of international society.""
'DESTABILISING IMPACT'
The U.S. military's Indo-Pacific Command said while it assessed that the launch did not pose an immediate threat to the United States or its allies, it highlighted the ""destabilising impact of the (North's) illicit weapons program.""
South Korea's JCS said the missiles travelled about 430 km (267 miles) to a maximum altitude of 36 km (22 miles). 
It was the third time North Korea has launched ballistic missiles since New Year's day, an unusually rapid pace of such tests. The previous two launches were of ""hypersonic missiles,"" North Korean state media said, or projectiles capable of high speeds and manoeuvering after launch.
North Korea defended the missile tests as part of its legitimate right to self-defence and said the United States was intentionally escalating the situation with new sanctions, state media said on Friday, citing the foreign ministry.
The ministry said the recent development of a ""new type"" weapon was just part of efforts to modernise https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkorea-says-leader-kim-attended-successful-hypersonic-missile-test-2022-01-11 defence capabilities, and did not target any specific country or harm the security of neighbours.
The ministry statement warned of an unspecified ""stronger and certain reaction"" if the United States adopted a confrontational stance.
President Joe Biden's administration imposed its first sanctions https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-imposes-sanctions-north-koreans-russian-after-missile-tests-2022-01-12 on Wednesday over North Korea's weapons programmes following a series of missile launches since September. 
It has called on the United Nations Security Council to act https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-pushing-more-un-sanctions-north-korea-over-missiles-2022-01-13 against several North Korean individuals and entities accused of violating security council resolutions that ban North Korea's missile and nuclear weapons development.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday the United States had made clear https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/blinken-calls-north-korea-missile-tests-profoundly-destabilizing-2022-01-13 it had no hostile intent toward North Korea and was willing to engage in talks without preconditions, but the tests were ""profoundly destabilising.""

The North Korean foreign ministry said that while Washington might talk of diplomacy and dialogue, its actions showed it was still engrossed in its policy for ""isolating and stifling"" North Korea.
Duyeon Kim of the U.S.-based Center for a New American Security (CNAS) think tank said Biden should continue to penalise North Korea for its missile tests and use sanctions to curb funding for weapons programmes, but if so, ""We should expect to see more fireworks and provocations.""

197,"<span>Jan 14, 2022 11:15AM ET</span>","BERLIN (Reuters) -German health officials warned on Friday the coronavirus remained a serious threat as the Omicron variant is set to completely replace Delta in the coming days in a nation whose vaccination rates lag much of western Europe.
Omicron often leads to a milder course of disease, but any positive gains are cancelled out by there being far too many cases, senior virologist Christian Drosten said, underscoring the need for vaccinations.
Drosten said some 3 million people over the age of 60 have not yet been vaccinated and almost 9 million have not received a booster shot, which makes them vulnerable to the highly contagious variant.
""The gap in vaccinations is our greatest obstacle,"" he said.
Germany has a relatively low vaccination rate compared to other countries in western Europe: 72.5% of the population is considered fully vaccinated while 45.9% have had a booster shot.
Italy, Spain and France have are around or above the 75% mark, while Portugal and Malta have over 80% of the population fully vaccinated.
The coronavirus will have to be allowed to run its course at some point, said Drosten, as continually re-vaccinating the population was not feasible.
Health Minister Karl Lauterbach ruled out easing current coronavirus measures for now, adding that even more restrictions might become necessary if infection numbers rose dramatically or hospitals were overwhelmed.
He added that the new  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) vaccine should be available from Feb. 21.
Lothar Wieler, head of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases, said Germany would begin prioritising who could get a PCR test due to Omicron's prevalence. 
Health authorities and laboratories have warned of a testing crunch as they struggle to keep up with demand. 

Germany's daily infection number hit a third consecutive high on Friday, with 92,223 new cases reported, bringing total confirmed cases to 7.8 million. 
Austria, which also saw a one-day record this week, and the Netherlands were declared high-risk travel areas on Friday.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing a revolt by grassroots Conservative supporters who want him to resign after a series of revelations https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-pm-johnsons-office-partied-queen-mourned-death-husband-2022-01-14 about parties held at his official Downing Street residence during national coronavirus lockdowns.
From the West Midlands to Scotland, party members - who raise funds and rally voters at election time - are turning against a man many of them had admired for his exuberance, unstuffy if sometimes messy style and his championing of Brexit.
John Strafford, 80, chairman of the Campaign for Conservative Democracy, called Johnson the worst prime minister of his lifetime and said the allegations about him attending parties during the worst health crisis in a century showed him to be reckless and irresponsible.
""People are absolutely disgusted by it. It is a sign of the arrogance of the man. The reality is that Boris is a court jester who wants to be king,"" he told Reuters.
""His greatest failure is that he has no judgment, and judgment is the most important quality for any politician."" 
Johnson was once the darling of the party's grassroots members who helped secure him a landslide victory in a 2019 election, allowing him to deliver on promises to finally steer Britain out of the European Union. They also applauded last year's rapid rollout of COVID-19 vaccines under his leadership.
'DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED'
But the relationship is rapidly souring under the impact of a steady stream of revelations about Downing Street's apparent flouting of strict lockdown rules.
In the latest twist, one guaranteed to upset Conservative supporters, Johnson's office on Friday had to apologise to Queen Elizabeth after it emerged that staff had partied in Downing Street on the eve of Prince Philip's funeral last year, at a time when mixing indoors was banned.
Johnson himself was not present at those parties. However, he apologised to parliament on Wednesday for joining a gathering in the Downing Street garden on May 20, 2020, when Britain was under a strict lockdown.
While grassroots Conservative members cannot oust a leader, their views influence lawmakers and they do vote on which of the final two candidates wins the party's top job in a leadership election. 
A senior government official, Sue Gray, is currently investigating the claims about parties held in government buildings during the lockdowns. Her report is expected in the next few weeks.
Johnson's supporters hope the report will stop short of saying whether he knowingly broke any rules or should resign.
But Strafford said that regardless of the report's findings many rank-and-file members had already made up their minds.
He said his group of Conservatives passed a symbolic vote of no-confidence in Johnson last month - before the latest damaging revelations - and his WhatsApp was inundated with messages from party members saying they no longer support the prime minister.
""The only reason they are not resigning their membership is because they want to vote in the leadership election, which is now inevitable,"" added Strafford.
Pressure among party loyalists is building nationwide.
In the Conservative stronghold of Sutton Coldfield in the West Midlands, the local party association passed a motion on Thursday calling for Johnson to stand down.
Scottish Conservatives have also broken ranks, with their leader Douglas Ross publicly saying Johnson must resign.
Ed Costelloe, chair of the group Conservative Grassroots, which backed him in 2019, said the party needed to force him out or face a humiliating defeat at the next national election, due by 2024.

""I am deeply disappointed, it is sad for the party, sad for the country, but the situation is diabolical,"" Costelloe said.
""His chaotic personal style is such that he can't carry on. We need a fresh start.""

If the election were held today, Lula would win 41% of votes against 24% for Bolsonaro, according to the survey by polling firm Ideia, published late on Thursday by business weekly Exame.
In the previous poll last month, 37% of those surveyed said they would vote for Lula and 27% for Bolsonaro. Neither politician has formally declared his candidacy in what is expected to be a highly polarized race.
Lula, who governed Brazil from 2003 to 2010 and was later jailed on corruption charges that were eventually overturned, would defeat Bolsonaro or any other candidate in a second-round vote, the Ideia poll showed.
Another poll published on Friday by broker XP (NASDAQ:XP) Investimentos confirmed Lula's clear lead, with voter support at 44% for Lula and 24% for Bolsonaro. That survey by polling firm IPESPE showed Lula pulling ahead in a runoff, with a 25-point advantage (56% versus 31%).
Lula has gained significant ground in regions where Bolsonaro was stronger, including southern and midwestern Brazil, when respondents were asked in an unprompted survey of whom they would vote for without a list of names, Ideia director Mauricio Moura said.
More than half the electorate view Bolsonaro's government negatively, while less than an quarter see it as good or great, Moura said.
Former judge Sergio Moro, who quit as Bolsonaro's justice minister in 2020 and is preparing to run for president on an anti-corruption platform, has strengthened his place as the third candidate, with 11% support, the poll showed.
Center-right Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria trails in fifth place with just 4%, behind leftist former Ceara Governor Ciro Gomes, with 7%.

Still, a third candidacy rivaling Lula and Bolsonaro remains ""embryonic,"" Moura said, with Moro, Gomes and Doria together gathering less than 10% of the vote in an unprompted survey.
Ideia surveyed 1,500 voters by telephone on Jan. 9-13. The poll has a margin of error of 3 percentage points up or down.

ROME (Reuters) - Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is galvanising his media empire behind his campaign to become Italy's president this month, a move reviving dormant but unresolved concerns about conflict of interest.
The 85-year-old billionaire media tycoon, who served four terms as premier, is the formal candidate of Italy's centre-right alliance and controls three national television channels, a daily newspaper and several magazines.
Many commentators say Berlusconi's background - he was convicted of tax fraud and held ""bunga bunga"" sex parties - make him a far from ideal candidate, and on paper he lacks the broad parliamentary backing required.
Yet, shrugging off these concerns and recent chronic health problems, Berlusconi has launched a media campaign reminiscent of those that helped him win three national elections.
Voting among more than 1,000 parliamentarians and regional delegates begins on Jan. 24 and he is trying to win the backing of scores of unaffiliated deputies and senators who could potentially get him into the presidential palace.
Even though he does not need the votes of the Italian public, Berlusconi hopes that creating a groundswell of public opinion behind his candidacy could help convince lawmakers to back him.
""He wants to build momentum, it's not strictly needed but he clearly thinks it can be useful,"" said Daniele Albertazzi, a politics professor at Britain's Surrey University who has closely followed Berlusconi's career.
For weeks, Berlusconi's Mediaset (OTC:MDIUY) television channels have been promoting his presidential ambitions, highlighting his qualities and achievements and ignoring blemishes such as an ongoing trial for allegedly bribing witnesses in a legal case, in which he denies the charges.
On Thursday, his family-owned newspaper Il Giornale ran a full-page advertisement entitled ""Who is Silvio Berlusconi ... who better than him?"" 
It featured a decades-old photo of the former premier and a list of 22 of his characteristics and supposed accomplishments.
The qualities include being ""a good and generous person,"" ""a friend of everyone, enemy of no one,"" and ""a self-made man, an example for all Italians.""
One of his listed achievements is ""ending the Cold War"". Others, though factually inaccurate, include ""founding commercial television in Europe"" and being president of ""the club that has won most in the history of world football"".
CONFLICT OF INTEREST DEBATE
Since entering politics in 1994, Berlusconi has been accused of using his media to promote his political fortunes and using his political power to defend his media interests.
However, when it was in power, the centre-left did not change the law to address the problem, possibly fearful of a fierce reaction from Berlusconi's business empire.
Modest legislation on conflict of interest was approved by Berlusconi himself in 2004. Though this was widely deemed inadequate, it has never been toughened.

""Everyone thought Berlusconi was out of the picture after 2011 and so the conflict of interest debate just faded away,"" said pollster and political analyst Lorenzo Pregliasco.
""That is quite typical of the way Italian politics works, only considering an issue when there is an immediate visible emergency.""

(Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors appear to have proceeded carefully in bringing sedition charges against 11 people linked to a far-right militia who took part in the deadly 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol and are likely to obtain convictions, legal experts said.
An indictment https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1462481/download was released on Thursday against the founder of Oath Keepers, Stewart Rhodes https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-arrests-far-right-militia-group-oath-keepers-leader-jan-6-probe-nyt-2022-01-13, and 10 purported members of the group, accusing them of conspiring to forcefully oppose the transfer of power between then-President Donald Trump, a Republican, to his successor, Democrat Joe Biden.
Seditious conspiracy is defined as attempting ""to overthrow, put down or to destroy by force the government of the United States"" and the U.S. Department of Justice has been wary of lodging such a charge in part because of losing a case 12 years ago, a former government lawyer said.
The indictment for the Jan. 6 attack is ""thorough and rigorous,"" said Alan Rozenshtein, a former Justice Department national security lawyer who teaches at the University of Minnesota Law School.
""I don't think there is much the defendants can say here,"" said Rozenshtein. ""This is the textbook definition of seditious conspiracy. If this isn't seditious conspiracy what is?""
The sedition charges are the first against participants in the storming of the building by Trump supporters after he gave a fiery speech repeating his false claims that his November 2020 election defeat was the result of widespread fraud. U.S. prosecutors have brought criminal charges against at least 725 people https://amers2.apps.cp.thomsonreuters.com/web/Apps/NewsServices/mediaProxy?apiKey=6d416f26-7b24-4f31-beb6-1b5aa0f3fafb&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgraphics.reuters.com%2FJAN-CHARGES%2FJAN6-CHARGES%2Fxmpjobknrvr%2FJAN6-CHARGES.jpg linked to the riot.
The seditious conspiracy charges were filed a year and a week after the assault amid concern from some Democrats and advocates that the Justice Department had been too sparing in bringing serious criminal charges against people who stormed the building or planned for violence.
The Oath Keepers are a loosely organized group of activists who believe that the federal government is encroaching on their rights, and focus on recruiting current and former police, emergency services and military members.
'STACK' ATTACK
Members of the group moved up the Capitol steps on Jan. 6, 2021, in a military-style ""stack"" formation and wearing tactical gear, the indictment said. Nine of the 11 people named in the indictment were already facing charges.
""We aren't going through this without civil war. Too late for that. Prepare your mind, body and spirit,"" Rhodes said in a November 5, 2020, Signal message, according to prosecutors https://www.reuters.com/world/us/a-bloody-desperate-fight-us-prosecutors-release-oath-keepers-communications-2022-01-13.
They said that in December 2020 Rhodes wrote of the certification of Biden's election win scheduled for Jan. 6 that ""there is no standard political or legal way out of this.""
Amy Cooter, an expert on U.S. militia movements and a lecturer at Vanderbilt University, said: ""It's important to reserve seditious conspiracy for serious cases, and I personally think this is one.""
A failed 2010 prosecution against a Christian nationalist militia called the Hutaree gave federal prosecutors pause, said Rozenshtein.
Members of the Hutaree were charged with conspiring to kill a Michigan police officer and then ambush the officer's colleagues who would have gathered for the funeral. But the seditious conspiracy charges were dropped after a judge ruled prosecutors had failed to prove that the militia members were doing anything more than talking about their hatred for authority.
Legal experts said that high-profile outcome highlighted a common issue in seditious conspiracy cases: that the charges might encroach on the broad free speech protections afforded by the U.S. Constitution.
In September 2020, amid civil unrest, then-U.S. Attorney General William Barr urged federal prosecutors to consider filing seditious conspiracy charges against people who engaged in violence at anti-police protests. That move drew immediate pushback from civil liberties group, who said the seditious conspiracy statute should be reserved for more dire threats to U.S. democracy.
Lawyers and extremism researchers said the Justice Department appears to have carefully vetted the Oath Keepers indictment, possibly using cooperating witnesses to build a more clear-cut case of attempting to overthrow the government.

One police officer who battled rioters on Jan. 6 died the day after the attack and four who guarded the Capitol later died by suicide. Four rioters also died, including a woman who was shot by a police officer while trying to climb through a shattered window. About 140 police officers were injured during the hours-long attack.
""The government has a strong case against the Oath Keepers,"" said Joshua Braver, a professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School. Unlike the Hutaree, the Oath Keepers ""executed their real agreement to obstruct the peaceful transfer of power.""

202,"<span>Jan 14, 2022 09:23AM ET</span>","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China suspended dozens of international flights on Friday amid a global surge in Omicron cases, while the city of Shanghai curbed tourist activity as it rushed to head off local COVID-19 infections as imported cases rose.
Cities across China are becoming more vigilant against COVID-19 ahead of the Lunar New Year travel season later this month and as Beijing readies to stage the Winter Olympics beginning Feb. 4, with many local governments urging residents not to leave town unnecessarily.
Shanghai's tourism and culture authority said travel agencies and online tourism companies must once again halt organising group tours into and out of Shanghai after it reported five new domestically transmitted infections on Thursday, all linked to an arrival from overseas. 
The order, in line with a national guideline to cut tourist activities in provinces where new infections have emerged, came less than a month after Shanghai lifted a suspension that had come into effect in November.
Late on Friday, Zhuhai city in the southern Guangdong province found seven coronavirus infections during testing schemes in local areas, with the Omicron variant detected according to preliminary sequencing result, state television said, without saying exactly how many of the seven cases were Omicron. 
Earlier on Friday, Zhuhai suspended all flights to the capital Beijing city. 
China has dramatically cut back on international arrivals during the pandemic, but the number of infected travellers arriving in Shanghai, a major financial hub, during the first 10 days of January, exceeded those for all of December. 
China has reported local transmissions of the highly-contagious Omicron variant in the northern city of Tianjin and three other provinces but has not said how many Omicron cases it has detected in total.
Authorities, however, have warned that Omicron adds to the increased risk of COVID-19 transmission as more people return to China from overseas for the Lunar New Year holiday. 
China on Friday announced that 30 inbound international flights from several countries were suspended due to COVID-19 cases, including four more from the United States. So far this year, China has announced the cancellation of 74 flights from the United States.
Athletes and other personnel involved in the Olympics are arriving largely on special charter flights and immediately entering a strictly enforced ""closed loop"" that separates them from the wider population. 
Unlike some other Chinese cities, Shanghai has largely refrained from broader curbs that risk disrupting normal routines and has taken a more surgical approach. This week it raised the ""virus risk"" level only for a small bubble tea shop where three of the five local infected people worked. 
MORE QUARANTINE ROOMS
China reported a total of 143 local confirmed cases, and four domestically transmitted asymptomatic carriers for Jan. 13.
Most new cases were detected in the central province of Henan, where both the Omicron and Delta variants are spreading, and in Tianjin.
Although China's caseload remains tiny compared to outbreaks elsewhere, the country aims to stamp out local clusters as quickly as possible, an approach that has forced local governments to rapidly isolate the infected as well as their close contacts. 
This week, hundreds of thousands of people were quarantined in centralised facilities or at home in China's worst-hit cities. 

The city of Yuzhou in Henan started building another 6,000 makeshift quarantine rooms on Friday after its mayor said the more than 1,000 rooms currently available were ""still not enough"", according to state media. 
Zhengzhou, Henan's capital, is speeding up preparation for 5,000 quarantine rooms which it aims to make ready by April, a local official said this week.

""A hybrid hearing (is) set to commence on the 21st of February, 2022,"" Gambian Attorney General Dawda Jallow said. He added that Aung San Suu Kyi, who led Myanmar's defence at the first public hearings in 2019 but has since been deposed by the military, had been formally replaced as its top representative in the case.
A hybrid hearing is a procedure where some of the participants are present in person and others participate online due to COVID-19 measures.
More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar after a military-led crackdown in 2017, and were forced into squalid camps across the border in Bangladesh. U.N. investigators concluded that the military campaign had been executed with ""genocidal intent"".
An ICJ spokesperson declined to confirm dates for a new hearing had been scheduled.
In December 2019 Nobel peace prize laureate Suu Kyi, then Myanmar's civilian leader, personally attended hearings at The Hague to ask judges to dismiss the case.
She was deposed in a 2021 coup and has since been sentenced to six years in detention and faces a slew of further charges. The army takeover of the democratically elected government led to widespread protests. [L1N2TQ09N]
The military government has been fighting for international recognition and could be eager for the opportunity to show themselves as Myanmar's legitimate representatives at the U.N.'s top court. 

Sources close to the case say the junta has been engaging with the court to submit court-ordered reports every six months on the situation with the Rohingya. The reports are not public.
The next step in ICJ proceedings is Myanmar's challenge to the jurisdiction of the court. The question if genocide was committed in Myanmar will be dealt with in later hearings.

ANKARA/MOSCOW (Reuters) -Turkey and Armenia on Friday said a first round of talks in more than ten years was ""positive and constructive,"" raising the prospect that ties could be restored and borders reopened after decades of animosity.
Turkey has had no diplomatic or commercial ties with its eastern neighbour since the 1990s. The talks in Moscow were the first attempt to restore links since a 2009 peace accord. That deal was never ratified and relations have remained tense. 
The Turkish and Armenian foreign ministries said on Friday the talks were held in a ""positive and constructive"" atmosphere, adding both sides were committed to a full normalisation without any pre-conditions. They said special envoys had ""exchanged their preliminary views regarding the normalisation process"". 
The neighbours are at odds over several issues, primarily the 1.5 million people Armenia says were killed in 1915. 
Armenia says the 1915 killings constitute a genocide, a position supported by the United States and some others. Turkey accepts that many Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire were killed in clashes with Ottoman forces during World War One, but contests the figures and denies killings were systematic or constitute genocide.
Tensions again flared during a 2020 war over the Nagorno-Karabakh territory. Turkey accused ethnic Armenian forces of occupying land belonging to Azerbaijan. Turkey has since called for a rapprochement, as it seeks greater influence in the region.
In separate but similarly worded statements, the foreign ministries said a date and location for the next round of talks would be finalised later.
Turkish diplomatic sources said the discussions between the delegations lasted for about 1.5 hours.
Russia's TASS news agency cited Armenia's foreign ministry as saying on Thursday it expected the talks to lead to the establishment of diplomatic relations and opening of frontiers closed since 1993.
Thomas de Waal, a senior fellow with Carnegie Europe, said in November opening borders and renovating railways to Turkey would have economic benefits for Armenia, as the routes could be used by traders from Turkey, Russia, Armenia, Iran and Azerbaijan.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said last year the two countries would also start charter flights between Istanbul and Armenia's capital Yerevan under the rapprochement, but that Turkey would coordinate all steps with Azerbaijan. 
The flights are set to begin in early February.
Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday Armenia needed to form good ties with Azerbaijan for the normalisation effort to yield results.
NO EASY BREAKTHROUGH
Despite strong backing for normalisation from the United States, which hosts a large Armenian diaspora and angered Turkey last year by calling the 1915 killings a genocide, analysts have said the talks would be complicated.
Emre Peker, a London-based director at Eurasia Group, said a cautious approach focusing on quick deliverables was expected on both sides due to the old sensitivities, adding the role of Russia, which brokered the Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire and is the dominant actor in the region, would be key.

Cavusoglu has also said Russia contributed to the process of appointing the special envoys.
""The bigger challenge will come from the question of historic reconciliation,"" Peker said, adding that the fate of talks would depend on ""Ankara's recognition that it must right-size its ambitions.""

Hindus believe a bathe in the holy river on the Jan. 14 Makarsankranti festival washes away sins.
A large number of devotees were taking a dip in the sacred river where it flows through the eastern state of West Bengal, which is reporting the most number of cases in the country after Maharashtra state in the west.
In the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, thousands of devotees, few wearing masks, thronged the river's banks in the holy city of Prayagraj.
""I can't breathe with a mask,"" Ram Phal Tripathi, who came with his family from a village in Uttar Pradesh state, said after emerging from the river.
""Every year I come for a holy dip. How could I have missed it this year?""
India is again facing a surge in coronavirus cases, fuelled mostly by the highly transmissible Omicron variant, but hospitalisations are low, with most people recovering at home.
Doctors had appealed unsuccessfully to the West Bengal state high court to reverse a decision to allow the festival this year, worrying it will become a virus ""super spreader"" event.
Last year, a big religious gathering in northern India contributed to a record rise in coronavirus cases.

On Friday, the health ministry reported 264,202 new cases of the coronavirus in the previous 24 hours, taking India's total tally to 36.58 million.
Deaths from COVID-19 rose by 315, with total now at 485,350, the ministry said.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian rebel and opposition groups said Germany's conviction of a former Syrian intelligence officer for crimes against humanity this week was welcome but was only a step towards holding to account President Bashar al-Assad and his top aides.
The conviction nL1N2TT0MJ of Anwar Raslan, who defected to Syria's opposition in 2012 before securing asylum in Germany, marked a landmark ruling related to state-backed torture committed during Syria's decade-long civil war.
But opponents of Syria's government said cases against lower ranking officers should not distract from more senior targets.
""We welcome the justice of the German court ... but we also warn against the selective justice that pursues small killers and fugitive criminals from the network of terror and authoritarianism,"" said Mustafa Sejari, a rebel commander and former detainee.
""Justice begins by holding and pursuing Assad and his top henchmen, aides and supporters of his crimes,"" said Sejari, head of the political bureau of the Syrian Front for Liberation, a mainstream rebel group operating in the last rebel enclave.
Raslan, 58, was convicted on 27 out of 58 counts of murder, rape and sexual assault carried out at a Damascus prison run by a unit of the security services he led. He denied the charges.
Syria's Information Ministry did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on the Raslan case that was sent during the Syrian weekend, which starts on Friday. There was no immediate sign of any official reaction in Syrian media.
The Assad government routinely denies torturing prisoners and says its forces have been waging a fight against rebels and Islamists who it accuses of terrorising the population.
'VICTORY' FOR ACCOUNTABILITY
Fadel Abdul Ghany, head of the Syrian Network for Human Rights, which helped prosecutors and compiles casualty lists, said the conviction showed ""these are crimes of a systematic widespread nature that cannot be carried out by individuals without being a central policy of the Syrian regime"".
Mohamad Sabra, a former opposition negotiator, wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR): ""It's a victory for the principle of accountability and a small step ... on the path of holding to account all perpetrators of war crimes and violators of human rights in Syria.""
Syria's conflict began with protests against Assad's regime in 2011, when uprisings flared across the Middle East against authoritarian leaders. It swiftly descended into all-out war.
Assad has now regained control of much of the territory initially lost to rebel and Islamist fighters, helped by Syria's ally Russia. Rebels still hold out in a small, northern area.
Millions of people have been displaced in the war, tens of thousands have died and cities and towns have been devastated.
Raslan's trial was held under Germany's universal jurisdiction laws, which allow courts to prosecute crimes against humanity committed anywhere in the world.
""The verdict will not heal the wounds in the heart of a mother who lost her son under torture or ease suffering endured by a detainee but it's a chance to renew the hope the Syrian regime will fall,"" said Omar al Shughri, an activist for detainees with the Syrian Organisation for Emergencies.

Raed Al Saleh, head of the opposition-run Syrian civil defence service known as the White Helmets, said the trial would have had more impact if it could have been held in Syria.
""The trial was under international jurisdiction but what about the tens of thousands who disappeared in Assad's prisons and who were tortured every day,"" he added.

""As prime minister and peace prize laureate Abiy Ahmed has a special responsibility to end the conflict and contribute to making peace."" .
The government has previously denied targeting civilians in the 14-month-old conflict, which pits Abiy's federal forces and their regional allies, backed by Eritrea, against rebellious forces of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).
Billene Seyoum, Abiy's spokesperson, said Abiy had taken up the responsibility of stopping the TPLF, which parliament had designated as a terrorist group.
""The Prime Minister has indeed taken up this ""special responsibility"" of ending the conflict waged on the State by TPLF and has been engaged in putting an end not only to the past year's conflict but the destabilising activities of the TPLF,"" she told Reuters. 

Abiy won the Nobel Prize https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nobel-prize-peace-idUSKBN1WQ12I a year after taking office for resolving two decades of hostility with neighbouring Eritrea - also an archenemy of the TPLF, which dominated Ethiopia's government until Abiy came to power.

The study, by the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) in the Western Cape region, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, concluded.compared about 11,600 patients from the first three COVID-19 waves with about 5,100 from the Omicron-driven wave that began in November.
Omicron globally has tended to cause less severe disease, and proportionally fewer hospital admissions and deaths, than previous variants. 
Scientists are trying to determine the extent to which this is because of higher immunity rates engendered by vaccination or past illness, or Omicron is intrinsically less nasty.

The study concluded that about a quarter of the reduced risk of severe disease with Omicron was attributable to characteristics of the virus itself.
""In the Omicron-driven wave, severe COVID-19 outcomes were reduced mostly due to protection conferred by prior infection and/or vaccination, but intrinsically reduced virulence may account for an approximately 25% reduced risk of severe hospitalisation or death compared to Delta,"" the study said.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) -A Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine booster shot is 85% effective in protecting against being hospitalised by the Omicron variant for 1-2 months after it is received, the head of South Africa's Medical Research Council (SAMRC) said on Friday.
Glenda Gray presented the findings of a SAMRC study at a South African health ministry briefing on the COVID-19 fourth wave, which has been driven by the new variant.
""We saw an 85% vaccine effectiveness and we saw that this kind of vaccine effectiveness is maintained for up to two months,"" she said. ""We are very happy to report very high levels of vaccine effectiveness against Omicron.""
The study involved 477,234 healthcare workers, all of them vaccinated with the J&J (NYSE:JNJ) shot, of whom 236,000 -- roughly half -- had received the J&J booster shot.
It looked at hospitalisations among those healthcare workers who had been infected during the fourth wave, and found that the booster shot reduced hospitalisations by 63% in the first two weeks after the booster, going up to 85% after that for between one and two months.
""This is the world's first evidence of vaccine effectiveness (against Omicron) using the J&J vaccine,"" Gray said.
The South African authorities have thus far maintained a preference for the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) vaccine -- they have administered 21 million doses, three times as many as the roughly 7 million J&J vaccine doses.
But the J&J shot is considered logistically much more preferable because it is a single dose regimen, which is easier to administer in remote rural areas, where follow ups can be difficult.
The data supported already strong global evidence that Omicron can evade vaccine protection when it comes to the initial infection.
Among the participants in the study, there were about 30,000 breakthrough infections during the Omicron wave, compared with only around 11,000 each in the previous waves driven by the Delta and Beta variants.
The study also highlighted that those infected with HIV were more vulnerable to being hospitalised with Omicron.
""They (those being hospitalised) are more likely to have HIV and less likely to have other comorbidities as compared to the Beta and Delta period,"" Gray said. 

HIV prevalence in South Africa is about 13%.
A separate study by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases of South Africa (NICD) on Friday suggested that Omicron may be cause less severe disease than previous variants, even among unvaccinated people.

ZUOYING, Taiwan (Reuters) - A chill wind whips across the Taiwan Strait as a small group of Taiwanese marines stands shivering on a remote dock in the early hours of the morning, their shorts and thin jackets drenched after a day spent mostly in the sea.
""Are you a sleeping beauty? Are you skipping out on class?"" a trainer shouts at the wiry men, who have barely slept in days, as they do sit-ups and other exercises on the rough concrete floor, some fading in and out of consciousness from fatigue. 
Blasts of cold water from a hose brings them to their senses.
Entry into the Taiwan navy's elite Amphibious Reconnaissance and Patrol unit or ARP, its answer to the U.S. Navy SEALs or Britain's Special Boat Service, is not for the faint of heart. 
(Open https://reut.rs/3fjJ2d7 to see a picture package on recruiting for Taiwan's elite navy unit) 
In the event of war with China, which claims the democratic island as its own and has stepped up its military and political pressure against Taiwan, ARP frogmen could find themselves spirited across the strait in small boats under cover of night to scout enemy locations and call in attacks.
Of the group of 31 who started the 10 week course, only 15 finished, with the closing week at the sprawling Zuoying navy base in southern Taiwan the last test, which Reuters was given rare access to witness.
""I'm not scared of death,"" Fu Yu, 30, said after completing the ""road to heaven"", a final obstacle course consisting of a stretch of rocks some 100 metres long over which they have to scramble on their bellies and do tasks like push ups to the satisfaction of their trainers.
""It's a soldier's responsibility, what we must do,"" added Fu, who had previously tried and failed to complete the course. 
Over six days and five nights, the volunteers to enter the ARP have to endure everything from long marches to hours in the water, with constant screaming by their instructors.
A lot of their time is spent in the sea or swimming pools, learning how to hold their breath for extended periods of time, swimming in full combat gear and infiltrating beaches from the sea.
Every six hours they have a one-hour break. In that time they have to eat - scarfing down bulbs of garlic to boost their immune systems - get medical attention, go to the toilet and sleep. 
They may only end up with five minutes of sleep, huddled together on the floor under light green blankets, awoken with shrill whistle blasts.
The aim is to give the soldiers an iron will to complete their mission no matter how difficult, and create steadfast loyalty to their comrades and the military.
The candidates are all volunteers, driven to join the special forces out of a mixture of patriotism and a desire to push their personal limits.
Wu Yu-wei, 26, said he considered it a ""personal challenge"" to complete the course.
""The hardest part was the timing, not being able to rest, having only 15 minutes to use the toilet, have a gulp of water, before moving on to the next section,"" he said. 
""The first few days are exhausting, and then you get used to it. You have to rely on your willpower and determination.""
Once across the ""road to heaven"" finish line, and congratulated by Marine Corps commander Wang Jui-lin, the stress of the past week is too much for some of the marines, who burst into tears in the arms of proud family members invited to see them graduate.

The trainers, all graduates of the same course, say the intention of the week of hell is not cruelty but to simulate the hardship of war, like extreme sleep deprivation, to see who has the stamina and guts to make it.
""Of course, we absolutely won't force anyone, everyone is here voluntarily. That's why we are so severe with them and also eliminate them strictly,"" said trainer Chen Shou-lih, 26. ""We won't just wave you through only because you wanted to come.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Hong Kong authorities said on Friday the city's airport will suspend for a month transit flights from around 150 countries and territories considered high risk because of the coronavirus, deepening the global financial hub's isolation.
Separately, the territory's leader Carrie Lam said restrictions on social life will be extended through the Lunar New Year holiday at the start of February, traditionally a time for shopping, feasting and family reunions.
""I know this will let a lot of people down,"" Lam told reporters. ""Covid is not yet under control.""
To help businesses survive the restrictions, Lam said the government would deliver economic relief measures worth HK$3.57 billion ($459 million), targetted at the establishments asked to close.
Fifteen types of venues, including bars and clubs, cinemas, gyms and beauty salons will remain closed for another two weeks after their current order to shutter expires next Thursday. Dining in restaurants will also remain banned after 6.00 pm.
Primary schools and kindergartens also remain shuttered.
Lam said if there were no further outbreaks, restrictions would be gradually lifted after the holidays.
The moves come as the city has seen dozens of cases of the fast-spreading Omicron variant since the end of last year.
Prior to the outbreak, which authorities said could be traced back to two aircrew of Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY), the city had had no local transmissions for over three months.
Hong Kong International Airport said in a statement on Friday that any persons who have stayed in places classified as high risk by health authorities in the 21 days before travelling cannot transit through the city from Jan. 16 until Feb. 15.
The measure was taken ""in order to control the spread of the highly infectious Omicron variant,"" it said.
Hong Kong currently classifies more than 150 countries and territories as high risk.
Last week, it banned incoming flights from Australia, Canada, France, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Britain and the United States, including interchanges. That ban remains in place, Lam said.
While its cases are very low by global standards, the Chinese-ruled city has followed mainland China's policy in adopting a zero-tolerance approach towards local COVID-19 infections even as much of the world shifts towards living with the coronavirus.
The policy has increasingly isolated the city, which is highly dependant on imports, tourism and business travel, and is frustrating residents https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/frustration-over-covid-19-restrictions-increasingly-isolated-hong-kong-2022-01-14 accustomed to organising their life to spend as much time as possible outside notoriously tiny flats.
Tighter aircrew quarantine restrictions have severely cut cargo flights and curtailed the city's position as one of the world's busiest passenger hubs. Hong Kong is soon expected to face a shortage of goods and higher prices, authorities said.
Hong Kong’s Association of Freight Forwarding & Logistics Chairman Gary Lau said logistics costs would rise 40% in coming weeks, with premium food, fresh produce, pharmaceuticals and e-commerce goods the hardest hit.

Most of the COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong are imported and detected during regular testing in hotel quarantine. All 300-plus patients in the city's hospitals have mild or no symptoms, health officials said.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Sweden's military said on Thursday it was ramping up its visible activities on the Baltic Sea island of Gotland amid increased tensions between NATO and Russia and a recent deployment of Russian landing craft in the Baltic.
Moscow has spooked the West by massing troops near Ukraine, sparking fears that it is considering invading. Moscow denies any such plans, saying it can deploy forces on its territory however it chooses.
Gotland, Sweden's biggest island, is strategically important and lies around 330 kilometres (205 miles) from Kaliningrad, the headquarters of Russia's Baltic Fleet. In 2019 Sweden deployed an updated ground-to-air missile defence system on the island.
Lieutenant General Michael Claesson, Chief of Joint Operations at the Armed Forces, told Reuters that from Thursday troops were patrolling the harbour and airport of Visby, Gotland's main town. 
Sweden is not a NATO member but has close ties to the Atlantic alliance and has been beefing up its armed forces after decades of neglect amid increased anxiety over Russian sabre-rattling in the Baltic Sea region. 
Claesson said the Gotland move was triggered by Russian landing ships entering the Baltic Sea this week and followed years of deteriorating security conditions, including in Sweden's immediate geographic vicinity. 
""Recent security developments and tensions at security policy level have not changed that picture but rather reinforce it,"" he said, adding that the armed forces had recently noted an expansion of foreign offensive capability near Sweden.
""... Russian landing ships are an example of such offensive capability,"" he said. ""They have passed through (Denmark's) Great Belt strait and continued into the Baltic Sea.""

Claesson said the armed forces were also taking action in other parts of Sweden in response to recent Russian moves but declined further comment.
Sweden's top military commander said last week that Sweden's security strategy would be entirely undermined if NATO agreed to refrain from expanding further and to curb some of its activity in Europe, as Russia has demanded.

KYIV (Reuters) -A massive cyberattack warning Ukrainians to ""be afraid and expect the worst"" hit government websites late on Thursday, leaving some websites inaccessible on Friday morning and prompting Kyiv to open an investigation. 
Ukraine's foreign ministry spokesperson told Reuters it was too early to say who could be behind the attack but said Russia had been behind similar strikes in the past. 
The cyberattack, which hit the foreign ministry, the cabinet of ministers and the security and defence council among others, comes as Kyiv and its allies have sounded the alarm about a possible new Russian military offensive against Ukraine.
""It's too early to draw conclusions, but there is a long record of Russian (cyber) assaults against Ukraine in the past,"" the foreign ministry spokesman told Reuters. 
The Russian foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Russia has previously denied being behind cyber attacks on Ukraine. 
""Ukrainian! All your personal data was uploaded to the public network. All data on the computer is destroyed, it is impossible to restore it,"" said a message visible on the hacked government websites, written in Ukrainian, Russian and Polish. 
""All information about you has become public, be afraid and expect the worst. This is for your past, present and future.""
RISING TENSIONS
Following a flurry of inconclusive talks this week over security in Europe, the United States warned on Thursday that the threat of a Russian military invasion of Ukraine was high.
Russia said dialogue was continuing but was hitting a dead end as it tried to persuade the West to bar Ukraine from joining NATO and roll back decades of alliance expansion in Europe - demands that Washington has called ""non-starters"".
Commenting on the cyberattack, a top Ukrainian security official told Reuters: ""All subjects of cyber security were aware of such possible provocations by the Russian Federation. Therefore the response to these incidents is carried out as usual.""
The government later said it had restored most of the affected sites and that no personal data had been stolen. A number of other government websites have been suspended to prevent the attack from spreading, it said.
Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed after Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the outbreak of war between Kyiv's forces and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine that same year. 
The United States said on Thursday Russia might be trying to create a pretext to launch a new military assault on Ukraine, comparing the situation to the circumstances in 2014. 
Russia warned of possible ""catastrophic consequences"" if there was no agreement on what the Kremlin has termed security red lines but said Moscow had not given up on diplomacy and would even accelerate it.
The Russian comments reflect a pattern of Moscow saying it wants to pursue diplomacy but rejecting calls to reverse its troop build-up near Ukraine and warning of unspecified consequences for Western security if its demands go unheeded.
Ukraine has suffered a series of cyber attacks since 2014, which have knocked out power supplies, frozen supermarket tills, and forced the authorities to prop up the hryvnia currency after banks' IT systems crashed.
Ukraine believes the attacks are part of what it calls Russia's ""hybrid war"" against Ukraine and its allies.

In 2017, a virus called NotPetya by some experts, hit Ukraine and spread around the world, paralysing thousands of machines as it spread to dozens of countries. 
The Kremlin denied any involvement, rejecting ""unfounded blanket accusations"".

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's domestic spy service MI5 has warned lawmakers that the Chinese Communist Party has been employing a woman to exert improper influence over members of parliament.
MI5 sent out an alert and picture of the woman named Christine Lee on Thursday alleging she was ""involved in political interference activities"" in the United Kingdom on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party. 
Speaker Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) Hoyle, who circulated MI5's alert to lawmakers, said MI5 had found that Lee ""has facilitated financial donations to serving and aspiring parliamentarians on behalf of foreign nationals based in Hong Kong and China"". 
Hoyle said Lee had been involved with the now disbanded all-party parliamentary group, Chinese in Britain.
Britain’s interior minister Priti Patel told reporters that Lee’s behaviour was currently below the criminal threshold to prosecute her, but she said that by putting the alert out the government was able to warn lawmakers about Lee's attempts to improperly influence them.
Patel said it was ""deeply concerning"" that an individual working on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party had targeted lawmakers.
Lee is the founder of a law firm, which has offices in London and Birmingham, according to a government official. A woman who answered the phone at the Birmingham office said: ""We are not taking any calls now"". A request for comment left at the London office went unanswered.
The law firm lists on its website one of its roles as legal adviser to the Chinese embassy in Britain.
The Chinese embassy in London said in a statement that China does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. 
""We have no need and never seek to 'buy influence' in any foreign parliament,"" it said. ""We firmly oppose the trick of smearing and intimidation against the Chinese community in the UK.""
POLITICAL DONATIONS
Barry Gardiner, a lawmaker for the opposition Labour Party, said he had received hundreds of thousands of pounds in donations from Lee and said he has been liaising with intelligence services ""for a number of years"" about her.
""They have always known, and been made fully aware by me, of her engagement with my office and the donations she made to fund researchers in my office in the past,"" Gardiner said.
Gardiner employed Lee's son as a diary manager but he resigned on Thursday.
Iain Duncan Smith, a former leader of Britain's governing Conservative Party who has been sanctioned by China for highlighting alleged human right abuses in Xinjiang, called for an urgent update from the government on the issue.
He questioned why the woman had not been deported and called for a tightening of the accreditation process for people gaining access to parliament, which he said was too lenient.
Lee is listed under the Christine Lee & Co law firm as a British national in financial filings with Companies House, Britain's corporate registry.
Former defence minister Tobias Ellwood told parliament of her alleged activity: ""This is the sort of grey-zone interference we now anticipate and expect from China.""
Britain's relations with China have deteriorated in recent years over issues including Hong Kong and Xinjiang.
Last year MI5 urged British citizens to treat the threat of spying from Russia, China and Iran with as much vigilance as terrorism.
British spies say China and Russia have each sought to steal commercially sensitive data and intellectual property as well as to interfere in domestic politics and sow misinformation.

The Chinese ambassador to Britain was banned from attending an event in the British parliament last year because Beijing imposed sanctions on lawmakers who highlighted alleged human right abuses in Xinjiang.
China placed the sanctions on nine British politicians in March last year for spreading what it said were ""lies and disinformation"" over the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in the country's far west.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Poorer nations last month rejected more than 100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines distributed by the global programme COVAX, mainly because of a rapidly approaching expiry date, a UNICEF official said on Thursday.
The big figure shows the difficulties of vaccinating the world's population, despite growing supplies of shots, with COVAX getting closer to delivering 1 billion doses to nearly 150 countries. 
""More than a 100 million have been rejected just in December alone,"" Etleva Kadilli, director of the supply division at the U.N. agency, told lawmakers at the European Parliament, adding that the main reason for rejection was their short shelf life. 
Later in the day a spokesperson for the U.N. children's agency said that of the 100 million doses rejected, 15.5 million were deemed to have been destroyed. Some doses were rejected by multiple countries.
UNICEF did not reply to a query on the total of rejected doses so far, in addition to those rejected in December.
Wealthy countries donating vaccines with a relatively short shelf life has been a ""major problem"" for COVAX, a senior official of the World Health Organization said last month.
Poorer nations have also been forced to delay supplies because they have insufficient storage facilities, Kadilli said, including a lack of fridges for vaccines - for which COVAX investments have been delayed for months. 
Many countries also face high levels of vaccine hesitancy and have overburdened healthcare systems. 
By the end of 2021 the EU had made available to poorer nations 380 million doses, of which only 255 million have been delivered, the European Commission has said.
Many other doses are stored for use in poorer nations.
UNICEF data shows 681 million shipped doses are now stored in about 90 poorer nations, says CARE, a charity, which extracted the figures from a public database.
More than 30 poorer nations, including big states such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria, have used fewer than half of the doses they received, CARE said.
A spokesperson for Gavi, a vaccine alliance which co-manages COVAX, said the high storage level was because of a surge in deliveries in the last quarter, especially in December.
Gavi added that most vaccines recently shipped by COVAX had a long shelf life, and so were unlikely to be wasted.
MORE SHIPMENTS
COVAX, which is co-led by the WHO, has delivered 987 million COVID-19 vaccines to 144 countries, Gavi data shows.
COVAX is the main supplier to dozens of poorer nations, but not the only one, as some countries buy doses on their own or use other regional programmes.
Supplies to poorer nations have long been very limited because of lack of vaccines, as wealthier countries secured most of the doses initially available from December 2020.
But shipments have increased exponentially in the last quarter, thanks to donations from rich countries that have vaccinated the majority of their populations.
In January, 67% of the population in richer nations had been fully vaccinated, whereas only 8% in poorer nations have received their first dose, WHO figures show.
Increased supply caught many recipients unprepared. 
""We have countries that are pushing doses that are currently available towards quarter two of 2022,"" Kadilli said.
Of the 15 million doses from the EU that have been refused, three-quarters were AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) shots with a shelf life of less than 10 weeks upon arrival, according to a UNICEF slide.

""You want to have adequate time to move vaccines from depots,"" said Kenya's health ministry spokesperson Mburugu Gikunda said, adding that doses near expiry would go to waste if accepted. 
Reuters reported in December that up to one million vaccines were estimated to have expired in Nigeria the previous month without being used.

(Reuters) - California Governor Gavin Newsom said on Thursday he has denied parole to Sirhan Sirhan, the Palestinian refugee serving a life prison sentence for assassinating U.S. presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy in 1968.
Newsom made the announcement after a California review board in August recommended Sirhan be released from prison, subject to review by the board's legal staff and by the governor himself. Sirhan had previously been denied parole 15 times. 
Outlining his decision in an opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times, Newsom said he disagreed with the Board of Parole Hearings finding that Sirhan, 77, was suitable for parole. 
""After carefully reviewing the case, including records in the California State Archives, I have determined that Sirhan has not developed the accountability and insight required to support his safe release into the community,"" Newsom wrote.
Sirhan's lawyer, Angela Berry, suggested in a written statement issued in response that Newsom had bowed to political considerations in denying her client parole.
""While I appreciate that the release of Mr Sirhan presents Governor Newsom with a challenging political calculation, the legal decision for his release is clear and straight-forward. We are confident that the judicial review of the governor’s decision will show that the governor got it wrong,"" Berry said.
Sirhan was convicted of gunning down Kennedy, 42, in the kitchen pantry of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 5, 1968.
The shooting occurred minutes after the U.S. senator and former U.S. attorney general gave his victory speech after winning the California Democratic presidential primary. Kennedy died the next day. Kennedy's older brother, President John F. Kennedy, was assassinated in Dallas in 1963.
Sirhan has said he had no recollection of the killing of Robert Kennedy, although he has also said he fired at Kennedy because he was enraged by his support for Israel. 
Kennedy's widow, Ethel Kennedy, 93, and six of her children with whom she sided in opposing parole for Sirhan, said in a joint statement on Thursday they were ""deeply relieved"" by Newsom's decision.
Sirhan ""continues to deflect blame for his crime through 16 parole hearings,"" insisted in his latest hearing that his role in the assassination was unsettled, and ""remains a danger to public safety,"" they wrote.
The statement was issued on behalf of former U.S. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II, five of his siblings - Courtney, Kerry, Christopher, Maxwell and Rory Kennedy - and their mother.
Two other of Robert and Ethel Kennedy's nine surviving children - Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Douglas Kennedy - were reported by the Los Angeles Times to have supported parole for Sirhan.

Newsom pointed to what he called Sirhan's ""shifting narrative"" over the killing and his refusal to take responsibility for it as proof he was ineligible for release. 
Sirhan was sentenced to death in 1969, but his sentence was commuted to life in prison after California banned the death penalty.

SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korea fired at least two ballistic missiles on Friday, the third test in two weeks, just hours after criticising a U.S. push for new sanctions over the previous launches as a ""provocation"" and warning of a strong reaction. 
South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it had detected what it presumed were two short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs)launched eastward from North Pyongan Province on the west coast of North Korea.
Japan's coast guard also reported that the North fired what could be a ballistic missile. The missiles appeared to have landed in the sea outside Japan's exclusive economic zone, broadcaster NHK reported, citing an unnamed Japanese defence ministry official.
The U.S. military's Indo-Pacific Command said while it assessed that the launch does not pose an immediate threat to the United States or its allies, it highlights the ""destabilizing impact of the (North Korea's) illicit weapons program.""
The launch would be the third since New Year's day, an unusually high pace of missile tests. The previous two were of ""hypersonic missiles,"" North Korean state media reported, capable of high speeds and manoeuvring after launch.
In contrast to Friday's tests, each of those earlier launches involved a single missile which were fired from Jagang Province, neighbouring North Pyongan.
Kim Dong-yup, a former South Korea Navy officer who teaches at Seoul's Kyungnam University, said North Korea could have fired previously deployed SRBMs such as the KN-23 or KN-24.
""It could fit in their ongoing winter exercises, while sending a message to the United States through action following the state media statement,"" he said.
North Korea defended the missile tests as its legitimate right to self-defence and said the United States was intentionally escalating the situation by imposing new sanctions, state media reported earlier on Friday, citing the foreign ministry.
North Korea's recent development of a ""new-type weapon"" was just part of its efforts to modernize https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkorea-says-leader-kim-attended-successful-hypersonic-missile-test-2022-01-11 its national defence capability, and did not target any specific country or harm the security of neighbouring countries, the foreign ministry said in a statement on the KCNA state news agency. 
The statement warned of an unspecified ""stronger and certain reaction"" if the United States adopts a confrontational stance.
'PROFOUNDLY DESTABILISING'
The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday imposed its first sanctions https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-imposes-sanctions-north-koreans-russian-after-missile-tests-2022-01-12 over North Korea's weapons programs following a series of North Korean missile launches. 
It also called on the United Nations Security Council to take action https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-pushing-more-un-sanctions-north-korea-over-missiles-2022-01-13 against several North Korean individuals and entities accused of violating security council resolutions that ban North Korea's missile and nuclear weapons development.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States had made clear https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/blinken-calls-north-korea-missile-tests-profoundly-destabilizing-2022-01-13 it had no hostile intent toward North Korea and was willing to engage in talks without preconditions, but that the tests were ""profoundly destabilising.""
The North Korean foreign ministry said that while Washington may talk of diplomacy and dialogue, its actions show ""it is still engrossed in its policy for isolating and stifling"" North Korea.
""The U.S. is intentionally escalating the situation even with the activation of independent sanctions, not content with referring the DPRK's just activity to the UN Security Council,"" the statement said.

Kim Dong-yup pointed to remarks last year by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that Pyongyang will approach Washington ""on the principle of answering force with toughness, and good faith in kind"". 
""A eye for eye, tooth for a tooth,"" Kim Dong-yup said. ""North Korea might be saying they'll go their own way without being intimidated.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - Even as debates swirl over their capability, a series of “hypersonic missiles” recently tested by nuclear-armed North Korea sparked sudden talk of preemptive strikes and arms races amid worry over the vulnerability of U.S. troops and their allies in Asia.
North Korea kicked off the new year with three missile tests in the space of two weeks, sparking reactions from Washington not seen since Pyongyang stopped testing its longest-range missiles, which can strike the United States, in 2017.
At least two of the latest tests were of what North Korea called ""hypersonic missiles"" while details on the third, launched on Friday, were not immediately available.
Those hypersonic missiles, which have only regional reach, are not a threat to the continental United States. But the weapons - which can fly below defences and change course at high speed - represent a potential major upgrade in North Korea's striking power against its nearby adversaries, and experts say it is unclear how the U.S. and its Asian allies could counter that.
""These sorts of offense-defence races have been taking place globally for many decades now, and what we consistently see is that offence has the advantage,"" said Cameron Tracy, a researcher at Stanford University's Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC) in California. ""North Korea will continue to deploy more missiles and to develop faster, more manoeuvrable systems that will keep South Korea vulnerable to attack.""
In recent years the United States and South Korea - hoping to restart stalled talks with Pyongyang - have played down North Korea’s increasingly capable short-range missiles as concerning and a violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions, but not a standout threat. 
This week, however, the Biden administration moved to impose its first sanctions over the North's missile program, and South Korea's leading presidential candidates are debating whether a preemptive strike was the only way to stop the new weapons. 
Although, like most ballistic missiles, they travel at hypersonic speeds - more than five times the speed of sound - their key feature is the ability to manoeuvre and fly on lower trajectories than traditional ballistic missiles, making them harder to track and shoot down.
""In a worst-case scenario, North Korea could launch the missile in a ballistic curve which makes it appear to be a test into the sea, but then have it manoeuvre below or around radar systems and even turn a corner to strike a target in South Korea or Japan with a nuclear weapon,"" said Melissa Hanham, also a researcher at CISAC.
'BAD NEWS'
Analysts caution that it is far from clear how capable North Korea's new systems are or when they will be deployed. South Korea's military said the missile tested this year appears to have a conical manoeuvrable reentry vehicle (MaRV) for its warhead, rather than the more high-tech ""glider"" style seen on some missiles developed by China and other nations.
Many ballistic missile defence (BMD) systems are meant shoot down missiles following the high, arching flight of traditional ballistic projectiles, many of which touch the edge of space before plunging back to earth. 
""If they are deployed, they will pose a stiffer challenge to BMD systems designed to handle medium-range missiles, like THAAD and Aegis, which are presently designed to guard against weapons approaching their targets on a more or less straight line,"" Joshua Pollack, editor of the Nonproliferation Review, said of North Korea's MaRV missiles.
Additionally, South Korea and the roughly 28,500 U.S. troops based there are so close that incoming missiles could fly on even lower trajectories, with a much shorter flight time, making defence more difficult said David Wright, a nuclear security researcher the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Wright's research shows that flying on such a ""depressed trajectory"" could also allow North Korea's latest missiles to evade defences in more distant places such as Japan, which hosts tens of thousands of U.S. troops.
Many South Koreans have become used to living under the threat of North Korean weapons, but governments in the United States and Japan can't ignore North Korea's advancing programmes, said Chun In-bum, a retired South Korean general.
""The North Korea hypersonic weapon system will undoubtedly become better,"" he said. ""This is bad news for everyone.""
PREEMPTIVE STRIKES
South Korea's defence ministry on Thursday insisted it could not only detect the new missiles but also intercept them.
Some of the candidates for South Korea's presidency don't seem so sure.
“Missiles that travel at speeds over Mach 5, if they are loaded with nuclear warheads, will reach the Seoul metropolitan area in less than a minute,"" leading conservative presidential candidate Yoon Suk-yeol told reporters on Tuesday. ""Interception is practically impossible.""
Yoon said diplomacy is needed to ensure a war never happens. But if diplomacy fails, Yoon added, preemptive strikes would be needed to stop an imminent launch.

North Korea hides its missiles, so there is no evidence that a preemptive strike would eliminate the threat, Wright said. 
""If that vulnerability is a concern, which it should be, the only realistic response is to negotiate with North Korea to reduce the risk of such attacks,"" he said.

GIGLIO, Italy (Reuters) -Ester Percossi can still hear the screams, feel the cold and see the terror in people's eyes.
    She is one of the survivors of the shipwreck of the Costa Concordia, the luxury cruise liner that capsized after hitting rocks just off the coast of the small Italian island of Giglio on Jan. 13, 2012, killing 32 people in one of Europe's worst maritime disasters.
    Percossi and other survivors have returned to the island to pay tribute to the dead and again thank the islanders who, in the dark and dead of winter, helped 4,200 crew and passengers - more than six times the number of winter residents that night.
    ""It is extremely emotional. We come here today to remember, most importantly, those who are no longer with us, and to relive the hell that we went through and try in some way to exorcise it,"" Percossi said on arrival on Wednesday ahead of Thursday's commemorations.
    ""I remember the screams of the people, the people who were jumping into the sea. I remember the cold, the sensation of terror in everybody's eyes,"" she said.
    While there were many heroes that night, the ship’s captain, Francesco Schettino, was not among them. Branded ""Captain Coward"" by Italian media for abandoning ship during the rescue, he was sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2017 on manslaughter charges. 
    One crew member who did not leave was Russel Rebello, a waiter who helped passengers get off the ship. His body was recovered only several years later, when the massive, rusting hulk was righted and towed away in the most expensive maritime wreck recovery in history.
    ""My brother did his duty, he lost his life helping other people, obviously I am proud of that and I think that he would be very proud of what he did, helping so many other people,"" said Russel's brother Kevin as he arrived for the commemorations.
""I am trembling, this is amazing,"" Rebello said as he entered San Lorenzo church for a memorial Mass with survivors and islanders ahead of a ceremony where flowers were being dropped into the sea.
The Concordia was left on its side for two-and-a-half years, looking like a giant beached white whale. For some residents, it never left.
    On the night of the disaster Sister Pasqualina Pellegrino, an elderly nun, opened up the local school, the convent and a canteen to take in the shipwrecked.

    ""It is a memory that never fades. Even when the ship was still there, it looked like a person who had been abandoned,  it oozed sadness, because I could see it from the window,"" Sister Pasqualina said. 
    ""And even now it's not nice to remember it. But unfortunately that's life, you have to keep going with the pain, with the joy, day by day,"" she said.

VIENNA/MOSCOW (Reuters) -Poland's foreign minister said on Thursday that Europe was at risk of plunging into war as Russia said it was not yet giving up on diplomacy but that military experts were preparing options in case tensions over Ukraine could not be defused.
In Washington, the White House said the threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine remained high with some 100,000 Russian troops deployed and the United States would make public within 24 hours intelligence suggesting Russia might seek to invent a pretext to justify one.
""The drumbeat of war is sounding loud, and the rhetoric has gotten rather shrill,"" Michael Carpenter, U.S. Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), said after talks with Russia in Vienna.
""The threat of military invasion is high,"" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters. ""There are no dates set for any more talks. We have to consult with allies and partners first.""
Russia said dialogue was continuing but was hitting a dead end as it tried to persuade the West to bar Ukraine from joining NATO and roll back decades of alliance expansion in Europe - demands that the United States has called ""non-starters"".
""At this stage it is really disappointing,"" Russian Ambassador Alexander Lukashevich told reporters after a meeting of the OSCE, the third leg in a series of East-West talks this week.
He warned of possible ""catastrophic consequences"" if the two sides could not agree on what Russia has termed security red lines but said Moscow had not given up on diplomacy and would even speed it up.
The Russian comments reflect a pattern of Moscow saying it wants to pursue diplomacy but rejecting calls to reverse its troop build-up near Ukraine and warning of unspecified consequences for Western security if its demands go unheeded.
Earlier, Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau told the 57-nation security forum: ""It seems that the risk of war in the OSCE area is now greater than ever before in the last 30 years.""
While overlooking wars during that period in the former Yugoslavia and parts of the former Soviet Union, his comment highlighted the level of European anxiety over Russia's build-up of some 100,000 troops within reach of its border with Ukraine.
Russia denies plans to invade Ukraine but its military build-up has forced the United States and its allies to the negotiating table.
Rau reported no breakthrough at the Vienna meeting, which followed Russia-U.S. talks in Geneva on Monday and a Russia-NATO conference in Brussels on Wednesday.
'DIFFERENCE OF APPROACHES'
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said the earlier meetings had shown there was a ""dead end or difference of approaches"", and he saw no reason to sit down again in the coming days to re-start the same discussions.
He told RTVI television Russian military specialists were providing options to President Vladimir Putin in case the Ukraine situation worsened but diplomacy must be given a chance.
The Russian rouble fell by more than 2% against the dollar on Ryabkov's comments, which also prompted a sell-off in government bonds. A trader at a major Russian bank told Reuters the market had partly reacted to a comment from Ryabkov, in reply to a question, that he would neither confirm nor rule out the possibility that Russia might deploy ""military infrastructure"" in Cuba and Venezuela.
Sullivan said U.S intelligence agencies believed Russia may want ""the option of fabricating a pretext for an invasion, including through sabotage activities and information operations, by accusing Ukraine of preparing an imminent attack against Russian forces in Eastern Ukraine.""
Washington would share details ""on what we see as this potential laying of a pretext"" with the media within 24 hours, he added.
U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov, about the Russian buildup. The Pentagon estimated two-thirds of the Russian forces near Ukraine were ""out-of-garrison,"" meaning they had deployed from other parts of Russia.
'ELIMINATE THREATS'
Moscow says it is threatened by NATO's expansion towards its borders by taking in 14 new members from former communist eastern Europe since the Cold War ended. It wants to draw ""red lines"" to stop the alliance from admitting Ukraine as a member or basing missiles there.
Washington has rejected those demands but said it is willing to talk about arms control, missile deployments and confidence-building measures to move on from one of the most fraught moments in East-West relations since the Cold War.
Ambassador Lukashevich told the OSCE that unless Moscow received a constructive response, ""we will be forced to draw appropriate conclusions and take all necessary measures to ensure strategic balance and eliminate unacceptable threats to our national security.""
He went on: ""Russia is a peace-loving country. But we do not need peace at any cost. The need to obtain these legally formalised security guarantees for us is unconditional.""
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov criticised a sanctions bill unveiled by U.S. Senate Democrats that would target top Russian government and military officials, including Putin, as well as banking institutions, if Russia attacks Ukraine.

Peskov said imposing sanctions on Putin would be tantamount to severing relations.
""We view the appearance of such documents and statements extremely negatively against the background of an ongoing series of negotiations, albeit unsuccessful ones,"" he said.

KOBLENZ, Germany (Reuters) -A German court on Thursday jailed a Syrian ex-intelligence officer for life for murder, rape and crimes against humanity, handing down the first ever conviction for state-backed torture committed during Syria's civil war after a landmark trial.
Anwar Raslan was found guilty on 27 of out 58 counts of murder, rape and sexual assault carried out at a Damascus prison run by a unit of President Bashar al-Assad's security services that he headed.
The 58-year-old, a colonel when he defected to the Syrian opposition in 2012 and who prosecutors said was granted asylum in Germany two years later, had denied all charges.
The Assad government denies it tortures prisoners.
The trial was held under Germany's universal jurisdiction laws, which allow courts to prosecute crimes against humanity committed anywhere in the world.
Prosecutors supported by the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR) had gathered evidence since 2016 from nearly 50 Syrian torture survivors living in Germany, and from others based elsewhere in Europe, the ECCHR - an NGO founded by lawyers in 2007 - said.
Mariam Alhallak, whose son died during interrogations by government agents after being abducted at Damascus University in 2012, the year after the war began, welcomed the verdict.
""It means a lot to me because I have a feeling that justice is happening,"" she said outside the court in the western German city of Koblenz, one of a group of Syrian mothers holding pictures of children they said were killed or tortured in Syrian government facilities.
""It's a small step toward the justice we hope will be achieved: accountability for all those who committed violations, including the criminals who killed my son.""
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet hailed what she called ""a landmark leap forward"" in pursuing justice for the serious human rights violations perpetrated in Syria.
""This is a clear example of how national courts can and should fill accountability gaps for such crimes wherever they were committed,"" she said in a statement from Geneva, urging other states to employ the same princples of extra-territorial jurisdiction.
Inside the court Raslan, dressed in a black jacket and wearing glasses and a white face mask, gave a brief, wry smile as he waited for the verdict to be read out after a police officer removed his handcuffs.
Syrian human rights lawyers said he had defected to Turkey before moving on in 2014 to Germany, where he contacted police saying he feared former colleagues could take his life. He was arrested by German authorities in 2019.
'THE CRUELTY CONTINUES'
The verdict against Raslan, which will give hope to survivors of atrocities committed during the war after attempts to establish an international tribunal for Syria failed, was the second handed down during the trial, which began in April 2020.
Last year, another former member of the Syrian intelligence services was sentenced to 4-1/2 years in jail for abetting the torture of civilians.
""The trial demonstrates that accountability for the Assad regime's heinous atrocities is possible ... if national prosecutors and judges choose to act,"" said Eric Witte of the Open Society Justice Initiative, which supported several witnesses in the case.
""As much as we welcome the outcome of this trial, we must not forget that the cruelty of the crimes proved in court continues to this day in Syria.""
A second trial of a Syrian doctor suspected of crimes against humanity, including torturing prisoners at a military hospital in the city of Homs in 2011 and 2012 and killing one using a lethal injection, opens in Frankfurt next week.
At the U.N. Security Council, Russia and China have vetoed attempts by Western powers to refer the Syrian crisis to the International Criminal Court, leaving survivors of torture and chemical weapons attacks with limited options to seek justice.

But some of the estimated 800,000 Syrians living in Germany have opposed the Koblenz trial https://www.reuters.com/article/mideast-syria-germany-defectors-int-idUSKBN28B55G, saying it discourages defections by Syrians who may have more evidence of crimes committed by the government, after Raslan was encouraged by senior opposition members to change sides.
""It is natural that Syrians are going to have different views on how to seek justice,"" said Witte. ""Some want an amnesty and to save the trial for Bashar al-Assad and his top officers.""

(Reuters) - NASA on Wednesday embarked on a months-long, painstaking process of bringing its newly launched James Webb Space Telescope into focus, a task due for completion in time for the revolutionary eye in the sky to begin peering into the cosmos by early summer.
Mission control engineers at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, began by sending their initial commands to tiny motors called actuators that slowly position and fine-tune the telescope's principal mirror.
Consisting of 18 hexagonal segments of gold-plated beryllium metal, the primary mirror measures 21 feet 4 inches (6.5 m) in diameter - a much larger light-collecting surface than Webb's predecessor, the 30-year-old Hubble Space Telescope.
The 18 segments, which had been folded together to fit inside the cargo bay of the rocket that carried the telescope to space, were unfurled with the rest of its structural components during a two-week period following Webb's launch on Dec. 25.
Those segments must now be detached from fasteners that held them in place for the launch and then moved forward half an inch from their original configuration - a 10-day process - before they can be aligned to form a single, unbroken, light-collecting surface.
The alignment will take an additional three months, Lee Feinberg, the Webb optical telescope element manager at Goddard, told Reuters by telephone.
Aligning the primary mirror segments to form one large mirror means each segment ""is aligned to one-five-thousandth the thickness of a human hair"", Feinberg said.
""All of this required us to invent things that had never been done before,"" such as the actuators, which were built to move incrementally at -400 Fahrenheit (-240 Celsius) in the vacuum of space, he added.
The telescope's smaller, secondary mirror, designed to direct light collected from the primary lens into Webb's camera and other instruments, must also be aligned to operate as part of a cohesive optical system.
If all goes as planned, the telescope should be ready to capture its first science images in May, which would be processed over about another month before they can be released to the public, Feinberg said.
The $9-billion telescope, described by NASA as the premier space-science observatory of the next decade, will mainly view the cosmos in the infrared spectrum, allowing it to gaze through clouds of gas and dust where stars are being born. Hubble has operated primarily at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths.
Webb is about 100 times more powerful than Hubble, enabling it to observe objects at greater distances, thus farther back in time, than Hubble or any other telescope.

Astronomers say this will bring into view a glimpse of the cosmos never previously seen - dating to just 100 million years after the Big Bang, the theoretical flashpoint that set in motion the expansion of the observable universe an estimated 13.8 billion years ago.
The telescope is an international collaboration led by NASA in partnership with the European and Canadian space agencies.  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC) was the primary contractor.

LONDON (Reuters) -The Royal Family removed Prince Andrew's military links and royal patronages on Thursday and said he will no longer be known as ""His Royal Highness"", as the son of Queen Elizabeth fights a U.S. lawsuit in which he is accused of sex abuse. 
Andrew, 61, the Duke of York, was forced to step down from public duties in 2019 because of his connections to convicted U.S. sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and after a disastrous BBC TV interview which the prince had hoped would clear his name.
Thursday's move by the royal family means he will now lose all his royal connections.
""With the queen's approval and agreement, The Duke of York’s military affiliations and royal patronages have been returned to the queen,"" Buckingham Palace said in a statement. 
""The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen.""
On Wednesday, Andrew's lawyers failed to persuade a U.S. judge to dismiss a civil lawsuit in which Virginia Giuffre accuses him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager.
U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan said Giuffre, 38, could pursue claims that Andrew battered her and intentionally caused her emotional distress while Epstein - a financier who killed himself in jail in August 2019 while awaiting his sex trafficking trial - was trafficking her.
The prince, the 95-year-old queen's second son, has denied Giuffre's accusations that he forced her to have sex more than two decades ago at a London home of former Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and abused her at two Epstein properties.
The judge's decision means Andrew could be forced to give evidence at a trial which could begin between September and December 2022 if no settlement were reached.
'MARATHON NOT A SPRINT'
""Given the robustness with which Judge Kaplan greeted our arguments, we are unsurprised by the ruling,"" a source close to Andrew said. 
""However, it was not a judgement on the merits of Ms Giuffre's allegations. This is a marathon not a sprint and the Duke will continue to defend himself against these claims.""
A representative for Giuffre did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Andrew's links to Epstein had led to a swathe of damaging media reports, leading the prince to decide to do an TV interview in November 2019 which he hoped would resolve the matter.
It instead led to ridicule and further questions, and as the controversy grew, Buckingham Palace had increasingly distanced itself from the prince, declining to comment and referring all questions to his lawyers.
""This is now about the protection of the royal family's reputation. This is likely to do, and is already doing, considerable reputational damage - it's being followed around the world,"" the BBC's royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said.
The U.S. conviction last month of his friend Ghislaine Maxwell on sex trafficking and other charges of recruiting and grooming underage girls for Epstein to abuse, together with his own case, had left his reputation in the British media in tatters.
A royal source said the decision over Andrew came after wide discussions among the Windsors, and that his military affiliations and patronages would be redistributed to other members of the family.
Earlier, an open letter to the queen, signed by more than 150 veterans calling for Andrew too have his military titles taken away and ""if necessary, that he be dishonourably discharged"", was published by the anti-monarchy campaign group Republic.
They called for Elizabeth to take immediate action because her son had been ""uncooperative and less than truthful"" about his relationship with Epstein, and had brought the armed services he represented into disrepute.
""Regardless of the result of Virginia Giuffre’s civil case against Prince Andrew, his position in Britain's armed forces is now untenable,"" the veterans' letter said.

The scandal surrounding Andrew comes on the heels of the damage caused after the queen's grandson Prince Harry and his American wife Meghan quit royal duties to forge new careers in Los Angeles, later accusing the royal household of racism.
They too were stripped of all their patronages, the 'His and Her Royal Highness' titles, and Harry also lost his prized military roles.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A lawyer for Alec Baldwin on Thursday said the actor would hand over his cellphone as part of a probe into the fatal shooting of a cinematographer on the movie set of Western ""Rust,"" but police in New Mexico said they had yet to receive the device. 
Baldwin's lawyer, Aaron Dyer, said he had reached a deal with New Mexico authorities to turn in the phone after steps were taken to protect the actor's privacy regarding matters unrelated to the ""Rust"" investigation.
""Mr. Baldwin’s phone is being turned over this week for review,"" Dyer said in a statement. ""Mr. Baldwin has continued to cooperate with the authorities, and any suggestion to the contrary is simply untrue."" 
The comments followed a Thursday news release from the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office saying Baldwin had not complied with a search warrant requesting he hand over the phone and that a New Mexico prosecutor was now working with the actor's lawyer to get it.
""To date, the cell phone has not been turned over to authorities,"" the news release said.
The Santa Fe detective leading the ""Rust"" investigation obtained the search warrant in December to examine text messages, emails and other information on Baldwin's Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone.
The detective said she requested the warrant as suspects, victims and witnesses ""often make and/or receive telephone calls and/or messages before, during and/or after the commission of crime(s).""
Baldwin has said he was holding a revolver on the film set when it went off during a rehearsal in October, firing a live round that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.

In a television interview, Baldwin said he never pulled the trigger and denied responsibility for the shooting. 
The New Mexico prosecutor overseeing the case has said some people who handled guns on the set may face criminal charges in connection with Hutchins' death.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Republican Party on Thursday said its future presidential candidates might not participate in debates run by the Commission on Presidential Debates due to concerns about fairness, upending decades of tradition.
In a letter https:// to the nonprofit commission known as the CPD, which has run presidential debates since 1988, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said the party was considering amending its rules to ensure its candidates do not attend the debates because of concerns about ""whether the CPD credibly can provide a fair and impartial forum for presidential debates.""
She said the party would try to help future Republican presidential nominees participate in debates that are organized more fairly.
It is unclear what format those debates would take or whether they would take place as often as in recent decades. Prior to the debate commission's founding in 1987, political parties or campaigns negotiated directly on the terms of debates.
The looming schism comes as U.S. political divisions have grown deeper and the possibility of fewer debates could leave Americans with less access to unfiltered information about their aspiring leaders.
At the same time, Republicans have long accused the debate commission, which was founded to codify the debates as a permanent part of presidential elections, of being biased in favor of Democratic candidates.
Republicans are also concerned that the commission could hold its first debate for the 2024 presidential contest after the start of early voting, as it did in 2020, McDaniel said.

Last year, McDaniel and other party officials asked the commission to agree to changes in how it conducts its business and how the debates were held. McDaniel said Republicans also want the commission to adopt term limits for its board of directors.
The RNC rule change could be made official at a party meeting in Salt Lake City in February, McDaniel said.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Startups in Nigeria are helping fight counterfeit pharmaceutical drugs in Africa's most populous nation, where the prevalence rate of fake drugs is higher than the global average 10% and contributes to several deaths annually.
The most counterfeited are drugs for anti-malaria, pain and antibiotics, according to the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC).
To fight the flood of fake pills, the agency, in partnership with the startups has created stickers with unique codes that manufacturers and distributors can attach to boxes and sachets of pills. Consumers can then use apps on their phones to scan the code and confirm their authenticity. 
Lagos-based Chekkit Technologies' mobile app allows patients to check authenticity and enables manufacturers to see the number of new customers using their products. 
""They've (manufacturers) also been able to discover things like side effects, potential side effects their product could have on consumers based on what people say about their product,"" the company's founder Dare Odumade told Reuters.
NAFDAC's director of investigation and enforcement directorate Kingsley Ejiofor said the agency had in the past three years seized 2 trillion naira ($4.8 billion) worth of counterfeit drugs.
He said tracking apps were boosting the confidence of consumers. 
""We currently have about 200 containers of counterfeit medicine at the ports scheduled for destruction. Just imagine the people that could have died as a result of use of such products,"" Ejiofor said, adding that China and India were the major sources of the fake medicines.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) -Tennis world No.1 Novak Djokovic was included in the Australian Open draw as top seed on Thursday though the government could still kick him out in a row over COVID-19 vaccination. 
The draw was delayed for an hour without explanation, even as Immigration Minister Alex Hawke mulled whether to exercise discretionary power https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/what-could-novak-djokovic-face-next-australia-visa-fight-2022-01-13to cancel Djokovic's visa over concern about the his medical exemption from Australia's strict vaccine rules.
Should he still be here, the unvaccinated defending champion will face fellow Serb Miomir Kecmanovic for his opening match, probably on Monday or Tuesday.

(See key moments in the tennis player's Australian saga)
Australia is due to hold an election by May, and while Morrison's government has won support at home for its tough stance on border security, it has not escaped criticism over the botched handling of Djokovic's visa.
Melbourne's The Age newspaper said Djokovic would immediately appeal in court https://www.theage.com.au/sport/tennis/djokovic-plans-court-appeal-if-minister-decides-to-cancel-visa-20220113-p59o3n.html any attempt to deport him, with a decision expected on Friday, and tournament organisers preparing contingency plans for a new draw in case. 
A source in Prime Minister Scott Morrison's Liberal Party said the government was ""strongly leaning"" towards revoking the visa again, the newspaper reported.
Djokovic, who practiced again at the Rod Laver Arena on Thursday, fuelled widespread anger in Australia by heading to Melbourne https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/key-moments-novak-djokovics-australian-saga-2022-01-12 with a medical exemption from requirements for visitors to be inoculated against COVID-19. 
On arrival, Australian Border Force decided his exemption was invalid and put him in an immigration detention hotel alongside asylum-seekers at for several days. 
A court on Monday allowed him to stay on grounds that officials had been ""unreasonable"" during the seven-hour interview process in the middle of the night. 
The government must now decide whether to let Djokovic remain and bid for a record men's 21st major title. 
Australia has endured some of the world's longest lockdowns, has a 90% vaccination rate among adults, and has seen a runaway Omicron https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/australia-covid-19-infections-hit-record-amid-runaway-omicron-outbreak-2022-01-13 outbreak bring nearly a million cases in the last two weeks 
Djokovic's cause was not helped by a wrong entry declaration, where a box was ticked stating he had not travelled abroad in the two weeks before leaving for Australia.
In fact, he had travelled between Spain and Serbia https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/djokovic-travelled-across-europe-before-australia-trip-odds-with-declaration-2022-01-11. 
Djokovic, 34, blamed the error to his agent and acknowledged he also should not have done an interview and photoshoot for a French newspaper on Dec. 18 while infected with COVID-19.
'BOOT HIM'
""After hearing about what Djokovic said about how he made mistakes on his form and those little slips, I reckon he'll kick him out,"" Melbourne resident Tyler Agnew said of the minister's pending decision.
""No one can stuff that badly on little things like that, that's just pretty basic stuff. I reckon he should and will boot him.""
Anti-vaxxers, however, have hailed him as a hero while Djokovic's family and the Serbian government have portrayed him as a victim of persecution.
Though no stranger to past controversy, the uproar was getting to Djokovic, Australian former tennis player Todd Woodbridge said after meeting him on on Thursday.
""He is still very aware he may not get to the starting blocks for round one,"" Woodbridge, who is now a commentator, told a tournament television programme. ""He is very, very visible ... it's taking a toll on him.""
An online poll by the News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) media group found that 83% favoured the government trying to deport Djokovic.
""I would just say though, you know, just get vaccinated. That is the key,"" said Daniel Andrews, premier of Victoria state where Melbourne is the capital. 
""That's what I've said to every single Victorian, that's what I've done, that's what my kids have done, that's what families, 93% of our community has done that, and I'm very proud of them for doing it, I'm very grateful.""
There may also be resentment in the dressing room, where all but three of the top 100 men are inoculated. 

""Sometimes your personal beliefs have to be trumped by what's good for the greater good, for those around you, for your peers,"" tennis great Martina Navratilova told Australian TV, urging Djokovic to ""suck it up"" and go home. 
""Get vaccinated or just don't go play.""

He added that 2022 would almost certainly rank among the 10 warmest years on record. The warming in 2021 occurred despite the presence of La Nina in the eastern Pacific Ocean, a cooling trend that generally lowers global temperatures. 
Last year's extreme heat wave in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, intense rains from Hurricane Ida and flooding in Germany and China were linked to global warming, the agencies said. 
A key indicator of climate change, the amount of heat absorbed and stored by the world's oceans, reached a record level in 2021, the agencies said. Oceans absorb more than 90% of the excess heat trapped in the earth's atmosphere by greenhouse gases, and those warmer waters influence weather patterns and changes in currents.
""What's scientifically interesting about that is it tells us why the planet is warming,"" Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said in an interview. ""It's warming because of our impacts on greenhouse gas concentrations.""
Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide are emitted into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels like oil and coal. 
According to NOAA, 2021 average temperatures were 1.51 degrees Fahrenheit (0.84 Celsius) above the 20th century average, putting it just ahead of 2018. NASA's analysis, which uses a 30-year baseline period, showed 2021 temperatures tied with 2018 as the sixth-warmest year.
The two agencies produce separate analyses to bolster confidence in their conclusions, they said.
The 2015 Paris climate agreement commits countries to limit the global average temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to aim for 1.5 degrees Celsius.
The global average temperature will ""almost certainly"" exceed the 1.5 degree Celsius threshold by the early 2040s, Vose said.

Last year the greatest warming occurred in the Northern Hemisphere, both on land and in the Arctic. The Arctic is warming more than three times faster than the global mean, the agencies said.
In an overview of its report earlier this week, NOAA said last year was the fourth-warmest on record for the United States.

Russia said the withdrawal of the troops would be completed by Jan. 19, earlier than previously announced. Their deployment had been criticised by Western leaders alarmed by a buildup of Russian troops near Ukraine. Moscow has denied allegations it plans to invade but said security talks this week had hit a dead end https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-us-nato-talks-so-far-unsuccessful-2022-01-13 and threatened unspecified consequences.
President Vladimir Putin said the mission in Kazakhstan had been a success and was a practice that warranted further study.
Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev asked for assistance from the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) last week after initially peaceful protests, triggered by a sharp increase in car fuel prices, turned violent in many big cities.
""Thanks to your arrival, Kazakh military and security forces were able to carry out their immediate task of locating and detaining bandits,"" Kazakh Deputy Defence Minister Mukhamedzhan Talasov told CSTO troops at a departure ceremony in Almaty on Thursday, where they stood with their respective flags. The Russian group was the most numerous.
The Kazakh authorities announced the completion of what they called an ""anti-terrorist operation"" in most of the country on Wednesday, although they have yet to declare its biggest city Almaty fully secure.
It was unclear how many troops out of about 2,500 sent in by the CSTO were leaving immediately.
CSTO troops were first deployed to government buildings in the capital city of Nur-Sultan, away from the centres of unrest, and later guarded some key infrastructure objects in Almaty, such as large power plants.
The authorities have detained almost 10,000 people over the unrest in which some protesters attacked security forces, captured and torched government buildings and looted shops.
They have said some of the attackers were foreigners trained by Islamist militants. Tokayev has said this justified CSTO involvement although he has not specified who the foreigners were. He has dismissed some of his senior security officials who were later charged with treason.
Authorities in Kazakhstan said on Thursday they were also investigating the former head of state security, Karim Masimov, on suspicion of an attempted coup.
At the height of the unrest, Tokayev said he was taking over former president Nursultan Nazarbayev's position as chairman of the security council - through which the longtime former leader was still wielding sweeping powers. Nazarbayev has not been seen in public since the protests broke out.
Some Kazakhs have echoed a comment by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken that Kazakhstan might have a hard time getting rid of Russian troops after letting them in. Tokayev has said no foreign troops would remain in the country after Jan.23.
Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Thursday the pullout would be completed on Jan. 19, the Interfax news agency reported.
Putin praised the CSTO peacekeepers' work.

""Everything worked like clockwork: fast, coherent and effective,"" Putin told Shoigu on state television. ""I want to thank you, the general staff and everyone who led this operation, for this work and to express my hope that this practice of using our armed forces will be studied further.""
""All in all, we should return home. We have accomplished our task,"" he added.

PARIS (Reuters) -Tens of thousands of French teachers angry with the government's COVID-19 rules walked off the job on Thursday and took to the streets to demand better protection for pupils and staff against infection.
""Stop your contempt,"" and ""We're fed up with tests"" teachers proclaimed on banners in rallies across France, calling for the government to provide them with FFP2 face-masks and to stop changing the rules so often.
Teachers https://www.reuters.com/world/french-schools-overwhelmed-by-covid-19-contact-tracing-2022-01-07, parents and school directors have struggled to cope with the many twists and turns in COVID rules on schools. New testing requirements announced a day before schools restarted after the Christmas holidays and changed https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-eases-covid-protocols-schools-amid-omicron-surge-pm-2022-01-10 twice since increased the anger.
""We had reached such a level of exasperation, tiredness, and anger that we didn't have any other option but to organise a strike to send a strong message to the government,"" said union leader Elisabeth Allain-Moreno.
Many at the rallies called for the resignation of Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer. A government source said he was unlikely to lose his job so close to April's presidential election.
Prime Minister Jean Castex will, however, meet teachers' representatives later on Thursday, his office said, in a sign the government was keen to try and quell their anger.
The government has so far stood by its policy to keep classes open and requiring all pupils in contact with an infected person to get tested three times. Some degree of complication is the price to pay to keep schools open, it said.
""I know it's tough, but a strike does not solve problems. One does not strike against a virus,"" Blanquer told BFM TV earlier this week.
'FED UP' 
Infections have surged https://www.reuters.com/world/french-schools-overwhelmed-by-covid-19-contact-tracing-2022-01-07 in schools as France has set records with close to 370,000 new daily cases https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-will-register-tuesday-record-350000-daily-new-covid-infections-minister-2022-01-11, sending families scrambling to get their children tested.
""My children and I, we're fed up with getting tested every other day,"" said Corinne Courvoisier, the mother of seven-year old twins, who had joined the protest rally in Nice.
""We started testing Nelson and Elsa on Friday because there was a suspicion of a positive COVID-19 test in Nelson's class, so Friday, then Sunday, then Tuesday, and then yesterday we were sent a letter from the director that there was another suspected case in Elsa's class ... We're never seeing the end of it."" 
Unions said 75% of teachers in primary schools and 62% in high schools walked out, while the Education Ministry said less than half those numbers did. Strike turnout was unusually high in either case.
Some schools closed due to the strike, others were open only for children of health workers while some operated as normal.

""The pandemic has put the spotlight on a policy of drastic staff reduction in public education,"" teacher Laurence Fourteuil said at the Paris rally.
""It's not against the virus that we're on strike. We are on strike against policies that are already attempting to squeeze staff.""

MISRATA, Libya (Reuters) - Hundreds of bodies of Islamic State fighters killed in battle years ago are rotting in food freezers outside a Libyan city while authorities work out what to do with them, a grim reminder of the disarray a failed election was meant to address.
Stored in a dusty corner of a compound southeast of Misrata, the 742 bodies were gathered by the internationally recognised government in 2016 from battlefields and informal graves, but there was no agreement on how or where they should be buried.
Instead, Libya's conflict rumbled on, frontlines shifted, governments changed and financial crises came and went. The corpses, meanwhile, began to decompose, as power supplies to refrigerated containers were interrupted. 
The compound, run by a police unit and surrounded by fences and security cameras, reeks of decay. Weeds grow between the containers and an abandoned forensic tent stands under the burning sun.
""Power cuts for long periods make the situation, the bad smell, worse,"" said Salah Ahmed of the police unit handling the compound.
Originally assembled for identification and proper burial, even those fighters identified by documents or former comrades remain uncollected by foreign states or family members, leaving it up to the Tripoli government to dispose of them.
One plan that assigned a burial ground in the city of Sirte, which Islamic State seized in 2015 and held for over a year, was thwarted when frontlines moved. 
Another, to bury them at a cemetery originally dedicated to migrants who died while trying to cross through Libya and on to Europe, was cancelled because it was not big enough.
The police unit running the compound says the interim government has assigned a budget to bury the bodies soon. Neither a date nor a location have been announced.
The Government of National Unity did not respond to a request for comment.
Meanwhile, Tripoli authorities have other priorities amid political jostling that undermined the election and ongoing rivalries between local forces who control their own fiefdoms.
A planned ballot last month was seen as a possible way forward, giving Libya's new rulers a clearer mandate to deal conclusively with the ugly remnants of war. But the vote never happened amid rows over basic rules among rival factions.
MILITANTS EXPLOITED CHAOS
Libya fell apart after the 2011 NATO-backed uprising against Muammar Gaddafi, as victorious rebel groups fell out and political factions squabbled for control of lucrative organs of state.
Amid the chaos, and as Arab Spring uprisings elsewhere spawned a new wave of militancy, devotees of Islamic State started staging attacks and seizing territory, including Gaddafi's hometown of Sirte.
Hundreds of foreign supporters of the group slipped into Libya hoping to join local fighters who had rallied to its cause.
The image of Islamic State's black flag flying over a major Libyan city was for many a symbol of the country's collapse.
When pro-government forces overran the group in Sirte in late 2016 after months of fighting, hundreds of militants' bodies were left under the rubble or in shallow graves their comrades had dug.
Apart from a major shooting in Tripoli in 2019, Islamic State has since been limited to small raids on remote desert towns, but some experts warn that any major recurrence of warfare could give it space to return.
The previous government ordered bodies to be collected from the rubble and exhumed from mass graves for identification and return to their countries of origin or Libyan families.
It also wanted to gather evidence of the flow of foreign jihadists into Libya.
Using documents and photographs, and by speaking to captured militants, the authorities identified over 50 of the bodies, mostly from Arab and African countries but with provisional identifications of a British woman and a French child.
Now the police looking after the bodies say they hope the interim government can find a solution quickly. Four of the 10 refrigerator units are not working. When that happens, bodies have to be moved to ones that are.

Though Libya is a major oil producer, political chaos has undermined infrastructure, including power supply.
""Keeping the bodies in freezers is expensive and stressful,"" said Ahmad. ""The conditions are not appropriate.""

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's foreign minister said on Thursday that some Southeast Asian countries had reservations about last week's visit to Myanmar by Cambodia's leader, with concerns it could be seen as regional recognition of its ruling junta.
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, the new chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) met last week with military ruler https://reut.rs/3ngcp4w Min Aung Hlaing, the first such visit by a head of government to Myanmar since last year's coup, dealing a blow to international efforts to isolate the generals.
Speaking to reporters late on Thursday, Saifuddin Abdullah said there were different opinions within ASEAN about Hun Sen's visit, with some of its 10 members concerned it could be seen as legitimising the coup-makers.
""There are people who think that he should not have taken the visit because his visit has been construed or interpreted as a recognition of the military in Myanmar,"" he said. 
""Malaysia is of the opinion that he has the right to visit Myanmar as the head of government of Cambodia. However, we also feel that because he has already assumed the chair of ASEAN, he could have probably consulted the other ASEAN leaders and sought our views as to what he should do if he were to go to Myanmar.""
Asked if he thought Hun Sen's visit achieved anything, Saifuddin said: ""No"".
Myanmar has been in turmoil since the coup, with the military using deadly force to quell protests and facing armed resistance on multiple fronts from opponents it calls ""terrorists"".
Thousands have been arrested and ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi, 76, has been convicted of crimes https://reut.rs/3tqSFyS including incitement and breaching coronavirus rules.

Saifuddin said it was unclear whether Cambodia, as ASEAN chair, would continue to exclude Myanmar's junta from ASEAN meetings until it showed progress, a position favoured by previous chair Brunei, which Malaysia backed.

Cambodia's foreign minister Prak Sokhonn on Saturday said his country as ASEAN chair would take ""different approaches"" https://reut.rs/3K36kC4 to the Myanmar crisis.

BERLIN (Reuters) -Germany's vaccine committee recommended on Thursday that all children between the ages of 12 and 17 receive a COVID-19 booster shot as the country reported a new daily record of more than 81,000 coronavirus infections.
The government's coronavirus crisis manager warned of possible bottlenecks in testing, though Health Minister Karl Lauterbach said Germany had the means to handle the situation.
The move on booster shots makes Germany among the first countries in the world to make such a recommendation, following the United States, Israel and Hungary. 
""The current situation, with a sharp increase in the number of cases due to the Omicron variant and the feared consequences for the health system in Germany, makes it necessary to extend the vaccination campaign,"" the STIKO vaccine committee said.
The third dose should be an mRNA shot from BioNTech/Pfizer and should be given, at the earliest, three months after the child had their second shot, STIKO said in a statement. 
While data on the effectiveness and safety of the booster vaccination for 12- to 17-year-olds remains limited, the risk of severe side effects is estimated to be very low, it added.
NO REGULATORY APPROVAL
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has not given regulatory approval, so Germany would be responsible for any liabilities linked to the booster for this age group. 
The EMA said this week it was reviewing whether to extend the booster approval for  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) shots to adolescents aged 16 and 17, and expected drugmakers to apply for the 12-15 age group as well.
BioNTech said it was processing the data for booster vaccines for children aged 12-15 to be submitted to the EMA.
Germany, seeking to slow the spread of the Omicron variant that a week ago accounted for about 44% of COVID infections, reported a record 81,417 daily cases on Thursday, bringing the seven-day incidence to 427.7 per 100,000 residents.
More than 115,000 people have died with COVID-19 and some 45.1% of the population has received a booster.
The head of Germany's federal coronavirus crisis team Carsten Breuer said workers in critical infrastructure sectors would be prioritised if COVID-19 testing capacity tightened. 
""As with all scarce resources, we will certainly have to pool capacities where necessary. This also applies to tests,"" Breuer told Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
Health Minister Lauterbach said the booster campaign would help Germany avert the steep increase in Omicron infections.
He also welcomed the move from STIKO, which has in the past drawn criticism for hesitating in making such recommendations.

Germany's DIVI association for intensive/emergency medicine on Thursday published data showing that unvaccinated people made up a majority of all COVID-19 cases in intensive care units.
The data, collected between mid-December and Jan. 12 and covering around 90% of all COVID-19 new intensive care admissions, showed that 62% of those admitted were unvaccinated.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal inmates who successfully participate in recidivism-reduction programs will qualify for early release from prison under new rules unveiled on Thursday by the U.S. Justice Department.
The rules, mandated by Congress in a 2018 federal law called the First Step Act, allow inmates to earn 10 to 15 days of ""time credits"" shaved off their sentence for every 30 days of participation in certain programs or activities offered to them by the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).
By earning those credits, they can qualify to be released early into halfway houses or home confinement. In some cases, inmates can also earn up to 12 months of credit that would be applied toward supervised release. 
The new rule will apply retroactively, allowing inmates to earn credits from prior participation in programs since Dec. 21, 2018, when the First Step Act became law.
The Justice Department faced criticism over its original proposal on how it would implement the federal time credits rule, with federal defenders https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-justice-dept-clashes-with-inmates-over-credits-shave-prison-time-2021-08-10 saying the Bureau of Prisons' menu of available programs was too limited and the number of hours required to complete them would make it too hard for inmates to earn credits.
""The math speaks for itself,"" federal defenders wrote in a January 2021 letter to the bureau. ""It would take 219 weeks, or over 4 years to earn a full year of credit under the BOP's proposed rule.""

Criminal justice advocates who lobbied for the First Step Act's passage lauded the new finalized rule on Thursday, saying it is now in line with what Congress intended.
""Today's announcement is relief for thousands of people who have done the hard work to turn their lives around, and rejoin their families and communities as productive, law-abiding citizens,"" Holly Harris, the president of Justice Action Network, said in a statement.

239,"<span>Jan 13, 2022 10:22AM ET</span>",,,,,,"KABUL (Reuters) - The Afghan Taliban on Wednesday proposed creating a joint body of its officials and international representatives to help coordinate billions of dollars in planned aid.
It was not clear whether the United Nations and foreign governments would back such an agreement, as it would constitute an increase in access to international funding by the Taliban, some of whose leaders have been hit by U.S. sanctions.
The abrupt withdrawal of foreign aid following the hasty exit of American forces and the Taliban's stunning victory last August left Afghanistan's economy on the brink of collapse. Hunger is widespread and prices for basic goods have spiked.
Western sanctions aimed at the Taliban also prevented the passage of basic supplies of food and medicine, although this has since eased after exemptions were passed by the U.N. Security Council and Washington in December.
On Tuesday, the United Nations asked donors for $4.4 billion in humanitarian aid for Afghanistan in 2022 and the White House announced it would donate an extra $308 million.
""The goal of this committee is coordination on a higher level for facilitating humanitarian aids of the international community and to distribute aid for needy people,"" Afghanistan's acting Deputy Prime Minister Abdul Salam Hanafi told a news conference in Kabul also attended by U.N. envoy Ramiz Alakbarov. 
""We ask the international communities that they should use the government capacities for their aid goals.""
Foreign governments, facing warnings that millions of people could starve as the economic crisis intensifies, are ramping up humanitarian aid, but they are keen to keep it away from government interference.
An Afghan finance ministry spokesman said that discussions would take place over the next few days with the United Nations on the proposal for the joint body.
The U.N. Secretary General's deputy special representative for Afghanistan Alakbarov told Reuters that U.N. agencies were already communicating their requirements to the Taliban over aid.
Their main condition has been access to the entire country, including for female staff members.

""International organisations are totally free. They can continue their work according their own procedures. (We) will provide anything they need - security ... transportation,"" Finance Ministry spokesman Ahmad Wali Haqmal said.

(Reuters) -Africa's top public health body said it was in talks with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) about securing supplies of its antiviral COVID-19 pills for the continent, the latest to join the race for a drug seen as a potential game changer in fighting the virus.
The Paxlovid medication was nearly 90% effective in preventing hospitalisations and deaths, and data suggested it retains its effectiveness against the Omicron variant, Pfizer has said.
""We are in really close discussions with Pfizer to see what can be done to make the drugs available on the continent and accessible on the continent, that is, the Paxlovid drugs,"" said John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.
Governments around the world are scrambling to buy Paxlovid, while Merck's Molnupiravir has faced setbacks after disappointing trial data.
While vaccines have been governments' main weapon against COVID-19, there are hopes Merck and Pfizer's experimental pills - taken at home rather than in hospital or medical centres - could be key in reducing the chances of dying or hospitalisation for those most at risk of severe illness.
Nkengasong said obtaining supplies of COVID-19 drugs was one of three key strategies for combating the pandemic in Africa in 2022, along with scaling up vaccinations and testing.
Such drugs would be crucial if another highly transmissible variant were to emerge and public health systems become overwhelmed, he said.
""The only way to relieve that will be if we have drugs like Paxlovid where people can take that drug and stay home and get relief, and that way the burden and the constraints on the health system will be limited,"" Nkengasong told an online news briefing.
While wealthy countries, including the United States and Britain, have secured deals to buy the pills, concerns have grown that low-income countries would lag in this effort due to tight supplies, as was the case in the scramble for vaccines.
The U.S. government's contract for 10 million courses of the drug is priced at $530 per course, a price that would put it out of reach for many poorer countries.
To mitigate that issue, Pfizer has agreed to allow generic manufacturers to supply versions of the treatment to 95 low- and middle-income countries through a licensing agreement with international public health group Medicines Patent Pool (NASDAQ:POOL) (MPP).
Africa has officially recorded just over 10 million cases of COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic, although the real number is likely much higher due to patchy testing.
Nkengasong said 10% of Africans were fully vaccinated. 

Addressing a separate briefing, a senior official from the World Health Organization's Africa office said it appeared that a fourth infection wave on the continent driven by Omicron was flattening, marking the shortest surge in cases to date. 
""It is (a) plateau ... but we are careful and we are observing for the upcoming couple of weeks to make sure,"" said the WHO regional emergency director Abdou Salam Gueye.

Omicron has brought new challenges for China's strategy to quickly stamp out outbreaks, which has taken on urgency ahead of the Winter Olympics set to start from Feb. 4, while the busy Lunar New Year travel season begins this month. 
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Group's China unit said it had shut a vehicle plant run jointly with FAW Group in Tianjin, as well as a component factory since Monday due to the outbreak.
Tianjin, located about 100 km (62 miles) from the capital Beijing, reported 41 domestically transmitted infections with confirmed symptoms on Wednesday, up from 33 a day earlier, National Health Commission data showed.
Dalian in the northeast also reported an individual arriving from Tianjin had tested positive for Omicron, city officials said. It said the virus situation was ""largely controllable"". 
Anyang in the central province of Henan reported 43 local symptomatic cases on Wednesday, after two Omicron infections on Monday. It traced the flare-up to a student from Tianjin. 
Case numbers in Tianjin and Anyang are tiny compared with outbreaks in many other countries, though the number of local Omicron infections is unclear. Still, officials imposed curbs on movement within the cities and outside. 
Several cities across China have ordered quarantine for recent visitors to the two cities. Beijing is among the many cities urging people to stay put during the Lunar New Year holiday. 
Citing the Omicron risk and the need to keep the Olympics Games safe, officials in the capital encouraged commuters from satellite towns to work from home.
There were no new deaths on Wednesday, leaving the toll since the virus was first found two years ago in China unchanged at 4,636.

Zhang Wenhong, director of a COVID-19 treatment team in Shanghai, said on Thursday the public health clinic in the commercial hub faced a record number of infections arriving from overseas. 
Imported cases in Shanghai during the first 10 days of this month have already exceeded December's total, Reuters calculations showed. How many were caused by Omicron is unclear. 
China has suspended more U.S. flights after a surge in numbers of infected passengers.
Its tough measures against local outbreaks included punishment for officials, with 11 people held to account in Anyang by Wednesday for failing to properly control the virus. 
On Thursday, city authorities in the ancient town of Xian ordered two hospitals to suspend operations for three months for failures in providing medical care during the outbreak. 
The move drove down shares of their owner, XiAn International Medical Investment Co, by 10%, or the maximum permitted daily percentage change.

One of the hospitals apologised for rigid virus controls that delayed treatment for a patient who suffered a heart attack and died. 
The story of a pregnant woman who lost her unborn baby after waiting for two hours outside the other hospital provoked anger on Chinese social media and brought punishment for city officials.

The number of new cases hit 25,215 on Thursday amid a surge in the Omicron variant and the Public Health Agency warned that figure could more than double by the end of the month in a worst-case scenario.
Sweden recently tightened its restrictions and has urged people to work from home in an effort to minimise the spread of the virus.
""The calculations in the Health Agency's updated scenarios show a massively increasing infection spread for another two weeks, with a peak at the end of January,"" the Health Agency said in a statement on Thursday. 
In a worst-case scenario, Sweden could see around 69,000 daily cases at the peak, the Health Agency said.
The agency's previous outlook, from Dec. 21, said Sweden could, in a worst-case scenario, see more than 15,000 new COVID-19 cases per day with a peak in mid-January.
State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell said Sweden was experiencing the same rapid increase in infections as many other countries.

""These increases are probably going to continue for a while yet. That means that we already... have a high level of pressure on the health and welfare system,"" he told a news conference.
While COVID infections have soared, the number of people hospitalized with the disease remains well below the peaks in previous waves. The number of new deaths has also been comparatively low.

Blinken said the entire federal government is working to get to the bottom of the illness, which has afflicted about 200 U.S. diplomats, officials and family members overseas. 
""To date, we don't know exactly what's happened and we don't know exactly who is responsible,"" Blinken said in an interview with MSNBC.
The Wall Street Journal on Thursday reported additional illnesses among officials serving in U.S. diplomatic missions in Paris and Geneva, where the United States and Russia held security talks on Monday over Moscow's troop buildup near the Ukraine border.
Blinken said the United States has raised the illnesses with the Russians but still cannot make a determination about who was responsible.
The mysterious ailment carries symptoms including migraines, nausea, memory lapses and dizziness. It was first reported among U.S. officials in the Cuban capital in 2016. 
Blinken said he has met with State Department employees around the world who described the illnesses and how these incidents disrupted their lives.

""There is no doubt in my mind that people have been directly and powerfully affected,"" he said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has eased its COVID-19 rules on testing, quarantine and hospital admissions in a bid to free up resources for its neediest people, a strategy hailed by experts even though it carries the risk of a heavy undercount of infections and deaths.
The moves will offer a breathing space for healthcare facilities, often overstretched in a far-flung nation of 1.4 billion, as they battle a 33-fold surge in infections over the past month from the highly contagious Omicron variant.
This week, federal authorities told states to drop mandatory testing for contacts of confirmed cases unless they were old or battling other conditions, while halving the isolation period to a week and advising hospital care only for the seriously ill.
""Contact-tracing has been the most resource-intensive activity since the pandemic began,"" said Sanjay K. Rai, a professor of community medicine at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi, the capital.
""That strategy did not work and wasted resources,"" he added, saying serological surveys had shown it had detected only a fraction of infections. ""The new one will ensure optimum utilisation of what we have got.""
India's tally of infections crossed 36 million on Thursday, with 247,417 new cases, although daily testing has stayed well below the capacity of more than 2 million.
Four Indian epidemiologists echoed Rai's view, saying it was better to monitor the numbers of those in hospital, rather than infections, while targeting crowded spaces such as workplaces, dormitories and barracks with rapid testing.
They added that the guidelines on shorter isolation and hospital admissions were in line with global practice, as most Omicron sufferers recover quicker, although they spread the virus faster.
But some experts say the new rules could lull people into taking infections lightly until it is too late, especially in the rural areas home to two-thirds of the population, where few seek tests unless directed by authorities.
""This new strategy will affect data from rural India or certain states in a disproportionate way,"" said Bhramar Mukherjee, an epidemiology professor at the University of Michigan.
""It will be harder to predict upcoming hotspots and epicentres,"" she added, which would leave authorities less time to marshal resources against the disease.
It would also affect the tracking of COVID-19 deaths, an effort Mukherjee said was ""already highly imperfect and under-reported"".
Health experts say India massively undercounts infections, with its death toll outstripping the official figure of about 485,000, as few victims of earlier waves, chiefly in rural areas, learnt of their condition until the last moment. 
 BEST  (NYSE:BEST) HEALTHCARE IN CITIES
India's best healthcare facilities are clustered in major cities, while poor people across vast swathes of the country have to rely on dilapidated government networks.
For example, government-run district hospitals in the sprawling mineral-rich state of Bihar struggle with one of India's worst ratios of medical staff to patients, while New Delhi is staffed at more than twice the national average.
The health ministry and the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
There was no shortage of test kits, with thousands of people having bought home test kits in the past week, ICMR chief Balram Bhargava said on Wednesday, but did not say if rural areas were as well supplied as urban areas.
Some Indian states have decided to ignore the new testing guidelines since they are not bound by them.
Karnataka, home to the southern technology hub of Bengaluru, has reported India's third-highest tally of infections, and plans to continue tests for close contacts of the infected.
A survey published this week by New Delhi-based website LocalCircles found that 15% of respondents knew of one or more of their family and friends who did not get tested, despite showing symptoms similar to COVID-19 in the past month.
It said the gap between actual and reported daily cases would widen when the virus reaches smaller towns and villages.

South Asian nations with less than half their people fully vaccinated, such as India, run a greater risk of severe illness that requires hospital stays, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said. 
""As we are seeing new variants, we must not be complacent in adhering to public health measures,"" said Abhishek Rimal, an Asia-Pacific official of the humanitarian network.

LONDON (Reuters) -Prime Minister Boris Johnson apologised on Wednesday for attending a ""bring your own booze"" gathering at his official residence during Britain's first coronavirus lockdown, as a senior figure in his party and opponents said he should resign. 
Johnson admitted for the first time that he had attended the party at 10 Downing Street in May 2020 when COVID-19 rules limited social gatherings to a bare minimum, saying he understood public anger.
""I know the rage they feel with me over the government I lead when they think that in Downing Street itself the rules are not being properly followed by the people who make the rules,"" an ashen-faced Johnson told parliament.
""I offer my heartfelt apologies,"" he said. 
Johnson said he regretted his action and had thought the gathering was a work event - drawing jeers and laughter from opposition lawmakers. 
""I went into that garden just after six on the 20th of May 2020 to thank groups of staff before going back into my office 25 minutes later to continue working,"" Johnson said. 
""With hindsight, I should have sent everyone back inside.""
Leaders of all the main opposition parties called for his resignation, while the Conservatives' leader in Scotland became the first figure in his party to say Johnson should now quit. 
Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said the public - who handed Johnson a landslide election victory in December 2019 after he promised to secure Britain's exit from the European Union - thought him a liar.
""The party's over, prime minister,"" Starmer told him. 
""After months of deceit and deception, the pathetic spectacle of a man who has run out of road. His defence that he didn't realise he was at a party is so ridiculous that it is actually offensive to the British public.""
'NOT SUNK YET'
Anger has grown since  ITV  (LON:ITV) News reported Johnson and partner Carrie mingled with about 40 staff in the Downing Street garden after his Principal Private Secretary Martin Reynolds sent an invitation asking attendees to ""bring your own booze"". Johnson's press secretary said the prime minister had not seen that email.
Numerous people, including some lawmakers, have described how the rules kept them from the bedsides of dying loved ones last May in contrast to the events in Downing Street. 
Some of Johnson's own Conservative lawmakers had said his response on Wednesday to the growing furore would determine his future.
""He's taken on a lot of water and is listing but not quite sunk yet,"" one of them told Reuters. 
Senior ministers rallied round Johnson to express support on social media, but other lawmakers were unconvinced, most notably Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross.
""Regretfully, I have to say his position is no longer tenable,"" Ross told Sky News, having earlier spoken to Johnson. Sky said he would submit a letter of no confidence in the prime minister.
To trigger a leadership challenge, 54 of the 360 Conservative MPs in parliament must write letters of no confidence https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/how-could-uk-pm-johnson-be-ousted-by-unhappy-lawmakers-2022-01-12 to the chairman of the party's ""1922 Committee"".
""It sounds to me, I'm afraid, very much as though politically the prime minister is a dead man walking,"" said Roger Gale, another Conservative lawmaker who has also written a letter calling for Johnson to face a challenge. 
LOCKDOWN PARTY
Just two years ago, Johnson was riding high: he had secured the biggest Conservative majority since Margaret Thatcher's in 1987 after promising to get Brexit done. He had led the campaign to leave the EU in 2016's referendum. 
But a series of missteps over everything from sleaze scandals and the opulent refurbishment of his flat https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/sleaze-scandal-lockdown-parties-trying-times-uk-pm-johnson-2022-01-11 to his handling of COVID-19 and now Downing Street parties have drained his political capital. 
Two snap opinion polls on Tuesday showed well over half of respondents thought Johnson should resign. Last month, the Conservatives lost a parliamentary seat they had held for almost 200 years while the party's comfortable lead over Labour in opinion polls has evaporated.
Bookmakers slashed their odds on Johnson being replaced as prime minister this year, with local elections in May viewed as another moment of jeopardy.
When details of the gathering first emerged, Johnson said he could not comment until a senior official, Sue Gray, concludes an investigation into other allegations - initially denied - that he and his officials held rule-breaking parties.
In response to the calls for his resignation, he again deferred to Gray's investigation.
""I cannot anticipate the conclusions of the current inquiry, I have learned enough to know that there were things we simply did not get right. And I must take responsibility,"" he said.
Opponents said he had not apologised for the party itself which Johnson said on Wednesday ""could be said technically to fall within the guidance"", but was simply sorry he had been found out.

While parliament resounded with demands for his head, Johnson's biographer Andrew Gimson said he was unlikely to quit unless forced out by his parliamentary colleagues.
""He will be looking for a way through this. He is not the resigning type,"" Gimson said.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Europe is nearer war than it has been in 30 years, Poland's foreign minister warned during the third round of diplomacy this week aimed at defusing tensions over Russia's demand that Ukraine never be allowed to join NATO.
Addressing envoys from the 57 members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Zbigniew Rau did not name Russia, but listed a string of conflicts in which Moscow's involvement has been alleged.
""It seems that the risk of war in the OSCE area is now greater than ever before in the last 30 years,"" Rau said in a speech outlining his country's priorities as it holds the OSCE's rotating chairmanship this year. 
""For several weeks we have been faced with the prospect of a major military escalation in Eastern Europe.""
Poland is among the NATO members that are most hawkish in confronting what it sees as Russia's revisionist ambitions in Eastern Europe.
""We should focus on a peaceful resolution of the conflict in and around Ukraine,"" Rau added, calling for ""full respect of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders"".
Russia has deployed more than 100,000 troops near its borders with Ukraine, which is already battling Moscow-backed separatists in its east. Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014. 

Thursday's talks in Vienna will be the first this week in which Ukraine will be represented, and there only on a low, ambassadorial level. Ministerial talks between Russia and the U.S. in Geneva on Tuesday and between Russia and NATO in Brussels on Wednesday failed to yield clear progress.
The Kremlin on Thursday gave https://news.trust.org/item/20220113101353-avwze a bleak assessment of Russia's security talks with the United States and NATO this week, describing them as ""unsuccessful"" and saying there was disagreement on fundamental issues.

In an annual report on rights abuses around the world, the Washington-based group urged Brazil's Supreme Court, Congress and other democratic institutions to remain vigilant and resist any attempt by Bolsonaro to undermine the October elections.
""President Bolsonaro tried to weaken the pillars of democracy, attacking the judiciary and repeating baseless allegations of electoral fraud,' said Maria Laura Canineu, Human Rights Watch director in Brazil. 
His government has promoted policies contrary to human rights in various areas, including indigenous peoples' rights, women's rights, the rights of those with disabilities and freedom of expression, the report said.
Bolsonaro has promoted bills to deny the rights of many indigenous peoples to their traditional lands and, in practice, legalized illegal mining in those territories.
During his administration, deforestation in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has skyrocketed to the highest level since 2006, as shown by the government's own data, Human Rights Watch said.
The president's office did not answer a request for comment on the rights report. Bolsonaro plans to seek re-election in October, though he has not formally declared his candidacy.
HRW said Bolsonaro has continued to spread false information about COVID-19 vaccines after a Senate inquiry found his government has jeopardized the health of Brazilians by disregarding science-based measures to contain the virus and by promoting drugs with no proven efficacy.
Bolsonaro has also encouraged police violence and defended a bill that makes it harder to hold police officers accountable for abuses, it added.

Police lethality reached a record in 2020 in Brazil, with the highest number of deaths resulting from police action since the indicator started to be monitored, the report said, adding that 80% of the victims were black. 
His government has also pursued criminal investigations against political critics, including with the use of the National Security Law of the 1964-1985 military dictatorship that he defends, it said.

ROME (Reuters) -Italy's centre-right bloc will support former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's bid to become the next president of the Republic, rightist League party leader Matteo Salvini said on Thursday.
The Italian parliament will convene on Jan. 24 to begin voting for a new head of state to replace the outgoing Sergio Mattarella. Centre-right leaders are expected to discuss the situation at a meeting set for Friday.
""The centre-right is firm and unanimous in its support for Berlusconi, we will not accept ideological vetoes from the left,"" Salvini said in a statement, referring to centre-left parties that have denounced Berlusconi's presidential ambitions.
The presidential election is dominating political debate in Italy and will likely have a major impact on the country's future.
Prime Minister Mario Draghi is among the top candidates for the job, but his promotion to the head of state's Quirinale Palace would leave the parties with the choice of either installing a new premier or asking for an election a year ahead of schedule.
In a news conference on Wednesday, Salvini made clear his party would be ready to stay in government even if Draghi left, but repeated he would like the former European Central Bank chief to remain premier.
Berlusconi's Forza Italia party has said it would quit the unity government if Draghi moves to the Quirinale.
The presidential election is conducted by a ballot held among more than 1,000 parliamentarians and regional delegates. The vote is secret, making it difficult for party leaders to be sure that lawmakers follow their instructions.
Analysts and politicians believe Berlusconi - who is still dealing with trials related to his infamous ""Bunga Bunga"" sex parties of more than a decade ago - is unlikely to muster the broad support needed to win the vote.
Even if all the lawmakers in the centre-right bloc voted for him, Berlusconi would still need at least 50 more votes to make him head of state - which he would have to secure from a pool of 113 unaffiliated lawmakers.

Riccardo Molinari, the League lower-house leader, told an Italian radio station that his party wanted Berlusconi to be elected, but added that his camp needed to find a candidate that the left could also support.
""It is no secret that Berlusconi is a divisive figure,"" he said.

GAZA (Reuters) - Palestinian Zeyad Abu Odah watched with a smile as his four-storey house, destroyed in an Israeli air strike in last May's fierce fighting, was slowly being rebuilt in Gaza's Beach refugee camp.
He is one of the lucky few. Only 50 of 1,650 homes wrecked in an 11-day war between Gaza militants and Israel are being restored, leading to frustration among Palestinians at the slow pace of reconstruction eight months after the conflict ended.
""When things started to move, we began to feel better. In six to seven months we will return to our house with our children and families,"" Abu Odah, 60, said, as construction workers put the finishing touches to the first floor.
Abu Odah's extended family of 50 members has been living in four separate homes since the conflict.
Gaza officials estimate that it will take $479 million to rebuild homes and infrastructure damaged in the war. Qatar and Egypt have each pledged $500 million for reconstruction in the Gaza Strip, which is run by the Hamas militant group.
Naji Sarhan, Gaza's deputy housing minister, said only $100 million had been made available so far and that, with Qatari funds, reconstruction had begun on 50 of 1,650 destroyed homes. Sarhan cited Israeli pressures, but did not elaborate.
""It is clear the Israeli occupation is exerting political pressure and making obstacles,"" he told Reuters.
COGAT, the Israeli Defence Ministry's liaison office to the Palestinians, did not respond to a request for comment.
Israel, which controls the main commercial crossing into Gaza, has said reconstruction would be linked to achieving a deal for the handover of two Israeli civilians and the bodies of two Israeli soldiers believed to be held by Hamas.
But in an apparent bid to lower tensions with the group, it recently allowed more construction materials into Gaza to rebuild homes destroyed or damaged during last year's war.
LACK OF ARAB SUPPORT
Sarhan also pointed at the lack of broader Arab and international support for the reconstruction process beyond Qatar, Egypt and the United Nations.
""Reconstruction process is slow and doesn't meet our ambitions,"" Sarhan said.
Israeli air strikes partly damaged another 59,000 homes during the conflict, according to Gaza's Hamas-run government. Some homes in Israel were damaged by rockets launched by the Islamist Hamas and by fellow militant groups.
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency UNRWA, which aids two thirds of Gaza's two million people, has also helped repair the damaged houses of refugees.
Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said the group had conveyed to Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations its displeasure with the pace of reconstruction, blaming it on Israeli restrictions.
""Continuing at this pace means the continuation of the suffering of the Palestinian people and therefore, there can't be a real calm as long as this continues this way,"" said Qassem.
Egyptian bulldozers and engineers have begun work in the northern Gaza Strip at the first of three large housing projects funded by Cairo.
Sarhan said the Egyptian ""cities"" would house nearly 4,000 families. There was no time frame for when construction would finish.

The cities would serve low-income people as well as hardship cases and some of those who had lost their homes in the conflict, he added.
Palestinian officials say 250 people, including 66 children, were killed by Israeli air strikes on Gaza in May. Israeli officials say 13 people, including two children, were killed in Israel by Palestinian rockets.

In contrast to what Human Rights Executive Director Kenneth Roth described as former U.S. President Donald Trump's ""embrace of friendly autocrats"", Biden took office in January 2021 with a pledge to put human rights at the center of his foreign policy.
""But he continued to sell arms to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Israel despite their persistent repression,"" Roth wrote in Human Rights Watch's annual World Report, released on Thursday.
""Other Western leaders displayed similar weakness in their defense of democracy,"" Roth wrote, naming French President Emmanuel Macron and former German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Roth also said that during key summits Biden ""seemed to lose his voice when it came to public denunciation of serious human rights violations.""
""The U.S. State Department has issued occasional protests about repression in certain countries, and in extreme cases the Biden administration introduced targeted sanctions on some officials responsible, but the influential voice of the president was often missing,"" he wrote.

U.S. officials have defended the Biden administration's record, saying diplomats have frequently raised human rights concerns with foreign leaders, including in difficult talks with adversaries including China and Russia.
""If democracies are to prevail in the global contest with autocracy, their leaders must do more than spotlight the autocrats' inevitable shortcomings. They need to make a stronger, positive case for democratic rule,"" Roth said.

251,"<span>Jan 13, 2022 04:16AM ET</span>","LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's premiership was in the balance on Thursday as he faced calls from within his Conservative Party to resign after he admitted attending a party at his official residence during a coronavirus lockdown.
Johnson on Wednesday issued ""heartfelt apologies"" for attending the gathering at Downing Street in May 2020, telling parliament he understood the public's rage at the revelations.
Senior ministers rallied around to offer support to their leader, who won a landslide election victory in 2019, although media said the backing of finance minister Rishi Sunak, regarded as a potential successor to Johnson, appeared lukewarm. 
Others were more direct. The Conservatives' leader in Scotland, along with a handful of other prominent lawmakers, called for Johnson to resign, saying his position was untenable.
""The mood isn't great,"" Conservative member of parliament Jake Berry told BBC radio.
""There is a lot of concern amongst my colleagues about the damage that these revelations are doing to the Conservative Party. But I think yesterday there was a bit of a turning point of opinion.""
Johnson admitted for the first time on Wednesday he had joined a gathering held in the garden of Downing Street on May 20, 2020, saying he had stayed for about 25 minutes to thank staff at what he thought was a work event. He said he regretted his action. 
Media reports have said tables in the garden were set out for food and wine, while an invitation sent to around 100 people suggested taking advantage of the lovely weather. ""Bring your own booze"", it said. 
At the time, social contact was limited to a bare minimum and many people were furious that they had been unable to visit loved ones on their deathbeds or attend funerals.
In response to opponents' demands for his resignation, Johnson said people needed to wait for the outcome of an internal investigation being carried out by senior civil servant Sue Gray, whose report is expected in the next two weeks. 
The revelation about the party follows similar allegations about rule-breaking by Johnson and his officials earlier in May 2020 and during a Christmas lockdown at the end of that year. 
A string of scandals including accusations of corruption and ""sleaze"", or self-serving dishonesty, have angered the public and the government's handling of COVID-19 and its awarding of contracts for protective equipment have been widely criticised.
A YouGov poll for the Times newspaper, carried out before Johnson's apology, put the opposition Labour Party 10 percentage points ahead of the Conservatives, whose lead has evaporated.
The Conservative Party is notoriously ruthless in dispensing with leaders who are feared to damage their electoral chances, most recently forcing Theresa May from power after three years amid bitter internal squabbles over Brexit.
To trigger a leadership challenge, 54 of the 360 elected Conservative members of parliament (MPs) must write letters of no confidence to the chairman of the party's ""1922 Committee"", with a small number saying they had already penned such letters.

Many MPs are said to be waiting for the outcome of Gray's report before taking any action, newspapers said, while May's local council elections could also be crucial in determining whether Johnson will face an insurrection.
""I think Boris Johnson is the right person to be the prime minister of our country, I think he is the prime minister who will win the next general election,"" Northern Ireland minister Brandon Lewis told BBC TV.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration on Wednesday imposed its first sanctions over North Korea's weapons programs following a series of North Korean missile launches, including two since last week.
The sanctions targeted six North Koreans, one Russian and a Russian firm Washington said were responsible for procuring goods for the programs from Russia and China.
The U.S. Treasury said the steps aimed both to prevent the advancement of North Korea's programs and to impede its attempts to proliferate weapons technologies.
The United States also proposed that five of those individuals also be blacklisted by the United Nations Security Council, which would need consensus agreement by the body's 15-member North Korea sanctions committee. 
The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has sought unsuccessfully to engage Pyongyang in dialogue to persuade it to give up its nuclear bombs and missiles since taking office in January last year.
U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said the United States remained committed to pursuing diplomacy with North Korea.
""What we have seen in recent days ... only underscores our belief that if we are going to make progress, that we will need to engage in that dialogue,"" he told a regular news briefing. 
The Treasury Department said the sanctions followed six North Korean ballistic missile launches since September, each of which violated U.N. Security Council resolutions.
South Korea, a U.S. ally that has pushed Washington to back more engagement with North Korea, said it did not believe the move meant that Biden's administration had hardened its position.
""We think the U.S. measure reflected the existing U.S. position that implementing sanctions is also important, together with dialogue,"" a South Korean foreign ministry spokesperson told a briefing.
U.S. Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson said the moves targeted North Korea's ""continued use of overseas representatives to illegally procure goods for weapons."" 
North Korea's latest launches were ""further evidence that it continues to advance prohibited programs despite the international community's calls for diplomacy and denuclearization,"" Nelson said in a statement.
It said the State Department had designated Russia-based North Korean Choe Myong Hyon, Russian national Roman Anatolyevich Alar and the Russian firm Parsek LLC for ""activities or transactions that have materially contributed to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or their means of delivery.""
It said Choe Myong Hyon, a Vladivostok-based representative of North Korea’s Second Academy of Natural Sciences (SANS), had worked to procure telecommunications-related equipment from Russia.
Four China-based North Korean representatives of SANS-subordinate organizations - Sim Kwang Sok, Kim Song Hun, Kang Chol Hak and Pyon Kwang Chol - and one other Russia-based North Korean, O Yong Ho, were also targeted. 
Sim Kwang Sok, based in Dalian, had worked to procure steel alloys and Kim Song Hun, who was based in Shenyang, software and chemicals, Treasury said.
In a statement, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said that between at least 2016 and 2021, O Yong Ho had worked with Parsek LLC and Alar, the firm's director for development, to procure multiple goods with ballistic missile applications, including Kevlar thread, aramid fiber, aviation oil, ball bearings, and precision milling machines.
ROCKET FUEL MIXTURES
Blinken said Alar also provided O Yong Ho with instructions for creating solid rocket fuel mixtures.
""The procurement and supply relationship between O Yong Ho, Roman Anatolyevich Alar, and Parsek LLC is a key source of missile-applicable goods and technology for the DPRK’s missile program,"" his statement said.
It also said O Yong Ho had worked to procure items including aramid fiber, stainless steel tubes and ball bearings from ""third countries"" it did not name.
North Korea's U.N. mission, Russia and China's embassies in Washington and the Russian firm did not respond to requests for comment.
North Korean media said leader Kim Jong Un observed the test of a hypersonic missile on Tuesday, the second in less than a week after he vowed in a New Year speech to bolster the military with cutting-edge technology.
Tuesday's test came hours after the U.S. mission to the United Nations, joined by Albania, France, Ireland, Japan and the United Kingdom, condemned last week's launch and called on U.N. states to fulfill sanctions obligations.
U.N. resolutions ban North Korean ballistic missile and nuclear tests and impose sanctions.
Anthony Ruggiero, a sanctions expert in the former Trump administration that failed to persuade Kim to roll back his nuclear program despite unprecedented engagement, called the new sanctions ""a good start.""
However, he said the Biden administration had allowed a reversal of sanctions pressure and added: ""Biden needs to continue the designations to increase the pressure on the Kim regime.""

Price did not respond when asked why no Chinese individuals or entities were targeted, or specifically when asked if China and Russia were doing enough to enforce sanctions, but stressed the importance of all U.N. states doing so, while adding: ""Obviously we've not seen all of that.""
Wednesday's actions freeze any U.S.-related assets of those targeted and prohibit all dealings with them.

Holmes plans to ask the judge overseeing her case to overturn her convictions, according to court filings. If he does not, she is likely to appeal and could seek to suspend her sentence until a final ruling.
The former entrepreneur became a Silicon Valley celebrity after claiming Theranos machines could run common blood tests on a few drops from a finger prick. Once valued at $9 billion, Theranos collapsed after the Wall Street Journal published a series of articles, starting in 2015, that suggested its devices were flawed and inaccurate.
Holmes was indicted in 2018 on allegations of defrauding investors and patients. Last week, a jury convicted her on four investor-related charges, acquitted her on four patient-related charges and deadlocked on three other counts.

Holmes had agreed with prosecutors that her sentencing should occur in September, given ""ongoing proceedings in a related matter.""
The trial of former Theranos executive Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani is scheduled to begin on March 9.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Britain's Prince Andrew failed to persuade a U.S. judge to dismiss Virginia Giuffre's lawsuit accusing the Duke of York of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager.
In a decision made public on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan said Giuffre, 38, could pursue claims that Andrew battered her and intentionally caused her emotional distress while the late financier Jeffrey Epstein was trafficking her.
The Manhattan judge said it was premature to assess Andrew's efforts to ""cast doubt"" on those claims, though the 61-year-old prince could do so at a trial.
Kaplan said it was also too soon to decide whether Giuffre's 2009 civil settlement https://www.reuters.com/world/us/prince-andrew-accusers-deal-with-epstein-be-made-public-part-civil-suit-2022-01-03 with Epstein ""clearly and unambiguously"" shielded Andrew from her lawsuit.
The judge did not address the merits of Giuffre's claims.
Lawyers for Andrew did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
David Boies, a lawyer for Giuffre, in a statement said his client was pleased, and ""looks forward to a judicial determination"" of the merits of her claims.
Andrew, the second son of Queen Elizabeth, has denied Giuffre's accusations https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/prince-andrew-is-sued-by-jeffrey-epstein-accuser-over-alleged-sexual-abuse-2021-08-09 that he forced her to have sex more than two decades ago at a London home of former Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and abused her at two Epstein properties.
Kaplan's decision keeps the case on track for a trial that he has said could begin between September and December 2022 if no settlement were reached.
URGENCY TO SETTLE
Sarah Krissoff, a partner at Day Pitney and a former federal prosecutor, said the decision made it more likely Andrew would pursue an out-of-court settlement.
""I can't imagine that Prince Andrew wants every detailed allegation to come out in the public realm,"" she said. ""If I were on Prince Andrew's team, I most certainly would be having a discussion with him right now about resolving this case.""
In the 2009 settlement, Epstein paid Giuffre $500,000, without admitting liability, to end her Florida lawsuit accusing him of sexually abusing her when she was underage.
Giuffre's claims against Andrew have not been proven, and the prince is not accused of criminal wrongdoing.
The case and Andrew's ties to Epstein have nevertheless damaged the prince's reputation and cost him many royal duties.
Andrew's troubles grew after critics said he failed in a 2019 BBC interview https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-royals-andrew/britains-prince-andrew-categorically-denies-sex-claims-idUSKBN1XP2CX to appear sympathetic toward Epstein's abuse victims.
A spokesman for Buckingham Palace declined to comment on Kaplan’s decision.
Epstein killed himself at age 66 in a Manhattan jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.
Maxwell, 60, was convicted https://www.reuters.com/world/us/maxwell-jury-resume-deliberations-after-judge-warns-omicron-risk-2021-12-29 on Dec. 29 of recruiting and grooming girls for Epstein to abuse between 1994 and 2004.
She is seeking a new trial after one juror told media, including Reuters https://www.reuters.com/world/us/some-ghislaine-maxwell-jurors-initially-doubted-accusers-juror-says-2022-01-05, that during jury deliberations he had discussed being a victim of sexual abuse.
'MUDDLED' SETTLEMENT 
In his 44-page decision, Kaplan said the ""muddled"" language in Giuffre's and Epstein's settlement agreement suggested they may have reached ""something of a middle ground.""
The settlement included language to ""forever discharge"" various people who ""could have been included as a potential defendant"" in Giuffre's lawsuit against Epstein.
""We do not know what, if anything, went through the parties' minds"" when drafting the settlement, Kaplan wrote.
Giuffre and Andrew ""have articulated at least two reasonable interpretations of the critical language,"" the judge continued. ""The agreement therefore is ambiguous.""
Settlement agreements can restrict plaintiffs like Giuffre from pursuing further litigation, even against third parties.
Kaplan also rejected Andrew's claim that letting Giuffre sue violated his due process rights under New York's constitution.

Giuffre sued Andrew last August, less than a week before the expiration of a state law giving accusers a two-year window to sue over alleged child abuse occurring long ago.
Kaplan called that window, which was extended by a year because of the COVID-19 pandemic, ""a reasonable measure for remedying injustice to victims"" of child sex abuse.

NEW DELHI(Reuters) -China has accelerated settlement-building along its disputed border with Bhutan, with more than 200 structures, including two-storey buildings, under construction in six locations, according to satellite image analysis conducted for Reuters.
The images and analysis supplied to Reuters by U.S. data analytics firm HawkEye 360, which uses satellites to gather intelligence on ground-level activities, and vetted by two other experts, provide a detailed look into China's recent construction along its frontier with Bhutan.
Construction-related activity in some of the locations along Bhutan's western border has been under way since early 2020, with China initially building tracks and clearing out areas, based on material provided by satellite imagery firms Capella Space and Planet Labs, said Chris Biggers, the mission applications director at HawkEye 360. 
Images show the work speeded up in 2021. Smaller structures were erected - possibly to house equipment and supplies - followed by the laying of foundations and then the construction of buildings, Biggers said.
""To me, 2021 was the period for acceleration,"" Biggers said.
Two other experts who studied the locations of the new construction and recent satellite images taken by Capella Space said all six settlements appear to be in territory disputed by China and Bhutan - including a contested tract of roughly 110 square kilometres - with little in the way of resources or native population.
""It is Bhutan's policy not to talk about boundary issues in the public,"" Bhutan's foreign ministry said in response to questions from Reuters. The ministry declined to comment further.
The construction suggests that China is bent on resolving its border claims by giving its ambitions concrete form, said the experts and one Indian defence source.
China's foreign ministry said the construction is ""entirely for the improvement of the working and living conditions of the local people.""
""It is within China's sovereignty to carry out normal construction activities on its own territory,"" the ministry said. The ministry declined to comment further.
The villages also offer Beijing some strategic value, two of the experts say. The new construction is 9 to 27km from the Doklam area at the junction of the borders of India, Bhutan and China, where Indian and Chinese troops were locked in standoff for more than two months in 2017.
The settlements would allow China to better control and monitor far-flung areas, and potentially use them to establish security-focused installations, according to one expert and the Indian defence source.
India's foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
Bhutan, a country of less than 800,000 people, has been negotiating with Beijing for almost four decades to settle their 477-km border. At issue for Bhutan is not just territorial integrity, but also concerns over the potential security implications for India, which is the Himalayan kingdom's main ally and economic partner.
The Bhutanese foreign ministry said Bhutan and China had agreed during the latest round of boundary negotiations in April 2021 to speed up the process of resolving their differences. It declined to discuss the details of the plan to do so.
""All issues are discussed between Bhutan and China within the framework of the Boundary Talks,"" the ministry said. 
""China's village building across the claimed Bhutan border appears to be designed to force Bhutan to yield to Chinese demands in their border negotiations, now in their 24th round after 37 years,"" said Robert Barnett, a professorial research associate at SOAS University of London, who is an expert on Tibet and has studied the China-Bhutan border closely.
BORDER VILLAGES
The settlements appear part of a plan Beijing made public in 2017 to build more than 600 villages in border areas in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), which lies on the Chinese side of the disputed border, said Barnett and M. Taylor Fravel, director of the Security Studies Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
Fravel said the construction indicated China likely wanted to consolidate its control and improve infrastructure in border areas.
The Chinese-controlled TAR was established in 1965, six years after the Dalai Lama fled Tibet in the wake of a failed uprising against Chinese rule.
Some of the villages near the border are built where there has been no previous construction. China's government gives residents subsidies to settle there, Barnett said.
""All the cross-border villages in the western Bhutan sector are sited in areas where no natural village would be found, since these areas are barely habitable,"" he said. 
CHICKEN'S NECK
Control over the remote Doklam plateau would potentially give China greater access to the adjoining ""Chicken's Neck"" area, a strategic strip of land that connects India to its northeastern region.
India shares an unsettled 3,500-km border with China. Troops from both countries remain deployed near each other in a separate border dispute in the Ladakh region - about 1,100km from Doklam - where they clashed in hand-to-hand combat in 2020.
India has been closely monitoring Chinese construction along its borders, the Indian defence source said, declining to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The satellite imagery suggests that neither India nor Bhutan has responded on the ground to China's construction activities, Biggers said.

Nathan Ruser, a researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute research organisation, added that it would be a challenge for India and Bhutan to counter the Chinese construction.
""Any action taken against these Chinese installations would necessarily put civilian populations at risk,"" Ruser said. ""It limits the ways in which India and Bhutan are able to combat Chinese encroachment into disputed territories.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -NATO said on Wednesday it was willing to talk to Russia about arms control and missile deployments to avert the risk of war in Europe, but Moscow said the situation was ""very dangerous"" and the way forward was unclear.
The gulf between Russia's position and that of the United States and its allies appeared as stark as ever after four hours of talks in Brussels, the second attempt this week to defuse a crisis provoked by the massing of Russian troops near Ukraine.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance was willing to hold arms talks but would not allow Moscow to veto Ukraine's ambition to join NATO one day - a core demand on which Russia says it will not yield.
""There is a real risk for new armed conflict in Europe,"" Stoltenberg told a news conference.
""There are significant differences between NATO allies and Russia,"" he said. ""Our differences will not be easy to bridge.""
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said Moscow was ready to talk about weapons deployment and verification measures, but would not allow its proposals to be cherry-picked.
'VULNERABILITIES'
At a lengthy news conference, Grushko said Russia could not take seriously NATO's claim to be a defensive alliance that posed no threat to it, and said it would respond symmetrically to any attempt to contain or intimidate it.
""If there is a search for vulnerabilities in the Russian defence system, then there will also be a search for vulnerabilities in NATO,"" he said.
""This is not our choice, but there will be no other path if we fail to reverse the current very dangerous course of events.""
Grushko later said Moscow would use military means to neutralise security threats if diplomacy proved insufficient. 
Interfax news agency quoted Russian Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin as saying NATO's ""ignoring"" of Russian security proposals created the risk of ""incidents and conflicts"".
This week's talks - beginning with a Russia-U.S. meeting in Geneva on Monday and due to continue on Thursday in Vienna at the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe - come at one of the most fraught moments in East-West relations since the Cold War.
Russia denies planning to invade Ukraine but says it needs a series of guarantees for its own security, including a halt to further NATO expansion and a withdrawal of alliance forces from central and eastern European nations that joined it after 1997.
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman reiterated that those demands were ""non-starters"".
'INTIMIDATION?'
Sherman told reporters it was hard to understand why a nuclear-armed Russia felt threatened by its much smaller neighbour and why it was conducting live-fire exercises near its border with Ukraine.
""Is this about invasion? Is this about intimidation? Is this about trying to be subversive? I don't know, but it is not conducive to getting to diplomatic solutions,"" she said.
Russia had not given any commitment to de-escalate, she said, but nor had it said it would not do so.
Despite the gulf in positions, Stoltenberg said it was positive that all 30 NATO allies and Russia had ""sat down around the same table and engaged on substantive topics"".

Grushko said he could not recall such a sharp and frank discussion with NATO. He said progress was possible, but there were some areas where Russia could not step back.
He said Moscow wanted written answers from NATO on its proposals and to hear from the alliance how it would implement them or - if not - why it could not do that.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. prosecutors have charged a man with supplying performance-enhancing drugs to athletes at the Tokyo Olympics, a first under a federal law allowing criminal charges against doping conspirators at events involving U.S. athletes, broadcasters and sponsors.
The U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan said Eric Lira, 41, distributed drugs, including human growth hormone, ""for the purpose of corrupting"" the Tokyo games.
Lira obtained misbranded versions of prescription drugs used to boost production of red blood cells from Central and South America and distributed them to two athletes, prosecutors said.
One of the athletes believed to be discussed in the criminal complaint but not identified there by name is Nigerian sprinter Blessing Okagbare.
She was provisionally banned by an international anti-doping entity, the Athletics Integrity Unit https://www.athleticsintegrity.org (AIU), after testing positive for human growth hormone.
Lira was charged under the Rodchenkov Act, a law enacted at the end of 2020 and named for Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov. It lets prosecutors seek prison terms of up to 10 years and fines of up to $1 million for offenders.
The charges against Lira marked the first U.S. criminal accusations of doping related to the Tokyo games, which were scheduled for 2020 but delayed to the summer of 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""The Games offered thousands of athletes validation after years of training,"" Damian Williams, the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement. ""Eric Lira schemed to debase that moment by peddling illegal drugs."" 
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), which had voiced concerns about the Rodchenkov Act, said in an email to Reuters it, ""welcomes efforts by governments to penalize those who are trafficking or distributing prohibited substances.""
The head of the AIU, Brett Clothier, said: ""Collaboration between law enforcement and anti-doping agencies can considerably strengthen the ability to detect serious doping, as is alleged in this case."" 
Lira, an El Paso, Texas-based therapist, was arrested on Wednesday.
Appearing via Zoom before U.S. Magistrate Judge Miguel Torres in El Paso, Lira, wearing a dark blue button-down t-shirt and surgical face mask, said he was ""not very aware of the charges"" and was in the process of hiring a private lawyer. 
Torres scheduled a bail hearing for Jan. 18, and turned Lira over to the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service.
'HUGE WIN'
Travis Tygart, chief executive of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, in a statement called the charges ""a huge win for all clean athletes and those who value fair sport.""
Prosecutors said they had obtained encrypted messages in which Lira and one of the athletes discussed the athlete's performance running the 100 meters, suggesting the athlete was a sprinter involved in the athletics competition. 
""Eric my body feel so good (sic), I just ran 10.63 with a 2.7 wind, I'm so happy,"" the athlete wrote to Lira on June 22, 2021, according to one of the messages obtained by prosecutors. ""Whatever you did, is working so well.""
Some details in the complaint, including race dates and times and the athlete's suspension, correspond with Okagbare, who had won a silver medal in the long jump at the Beijing Olympics in 2008.
Okagbare did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

She had competed in the 100-meter heats at the Tokyo Olympics and was scheduled to run in the semi-final before being suspended.
The AIU said Okagbare had previously tested positive, and charged her with the presence and use of a prohibited substance following the detection of human growth hormone.

The CECC is concerned that Anta Sports and Hengyuanxiang Group (HYX Group), with which the IOC has contracts to produce uniforms, use cotton from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR).
""Cotton produced in the XUAR is synonymous with forced labor and the systematic repression that takes place there,"" the letter said. 
""Forced labor plays an integral role in the genocide taking place against Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups in the region.""
The IOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The U.S. government and many rights groups say Beijing is carrying out genocide in Xinjiang. China denies the allegations of human rights abuses. 
""Because Anta and HYX Group both continue to use cotton produced in the XUAR, there is a worrisome possibility that IOC personnel or others attending the 2022 Olympic Games will be wearing clothing contaminated by forced labor,"" the CECC added in the letter.
Among the commission's requests of the IOC were to make public a ""certificate of origin"" that HYX Group provided the IOC ""that reportedly confirmed that no forced labor was used"" in its production. 

The CECC also asked the IOC to explain publicly ""assurances"" from Anta Sports that its products were not produced through forced labor.
The Winter Olympics run from Feb. 4-Feb. 20.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Biden administration on Wednesday criticized China's decision to cancel a growing number of flights from the United States to China because of passengers who later tested positive for COVID-19 and warned it could take action in response.
""China’s actions are inconsistent with its obligations under the U.S.-China Air Transport Agreement. We are engaging with the (Chinese government) on this and we retain the right to take regulatory measures as appropriate,"" a U.S. Transportation Department (USDOT) spokesperson said.
China on Wednesday ordered the suspension of six more U.S.-to-China flights in coming weeks after a surge in passengers testing positive for COVID-19, rising to 70 cancellations mandated this year in a schedule that had already been drastically cut back.
The latest suspension affected two United Airlines flights from San Francisco to Shanghai and four China Southern Airlines flights from Los Angeles to Guangzhou.
The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately comment.
Airlines for America, a trade group representing United , Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and others, said U.S. carriers are in ""communication with the U.S. and Chinese governments to identify a path forward that minimizes impact to travelers.""
Beijing and Washington have sparred over air services since the start of the pandemic. 
Before the latest cancellations, three U.S. airlines and four Chinese carriers were operating about 20 flights a week between the countries, well below the figure of more than 100 per week before the pandemic.
China has been suspending flights with other countries, including on Wednesday six total flights from France and Canada.

The number of U.S. flights scrapped has surged since December, as infections caused by the Omicron variant soar to record highs in the United States.
China has all but shut its borders to travelers, cutting total international flights to just 200 a week, or 2% of pre-pandemic levels, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said in September.

DUBAI (Reuters) -Iran and the United States are displaying little flexibility on core issues in indirect nuclear talks, raising questions about whether a compromise can be found soon to renew a 2015 deal that could dispel fears of a wider Middle East war, diplomats say. 
After eight rounds of talks the thorniest points remain the speed and scope of lifting sanctions on Tehran, including Iran's demand for a U.S. guarantee of no further punitive steps, and how and when to restore curbs on Iran's atomic work.
The nuclear deal limited Iran’s uranium enrichment activity to make it harder for it to develop nuclear arms - an ambition Tehran denies - in return for lifting international sanctions.
But former U.S. President Donald Trump ditched the pact in 2018, saying it did not do enough to curb Iran’s nuclear activities, ballistic missile program and regional influence, and reimposed sanctions that badly damaged Iran’s economy.
After waiting for a year, Iran responded to Trump's pressure by gradually breaching the accord, including rebuilding stockpiles of enriched uranium, refining it to higher fissile purity and installing advanced centrifuges to speed up output.
Following months of stop-start talks that began after Joe Biden replaced Trump in the White House, Western officials now say time is running out to resurrect the pact. But Iranian officials deny they are under time pressure, arguing the economy can survive thanks to oil sales to China.
'WE NEED GUARANTEES'
A former Iranian official said Iran's rulers ""are certain that their uncompromising, maximalist approach will give results"". 
France said on Tuesday that despite some progress at the end of December, Iran and world powers were still far away from reviving the deal.
The United States on Wednesday cited ""modest progress"" in recent weeks, but not enough.
""Modest progress is also not sufficient if we are going to"" revive the 2015 deal, State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters.
Iran insists on immediate removal of all Trump-era sanctions in a verifiable process. Washington has said it would remove curbs inconsistent with the 2015 pact if Iran resumed compliance with the deal, implying it would leave in place others such as those imposed under terrorism or human rights measures.
""Americans should give assurances that no new sanctions under any label would be imposed on Iran in future. We need guarantees that America will not abandon the deal again,"" said a senior Iranian official.
Iran's Nournews, a media outlet affiliated to the Supreme National Security Council, reported on Wednesday that Iran's key conditions at the talks ""are assurances and verifications."" 
U.S. officials were not immediately available to comment on the question of guarantees. However, U.S. officials have said Biden cannot promise the U.S. government will not renege on the agreement because the nuclear deal is a non-binding political understanding, not a legally-binding treaty.
Asked to comment on that U.S. constitutional reality, an Iranian official said: ""It's their internal problem"".On the issue of obtaining verification that sanctions have been removed - at which point Iran would have to revive curbs on its nuclear programme - the senior Iranian official said Iran and Washington differed over the timetable.
""Iran needs a couple of weeks to verify sanctions removal (before it reverses its nuclear steps). But the other party says a few days would be enough to load oil on a ship, export it and transfer its money through banking system,"" the official said.
THREATS
Shadowing the background of the talks have been threats by Israel, widely believed to have the Middle East’s only nuclear weaponry but which sees Iran as a existential threat, to attack Iranian nuclear installations if it deems diplomacy ultimately futile in containing Tehran’s atomic abilities and potential.
Iran says it would hit back hard if it were attacked. 
A Western diplomat said ""early-February is a realistic end-date for Vienna talks"" as the longer Iran remains outside the deal, the more nuclear expertise it will gain, shortening the time it might need to race to build a bomb if it chose to.
""Still we are not sure whether Iran really wants a deal,"" said another Western diplomat.
Iran has ruled out adhering to any ""artificial"" deadline. 
""Several times, they asked Iran to slow down its nuclear work during the talks, and even Americans conveyed messages about an interim deal through other parties,"" said a second Iranian official, close to Iran's negotiating team. 
""It was rejected by Iran."" 
Asked for comment, a State Department spokesperson who declined to be identified told Reuters: ""Of course we — and the whole international community — want Iran to slow down their nuclear program and have communicated that very clearly."" 
""Beyond that, we don’t negotiate the details in public, but these reports are far off.""
Other points of contention include Iran's advanced nuclear centrifuges, the machines that purify uranium for use as fuel in atomic power plants or, if purified to a high level, weapons. 

""Discussions continue on Iran's demand to store and seal its advanced centrifuges ... They wanted those centrifuges to be dismantled and shipped abroad,"" the first official said. 
Asked to comment on this question, a Western diplomat said: ""We are looking for ways to overcome our differences with Iran about verification process"".

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. lawmakers gathered to honor former U.S. Senator Harry Reid, as his body lay in state in the rotunda of the Capitol in Washington on Wednesday, part of a tribute paid to the Democratic majority leader who died on Dec. 28.
The Nevada statesman, who was 82 when he died after a battle with pancreatic cancer, was known as an influential and pugnacious fighter during an era of deepening partisanship in Washington.
Reid helped secure congressional passage of former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law in 2010 over sharp opposition from Republicans. Obama said in his eulogy at Reid's funeral last week in Las Vegas that he could not have asked for a better friend.
""Without Harry, there would be no Affordable Care Act,"" Obama said. ""Harry refused to give up.""
Reid's body arrived in the Capitol on Wednesday morning, and a ceremony took place with leaders of both parties, Vice President Kamala Harris, and members of Reid's family including his widow and children in attendance.

""Harry was tough as nails, a fighter to his core, but one of the most compassionate individuals you could ever imagine. He was one of the most incredible and generous individuals I've ever met,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a speech at the ceremony. ""The sort of person you come across only a handful of times in your life.""
Reid's body will be removed from the rotunda on Wednesday evening. He is the 34th person to receive the honor of lying in state in the Capitol.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - World tennis No. 1 and vaccine sceptic Novak Djokovic blamed human error on Wednesday for a mistake in his Australian immigration paperwork and apologised for breaking isolation for a photoshoot when he had COVID-19 last month.
The 34-year-old Serbian superstar is chasing a record-breaking 21st men's Grand Slam title at the Australian Open beginning on Monday, but he could be deported by a government unhappy with his medical exemption from inoculation against the coronavirus.
Djokovic was held alongside asylum-seekers at an immigration detention hotel in Melbourne for several days before a judge said that treatment was unreasonable and ordered him freed. 
Though training now for the tournament at Melbourne Park, Djokovic could still have his visa cancelled again if Immigration Minister Alex Hawke exercises discretionary power.
Djokovic's cause was not helped by a mistake in his entry declaration, where the box stating he had not travelled abroad in the two weeks prior to leaving for Australia was ticked.
In fact, he had gone to Spain from Serbia.
""This was submitted by my support team on my behalf - as I told immigration officials on my arrival - and my agent sincerely apologises for the administrative mistake,"" Djokovic said on Instagram.
""This was a human error and certainly not deliberate."" 
Giving wrong information on the form carries a maximum penalty of 12 months' prison plus a fine and potential visa cancellation. 
There is widespread anger over the saga among Australians, who have a 90% vaccination rate among adults.
""I don't like his arrogance,"" said one Melbourne resident, Teyhan Ismain. ""It does seem that he's been telling a few fibs too. So I think he should just probably go back."" 
'ERROR OF JUDGEMENT'
Djokovic was also contrite over an interview and photoshoot for French newspaper L'Equipe on Dec. 18 while infected with COVID-19 for the second time.
""I didn't want to let the journalist down, but did ensure I socially distanced and wore a mask except when my photograph was being taken,"" he said. ""This was an error of judgement.""
The International Tennis Writers Association said it was deeply concerned Djokovic did not inform L'Equipe's team that he had tested positive. ""As journalists, we take great care to adhere to all Covid-19 rules in place and we would expect all players to do the same,"" its co-presidents said in a statement.
Djokovic said he would not comment more on the vaccine controversy out of respect for Australian authorities. ""I just want to have the opportunity to compete (there),"" he posted.
Djokovic's visa was initially cancelled on grounds he was unvaccinated and his exemption - based on having COVID-19 last month - was deemed unsatisfactory. 
He denied media reports he also knew he was infected when he attended a Dec. 17 event in Belgrade to present awards to children. 
""I was asymptomatic and felt good, and I had not received the notification of a positive PCR result until after that event,"" he said, adding that a rapid antigen test before the event was negative. 
However, in an affidavit to an Australian court, Djokovic said he was diagnosed on Dec. 16, the day before.
'ARROGANT, SELFISH INDIVIDUAL'
Fans, including many Serbian Australians, gave him noisy support when he was detained, anti-vaxxers have hailed him as a hero, and his family have portrayed him as a champion for individual rights. 
But Djokovic may face hostility from the crowd if and when he walks out on court.
Australians are battling a wave of the Omicron variant and Melbourne has endured one of the world's strictest lockdowns.
""If an unvaccinated man with untenable views on the science of immunology, who chooses to mix with children without even a mask one day after testing positive to COVID-19, is inexplicably allowed to compete in a sporting event in Melbourne, the holders of tickets to the Australian Open should demand an immediate refund,"" a The Age reader, Dr David Edgar, wrote to the Melbourne-based newspaper.
His was one among a series of mainly angry letters.
There may also be resentment in the dressing room, where all but three of the top 100 men are inoculated 
With sensitivities heightened as governments and medics worldwide push vaccination as the only way out of the pandemic, Australia's top-rating TV network unwittingly revealed passions behind the scenes. 
Two Seven West Media anchors were caught in an expletive-laden ""hot mic"" off-air conversation condemning Djokovic as sneaky.

There was at last some sympathy on the streets though. 
""I'm desperately waiting for him to just come onto the court and play in front of Australian people and entertain us, that's it,"" said Nick Shukla, also in Melbourne.

(Reuters) -The Baltic States are talking to NATO allies about increasing military deployments on their soil to deter Russia, Estonia's prime minister told Reuters on Wednesday, and NATO's chief said any Russian attack on Ukraine would spur a decision.
Russia, which has massed troops on its border with Ukraine, has demanded an end to such deployments and no more expansion of the Western defence alliance. It laid out its demands for security guarantees in Europe to NATO's 30 allies in Brussels on Wednesday.
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said following those talks that reinforcements in eastern NATO member countries would be seriously considered if Russia invaded Ukraine.
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, once ruled from Moscow, have been members of both NATO and the European Union since 2004, and have long sought more NATO involvement. 
""Of course, we are discussing with our allies to increase their presence here to act as a deterrent,"" Estonian premier Kaja Kallas told Reuters in a video interview from Tallinn, without giving any details.
""If you look at the map, the Baltic states are a NATO peninsula and therefore we have our worries"".
Stoltenberg said in Brussels: ""If Russia once again uses force against Ukraine and further invades Ukraine, then we have to seriously look into the need to further increase our presence in the eastern part of the alliance."" 
One NATO diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the issue of more deployments in the Baltics could be discussed by NATO defence ministers when they hold a scheduled meeting in mid-February.
NATO units were deployed in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Poland after Russia annexed the Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. They have just over 1,000 troops each. Kallas said a boost to existing detachments was a possibility.
The West could have constructive talks with Moscow, she said but should also let the Kremlin know that if it escalates the situation in Ukraine there would be a high price to pay in terms of economic sanctions. 

""I think we should not fall into the trap, into discussing what the West could do, because West hasn't done anything wrong,"" Kallas said. ""The West hasn't formed military groups to attack Russia.""
Moscow has denied any aggressive intent and has said it is entitled to station troops where it wants within its borders.

Bolsonaro has railed at justices Luis Roberto Barroso and Alexandre de Moraes for months over rulings against his policies and investigations into the president, including one for spreading fake news over COVID-19.
""Barroso and Alexandre de Moraes want Lula to be president,"" he said in a television interview.
""OK, they might not want to vote for me, but do they want to return to office the man who robbed the nation for eight years?"" Bolsonaro commented.
Lula was president of Brazil from 2003-2010. He spent a year and a half in jail on corruption charges that were annulled by the Supreme Court last year, allowing him to run again this year. Polls show he has a clear lead over Bolsonaro if the October election were held today.

Barroso last month ruled on requiring vaccination proof from all travelers arriving in Brazil, a measure contrary to the views of vaccine-skeptic Bolsonaro.
De Moraes oversees five investigations of the president, including one into his comments falsely associating vaccines against COVID-19 with causing AIDS.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) -A car bomb exploded on a road leading to the airport in the Somali capital Mogadishu on Wednesday, killing at least eight people, the head of the city's ambulance services said.
Mogadishu resident Mohamed Osman said the shock of the blast hit the walls and roof of a mosque he was praying in nearby.
""When I came out of the mosque, I saw several old houses collapsed, body parts on the street, hands, legs,"" Osman told Reuters.
""Destroyed cars, burnt Tuk tuks (rickshaws); all this mess and loss of lives in a minute, I survived."" 
It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the bombing.
Osman said he had seen nine bodies at the scene. Abdikadir Abdirahman, director of Aamin Ambulance service, put the death toll at eight.
""A car bomb targeted a convoy, including bullet proof cars using Avisione street, we do not who owns the convoy. We carried eight dead people from the scene,"" Abdirahman told Reuters.
Earlier, a Reuters photographer saw four bodies and four damaged cars and two motor rickshaws while Ahmed Nur, a shopkeeper nearby, said he had seen at least five bodies.
A paramedic was seen attending to at least one wounded person, Reuters photographs from the scene showed.
In the past, al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab group has taken responsibility for similar attacks.

The group aims to overthrow the central government and impose a strict interpretation of Islamic law. It carries out frequent gun and bomb attacks on security and government targets, but also on civilians. 
It also carries out attacks against African Union peacekeeping troops.

""I've heard he wants to. But like you, I'm waiting for his decision,"" Brigitte Macron told TV channel TF1.
France's president since 2017, Emmanuel Macron is doing little to disguise his desire to stand again. But like many incumbents before him, he is holding back on formally launching his challenge to shorten the campaign and minimise risks.
Macron, who was France's youngest leader since Napoleon when he was elected, is the frontrunner to win the two-round election in polls. However, conservative challenger Valerie Pecresse poses a danger to the 44-year-old if she can beat the far-right into the run-off vote.
The first couple's relationship has captured the public's imagination in France and abroad. Their romance blossomed at a Jesuit college in the provinces where he was a teenage schoolboy and she was a drama teacher 24 years his senior. They married in 2007 after Brigitte divorced her then-husband
""Everyday has its surprises,"" Brigitte Macron said when asked about their relationship.

Lawyers for Brigitte Macron last month said she was launching legal proceedings over the spread of baseless claims https://www.reuters.com/article/france-macron-wife-idUKL8N2T73S6 that she is a transgender woman who was born a man.

(Reuters) - Myanmar's military leader has removed the head of the air force, local media and four sources close to the armed forces said, replacing one of the most senior figures in a junta that has carried out bombing raids to try to crush resistance. 
The sources told Reuters that 57-year-old Maung Maung Kyaw, a general from an elite military background, had been ousted from the post he had held since 2018. 
Two of the sources said he was replaced on Monday by Htun Aung, who had been the air force's chief of staff.
There was no public announcement that Maung Maung Kyaw had been removed and Reuters was unable to establish why junta leader Min Aung Hlaing had removed him. 
Military spokesman Zaw Min Tun did not respond to a request for comment on whether Maung Maung Kyaw had been removed. The spokesman was quoted by local news outlet Eleven Media as saying Maung Maung Kyaw had ended his service after a four-year term.
Reuters was unable to contact Maung Maung Kyaw directly, and requests for comment through the military received no response.
Since the coup on Feb. 1 last year in which an elected government was overthrown, and during the protests that followed the coup, the air force has been used to ferry troops around Myanmar to quell opposition. 
Witnesses say the air force has also been used for bombing raids that have killed civilians. The junta has not commented on the allegations. It says it does not target civilians, only ""terrorists"".
The junta, which has jailed ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi and most of her allies, calls the opposition forces loyal to her deposed government ""terrorists"".
The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a human rights group, says more than 1,400 people have been killed in violence since the coup, including those killed in bombing raids. The junta disputes the reported number of casualties.
Maung Maung Kyaw was the subject of a Reuters investigation https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/myanmar-generals-families last year that revealed his family members, including his son and nephew, were part of a young generation of military families with business interests including supplying the armed forces. 
Photos and postings on social media – showing parties at expensive venues in Singapore and trips to Bangkok, London and Santorini – showed his family members enjoying a lifestyle far out of reach for the vast majority of Burmese.
Maung Maung Kyaw, who has had sanctions https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-usa-sanctions-idUSKBN2AN01D imposed on him by the United States over his role in the coup, did not respond to questions Reuters sent to the military before publication of its investigation.

In recent weeks, aerial bombardment of the town of Loikaw https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/un-rights-envoy-urges-halt-attacks-myanmar-town-residents-trapped-2022-01-10 in eastern Kayah state, bordering Thailand, where ethnic armed groups have joined forces with newly formed anti-coup armed organizations, has forced thousands of people to flee. 
Opponents of the junta say Myanmar's military has sustained heavy losses during the fighting. The junta has not commented on the reports that it has suffered heavy losses.

Austria is bracing for infections to rise far above previous records, in line with what has happened elsewhere in Europe recently. The conservative-led government wants to avoid reintroducing a full lockdown like the one the country emerged from last month, its fourth of the pandemic.
New daily coronavirus infections rose above 17,000 for the first time on Wednesday, to 17,006, data from the interior and health ministries showed. The previous peak was 15,809 on Nov. 19, though figures vary by source - public health agency AGES lists https://covid19-dashboard.ages.at/?l=en the previous peak as 16,474 on Nov. 16.
""We have today roughly 17,000 positive test results in Austria. That is a new record,"" Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein told a news conference, adding that current measures, which include a lockdown https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/austrias-unvaccinated-will-remain-lockdown-next-week-chancellor-says-2021-12-07 for the unvaccinated and a 10 p.m. closing time for bars and restaurants, were the right ones.
""These figures have been forecast for 14 days, so that is no surprise. We have an intensive-care unit occupancy rate of around 12% and regular hospital-bed occupancy has fallen from 3,000 to around 650.""
Newspaper Kronen Zeitung reported earlier on Wednesday that cases had risen above 18,000, citing a national register separate to the ministries' figures.

Although Omicron is more contagious than previous variants, a smaller proportion of people infected require treatment in hospital, but it is still unclear how hospitalisations will evolve, Mueckstein said.
""We have a paradigm shift. We must ensure that we avoid a general lockdown. We must also, however, ensure that Austria keeps running. We must ensure that with so many positive tests people can keep working,"" he said, referring to recently eased quarantine rules.

GENEVA (Reuters) - U.N. agencies on Tuesday asked donors for $4.4 billion in humanitarian aid for Afghanistan in 2022, calling the funds an ""essential stop gap"" to ensure the country's future after a period of turmoil marked by the Taliban's seizure of power and a hasty U.S. exit. 
The United Nations says the appeal, which amounts to nearly a quarter of the country's GDP, is the largest ever sought for a single country and is triple the figure it received in 2021 when the U.S.-backed government collapsed.
""This is a stop gap, an absolutely essential stop gap measure that we are putting in front of the international community today,"" U.N. aid chief Martin Griffiths told reporters in Geneva.
""Without this being funded there won't be a future, we need this to be done otherwise there will be outflow, there will be suffering."" 
The abrupt withdrawal of foreign aid last year following the Taliban victory in August left Afghanistan's fragile economy on the brink of collapse, with food prices rising rapidly and causing widespread hunger. 
Western sanctions aimed at the Taliban also prevented the passage of basic supplies of food and medicine, although this has since eased after exemptions were passed by the U.N. Security Council and Washington in December.
Griffiths, who has been meeting with Taliban officials, said the humanitarian plan had been ""carefully calibrated"" so that aid will go directly to people in need and not to authorities.
Filippo Grandi, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said that improved security presented an opportunity to entice millions of people displaced by the long conflict back home, adding that since the Taliban seized power, 170,000 had returned already.

""The conflict between the Taliban and the previous government is over and that has opened up some space of security which I think we need to take advantage of,"" Grandi said.
""But to do that we need those resources that are part of this appeal.""

SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for boosting the country's strategic military forces as he observed the test of a hypersonic missile https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkorea-launches-possible-ballistic-missile-japan-says-2022-01-10, state media said on Wednesday, officially attending a missile launch for the first time in nearly two years.
On Tuesday authorities in South Korea and Japan detected the suspected launch, which drew condemnation by authorities around the world and prompted an expression of concern from the U.N. secretary-general.
The second test of a ""hypersonic missile"" in less than a week underscored Kim's New Year's vow to bolster the military with cutting-edge technology at a time when talks with South Korea and the United States have stalled.
After watching the test, Kim urged military scientists to ""further accelerate the efforts to steadily build up the country's strategic military muscle both in quality and quantity and further modernize the army,"" KCNA news agency reported.
It was the first time since March 2020 that Kim had officially attended a missile test.
""His presence here would suggest particular attention on this programme,"" Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Unlike some other recent tests, ruling party newspaper Rodong Sinmun published photos of Kim attending the launch on its front page.
""While Kim probably unofficially attended other tests in the interim, this appearance and its Page One feature on Rodong Sinmun is important,"" said Chad O'Carroll, chief executive of Korea Risk Group, which monitors North Korea. ""It means Kim is not concerned about being personally associated (with) tests of major new tech. And doesn't care how the U.S. sees this.""
U.N. Security Council resolutions ban all North Korean ballistic missile and nuclear tests and have imposed sanctions over the programs.
Talks aimed at persuading North Korea to surrender or limit its arsenal of nuclear weapons and missiles have stalled, with Pyongyang saying it is open to diplomacy but only if the United States and its allies stop ""hostile policies"" such as sanctions or military drills.
U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland called the launches dangerous and destabilising.
""It obviously takes us in the wrong direction,"" she said at a regular briefing in Washington on Tuesday. ""As you know, the United States has been saying since this administration came in that we are open to dialogue with North Korea, that we are open to talking about COVID and humanitarian support, and instead they're firing off missiles.""
The European Union on Tuesday condemned the latest North Korean missile launch as a ""threat to international peace and security"" and called on Pyongyang to resume diplomacy. 
'SUPERIOR MANOEUVERABILITY'
Despite their name, analysts say the main feature of hypersonic weapons is not speed - which can sometimes be matched or exceeded by traditional ballistic missile warheads - but their manoeuvrability, which makes them an acute threat to missile defence systems.
Photos released by state media appeared to show the same type of missile and warhead that was first tested last week, analysts said.
""The test-fire was aimed at the final verification of overall technical specifications of the developed hypersonic weapon system,"" KCNA reported.
After its release from the rocket booster, a hypersonic glide vehicle made a 600 km (375 mile) ""glide jump flight"" and then 240 km of ""corkscrew manoeuvering"" before hitting a target in the sea 1,000 km away, the report said.
South Korean officials had questioned https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/skorea-casts-doubts-north-koreas-hypersonic-missile-claims-2022-01-07 the capabilities of the missile after the first test last week, saying it did not appear to demonstrate the range and manoeuverability claimed in a state media report and featured a manoeuverable warhead rather than an actual glide vehicle.

On Tuesday, however, South Korea said the second test appeared to show improved performance, with the missile reaching top speeds up to 10 times the speed of sound (12,348 km per hour / 7,673 miles per hour), although they did not comment on its manoeuverability.
""The superior manoeuverability of the hypersonic glide vehicle was more strikingly verified through the final test-fire,"" KCNA said.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina is facing a historic heat wave with temperatures soaring above 40 degrees Celsius (104°F), making the country for a while the hottest place on the planet, straining power grids and forcing residents to seeking sanctuary in the shade.
With temperatures up around 45°C (113°F) in parts of the South American nation, hundreds of thousands of people were left without electricity when power grids failed in and around populous capital city Buenos Aires.
""I came home and we were without electricity and the house was a furnace,"" said Jose Casabal, 42, who whisked his children off to find somewhere to cool down. ""So I took them off to their grandmother's house to swim in the pool.""
The temperatures in Argentina, where dry hot weather driven by the La Nina weather pattern is already hitting crops, meant that for several hours it was the hottest place on earth, taking over from parts of Australia that cooled during its night.
""Even early morning it was very hot, around 31 degrees,"" said Gustavo Barrios, 34, from Tigre as he sat in the shadow of some trees. ""I do not have air conditioning at home and we were with just the fan blowing hot air. It's unbearable.""
Local leaders warned residents to stay out of the sun in the hottest part of the day, wear light clothes and stay hydrated.
""We have to be very careful these days,"" said Buenos Aires city mayor Horacio Rodriguez Larreta. 
Meteorologist Lucas Berengua said that the heat wave was off the charts and could set records in the country.
""This is a heat wave of extraordinary characteristics, with extreme temperature values ​​that will even be analyzed after its completion, and it may generate some historical records for Argentina temperatures and persistence of heat,"" he said.
For some it raised questions about climate change and more extreme weather. Argentina in recent years has seen unusual amounts of wild fires around its main river delta and the major Parana River drop to a nearly 80-year low water level.

""I was always born here in a temperate climate and I saw how the temperature changed over the years, and it is not what we're used to,"" said Marta Lorusso, 59, an architect.
""This with the low pressure really kills me, I can't stand it. I drink liters of water and do what I can. And on top of it all, without electricity. I don't know what to do.""

The statement came as Australia's Immigration Minister Alex Hawke was considering whether to cancel the world no.1 tennis player's visa ahead of the Australian Open, which starts on Jan. 17, amid controversy over whether he was eligible for a medical exemption from the country's COVID-19 vaccine requirements.
""I want to emphasise that I have tried very hard to ensure the safety of everyone and my compliance with testing obligations,"" Djokovic said in a statement on his Instagram account.

Amid questions about his Australian Travel Declaration where he had to state whether he had travelled within 14 days of coming to Australia, he said his agent accidentally ticked the wrong box on the form.

BELGRADE (Reuters) - Novak Djokovic was in Serbia in the two weeks before flying to the Australian Open from Spain, according to three Belgrade residents, whose accounts to Reuters backed social media posts that contradict information contained in his immigration declaration on arrival in Melbourne.
The accounts from two eyewitnesses and another individual, obtained by Reuters on Tuesday and previously unreported, corroborated earlier social media posts that appear to show Djokovic in Belgrade less than two weeks before he headed to Spain and then on to Australia.
These accounts of his travel history are at odds with a declaration submitted as part of immigration formalities for Djokovic's entry to Australia that stated he had not travelled in the 14 days prior to leaving for Australia.
Giving false or misleading information in the form is an offence, carrying a maximum penalty of 12 months in prison, and a fine of up to 6,600 Australian dollars (US$4,730) and can lead to cancellation of the offender's visa.
Djokovic, the world number one in men's tennis, is in Australia to play in next week's Australian Open. The federal government cancelled his visa when he landed, on the grounds he has not had a COVID-19 vaccination and his medical exemption was not satisfactory. 
A judge on Monday quashed that decision after Djokovic made a successful legal challenge. But the Australian government said it was considering whether to use discretionary powers to cancel Djokovic's visa.
Two representatives for Djokovic, and his Australian lawyers, did not respond to emailed requests for comment on his movements in the 14 days before Jan. 5, and about the information given in the immigration form. 
Djokovic's father, Srdjan Djokovic, responding to Reuters questions, sent a statement which said: ""If anything had not been cleared up as some journalists stipulate, the verdict would have been different.""
Three separate social media posts have purported to show Djokovic photos and video of Djokovic in Belgrade and were posted on Dec. 25. It has not been possible to independently verify when and where the images were recorded.
However, two eyewitnesses who spoke to Reuters said they saw the athlete in Belgrade on or after Dec. 24, that is within the 14-day window before his arrival in Australia, via Spain. The two witnesses said they could not recall the exact dates they saw the tennis player. A third person confirmed that video of Djokovic posted on social media was recorded on Dec. 25 in Belgrade.
TRAVEL DECLARATION 
Before boarding his Emirates flight to Melbourne, Djokovic – like all travellers to Australia – was required to fill out a form called an Australia Travel Declaration.
Among the questions on that form, Djokovic or his representatives had checked a box stating that he had not, or would not, travel in the 14 days prior to his flight to Australia, according to a copy of the completed form submitted to the Australian federal court by his lawyers as part of his legal challenge.
Djokovic told Australian authorities that when he arrived in Australia on Jan. 5, he had travelled there from Spain, according to documents his lawyers submitted to the court and seen by Reuters.
In order to have not travelled in the 14 days prior to his flight to Australia, Djokovic needed to have been in Spain from Dec. 23 at the latest. 
Asked to comment on whether it was investigating if Djokovic’s form contained misleading information, the Australian Border Force said it did not comment on operational matters.
It said that as part of Australia's response to the COVID-19 Omicron variant, it is an enforceable requirement that travellers, among other things, ""make a declaration setting out their travel history for the 14 days before their scheduled flight"".
STREET TENNIS
Part of the evidence placing Djokovic in Serbia within the 14-day window before he went to Australia centres around a video of an impromptu tennis match showing Djokovic playing with an unidentified individual on Dec. 25 on a Belgrade street.
The video posted on the Instagram account of Belgrade real estate executive Igor Rogan showed someone matching Djokovic’s description, wearing jeans and a raincoat, playing tennis in a street. Reuters identified the location as West 65, a high-end apartment complex in Belgrade’s Novi Beograd district. A branch of Rogan's real estate firm can be seen in the background.
The video was posted on Dec. 25, with a caption saying it was recorded on the same day. When the firm was contacted by Reuters, a female employee at the company where Rogan works said the branch in West 65 was open for business on Dec. 25 and that Rogan recorded the video in Belgrade the same day.
""I remember it was on the Catholic Christmas,"" she said. Orthodox Christians, who are the majority in Serbia, celebrate Christmas on Jan. 7. She asked not to be identified. She declined to answer further questions, referring inquiries to Rogan. He told Reuters he did not wish to comment.
The two eyewitnesses who spoke to Reuters, and who declined to be named, said they had seen Djokovic in the vicinity of the same apartment complex. 
The accounts the three individuals provided to Reuters support prior posts on social media.
A picture posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), also on Dec. 25, by a user called Danilo Skerovic showed Djokovic posing with a fan in front of the same apartment block. The tennis player was wearing the same outfit as he had in the video posted by Rogan, with a tennis racket in one hand and a tennis ball in the other. Skerovic did not respond to messages seeking comment.
Another picture of Djokovic was posted on the same day on the Instagram account of Petar Djordjic, an athlete who plays handball for the Serbian national team and the Portuguese club side S. L. Benfica. The photo showed Djokovic, in the same outfit and against the same backdrop, posing alongside Djordjic. Djordjic did not respond to messages sent on Tuesday to his mobile phone number. S. L. Benfica did not respond to a request for comment.
While being interviewed by an immigration official at Melbourne airport, Djokovic said the Australian travel declaration was completed by his agent, according to a transcript of the interview released as part of the legal challenge. Elena Cappellaro, who acts as his agent, did not respond to a request for comment on whether she completed the form. 
Djokovic's case provoked a row between Canberra and Belgrade and fuelled heated debate over mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policies.

Public opinion in Australia, which is battling an Omicron wave of infections and where more than 90% of the adult population is double vaccinated, has been largely against the player. Serbian supporters of the tennis player alleged he was being made a scapegoat by the Australian authorities.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The Hong Kong government is expanding its use of a long-dormant sedition law in what some lawyers and democracy advocates say is intensifying a squeeze on press freedom.
Evidence of the renewed reliance on the sedition legislation came in late December when China-ruled Hong Kong targeted two media outlets. On Dec 29, about 200 police raided the office of online outlet Stand News and arrested seven people, charging two editors with conspiracy to publish ""seditious publications"".
Authorities have not fully detailed what led to the charges. But pro-Beijing media outlets Ta Kung Pao and DotDotNews listed specific Stand News articles that they deemed seditious, including interviews with local democracy activists and opposition figures - topics that until recently were not out of the ordinary in Hong Kong. 
A day earlier, prosecutors levelled a new charge of sedition against Jimmy Lai, 74, founder of the now shuttered Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily newspaper and some of his top executives.
The charge of sedition, inciting resistance or insurrection against central authorities, stems from colonial-era laws designed to thwart dissent against the British crown, and had not been used in Hong Kong since the mid-1960s until recently, three legal scholars interviewed by Reuters say. Last month's sedition charges were the first to be brought against the media since 1967, according to those scholars.
Some legal scholars say recent court judgements have empowered authorities to use the controversial national security law (NSL) imposed on the city by Beijing in 2020, to bolster colonial-era laws, including sedition. 
The security law, enacted after sometimes-violent, pro-democracy protests rocked the city in 2019, gives police extra powers of search, seizure and surveillance and makes it tougher for those arrested to get bail. Only judges selected for national security duties will handle cases under the law.
The sedition law allows officials to directly target the published content of media operations and does not require prosecutors to prove that an offending article or speech was intended to be seditious, according to three lawyers. 
""To some extent, the government is better armed now,"" Simon Young, a professor at the University of Hong Kong's law school, told Reuters. ""The national security law provides an enhanced procedural and investigative framework to bring these charges.""
A barrister whose career has straddled Hong Kong's handover from Britain to China in 1997, said: ""We can see that at a stroke, the NSL has re-tooled these old laws that were largely forgotten. You could say we are now drinking bitter, old colonial wine from new, authoritarian bottles."" 
Asked whether the security legislation had enhanced the powers of colonial-era laws such as sedition, the Hong Kong Department of Justice declined to comment but said the prosecution of offences endangering national security was ""based on admissible evidence"". 
""We express our deep regret regarding the governments, media and organisations of the United States and Western countries in respect of their attempt to twist facts and slandering remarks on the enforcement actions taken in accordance with the law,"" a government spokesman told Reuters. 
The actions against Stand News targeted ""illegal acts"" and had ""nothing to do with freedom of the press"", he added. 
The latest moves extend a media clampdown over the past year that included the shutdown of Apple Daily and the imposition of fresh staff guidelines on public broadcaster RTHK to ensure all content complies with the national security law.
'WALKING ON EGGSHELLS'
A full-page article in the China-backed Ta Kung Pao newspaper last week criticised the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) and the Foreign Correspondents' Club (FCC) for helping to organise a regional human rights press award that honoured journalistic works it said had ""smeared"" the Hong Kong police and Chinese government. 
The newspaper, whose articles have often preceded enforcement actions, called on authorities to investigate.
Asked if the government planned to investigate the FCC and the HKJA, a government spokesman said it did not comment on ""speculation"". ""We will continue to spare no efforts in pursuing the legal liabilities of any organisations and individuals endangering national security."" 
Keith Richburg, the president of the FCC and head of the University of Hong Kong's journalism school, said that the closure of Stand News and arrests ""leaves everyone walking on eggshells ... It's an open question as to whether Hong Kong can continue to thrive and prosper without having that free and open and critical press.""
Ronson Chan, the head of the HKJA, dismissed the Ta Kung Pao allegations, and told Reuters the awards process was ""independent and fair"". 
The government spokesman told Reuters that ""freedom of speech and freedom of the press are not absolute, and can be restricted for reasons including protection of national security,"" adding that ""no one is above the law"".
DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE
Broadly defined by legal scholars as a crime of incitement to resist or insurrect, in words or acts, against legal authority, the sedition laws in Hong Kong and elsewhere have long been seen as British colonial relics overtaken by more modern statutes.
According to Hong Kong's Crimes Ordinance - the legislation that details sedition offences - it is a crime to publish anything that brings ""into hatred or contempt or to excite disaffection against ... the government of Hong Kong"".
Despite the tough language, some lawyers and academics said they had long believed sedition offences would be difficult to enforce. Freedom of speech and other rights protections have been written into more modern laws, including Hong Kong's Bill of Rights and the Basic Law, the former British colony's mini-constitution since its handover to Beijing in 1997. 
Ten academics, criminal lawyers and diplomats interviewed by Reuters said their views had changed because the NSL's powers can be applied to older laws, such as sedition. 
Some provisions of the NSL refer generally to acts ""endangering national security"", which judges have ruled effectively extends the law's reach to cover older, pre-existing laws that involve national security, such as sedition and espionage.
In rulings on pre-trial matters for two separate cases last year, including one involving media tycoon Lai, the Court of Final Appeal said the security law's reference to ""acts endangering national security"" included violations of these older laws.
And a District Court ruling in April noted that under the security law, the older offence of sedition was now classified as an indictable offence, making it a more serious crime with a potentially longer statute of limitations and tougher sentencing guidelines, according to the legal scholars interviewed by Reuters.
In the past, the offence of sedition was classified as a summary offence that would be handled by a lower court magistrate alone, without a jury.
While the government's enforcement hand has been strengthened, the basis on which authorities arrested journalists and charged media organisations still needs to be fully tested in Hong Kong's courts, including the Court of Final Appeal, lawyers, legal scholars and diplomats point out. 

Three criminal barristers said certain exceptions written long ago into the sedition law that authorities are now relying on were good ammunition for defence counsel. 
The Crimes Ordinance states, for example, that it is not seditious to show the sovereign ""has been misled or mistaken in any of (its) measures"" or point out ""matters which are producing ... feelings of ill-will or enmity between different classes of the population of Hong Kong"".

(Reuters) - Prominent U.S. civil rights attorney Ben Crump said on Tuesday he will represent the family of a Black man who was shot dead by an off-duty North Carolina deputy over the weekend in an incident that has drawn protests against police violence. 
The North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) said it is investigating the Saturday killing of Jason Walker, 37, in Fayetteville, a city about 100 miles (161 km) east of Charlotte. The deputy involved, Jeffrey Hash, was put on administrative leave, local media reported. 
Police in Fayetteville say that Walker had run into traffic and jumped on a moving vehicle before being shot by the driver, who they said then called 911.
Fayetteville Police Chief Gina  Hawkins  (NASDAQ:HWKN) later said a black box taken from Hash's pickup truck showed no impact had happened, local media reported. 
Announcing that he had been retained by Walker's family, Crump, who represented the family of George Floyd after he was killed by former Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin, disputed the Fayetteville Police account. 
""At the crux of the matter, was Mr. Walker shot in the back as he tried to return home? His parents lived across the street, less than 100 yards away,"" Crump's firm said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
""We stand committed, with the family and the young son that Jason Walker left behind, to find answers as to what happened to him when he was senselessly shot and killed by off-duty deputy Jeffrey Hash,"" Crump was quoted as saying. 
Reuters was not immediately able to reach Hash or a lawyer representing him for comment.
At a protest outside the Fayetteville Police headquarters on Sunday, demonstrators chanted, ""Say his name! Jason Walker!,"" and heard remarks from a woman who said she was an eyewitness to the incident. She disputed the police account. 
""He was not acting crazy, he didn't jump on traffic. That officer - murderer - shot him, hit him with his car. How would Jason jump onto a big truck?,"" the eyewitness, identified on social media as Elizabeth Ricks, told demonstrators. 

Asked for comment, the FBI said it was aware of the shooting death investigation in Fayetteville and that it is in regular contact with local authorities in North Carolina. 
""If, in the course of the North Carolina SBI investigation, information comes to light of a potential federal violation, the FBI is prepared to investigate,"" FBI spokesperson Shelley Lynch said.

(Reuters) - Republican lawmakers in Florida filed a bill on Tuesday seeking to ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions in cases of serious medical emergencies for the mother or fatal fetal abnormalities. 
The bill, introduced on the first day of the Florida legislature's 2022 session, sets the stage for a battle over abortion access expected to play out in courts and state capitols this year as the United States Supreme Court weighs a case that could overhaul abortion rights.
A 15-week ban would violate the Supreme Court's precedent in Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that established a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy before the fetus is viable, at around 24 weeks. 
But the Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, has given anti-abortion advocates reason to hope that such a ban could soon stand. 
In December, the Supreme Court heard arguments in Mississippi's bid to revive its 15-week ban on abortions, which lower courts had blocked. The conservative justices indicated sympathy toward Mississippi's law, and the court is expected to rule in the spring. 
If the court rules in Mississippi's favor, it will pave the way for states like Florida to successfully defend their pre-viability bans on abortion in court.
The Florida bill is part of a wave of Republican-backed anti-abortion measures pursued around the country in recent years, and more are likely to follow in the run-up to the Supreme Court's decision. Florida law currently bans abortion after 24 weeks. 

Abortion has long been a politically divisive issue in the United States, with abortion opponents concerned about preserving life from conception and abortion rights advocates standing for a woman's bodily autonomy. 
The issue will likely play a prominent role in the 2022 midterm elections to decide control of Congress.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia staged live-fire exercises with troops and tanks near the Ukrainian border on Tuesday while sounding a downbeat note over the prospects for talks with the United States that Washington hopes will remove the possible threat of an invasion of Ukraine.
A day after the U.S. side urged Russia at talks in Geneva to pull back an estimated 100,000 troops from near the border, the defence ministry said about 3,000 servicemen had started combat training including mock battles in four regions of southwestern Russia. 
The drills suggested that the Kremlin has no intention of easing the military pressure that has brought the United States to the negotiating table, where Moscow has presented demands for sweeping security guarantees from the West.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was positive that Monday's talks had been held in an open, substantive and direct manner, but that there was no real cause for optimism.
Russia wants quick results, he said. ""There are no clear deadlines here, no one is setting them - there is just the Russian position that we will not be satisfied with the endless dragging out of this process.""
Peskov said the situation would be clearer after two further rounds of talks that Russia is due to hold this week - with NATO in Brussels on Wednesday and at the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Vienna on Thursday.
U.S. Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland told reporters it was ""disappointing to hear"" the Kremlin found no cause for optimism in the talks, and said Washington wanted the ""constructive"" exchange of views to continue.
Russia staging live-fire exercises ""obviously goes in exactly the opposite direction"" of the de-escalation Washington wants to see, Nuland added.
DEMANDS
Russia has repeatedly said it has no intention of attacking Ukraine but that it has the right to deploy its forces as it deems fit on its own territory.
Moscow insists that the United States and its allies rule out the possibility that Ukraine could ever join NATO, which promised as far back as 2008 to admit Kyiv one day. It also wants NATO to remove forces and weaponry from ex-communist countries that have joined it since the end of the Cold War.
Washington has said it cannot accept these demands, although it is willing to engage on other aspects of Russia's proposals by discussing missile deployments or limits on the size of military exercises.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said after the Geneva talks on Monday that the two sides had ""in some ways opposite views"". He told reporters: ""For us it’s absolutely mandatory to make sure that Ukraine never, never, ever becomes a member of NATO.""
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said: ""We were firm ... in pushing back on security proposals that are simply non-starters to the United States.""
NATO has no immediate plans to admit Ukraine, but says Russia cannot dictate its relations with other sovereign states - a stance reaffirmed by Ukraine's foreign minister on Tuesday. 
""Russia does not have the right to vote on Ukraine's NATO membership. This is a red line that neither Ukraine nor our partners will cross,"" Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told the RBK-Ukraine media outlet. 
He added: ""No matter how many times Russian diplomats go around in circles, the starting line for discussing security guarantees in the Euro-Atlantic space should begin with Russia's de-escalation of the security situation near the Ukrainian border and Russia's withdrawal from Donbass and Crimea.""
Moscow seized the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014, and Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian troops in the easterly Donbass region since then in a war that has killed some 15,000 people.

Ukraine was under Moscow's rule for centuries, including as part of the Soviet Union, and President Vladimir Putin has said the prospect of NATO admitting it as a member, or stationing weapons there that could strike Russia, is a ""red line"".
U.S. President Joe Biden warned Putin in two conversations last month that any new Russian aggression would trigger severe economic costs in the form of unprecedented sanctions. Putin responded that such moves would be a colossal mistake and lead to a complete rupture in relations.

NUR-SULTAN (Reuters) -Russian-led forces will begin withdrawing from Kazakhstan in two days' time after stabilising the Central Asian nation following serious unrest, the president said on Tuesday, in a speech that took aim at wealthy associates of his predecessor. 
In a video call with parliament after putting down what he has called an attempted coup, Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev appointed a new government headed by career public servant Alikhan Smailov.
In what looked like his latest attempt to distance himself from his predecessor, Tokayev said that public discontent over income inequality was justified and that he wanted associates of Nursultan Nazarbayev, the former president, to share their wealth.
Many Central Asia analysts believe intra-clan infighting among the elite may have played a major role in what was the deadliest violence in the former Soviet republic's 30 years of independence from Moscow. 
As protesters torched buildings in the biggest city Almaty last week, Tokayev said former leader Nazarbayev was leaving his post as head of the powerful Security Council - where he had continued to pull the strings despite handing over the presidency in 2019.
Nazarbayev, 81, who ran the country for almost three decades and backed Tokayev as his successor, has not made a public appearance since.
Thanks to Nazarbayev, ""a group of very profitable companies emerged in the country as well as a group of people wealthy even by international standards,"" Tokayev told parliament.
""I think it is time they pay their dues to the people of Kazakhstan and help them on a systemic and regular basis.""
He gave no names, but the list of Kazakhstan's richest people includes several members of Nazarbayev's extended family, including his daughter Dinara with her husband, and a father-in-law of the former president's late grandson.
Tokayev said the financial system was dominated by large business groups ""based on the principle 'everything for friends, and laws for everyone else'"".
He spoke of initiatives to narrow the wealth gap, raise taxes on the mining sector, and eliminate irregularities in state procurement and areas where associates of Nazarbayev have business interests.
Tokayev also rounded on security officials, accusing them of abandoning their posts and letting protesters capture weapons and sensitive documents.
He has blamed the violence on foreign-trained Islamist radicals and ""terrorists"".
He said on Tuesday that the National Security Committee, the Kazakh successor to the Soviet KGB, had not only missed the looming threat, but had failed to act properly during the unrest. In some cities its officials had abandoned buildings and left behind firearms and classified documents, he said.
The fact that Russian-led forces that Tokayev called in to help stabilise the situation were first deployed to the capital, Nur-Sultan, prompted speculation at the time that their mission was to protect the government and Tokayev himself at a time when he could not fully trust his own security forces. 
Tokayev sacked Karim Masimov, then head of the National Security Committee (NSC), on Jan. 5. Masimov was then detained on suspicion of treason. 
'QUIET TERROR'
Tokayev, 68, last week asked the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) to send in troops at the peak of what he later said was an attempted coup d'etat whose unnamed instigators had plunged half of the oil-rich nation's territory into violence.
A day earlier, he said that the CSTO mission, whose legitimacy and duration were questioned by Washington, prompting an angry response from Moscow, numbered 2,030 troops and 250 pieces of military hardware.
On Tuesday he said the CSTO's main mission had been successfully completed. It would start a phased withdrawal in two days and pull out altogether within 10.
U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters Washington welcomed the announcement that the forces have completed their mission and called on them to ""uphold their commitment to promptly depart Kazakhstan, as the government has requested.""
Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed victory in defending Kazakhstan from what he described as a foreign-backed terrorist uprising. 
Kazakh authorities say order has been largely restored in the nation of 19 million and that almost 10,000 people have been detained over the unrest, with a hunt for others ongoing. 
""Right now in the country there is a quiet terror. Everyone is frightened,"" said Botagoz Issayeva, a Kazakh rights activist in Sweden who is in contact with civil society groups inside the country.
She said among those arrested were about 50 activists taken from their homes and not heard of since.
""We don't even know where they've been taken and what state they're in,"" said Issayeva, who represents a civil society coalition that has lobbied the European Parliament and U.S. Congress to crack down on corruption in Kazakhstan.
She said the reported death toll of 164 appeared too low, especially since Tokayev announced last week he had given shoot-to-kill orders against what he called bandits and terrorists.

The authorities say that initially peaceful protests against car fuel price increases were hijacked by groups aiming to overthrow the government.
The Organisation of Turkic States and Hungary on Tuesday condemned ""violence and vandalism"" in Kazakhstan, voicing support for Kazakh government operations against ""terrorists, radicals, extremists and criminals"".

PARIS (Reuters) - Fifteen years ago, Valerie Pecresse quelled a student uprising over her university reforms with the same blend of consensus-building politics and reformist mettle that she believes will now propel her to the French presidency.
Chosen to run last month by rank-and-file members of the conservative Les Republicains party, voter surveys show Pecresse could beat President Emmanuel Macron in April's election. If she succeeds, she would become France's first woman head of state.
In an office adorned with framed cinema posters, Pecresse, 54, reeled off a list of woes facing France that speak of her social and fiscal conservatism: poor control of national borders, violent city ghettos and a growing pile of debt.
""We need to restore order, both on our streets and in our national accounts,"" she told Reuters.
A minister for higher education and then the budget during Nicolas Sarkozy's presidency, Pecresse said last week she would bring out ""the power hose"" to clean up trouble neighbourhoods where the state had lost authority and lawlessness prevailed.
Critical of Macron for ""burning a hole in the state coffers"" during the pandemic, Pecresse has promised to reform France's generous pension system and cut a bloated public wage bill - both pledges she says Macron has failed to deliver on.
Her style, she says, is ""two-thirds (Angela) Merkel and one-third (Margaret) Thatcher"".
""I am a woman who consults, decides and acts,"" she said. ""The one-part Thatcher is to say 'I'm not for turning',"" referring to a phrase in a 1980 speech when the conservative British leader refused to back down on liberalising reforms.
Pecresse pointed to the cutting of hundreds of jobs at her head office to make way for more high-school staff, reduced spending and higher investment as proof she gets things done. In 2020, she won a second mandate to run the greater Paris region. 
Opponents who had nicknamed her ""the blond"" had paid the price, she said. Asked if France was ready for a woman president, she replied: ""Voters on the right have shown they're ready, and they can be the most reticent to trust a woman."" 
'UNBENDING'
Pecresse's party, which traces its origins to Charles de Gaulle, dominated French politics for much of the post-war era. But after Macron redrew the landscape in 2017, it has struggled to unite its centre-right and staunchly conservative factions.
The defection of a senior conservative lawmaker https://www.reuters.com/article/france-election-zemmour-idUKKBN2JJ073 to the campaign bid of far-right polemicist Eric Zemmour on Sunday underscored the challenge she faces keeping a feuding party together. 
Opinion polls show her in a close-fought race with Marine Le Pen, leader of the traditional far-right, for the second spot in the election's run-off vote. Zemmour follows close behind. Should she make it, she would be the most dangerous opponent for Macron, the surveys suggest. 
Born in an upmarket Paris suburb and educated at France's elite ENA school for politicians and civil servants, Pecresse is a moderate in a conservative party that has lurched rightwards as the far-right fuels anti-immigrant sentiment and a desire among many voters to get tough on law and order. 
Pecresse has toughened her language on immigration and identity, seeking to neutralise the threat from Le Pen and Zemmour, whose promise to ""save France"" https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/french-far-right-commentator-zemmour-announces-presidential-run-2021-11-30 from Islam has polarised France.
She says she would end the automatic right to French citizenship for people born in France and stiffen judicial sentences in places where police have lost control.
On a table in Pecresse's office sits a photograph of Samuel Paty, the teacher decapitated by a Chechen-born teenager in a suburb of Paris in 2020 because he used caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad in a lesson on free speech. 

Pecresse said the teacher's portrait would follow her to the Elysee Palace if she won the election.
""We have to be unbending in the respect of our values,"" Pecresse said. ""In the public space, the law comes before faith. It's the same rights, the same duties for all.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A lawyer for Donald Trump on Tuesday accused the former U.S. president's niece of trying to cash in on the family name by suing Trump and his siblings for allegedly defrauding her out of a multimillion-dollar inheritance.
At a hearing in a New York state court in Manhattan, the lawyer James Kiley rejected Mary Trump's claim that she learned of fraud through a Pulitzer Prize-winning 2018 New York Times probe into Donald Trump's finances, including his alleged efforts to avoid paying taxes.
Kiley said a 2001 settlement over the estate of Donald Trump's father Fred Trump Sr put Mary Trump on notice of potential claims against her uncles and aunt, and that she waited too long by not suing them until September 2020.
""She's saying the New York Times was like the  Rosetta Stone  (NYSE:RST),"" Kiley said in seeking the lawsuit's dismissal. ""She was getting all this information (in 2001). All she had to do was look at it.""
Kiley also accused Mary Trump, now a 56-year-old psychologist, of wanting ""round two"" with her relatives because of the case's notoriety.
""Are we kidding ourselves that if the name on this case wasn't Trump, this case would have never been brought?"" he said. ""The plaintiff is seizing on sensationalism and politics to bring a claim that shouldn't get past the courtroom front door.""
The case had its roots in the 1981 death of Mary's father, Fred Trump Jr, the older brother of Donald Trump, who left the then 16-year-old Mary a profitable real estate portfolio.
Mary Trump claimed https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-mary-trump-lawsuit-idINKCN26F2RV that her uncles Donald and Robert Trump and aunt Maryanne Trump Barry were supposed to protect her interests but instead siphoned money away, and ""squeezed"" her out through the 2001 settlement.
""Fraud is a secret thing,"" Mary Trump's lawyer John Quinn said. ""She didn't have the expertise and the resources the Times had, and she didn't have any notice that there was fraud.""
Quinn said the defendants fell ""well short"" of conclusively showing otherwise, meaning the lawsuit should proceed.
The defendants have denied the fraud claims in Mary Trump's lawsuit.
Justice Robert Reed, overseeing the case, did not say when he will rule.
BEST-SELLER
Mary Trump is also being sued by Donald Trump, who accused her, the Times and three reporters in September of running an ""insidious plot"" to exploit his tax records in order to fulfill personal vendettas, advance political agendas and make money.
Some of Mary Trump's allegations about Donald Trump were in her best-selling 2020 tell-all, ""Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man.""
Gary Freidman, a lawyer for Maryanne Trump Barry, tried at Tuesday's hearing to turn the book against Mary Trump.
""She writes in her book, 'we knew at the time we were being lied to,'"" Freidman said. ""That indicates that she had some duty at that time ... to perhaps look a little further and a little deeper, not wait 20 years.""
He also said the 2001 settlement gave the defendants a ""broad, broad general release"" from Mary Trump's claims.
Maryanne Trump Barry is a retired federal judge. Robert Trump died in August 2020. Kiley also represented Robert Trump's estate.
Donald Trump and his namesake Trump Organization also face a criminal probe by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, which state Attorney General Letitia James has joined, and a related civil probe by James.

Tax avoidance is among the issues being probed. Donald Trump has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing.
The cases are Mary L. Trump v Donald J. Trump et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 654698/2020, and Donald J. Trump v Mary L. Trump et al in the same court, No. 453299/2021.

SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korea appeared to test-fire a ballistic missile on Tuesday that may be more advanced than a ""hypersonic"" one it launched less than a week ago, South Korea's military said, as Pyongyang pursues increasingly powerful weapons.
Tuesday's launch, condemned by authorities in Washington and Tokyo and prompting an expression of concern from the U.N. secretary general, underscored North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's New Year's vow to bolster the military with cutting-edge technology at a time when talks with South Korea and the United States have stalled.
Initial estimates found the missile travelled more than 700 km (435 miles) to a maximum altitude of 60 km at up to 10 times the speed of sound (12,348 km/h), South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said in a statement.
""We assess that this is more advanced than the missile North Korea fired on Jan. 5, though South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities are conducting detailed analysis,"" the JCS said.
The launch was detected around 7:27 a.m. (2227 GMT Monday) from North Korea's Jagang Province toward the ocean off its east coast, the same location as last week's test.
The U.S. military's Indopacific Command said while it had assessed that the launch did not pose an immediate threat to the United States or its allies, it ""highlights the destabilising impact of North Korea's illicit weapons program.""
The Federal Aviation Administration said on Tuesday it briefly halted departures at some U.S. West Coast airports around the time of reports that North Korea had launched a ballistic missile.
A U.S. official said the pause lasted less than 15 minutes ""due to initial reports of events in the Indo-Pacific region,"" without directly tying it to the missile launch.
North Korea has joined a global race in developing hypersonic missiles, usually defined as types reaching at least five times the speed of sound - and which can manoeuvre at relatively low trajectories, making them much harder to detect and intercept.
South Korean military officials cast doubts on the capabilities of the hypersonic missile North Korea claimed to have test-fired last Wednesday, saying it appeared to represent limited progress over Pyongyang's existing ballistic missiles. 
""Today's test might be intended to send a message to the South after authorities here said the earlier test was a failure and did not involve a hypersonic missile,"" Kim Dong-yup, a former South Korea Navy officer who teaches at Seoul's Kyungnam University.
'DESTABILISING'
South Korea's National Security Council held an emergency meeting and President Moon Jae-in expressed concerns over the series of launches coming ahead of South Korea's March 9 presidential election.
The nuclear envoys of South Korea and the United States talked on the phone to share their assessment on the missile test and coordinate responses. They agreed to continue to try to restart the peace process with North Korea, South Korea's foreign ministry said.
""The United States condemns the DPRK's ballistic missile launch,"" a U.S. State Department spokesperson said, while U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres was ""very concerned"" and repeated a call for North Korea to comply with U.N. resolutions and resume talks. 
""Diplomatic engagement is the only way to reach a sustainable peace and a complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,"" Dujarric said.
U.N. Security Council resolutions ban all North Korean ballistic missile and nuclear tests and have imposed sanctions over the programmes.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida noted the United Nations had just finished discussions on how to respond to last week's launch and called North Korea's continuing launches ""extremely regrettable.""
Tuesday's test occurred hours after the U.S. mission to the United Nations, joined by France, Ireland, Japan, the United Kingdom and Albania, condemned last week's launch and called on U.N. member states to fulfil their sanctions obligations.
China and Russia have pushed the U.N. Security Council to ease sanctions on North Korea by removing a ban on Pyongyang's exports of statues, seafood and textiles, and lifting a refined petroleum imports cap. 

North Korea has said it is open to talks, but only if the United States and others drop ""hostile policies"" such as sanctions and military drills.
Few observers expect Kim to ever fully surrender his nuclear arsenal and North Korea argues its military activities are similar to those of other countries.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Novak Djokovic on Tuesday warmed up for his bid to win a record 21st Grand Slam title at next week's Australian Open, hitting practice shots at Melbourne Park, but he still faces the threat of deportation.
A week after his arrival in Australia, Djokovic finally reached the tennis court after a judge on Monday quashed the federal government's decision to cancel his visa.
But the world number one could still be detained by the federal government for a second time and deported. Immigration Minister Alex Hawke's office said he was considering whether to use his discretionary power to cancel Djokovic's visa. 
Australia has a policy barring non-citizens or non-residents from entry unless they are fully vaccinated against COVID-19. It allows for medical exemptions but the government argued that Djokovic, who is not vaccinated, did not provide adequate justification for an exemption.
The court ruled Djokovic was treated unfairly by officials on his arrival and ordered his visa cancellation be overturned. It did not, however, address whether his exemption - based on Djokovic contracting COVID-19 last month - was valid. 
Djokovic's case provoked a row between Canberra and Belgrade and fuelled heated debate over mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policies.
Public opinion in Australia, which is battling an Omicron wave of infections and where more than 90% of the adult population is double vaccinated, has been largely against the player. 
Melbourne endured the world's longest coronavirus lockdown and Victoria state has Australia's highest number of COVID-19 deaths. 
Prime Minister Scott Morrison's office said he spoke with Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic on Monday and explained Australia's non-discriminatory border policy.
In an interview with Reuters, Brnabic said she felt neither optimistic or pessimistic over to whether Djokovic would be allowed to compete but hoped for a final decision soon.
""Uncertainty is not good for any of the stakeholders, neither Djokovic nor the Australian Open,"" she said.
The ATP, the governing body of men's tennis, applauded the court ruling, saying the dispute was ""damaging on all fronts.""
Djokovic, who expressed his gratitude to the judge and his determination to compete at the first major of the year in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) https://twitter.com/DjokerNole?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor post on Monday, did not publicly address the situation on Tuesday. 
He was filmed by media helicopters practicing at Rod Laver Arena amid tight security at Melbourne Park. He was also confirmed as top seed for the event.
OPPOSITION TO VACCINATION
Djokovic was detained when he landed at Melbourne airport last Wednesday. His visa was cancelled because he failed to provide appropriate evidence to meet entry requirements, border officials said.
However, in quashing that decision, Judge Anthony Kelly was critical of the hours-long airport interview and said the player had not been given enough time to contact lawyers and tennis officials to discuss his predicament. 
Djokovic had been granted a medical exemption by the Victoria state government based on evidence he contracted COVID-19 last month - the second time he had been infected. The player, who has long opposed mandatory vaccination, confirmed during the interview he was unvaccinated.
Some Australian media reported that Australian Border Force was investigating potential discrepancies in the traveller form submitted by Djokovic and his whereabouts in the days before he arrived in Australia. 
In the document submitted to court Djokovic ticked ""no"" when asked he had been overseas in the 14 days prior. Social media posts, however, appeared to show him in Belgrade on Christmas Day and in Spain on Dec. 31.
In Madrid, Spain's foreign minister said he had no information on whether Djokovic had visited Spain in December before travelling to Australia.
""We have not been contacted by the Australian government to request such documentation,"" Minister Jose Manuel Albares also said.
The Australian Border Force did not reply to a request for comment. Djokovic's lawyers at Hall & Wilcox declined to comment.
FAIREST DECISION, SAYS RAFA
The Australian Open begins on Jan. 17. Djokovic has won the tournament, one of four tennis Grand Slams, for the past three years and nine times in all.
Spain's Rafa Nadal, who is tied on 20 majors with Djokovic and Switzerland's Roger Federer, called the fraught build-up to the tournament a ""circus"" and said the ""fairest decision"" had been made.
Nick Kyrgios said while he supported vaccination he felt ""embarrassed as an Australian athlete, seeing what this guy has done for us and the sport"".

However, former American player turned pundit Pam Shriver warned on Twitter the controversy may not be over: ""If he plays the booing will be deafening.""
Melbourne resident Keith Moore told Reuters: ""We've had to go through vaccination protocols and lockdowns for such a long time and he swans in and pretty much does what he likes because he's the world best tennis player.""

The United Nations said it had been unable to confirm the reports or the number of casualties due to a lack of communications in the area. It called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and full humanitarian access.
Last Friday, an air strike killed 56 people and injured 30, including children, in a camp for displaced people in a different location in Tigray. 
U.S. President Joe Biden raised concerns with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on Monday about civilian casualties and suffering caused by air strikes.
Ethiopian government spokesperson Legesse Tulu did not respond to a request for comment on the Mai Tsebri strike. Military spokesperson Colonel Getnet Adane referred Reuters to Legesse. 
The government has previously denied targeting civilians in the 14-month conflict, which pits Abiy's federal forces and their regional allies, backed by Eritrea, against rebellious forces of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).
Abiy's appointment as prime minister in 2018 ended 27 years of TPLF dominance over Ethiopia's central government. But the party stayed in power in its home region of Tigray, where fighting erupted in November 2020.
Each side blames the other. The TPLF accuses Abiy of centralising power at the expense of the regions, which he denies, while Abiy accuses the TPLF of seeking to return to power at the national level, which it rejects.
Thousands of civilians have been killed and millions displaced by the conflict. Hundreds of thousands are facing famine-like conditions.
Before the two latest strikes, at least 146 people had been killed and 213 injured in air strikes in Tigray since Oct. 18, according to a document prepared by aid agencies and shared with Reuters last week.
In a separate development, the government last Friday freed some jailed opposition leaders, including several TPLF figures, and said it would begin dialogue with political opponents in order to foster reconciliation.
At a briefing in Washington on Tuesday, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric reiterated the Secretary General's calls for an end to fighting in Tigray and ""for all parties to adhere to their obligations under international humanitarian law"".

LONDON (Reuters) - Boris Johnson's leadership faced its most serious threat yet on Tuesday after it emerged his private secretary invited over 100 people to a ""bring your own booze"" party at the British Prime Minister's official residence during a coronavirus lockdown. 
Johnson, who won a landslide election victory in 2019, has faced intense scrutiny over the past month after a video emerged showing his staff laughing and joking about a different party also held in Downing Street during a 2020 Christmas lockdown.
Revelations about a series of gatherings that took place in the heart of government have been widely criticised and prompted opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer to accuse Johnson of lacking the moral authority to lead the country.
The latest, if substantiated by an internal inquiry, would be the most damaging yet for Johnson's future. His own lawmakers show signs of losing patience after a series of scandals, and polls show Johnson's Conservative Party slipping behind Labour. 
Johnson and his partner Carrie were among those who gathered with about 40 staff in the garden of Downing Street on May 20, 2020, after the PM's Principal Private Secretary Martin Reynolds sent an invite by email using the pronoun ""we"",  ITV  (LON:ITV) reported.
Johnson's spokesman declined to comment on the report.
At the time, schools were shut to most pupils, and pubs and restaurants were closed, with strict controls on social mixing. Police prosecuted revellers, and people were prevented from bidding farewell in person to dying relatives.
""If the prime minister broke the law, he will resign won't he?"" Labour lawmaker Ben Bradshaw asked Paymaster General Michael Ellis who sat alone on the government's front bench in parliament to answer in place of Johnson.
""The prime minister is going nowhere,"" Ellis said, to Labour jeers. Ellis apologised unreservedly for the upset that the allegations had caused.
Only a smattering of Conservative lawmakers attended the debate, and few spoke in support of Johnson. 
Labour's Afzal Khan, asking if Johnson would apologise to bereaved families for holding such parties, related how his mother had died alone in hospital in 2020 while he sat in a car outside.
""Even burdened with our grief, my family obeyed the rules,"" Khan said.
A snap poll by Savanta ComRes showed 66% thought Johnson should resign, up 12 percentage points from a poll taken in December after the reports of Christmas parties. It said 42% of those who voted for Johnson in 2019 thought he should quit, up 9 points. The pollster interviewed a weighted sample of 1,040 adults online on Tuesday.
A YouGov poll of 5,391 people showed a similar increase in those who thought Johnson should quit - rising to 56% on Tuesday from 48% on Nov. 22.
LOCKDOWN PARTIES 
A senior government official, Sue Gray, is currently investigating allegations of at least five parties held in government departments last year during lockdown restrictions.
Asked about the claims of Downing Street parties, Johnson told parliament last month that all COVID-19 guidance had been followed, no rules had been broken and that there had been no party in Downing Street. 
Opponents said that if Johnson had attended a party during a lockdown, his position would be in danger as such revelry would show disdain for the rules.
""Did the prime minister attend the event in the Downing Street garden on May 20, 2020?,"" the opposition Labour Party's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, asked. ""If the prime minister was there, surely he knew?""

Over recent months, Johnson, 57, has faced criticism over his handling of a sleaze scandal, the awarding of lucrative COVID-19 contracts, the refurbishment of his Downing Street flat and a claim he intervened to ensure pets were evacuated during the Western withdrawal from Afghanistan in August.
London police, who previously declined to investigate the claims of government officials' lockdown gatherings, said on Monday they were in contact with the Cabinet Office over the alleged breaches of health protection laws in Downing Street.

HELSINKI (Reuters) -Surging coronavirus infections are forcing local authorities in Finland to stray from the government's COVID-19 strategy based on mass testing, tracking and isolation.
Helsinki and neighbouring cities recommend that people with a mild infection do not get an official test as the waiting time can now be days, city mayors and Helsinki hospital district said in a joint statement on Tuesday.
""The hospital district and cities have had to prioritise having workforce in hospital care and inoculation,"" strategy director Pasi Pohjola from the health ministry told Reuters.
Finland's minister in charge of the COVID response, Krista Kiuru, warned https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-finland-long-covid-idUSKBN2JH14W on Friday that long COVID could become Finland's largest chronic disease and that children were also at risk. [L1N2TN0X3]
She added she feared returning to school was not safe and called for local authorities to implement strict quarantines at schools in which one pupil's COVID infection would result in quarantine for the entire exposed class.
But Sanna Isosomppi, Helsinki's chief epidemiologist, told Reuters the capital region's municipalities were not going to follow the minister's advice.
""It would be disproportionate to implement large-scale quarantines at schools when they have not been a high-risk environment to begin with,"" Isosomppi said.
""Mandating quarantines is no longer an effective way to control the epidemic,"" Isosomppi said.
For more than a year, the government's main strategy to counter the pandemic has been to test and trace infections throughout society, but this week local authorities began to openly rebel against the measures. 
""Tracing infections has lost its effectiveness due to delays in testing and in contacting the patients,"" they said in a statement.
Helsinki and 11 other municipalities in the capital region had already said on Monday that they were giving up on mandating quarantines on infected patients in most cases, focusing their efforts only at health care units and elderly care units.
Instead, authorities recommended anyone with symptoms, including children, to remain at home on voluntary basis. 

Last week, Isosomppi and nine other leading Finnish infection specialists published an open letter against a plan proposed by Kiuru's ministry to reintroduce school closures and going back to remote learning. 
Finland's government was not immediately available for comment.

Speaking at a televised meeting of the government's coronavirus task force, Anna Popova, a top consumer health official, said Russia had so far recorded 305 cases of Omicron across 13 of its regions.
""The risk of a very intense rise in (cases) of the disease is real,"" she said. 
Omicron has pushed COVID-19 case figures to record highs in parts of western Europe and the United States, while cases in Russia have generally been declining from a peak of 41,335 registered in early November. 
Officials said they now feared the trend could rapidly reverse and Popova warned that daily infections could hit ""six figures"" if proper sanitary measures were not observed. 
Moscow's Mayor Sergei Sobyanin told Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin at the televised meeting that the capital, which has a population of 12.7 million, was already seeing a significant increase in Omicron cases.
He said special measures would be taken to tackle the rise in cases, without elaborating. 
""It's necessary to mobilise more hospital beds, to mobilise the health system,"" Sobyanin said. 

Sources told Reuters last month that officials were bracing for another wave of COVID-19 in early 2022.
The Kremlin has frequently expressed frustration at the slow uptake of the domestically-made Sputnik V vaccine against COVID-19, with many citing distrust of the authorities and fear of new medical products.

BRUSSELS/ROME (Reuters) -European Parliament President David Sassoli, an Italian socialist and former journalist, died early on Tuesday in hospital in Italy, his spokesperson said. He was 65.
He had been president of the 705-seat parliament since July 2019 and his term in the predominantly ceremonial role had been due to end this month. Maltese lawmaker Roberta Metsola, from the conservative European People's Party (EPP), is widely expected to succeed him.
""Sassoli was a symbol of balance, humanity and generosity. These qualities have always been recognised by all his colleagues, from every political quarter and every European country,"" said Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi.
His time leading the EU assembly was dominated by the coronavirus crisis and he was credited with introducing a remote voting system that allowed the parliament to keep operating even as much of Europe was forced into repeated lockdowns.
Sassoli contracted legionella pneumonia in September and he returned to hospital in December after suffering complications related to his immune system.
He had undergone a bone marrow transplant 10 years ago and he died in a cancer clinic in the northeastern town of Aviano.
Flags at EU institutions were lowered to half mast as praise for Sassoli poured in from across the political spectrum.
European Commission President Ursula van der Leyen, a conservative who secured Sassoli's backing within the EU parliament despite coming from different camps, said she had lost a dear friend.
""Today is a sad day for Europe. Our union loses a passionate European, a sincere democrat and a good man,"" she told reporters. ""He wanted Europe to be more united, closer to its people, more faithful to our values. That's his legacy.""
PLEDGE TO TACKLE EXTREME NATIONALISM
In his inaugural speech, Sassoli had urged Europeans to counter the ""virus"" of extreme nationalism and called for a reform of EU rules on migration and political asylum.
He had been unable to chair the Strasbourg-based parliament recently and missed the European Commission's annual state of the union event in September.
Sassoli was born in Florence in 1956 but moved to Rome as a young child. He started as a newspaper journalist before joining Italian state broadcaster RAI, where he became a household name delivering the main evening news.
He switched to politics in 2009, joining the centre-left Democratic Party and easily won election to the European Parliament. After a failed bid to become mayor of Rome, he focused on European politics.
News of his death dominated morning news shows in Italy.

""His death is a great loss for the entire Italian community and for all those who, just like him, believe and invest in the project of a great European home,"" former prime minister Giuseppe Conte wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Sassoli leaves behind a wife and two children.

Chief health inspector Angel Kunchev said all participants in the consultative National Security Council on Monday were in good health but would remain in self-isolation after Parliament Speaker Nikola Minchev tested positive.
Along with Prime Minister Kiril Petkov and President Rumen Radev, the meeting was attended by the ministers of interior, defence and finance and senior members of the main political parties.
They met to discuss Bulgaria's position towards North Macedonia, deciding that lifting Bulgaria's veto on the start of Skopje's EU accession talks should not be rushed but linked to results. 
Petkov had planned to visit North Macedonia on Jan. 18 but the trip may now be rescheduled. 
""The prime minister will be under quarantine as are the rules,"" a government press official told Reuters. ""There will be a visit to North Macedonia, and we will inform you once a new date is set."" 
Petkov will continue his work remotely while his duties that require attendance will be taken over by deputy premier Kalina Konstantinova, the government said.
Bulgaria has experienced a spike in coronavirus infections recently as the Omicron variant spread in the European Union's least vaccinated member state.
On Tuesday, the country of 7 million people reported 6,761 new cases and more than 800 people were taken to hospital. The pandemic has caused 31,672 deaths.
The officials and politicians who attended the meeting on Monday may stay in quarantine for up to seven days after the health ministry changed the rules for self-isolation, effective from Jan. 11.
The quarantine for contact people with full vaccination and a booster dose can be lifted earlier if they present a negative PCR test 72 hours after being ordered to isolate.

Kostadin Kostadinov, leader of the ultra-nationalist Revival party and a vocal anti-vaccine activist who also attended the security meeting, said he tested negative for coronavirus on Tuesday and questioned the need to be quarantined. 
His party, which has called COVID vaccines ""experimental liquid"", is organising a protest on Wednesday against the obligatory health pass for entry to many indoor venues, including shopping malls and cafes.

ATHENS (Reuters) - A marble fragment of the Parthenon temple has been returned to Athens from a museum in Sicily, a move officials hope will advance efforts to have the British Museum send back ancient sculptures from Greece's most renowned ancient landmark.
Athens' Acropolis Museum presented on Monday the ""Fagan fragment"", a 35-by-31-centimetre (12-by-14-inch) marble fragment showing the foot of the seated ancient Greek goddess Artemis brought home from the Antonio Salinas Archaeological Museum in Palermo.
""It is marvellous that Sicilian and Italian friends thought to bring it back where it was born,"" Acropolis Museum Director Nikolaos Stampolidis said of the fragment, once part of the temple's eastern frieze.
It is to be placed in the Parthenon Gallery - a glass-walled chamber with a view of the Parthenon that displays sculptures of the temple's 160-metre-(520-foot)-long frieze in the same position as they were on the original monument, with plaster copies replacing pieces that are now mainly in the British Museum.
""We hope that this first step taken by Sicily can encourage a similar decision in other countries,"" said Antonio Salinas Museum Director Caterina Greco.
Part of Sicily's cultural heritage agreement, which provides for transfers and exchanges of artefacts between museums, the Parthenon fragment will be loaned to Athens for four years with a renewal option for another four, but talks are underway between governments for the piece to remain permanently.
In return, the Acropolis Museum will loan Palermo a 5th century BC headless statue of the goddess Athena and an 8th century BC amphora from the Geometric period for four years.
The ""Fagan fragment"" is a part of a larger sculpture in the Acropolis Museum that is mostly a plaster copy, whose original pieces are in the British Museum.
The fragment was once part of the collection of the 19th century British consul general to Sicily, Robert Fagan, a diplomat and archaeologist, before it was purchased by the Royal University of Palermo in 1820 from his widow after his death. It is not clear how Fagan first acquired it.
LONG DISPUTE OVER 'ELGIN MARBLES'
The ""Fagan fragment"" is the first piece of the sculptures of the Parthenon - Greece's most renowned 5th century BC monument - to return to Greece from a foreign museum.
Athens has campaigned to have the ""Elgin Marbles"", as they are often known - 75 metres of Parthenon frieze, 15 metopes and 17 sculptures - returned from the British Museum since they were removed by British diplomat Lord Elgin in the early 19th century when he was ambassador to the Ottoman Empire then ruling Greece.
The British Museum bought the marbles in 1816 and British officials say they had been acquired legally by Elgin, a claim Greece denies. The British Museum says there are no current discussions with the Greek government on their return.
""They are essentially providing the road map on how the permanent return of the Parthenon marbles to Athens could be organised,"" said Greek Culture Minister Lina Mendoni, referring to the loan by Italy.
Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has offered to loan significant artefacts to Britain in return for the marbles, after decades of rejected appeals.
""(This) paves the way for the British Museum to enter into serious discussions with the Greek authorities in order to find a solution that would be mutually acceptable,"" Mitsotakis said during the presentation.
When Mitsotakis visited Downing Street in November, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told him that the issue was one for the British Museum and not for his government. 
""I did raise the issue when I visited,"" Mitsotakis said on Monday. ""I felt encouraged by (Johnson's) statement...that the British government would not oppose a possible agreement that could be reached between (Greece) and the British Museum.""
In March last year Johnson told a Greek newspaper that Britain was the legal owner of the marbles.

Recently European countries such as France, Spain and Germany have stepped up to return looted artefacts in their museums back to their African countries of origin.
""When there is a will, there is a way. Sooner or later this will happen,"" Mitsotakis said of the marbles returning from Britain.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - A U.S. man with terminal heart disease was implanted with a genetically modified pig heart in a first-of-its-kind surgery, and three days later the patient is doing well, his doctors reported on Monday.
The surgery, performed by a team at the University of Maryland Medicine, is among the first to demonstrate the feasibility of a pig-to-human heart transplant, a field made possible by new gene editing tools.
If proven successful, scientists hope pig organs could help alleviate shortages of donor organs. 
“This was a breakthrough surgery and brings us one step closer to solving the organ shortage crisis. There are simply not enough donor human hearts available to meet the long list of potential recipients,” Dr. Bartley Griffith, who surgically transplanted the pig heart into the patient, said in a statement. 
“We are proceeding cautiously, but we are also optimistic that this first-in-the-world surgery will provide an important new option for patients in the future,” Griffith added.
For 57-year-old David Bennett of Maryland, the heart transplant was his last option.
""It was either die or do this transplant. I want to live. I know it’s a shot in the dark, but it’s my last choice,” Bennett said a day before his surgery, according to a statement released by the university.
To move ahead with the experimental surgery, the university obtained an emergency authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on New Year's Eve through its compassionate use program.
""The FDA used our data and data on the experimental pig to authorize the transplant in an end-stage heart disease patient who had no other treatment options,” said Dr. Muhammad Mohiuddin, who heads the University's program on xenotransplantation - transplanting animal organs into humans.
About 110,000 Americans are currently waiting for an organ transplant, and more than 6,000 patients die each year before getting one, according to organdonor.gov.
Bennett's genetically modified pig heart was provided by Revivicor, a regenerative medicine company based in Blacksburg, Virginia. On the morning of the surgery, the transplant team removed the pig's heart and placed it into a special device to preserve its function until the surgery.
Pigs have long been a tantalizing source of potential transplants because their organs are so similar to humans. A hog heart at the time of slaughter, for example, is about the size of an adult human heart.
Other organs from pigs being researched for transplantation into humans include kidneys, liver and lungs.
Prior efforts at pig-to-human transplants have failed because of genetic differences that caused organ rejection or viruses that posed an infection risk.
Scientists have tackled that problem by editing away potentially harmful genes.
In the heart implanted in Bennett, three genes previously linked with organ rejection were ""knocked out"" of the donor pig, and six human genes linked with immune acceptance were inserted into the pig genome. 
Researchers also deleted a pig gene to prevent excessive growth of the pig heart tissue. 

The work was funded in part with a $15.7 million research grant to evaluate Revivicor's genetically-modified pig hearts in baboon studies.
In addition to the genetic changes to the pig heart, Bennett received an experimental anti-rejection drug made by Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:KNSA) based in Lexington, Mass.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea began the New Year with increasingly capable missile tests, including at least one it claims was a hypersonic missile, amid an intensifying race for the next generation of long-range weapons that are harder to detect and intercept. 
South Korean military officials have cast doubts https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/skorea-casts-doubts-north-koreas-hypersonic-missile-claims-2022-01-07 on North Korea's claim a missile fired last week was hypersonic, but on Tuesday officials in Seoul said the North appeared to have test fired https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkorea-launches-possible-ballistic-missile-japan-says-2022-01-10 another missile that flew at relatively low altitudes at up to 10 times the speed of sound (12,348 kmh/7,673 mph).
North Korea did not immediately confirm the launch. The performance and the launch location reported by South Korea, however, suggested it may be another hypersonic missile.
North Korea tested its first such missile last year, joining other countries such as China, United States and Russia, which have conducted tests of hypersonic weapons in recent months.
HOW THE MISSILES WORK
Hypersonic missiles typically launch a warhead that travels at more than five times the speed of sound - or about 6,200 km per hour (3,850 mph), often manoeuvring at relatively low altitudes. 
Despite their name, analysts say the main feature of hypersonic weapons is not speed - which can sometimes be matched or exceeded by traditional ballistic missile warheads - but their manoeuvrability.
North Korea's first hypersonic missile test in September featured a glider-shaped warhead, while last week's launch involved what analysts and South Korean military officials said was actually a conical manoeuvrable reentry vehicle (MaRV), or a ballistic missile warhead capable of manoeuvring to hit a target.
Combining a glide vehicle with a missile that can launch it partially into orbit - a so-called fractional orbital bombardment system (FOBS) - could strip adversaries of reaction time and traditional defences mechanisms.
Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), by contrast, carry nuclear warheads on ballistic trajectories that travel into space but never reach orbit.
WHO LEADS THE RACE
Last year China launched a rocket carrying a hypersonic glide vehicle that flew through space, circling the globe before cruising down toward its target, which it missed by about two dozen miles. [L1N2RD01Y]
In July, Russia successfully tested a Tsirkon (Zircon) hypersonic cruise missile, which President Vladimir Putin touted as part of a new generation of missile systems. Moscow also tested the weapon from a submarine for the first time. [L8N2R017O]
The United States said in late September that it had tested an air-breathing hypersonic weapon - meaning it sustains flight on its own through the atmosphere like a cruise missile - marking the first successful test of that class of weapon since 2013. 
Days after the U.S. announcement, North Korea fired a newly developed hypersonic missile for the first time, calling it a ""strategic weapon"" that boosted its defence capabilities, though some South Korean analysts described the test as a failure. 
WHY IT MATTERS
The recent tests are the moves in a dangerous arms race in which smaller Asian nations are striving to develop advanced long-range missiles https://graphics.reuters.com/ASIA-MISSILES/xklpyxajkvg/asia-missiles.jpg, alongside major military powers. 
Hypersonic weapons, and FOBS, could be a concern as they can potentially evade missile shields and early warning systems. 

Some experts cautioned against hype surrounding missiles such as the one China tested in August. 
""China already has 100 nuclear-armed ICBMs that can strike the U.S.,"" Jeffrey Lewis, a missile specialist at the U.S.-based James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) at the time. ""Although the glider is a nice touch ... this is an old concept that is newly relevant as a way to defeat missile defences.""

KATHMANDU (Reuters) -Nepal banned large public gatherings and closed schools across the Himalayan nation for nearly three weeks after a spike in coronavirus cases, officials said on Monday.
Nepal reported 1,357 new cases on Monday, the biggest single-day jump since September last year, taking its total to 833,946 since the pandemic began. Its death toll from the coronavirus is 11,606.
Home Ministry spokesman Pradip Kumar Koirala said public gatherings like political rallies and religious functions involving more than 25 people had been prohibited.
“Entry to hotels, restaurants, cinema halls and public offices as well as parks from Jan. 21 will be given to those providing proof of being vaccinated against the coronavirus,” Koirala told Reuters.
Earlier the government ordered schools to close for almost three weeks until Jan. 29.
Education Ministry spokesman Deepak Sharma said a campaign to vaccinate children aged 12 to 17 at their schools would go ahead.
""Schools must notify students about the time and date when they need to go to schools and receive the shots,” Sharma said.
Authorities hope the closure of schools will help break chains of infection amid fears about the rapid spread of the Omicron variant of the virus.
Last week, the government asked hospitals to prepare for increased numbers of patients as COVID-19 cases could increase sharply.

Hospitals have been ordered to maintain adequate supplies of oxygen and keep staff at the ready. Nepal has reported 27 cases of infections with the Omicron but no deaths from it.
Nepal has provided two shots of COVID-19 vaccines to 37% of its population of 30 million since an inoculation drive began a year ago.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Two Belarusian cross-country skiers, including one who hoped to compete at next month's Beijing Winter Olympics, say authorities have barred them from competition after sports officials accused them of supporting the country's political opposition.
The skiers, Sviatlana Andryiuk and Darya Dolidovich, are the latest elite athletes to be targeted since a crackdown on critics of veteran leader Alexander Lukashenko after a 2020 presidential election his opponents say was fraudulent. Lukashenko has denied rigging the vote. 
The skiers said the Belarus Ski Union last month deactivated their FIS code, an individual identifying number required for athletes to take part in competitions overseen by the International Ski Federation (FIS). They are sidelined from official competitions, including qualifications for major international events. 
The skiers say the head of the Belarus Cross-Country Skiing Federation, Aliaksandr Darakhovich, ordered officials in November to prohibit them from competing internationally and taking part in national training camps.
The federation did not respond to a request for comment addressed to Darakhovich, who also serves as deputy chairman of the Minsk city executive committee. 
The Belarus Ski Union and the FIS did not immediately respond to Reuters email requests for comment on both cases. 
Andryiuk, 22, says the decision forced her to miss a qualifying event that could have allowed her to secure a berth in the Beijing Olympics.
""They (sports officials) accused me word for word of being an opposition supporter,"" Andryiuk, who also lost her state job over the accusations, told Reuters in a video call.
Andryiuk said she had never publicly voiced her political views, which she described as neutral. She said her situation was compelling her to leave Belarus.
""I don't want to be here,"" she said. ""I'm planning to leave for Poland because it's impossible to live here.""
2020 PROTESTS
Darya Dolidovich, 17, is one of Belarus' most promising junior cross-country skiers. She is also the daughter of cross-country skier Sergei Dolidovich, a seven-time Olympian who took part in street protests and spoke out against Lukashenko.
Darya Dolidovich told Reuters, also during a video call, that she believed her father's political views were behind the move.
""I didn't do anything myself that would justify a disqualification and having my FIS code deactivated,"" she told Reuters, adding that she shared her father's views. 
Sergei Dolidovich, who coaches his daughter, said he quit his job at a national training centre after coming under pressure for his support of the opposition. 
""The state can no longer have an impact on me,"" he said. ""It can only do so through my daughter.""
Several prominent Belarusian sports figures joined opposition protests in 2020, an unusual move in a country where the state heavily subsidises athletes.

Some athletes were jailed. Others lost their state employment or were kicked off national teams.
At the Tokyo Olympics last year, Belarusian sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya refused to board a flight back home when she was removed from the Games against her will after publicly complaining about national team coaches. She defected to Poland, saying she feared for her safety if she returned to Belarus.

The government's Rescue Command Centre said witnesses had seen the aircraft crash into the sea and helicopters and ships were searching for the pilot.
Air Force Inspector-General Liu Hui-chien said the aircraft had only recently been upgraded to the ""V"" version, with new weapons systems and avionics.
Combat training for the F-16 fleet has now been suspended, he added.
In late 2020, an F-16 vanished shortly after taking off from the Hualien air base on Taiwan's east coast on a routine training mission.
Last year, two F-5E fighters, which first entered service in Taiwan in the 1970s, crashed into the sea off the southeast coast after they apparently collided in mid-air during a training mission.

While Taiwan's air force is well trained, it has strained from repeatedly scrambling to see off Chinese military aircraft in the past two years, though the accidents have not been linked in any way to these intercept activities.
China, which claims the democratic island as its own, has been routinely sending aircraft into Taiwan's air defence zone, mostly in an area around the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands but sometimes also into the airspace between Taiwan and the Philippines.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russian political satirist and Kremlin critic Viktor Shenderovich said on Tuesday he had left Russia fearing that a criminal case for slander would be opened against him after authorities designated him as a ""foreign agent"". 
The 63-year old did not say where he had gone and was not immediately reachable. A slew of Russians have fled in the past year, including supporters of jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny and several journalists. 
""(My) departure is exactly what the Kremlin has been hinting I do over the last 20 years of endless and demonstrative criminality directed at me,"" Shenderovich wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
The Kremlin said it looked as though Shenderovich was trying to hide from his opponents after making comments that were being challenged in court. It said his departure had nothing to do with him being labelled a ""foreign agent"".
Shenderovich had the tag imposed on him by the Justice Ministry last month in a mounting crackdown on opposition figures.
The label has negative Soviet-era connotations and its bearers have to place it prominently on all content that they publish. They also face arduous financial and bureaucratic requirements. 
Authorities say the designation, and another for ""undesirable organisations"", are needed to shield the country from malign foreign influence. 
Shenderovich, also known as a journalist, has been at odds with the authorities for years. 
His old ""Puppets"" satirical show on national television lampooned politicians including President Vladimir Putin who had just come to power at the turn of the century. The show was taken off air in 2002. 
Shenderovich's biting criticism of the state of Russian politics was eventually only heard on a handful of outlets like Moscow's liberal radio station Ekho Moskvy or on the TV Rain online news channel.
Announcing his departure, he said he had faced surveillance, slander, invasions of his privacy and even death threats over the years.
He was sued last year by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman accused by the United States of election meddling and of spreading malign influence around the world, something he denies. Shenderovich was ordered to pay out 100,000 roubles ($1,330) for comments he made on Ekho Moskvy.

On Dec. 30, Prigozhin's company Konkord said it was pursuing criminal action and that Shenderovich could face up to five years in jail.

GENEVA (Reuters) - U.N. agencies on Tuesday asked donors for $4.4 billion in humanitarian aid for Afghanistan in 2022, calling the funds an ""essential stop gap"" to ensure the country's future after a period of turmoil marked by the Taliban's seizure of power and a hasty U.S. exit. 
The United Nations says the appeal, which amounts to nearly a quarter of the country's GDP, is the largest ever sought for a single country and is triple the figure it received in 2021 when the U.S.-backed government collapsed.
""This is a stop gap, an absolutely essential stop gap measure that we are putting in front of the international community today,"" U.N. aid chief Martin Griffiths told reporters in Geneva.
""Without this being funded there won't be a future, we need this to be done otherwise there will be outflow, there will be suffering."" 
The abrupt withdrawal of foreign aid last year following the Taliban victory in August left Afghanistan's fragile economy on the brink of collapse, with food prices rising rapidly and causing widespread hunger. 
Western sanctions aimed at the Taliban also prevented the passage of basic supplies of food and medicine, although this has since eased after exemptions were passed by the U.N. Security Council and Washington in December.
Griffiths, who has been meeting with Taliban officials, said the humanitarian plan had been ""carefully calibrated"" so that aid will go directly to people in need and not to authorities.
Filippo Grandi, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said that improved security presented an opportunity to entice millions of people displaced by the long conflict back home, adding that since the Taliban seized power, 170,000 had returned already.

""The conflict between the Taliban and the previous government is over and that has opened up some space of security which I think we need to take advantage of,"" Grandi said.
""But to do that we need those resources that are part of this appeal.""

WASHINGTON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega was sworn into office for his fourth consecutive term on Monday, hours after the United States and European Union imposed sanctions on several figures in his government following elections Washington has called a ""sham"".
Ortega won the Nov. 7 poll after most of his political foes were jailed, prompting widespread condemnation. U.S. President Joe Biden called the election a ""pantomime"", accusing the former Marxist guerrilla and Cold War adversary of the United States of growing authoritarianism.
Most Western and regional nations shunned the inauguration ceremony on Monday evening, though leftist leaders such as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and Cuba's President Miguel Diaz Canel flew in to show their support.
China, which recently established ties with Nicaragua, also sent a delegation.
In a measured speech mostly focused on the history of the Sandinista rebellion against former U.S.-backed dictator Anastasio Somoza, Ortega vowed to keep ""growing dreams and building roads"" for the Nicaraguan people.
But Ortega's opponents say the leader now presides over a government akin to that of Somoza, who was toppled by Ortega's leftist Sandinista guerrillas in 1979.
Laura Chinchilla, the former president of Costa Rica, called Ortega a ""dictator"" ahead of the ceremony.
""He shows his back to a people who did not vote for him, isolated from the world that does not recognize his election, under a legacy of horror and pain,"" Chinchilla said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Ortega's government, in power since 2007, did not respond to a request for comment.
Earlier in the day, the United States and the European Union imposed sanctions on Nicaraguan officials, including the defense minister.
The sanctions come after a series of other actions Washington has coordinated with allies in recent months to increase pressure on Ortega and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo.
Ortega's first stint in power ended in 1990 and upon returning as president in 2007, he quickly set about gaining control of key state institutions, analysts say. 
Election observers from the European Union and the Organization of American States were not allowed to scrutinize November's poll, and journalists were barred from entering Nicaragua.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States and partners would ""continue to call out the Ortega-Murillo regime's ongoing abuses and will deploy diplomatic and economic tools to support the restoration of democracy and respect for human rights in Nicaragua"".
The U.S. Treasury Department said in a separate statement it imposed sanctions on six Nicaraguan officials over accusations of state acts of violence, disinformation and targeting of independent media.
The Treasury action targeted the minister of defense as well as officials of the military, the company overseeing telecommunications and postal services, and the state-owned Nicaraguan Mining Company.
The U.S. State Department is also taking steps to impose visa restrictions on 116 people it accused of undermining democracy in Nicaragua, Blinken said, barring some mayors, prosecutors and police, prison and military officials, among others, from entering the United States.

Responding to the moves against him, Ortega said in his speech the United States and the European Union did not have the moral authority to impose sanctions.
""They don't respect international laws,"" Ortega said.

(Reuters) - Robert Durst, the multimillionaire real estate heir who was serving a life sentence for murder in California and was the prime suspect in two other murders over the past four decades, died in prison at age 78, his lawyer's office said on Monday. 
The law office of Chip Lewis told Reuters he died of natural causes, while Lewis told the New York Times that Durst went into cardiac arrest and died at the San Joaquin General Hospital, where he had been taken for testing.
Durst had once been groomed to take over The Durst Organization, one of New York City's premier real estate companies, but instead spent many of his formative years evading law enforcement and the last several years of life in jail.
Durst mostly stayed one step ahead of the law until he told on himself during the making of the 2015 HBO documentary series ""The Jinx,"" in which Durst was caught on a hot microphone saying to himself, ""What the hell did I do? ... Killed them all, of course.""
Durst was arrested just before the final episode aired.
His wife Kathleen McCormack Durst went missing in New York in 1982, but no charges were filed until after a Los Angeles County in September found Durst guilty of murdering his best friend Susan Berman in 2000. 
Prosecutors said Berman was about to reveal she helped Durst create a cover story about his wife's disappearance.
In New York, after the Los Angeles trial ended, a Westchester County grand jury indicted him for his wife's murder.
Prosecutors also said Durst killed his neighbor Morris Black in Galveston, Texas, in 2001 because Black discovered his identity at a time when Durst was hiding from the law, sometimes disguising himself as a mute woman.
A Galveston jury acquitted Durst, who argued self-defense, even though Durst also admitted to dismembering Black's body.
Durst listed his many health problems on the witness stand including surgeries for esophageal and bladder cancer, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, neuropathy, chronic kidney disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. A shunt relieved pressure on his brain.
Shortly after his Los Angeles sentencing, his lawyer disclosed he had also contracted COVID-19.
Los Angeles County prosecutor John Lewin, who had pursued Durst for years, credited ""The Jinx"" filmmakers Andrew Jarecki and Marc Smerling for their revealing interviews with Durst, telling reporters after the verdict: ""Without them having conducted the interviews, we wouldn't be where we are.""
Durst's story was also depicted in the 2010 film ""All Good Things,"" starring Ryan Gosling and directed by Jarecki. 

Durst is the grandson of Joseph Durst and son of Seymour Durst, who built The Durst Organization into one of New York City's premier real estate companies and developed some of Manhattan's signature skyscrapers. 
Robert Durst long ago left the company, now run by his estranged brother Douglas Durst, who testified at trial and said of his sibling: ""He'd like to murder me.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government is prepared to dismiss two perjury charges against Ghislaine Maxwell if her conviction for aiding Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuses is allowed to stand, according to a joint letter from prosecutors and Maxwell's defense team.
In the Monday night letter to U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan, prosecutors said dismissing the perjury counts would reflect the victims' ""significant interests in bringing closure to this matter and avoiding the trauma of testifying again.""
Prosecutors also asked the Manhattan judge to sentence Maxwell in about three to four months.
Lawyers for Maxwell oppose setting any timetable, believing that one juror's post-trial revelations about having been sexually abused was a ""compelling basis"" to overturn their client's conviction and grant a new trial, the letter said.
Maxwell, 60, was convicted on Dec. 29 after a month-long trial on sex trafficking and other charges of recruiting and grooming underage girls for Epstein to abuse between 1994 and 2004.
Lawyers for the British socialite challenged the conviction after one juror told Reuters that when some jurors expressed skepticism about the accounts of two Maxwell accusers, he shared his experience of having been sexually abused as a child. 
That juror's disclosures to Reuters and other media ""influenced the deliberations and convinced other members of the jury to convict Ms. Maxwell,"" Maxwell's lawyers have said.
Maxwell faces up to 65 years in prison on her conviction.
The perjury charges concern allegations that Maxwell lied about her knowledge of Epstein's behavior during depositions taken in 2016 for a separate civil lawsuit.
Each charge carries a maximum five-year prison term. Nathan decided last April to try them in a separate trial.

Nathan gave Maxwell's lawyers until Jan. 19 to formally explain why the conviction should be overturned. Prosecutors have until Feb. 2 to respond.
Epstein, a financier and convicted sex offender, killed himself in August 2019 in a Manhattan jail while awaiting his own sex trafficking trial.

GENEVA (Reuters) -Russia and the United States gave no sign of narrowing their differences on Ukraine and wider European security in talks in Geneva on Monday, as Moscow repeated demands that Washington says it cannot accept.
Russia has massed troops near Ukraine's border and demanded the U.S.-led NATO alliance rule out admitting the former Soviet state or expanding further into what Moscow sees as its back yard.
""Unfortunately we have a great disparity in our principled approaches to this. The U.S. and Russia in some ways have opposite views on what needs to be done,"" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told a news conference.
""We were firm ... in pushing back on security proposals that are simply non-starters to the United States,"" U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said in a separate telephone briefing after nearly eight hours of talks with Ryabkov.
However, Sherman also hinted at the possibility of mutual compromises, saying Washington was open to discussing missile deployments in Europe as well as limiting the size and scope of military exercises.
Washington and Kyiv say 100,000 Russian troops moved to within striking distance of Ukraine could be preparing a new invasion, eight years after Russia seized the Crimean peninsula from its neighbour.
Russia denies any such plans and says it is responding to what it calls aggressive behaviour from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Ukraine, which has tilted toward the West and aspires to join the alliance.
Ryabkov repeated a set of sweeping demands including a ban on further NATO expansion and an end to its activity in the central and eastern European countries that joined after 1997.
""For us it’s absolutely mandatory to make sure that Ukraine never, never, ever becomes a member of NATO,"" he said. ""We do not trust the other side.""
""We need iron-clad, waterproof, bulletproof, legally binding guarantees. Not assurances, not safeguards, guarantees with all the words 'shall, must', everything that should be put in, 'never ever becoming a member of NATO'. It’s a matter of Russia’s national security,"" he added.
""We will not allow anyone to slam closed NATO's open-door policy,"" Sherman told reporters, saying the United States ""will not make decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine, about Europe without Europe, or about NATO without NATO."" 
RUSSIAN URGENCY
The build-up of troops near Ukraine, has raised U.S.-Russia tensions to their highest levels since the end of the Cold War.
Both sides said Russia had stated that it did not intend to invade, something Ryabkov said could never happen, but Sherman said she did not know if Russia was willing to de-escalate, which she defined as Russian troops returning to their barracks.
The Russian complained that the U.S. side did not show an understanding of the urgency of the situation. While there was no deadline, Russia was not prepared to wait weeks or months, he said.
Ryabkov said Russia needed to see movement by NATO, and failure to provide that would be a mistake that would damage NATO's own security.
Russia would respond in a ""military-technical"" way if talks broke down, he said - a possible reference to redeploying intermediate-range nuclear (INF) missiles in Europe, which he said last month could happen if the West declined to respond.
Sherman said if Russia walked away from the talks, it would be clear it was never serious about diplomacy.
She also said Washington was open to discussing a possible deal on INF missiles along the lines of the now-defunct INF treaty between the U.S. and Russia and Russia's proposal to set limits on the size and scope of military exercises.
The United States formally withdrew from the landmark 1987 INF pact with Russia in August 2019 after determining that Moscow was violating the treaty, an accusation the Kremlin has denied.
The treaty banned land-based missiles with a range of between 310 and 3,400 miles (500 and 5,500 km).
Despite the lack of obvious progress, the atmosphere between the two sides appeared cordial.
Sherman called it a frank and forthright discussion, while Ryabkov said it was difficult but professional and that the U.S. had approached the Russian proposals seriously.

He said Russia would decide on the prospects for progress after further meetings with NATO members in Brussels on Wednesday and with the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Vienna on Thursday.
U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said he did not expect a breakthrough in either meeting but Washington and Moscow would touch base after them to explore the way forward.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) -Novak Djokovic was back in training hours after winning a court challenge to remain in Australia on Monday, thanking the judge who released him from immigration detention and saying he remained focused on trying to win a record 21st tennis major.
The fight over the world number one's medical exemption https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/djokovic-will-defend-australian-open-title-after-exemption-vaccination-2022-01-04 from COVID-19 vaccination in order to enter Australia and play may not be over, however, as the government said it was still considering another way to deport him.
""I am pleased and grateful that the judge overturned my visa cancellation,"" Djokovic wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) https://twitter.com/DjokerNole?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor, where he posted a photograph of himself on court at Melbourne Park after a chaotic few days.
""Despite all that has happened I want to stay and try to compete at the Australian Open.""
Judge Anthony Kelly ruled the federal government's decision https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/djokovic-begins-4th-day-australian-detention-legal-hearing-looms-2022-01-08 last week to revoke the Serbian tennis star's visa was ""unreasonable"", and ordered his release from a modest hotel also used to house scores of asylum seekers.
""Novak is free and just a moment ago he went to the tennis court to practice,"" Djokovic's younger brother Djordje told a family news conference https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/djokovic-back-practice-family-hails-biggest-victory-his-life-2022-01-10 in Belgrade. ""He's out there to set another record.""
Djokovic, who arrived in Australia last week, spent most of the day at his lawyers' chambers.
Supporters who had gathered outside https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/chaos-melbourne-fans-call-djokovics-release-2022-01-10 chanting ""Free Novak!"" surged around a black car with tinted windows leaving the building, while police used pepper spray to try to clear a path.
The saga has triggered diplomatic tensions between Belgrade and Canberra, dismayed some Australians enduring a surge in cases, and fuelled domestic political point-scoring.
A spokesman for Immigration Minister Alex Hawke said he was considering using his discretionary power to revoke Djokovic's visa again. That could mean a three-year ban on re-entering.
""The minister is currently considering the matter and the process remains ongoing,"" the spokesman said.
COURT 'CIRCUS'
Spain's Rafa Nadal, who is tied on 20 majors with Djokovic and Switzerland's Roger Federer, called the fraught build-up to the tournament a ""circus"".
""Justice has spoken and has said that he has the right to participate in the Australian Open and I think it is the fairest decision,"" Nadal told the Spanish radio station Onda Cero.
The Australian Open begins on Jan. 17. Djokovic has won the tournament, one of tennis' four Grand Slams, for the last three years and nine times in all.
Czech player Renata Voracova, whose visa was also cancelled, told Reuters she welcomed the decision to let him stay: ""Hopefully he can play. Because that is what we went there for: to play tennis and not be part of any inside games.""
Former American player turned pundit Pam Shriver warned on Twitter the controversy may not be over: ""If he plays the booing will be deafening.""
Judge Kelly said he had quashed the decision to block Djokovic's entry because the player had not been given enough time to respond to it.
Officials at Melbourne's airport, where Djokovic had been detained late on Wednesday, reneged on an agreement to give him until 8:30 a.m. to speak to Tennis Australia and lawyers, Kelly said.
The player, who has long opposed mandatory vaccination, told border officials he was unvaccinated and had had COVID-19 twice, according to a transcript of the interview.
MEDICAL EXEMPTION
Kelly told the court it appeared Djokovic had received the medical exemption from COVID-19 vaccination on the basis that he had contracted the virus last month, and had presented evidence of the infection before travelling and on arrival.
""What more could this man have done?"" he said.
Kelly's ruling did not directly address the issue of whether the exemption on the grounds of an infection in the past six months was valid, which the government had disputed.
Tennis Australia CEO Craig Tiley has said his organisation had spoken with federal and state officials for months to ensure the safe passage of players. Tennis Australia did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.
The authorities' efforts to let the media and public follow events in court at times descended into farce, with pranksters hijacking internet links to stream loud music and porn. https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/pranksters-hijack-djokovics-virtual-court-hearing-stream-music-porn-2022-01-10

Though news of the ruling was greeted with drums and dancing by around 50 supporters outside the court, public opinion in Australia, where more than 90% of the adult population is double vaccinated, has been largely against the player. Melbourne has experienced the world's longest cumulative lockdown. 
Australia has registered more than half a million cases in the past week.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -New York authorities said on Monday the city was investigating a possible ""maintenance issue"" with self-closing doors that failed to function properly when a devastating fire erupted in a Bronx apartment building a day earlier, killing 17 people, including eight children.
New York City Mayor Eric Adams, just over a week into the job, said at a briefing that the city's medical examiner determined the fire had claimed two fewer lives than the 19 announced on Sunday. 
Nearly three dozen survivors were hospitalized with severe injuries.
The blaze broke out on Sunday morning in the 19-floor Twin Parks North West building, which provided affordable housing units for low-income New Yorkers. Many of the residents were from the large Gambian immigrant community that lived in the neighborhood. 
""This is a global tragedy as the Bronx and New York City is representative of the ethnicities and cultures across the globe,"" Adams said during a briefing in front of the building. ""This is an evolving crisis. An unspeakable tragedy."" 
Adams said he spoke with U.S. President Joe Biden, who pledged that the White House will provide any assistance needed to address the aftermath of the fire.
The catastrophe was likely to stir questions on safety standards in low-income city housing. It was the second major fire in a residential complex in the United States this week after 12 people, including eight children, were killed early on Wednesday when flames swept through a public housing apartment building in Philadelphia.
Crew dressed in white protective suits were on the scene of the Bronx fire cleaning glass and debris off sidewalks on Monday as firefighters and inspectors continued to examine the building's interior and exterior.
The street was cordoned off where a small group of people gathered, some bringing clothing and other donations for survivors.
SPACE HEATER STARTED FIRE
Fire marshals determined through physical evidence and accounts from residents that the fire started from a portable electric heater in a bedroom of an apartment that spanned the second and third floors of the building. The building's furnace was functioning, and the portable device that caught fire was being used to supplement central heating, they said.
Earlier in the day on the ABC News program ""Good Morning America,"" Adams said smoke spread swiftly to other parts of the building due to a faulty self-closing apartment door being left open, rather than shutting automatically as designed in order to help contain fires.
""There may have been a maintenance issue with this door, and that is going to be part of the ongoing investigation,"" Adams said. ""This is all going to come out during the investigation.""
Investigators were also looking into the possibility that a door to the 15th floor stairway was not functioning as it should, Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said, adding that residents would have been safer if they stayed in their apartments rather than exiting down stairways. 
At least two residents who spoke to Reuters said fire alarms went off in the building ""periodically"" or routinely and were not always heeded.
One survivor, John Maroney, 59, recounted he was awakened by firemen as his 13th-floor apartment filled with smoke and was given oxygen by emergency personnel after being ushered out of his unit.
""And then I learned about the fatalities, which is, you know, I'm still going through that. I'm still dealing with that,"" he said standing at the door of the hotel room where he was staying afterwards. 
His wife, who was at work at the time of the fire, has since returned to their unit and found no structural damage to their home. ""I'm lucky. I'm still here and my wife is still here with me,"" Maroney said.
Fire Commissioner Nigro said officials do not yet have a tally of how many victims were found in apartments, stairwells and hallways. 
He added that stairwells were ""very dangerous"" during the emergency because of smoke filling the area. 
Addressing the revised death toll, Nigro said patients had been taken to seven different hospitals in the city, which led to ""a bit of a double count."" 
Some 60 people were injured in the blaze, 32 of them hospitalized with life-threatening injuries, officials said on Sunday. 
More than 200 firefighters helped put out the blaze.
""Many of them, of their oxygen tanks were on empty,"" Adams said on Monday. ""But instead of turning back and exiting the building, they pushed through, through the smoke.""
The building is owned by a joint venture, Bronx Park Phase III Preservation LLC, made up of three firms - LIHC Investment Group, Belveron Partners and Camber Property Group.

The building was constructed in 1972 as part of a state program to provide affordable housing, a spokesperson for the joint venture said. All 120 units are covered by subsidy programs, the spokesperson said.
She said the building was equipped with self-closing doors, and that owners are ""cooperating fully"" with fire officials and other agencies investigating the blaze.

305,"<span>Jan 10, 2022 04:21PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -A court in military-ruled Myanmar on Monday sentenced ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi to four years in jail on charges including possession of unlicensed walkie-talkies, a source familiar with the proceedings said.
The latest sentencing in legal proceedings that rights groups have criticised as a farce and a ""courtroom circus"" means she faces a six-year jail term after two convictions last month.
She is on trial in nearly a dozen cases that carry combined maximum sentences of more than 100 years in prison. She denies all charges.
Nobel laureate Suu Kyi, 76, appeared calm when the verdict was read out on Monday in a court in the capital, Naypyitaw, said another source with knowledge of the court proceedings.
Suu Kyi was detained on the day of the Feb. 1 coup and days later, police said six illegally imported walkie-talkies were found during a search of her home.
International human rights groups, the Norwegian Nobel Committee and the United States assailed the news, with U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price calling the convictions ""an affront to justice and the rule of law"" and demanding the release of Suu Kyi and other political detainees.
The court handed her a two-year sentence for breaching an export-import law by possessing the handheld radios and one year for having a set of signal jammers. The two sentences will run concurrently, said the source.
She was also sentenced to two years on another charge of breaching a natural disaster management law related to coronavirus rules, the source said.
Myanmar has been in turmoil since the coup against Suu Kyi's democratically elected government led to widespread protests and signalled the end of 10 years of tentative political reforms that followed decades of strict military rule.
On Dec. 6, she received a four-year jail sentence for incitement and breaching coronavirus rules. 
That sentence, which was later reduced to two years, was met by a chorus of international condemnation. 
The United States, along with other Western nations, has levelled sanctions against the Myanmar military and its businesses since the coup.
Rights group Amnesty International said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Monday the new convictions were ""the latest act in the farcical trial against the civilian leader.""
""The latest verdict against Aung San Suu Kyi is a politically motivated verdict. Aung San Suu Kyi continues to be the leading champion of democracy in Myanmar,"" Berit Reiss-Andersen, the chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, told Reuters.
""The Nobel Committee is deeply concerned about her situation,"" she added.
SECRETIVE TRIAL
Suu Kyi's supporters say the cases against her are baseless and designed to end her political career and leave the military free to wield power untrammelled by any challenge.
The junta says Suu Kyi is being given due process by an independent court led by a judge appointed by her own administration. A spokesman for the military council could not be immediately reached for comment. 
Her trial has been closed to the media and Suu Kyi's lawyers have been barred from communicating with the media and public.
The military has not disclosed where Suu Kyi, who spent years under house arrest under a previous military government, is being detained.
""The Myanmar junta’s courtroom circus of secret proceedings on bogus charges is all about steadily piling up more convictions ... so that she will remain in prison indefinitely,"" Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.
In some recent court hearings, Suu Kyi has been wearing a white top and a brown wraparound longyi https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmars-ousted-leader-suu-kyi-appears-prison-uniform-court-2021-12-17 typically worn by Myanmar prisoners, sources have said. 

Military ruler Min Aung Hlaing last month said Suu Kyi and ousted President Win Myint would remain in the same location during their trials and would not be sent to prison.
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen did not seek to meet Suu Kyi during a visit to the country last week for talks with its military rulers.

Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will speak in Atlanta about the need to secure voting rights in the United States and change the Senate filibuster rule https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-push-filibuster-changes-mlk-hometown-atlanta-2022-01-10 in the face of new Republican-backed laws that Democrats say will suppress minority votes.
""It is very disappointing that we use our voice and our vote to elect the Democrats to handle this issue and it just hasn't been given the priority that it should,"" April England Albright, legal director for activist group Black Voters Matter, said in an interview. 
The group, which last summer arranged a bus tour through southern states https://www.reuters.com/world/us/freedom-riders-60th-anniversary-voting-activists-ask-biden-do-more-2021-06-22 to mark the 60th anniversary of the historic ""Freedom Riders"" campaign, will boycott the speech along with the New Georgia Project Action Fund, the Asian American Advocacy Fund and the GALEO Impact Action Fund, which represents Latinos. 

Biden will be joined in Atlanta by NAACP president Derrick Johnson and leaders from other civil rights groups. In a statement, the groups that will not attend called Biden's visit an ""unacceptable"" empty gesture, unless it includes ""an announcement of a finalized voting rights plan that will pass both chambers, not be stopped by the filibuster, and be signed into law.""
Senate Democrats tried to bring https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-vote-changing-rules-if-republicans-obstruct-voting-rights-law-schumer-2022-01-03 the voting-rights bill to a floor vote four times last year, and were repeatedly blocked by Republicans, who made use of the filibuster rule that requires 60 of the 100 senators to agree to advance most legislation.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Israel's Health Ministry on Monday instructed people self-testing for COVID-19 to swab their throat as well as their nose when using rapid antigen kits to increase the chances of detecting the Omicron variant.
The recommendation goes against the advice of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has said manufacturers' instructions should still be followed and that incorrect use of throat swabs could pose a safety risk.
On Israeli Army Radio, Sharon Alroy-Preis, Israel's public health chief, said antigen - or lateral flow - tests, used widely in the country, are less sensitive than PCR tests in detecting illness.
""In order to increase their sensitivity we will from now on recommend swabbing the throat and the nose. It's not what the manufacturer instructs but we are instructing this,"" she said.
The ministry later issued guidelines which said a swab should be taken from the throat and then from one nostril.
""It has the potential to improve the reliability of the test,"" Salman Zarka, Israel's pandemic-response coordinator, told a news conference, adding that the ministry would release a video showing how to use the new method.
Zarka said the ministry had spoken with companies supplying the test kits before issuing the new recommendation.
Rhenium, one of the Israeli importers of antigen kits, said earlier the Health Ministry had not consulted with it before issuing the new guidelines and that the tests, not checked by the company for throat swabs, were intended for nasal swabs.
MORE THAN ONE TEST
With Omicron pushing daily infection cases to record highs, health officials have prioritised risk groups for PCR testing and trusted younger, vaccinated people to test at home if exposed to COVID-19. [L1N2TM11R]
Alroy-Preis said that when exposed to a carrier, people should take more than one test or wait three days after exposure before testing with rapid kits.
The quarantine period for those testing positive is expected to be shortened from 10 to seven days, though a final decision has not been made, the Health Ministry's director general said.
Some infectious disease experts have advocated throat swabbing with antigen tests because people can transmit Omicron to others when the virus has infected their throat and saliva but not yet reached their nose.
A study released on Wednesday by online archive medRxiv before peer review looked at 29 Omicron-infected workers in high-risk professions who had PCR and antigen tests simultaneously on multiple days. The PCR tests of saliva detected the virus on average three days before rapid nose-swab samples became positive.

However, the U.S. FDA tweeted on Friday: ""When it comes to at-home rapid antigen COVID-19 tests, those swabs are for your nose and not your throat"". Throat swabs, it said, ""if used incorrectly, can cause harm to the patient"".
Israel has confirmed around 1.5 million infections since the coronavirus pandemic began, and more than 8,000 deaths, and says around 60% of its 9.4 million population is now fully vaccinated.

LONDON (Reuters) -British republicans said on Monday they would launch a campaign to end the monarchy in the run-up to celebrations to mark Queen Elizabeth's 70 years on the throne.
Elizabeth, 95, the world's oldest and longest-reigning monarch, will mark her seventh decade as sovereign next month and on Monday Buckingham Palace detailed plans for four days of celebrations for her Platinum Jubilee in June.
But anti-monarchy group Republic used the occasion to say it would begin a ""Not Another 70"" campaign to call for an end to the historic institution.
""While a vocal minority will want to celebrate the queen's seventy year reign, we must all start looking to the future. The prospect of King Charles is not a happy one, and there is a good, democratic alternative on offer,"" Republic's Graham (NYSE:GHM) Smith said.

""It's time to have a serious debate about our constitution, accept that Charles is not the best the country has to offer, and that as a nation we are quite capable of choosing our head of state.""
Polls indicate the vast majority of people in Britain support the monarchy and the queen herself is hugely popular. But there is not as much support for her eldest son and heir Charles, and surveys suggest there is growing republican sentiment among younger Britons.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) -The United Nations said it was starting consultations in Sudan on Monday to try to salvage the country's move to democracy after a military coup.
U.N. officials was contacting parties to look for a way forward, and the army had raised no objections to the initiative, U.N. special representative Volker Perthes told reporters. ""We want to move quickly,"" he said.
The U.N. plan amounts to the only substantial effort at present to resolve the political crisis. 
The military takeover in October wrecked a power-sharing arrangement with civilian leaders that was meant to pave the way to elections after the overthrow of leader Omar al-Bashir in 2019. 
The coup also halted a Western-backed opening up of the economy after decades of isolation and sanctions.
Protesters have regularly taken to the streets demanding civilian rule, and medics aligned with the protest movement say more than 60 people have died in clashes with security services. 
""I do hope that these consultations can become something like a confidence-building measure and would help to at least reduce the violence,"" Perthes said.
Protest groups and the political parties ousted by the coup have so far refused to negotiate directly with the military. 
So the United Nations would start by approaching groups individually, in the hope of moving onto to a second phase of direct or indirect negotiations, Perthes said.
The first sessions on Monday afternoon would involve civil society groups. ""We will have every day a mix of stakeholders we are talking to,"" he said.
U.N. officials have asked the groups to present their visions for a way forward, with the aim of producing a consensus on points of agreement and disagreement at the conclusion of talks.
Perthes said that only Bashir's former ruling party and the Sudanese Communist Party had rejected the initiative outright, while the military had not objected to the process.
He said it would be tricky to set a timeframe for concluding talks and starting negotiations and that if one or two more weeks were needed, hard deadlines would not be imposed. ""Time is precious, we know that. There's a lot of pressure on the situation in Sudan and on us.""
Unless a new course for the transition and a path to credible elections is found, Sudan's economic plight could worsen and instability could spread inside and outside its borders, analysts and diplomats say. 
Perthes told Reuters he would find ways to make use of offers of support from international players including the United States and Saudi Arabia, both key donors, and that others including European states and Kenya had also offered backing.

""The U.S., the Saudis, and a couple of others are very heavily involved, they helped in developing some ideas,"" he said.
More mass protests against the military are planned, with another round expected on Wednesday.

Ortega, who in November won an election which U.S. President Joe Biden described as a ""pantomime"" after the Nicaraguan government's crackdown on the opposition and critical media, is due to be sworn in for his next term on Monday afternoon.
Mexico's foreign ministry on Sunday initially said it would send a representative to the ceremony, but later announced that it would not due to an annual meeting of diplomats.
However, on Monday President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said it would be imprudent not to send someone, and that Ramiro Ayala, Mexico's charge d'affaires in Nicaragua, would attend.
""Because we can't set aside our policy of national self-determination and independence,"" he said, arguing that the previous Mexican administration had been beholden to the interests of ""another government"" in its diplomatic policy.

Asked what he thought of Ortega's victory in the election, Lopez Obrador answered: ""The decisions are theirs,"" he said, before briefly looking down. ""The Nicaraguans',"" he added.
Separately, the United States on Monday imposed sanctions on Nicaraguan officials, including the defense minister, in coordination with the European Union.

OLYMPIC PENINSULA, Wash. (Reuters) - Howling hounds picked up a cougar's scent and led researchers deep into the forest, where the steep hills were covered with cedars and ferns dusted with snow.
The dogs chased Lilu, an 82-pound (37-kg) cougar whose collar needed a new battery, up a tree. After being plunked by a tranquilizer dart, the groggy cat climbed down and went to sleep. The team was able to swap her collar, examine Lilu, and then inject her with a drug to wake her.
It was part of a day's work for the Olympic Cougar Project, a partnership between a coalition of Native American tribes, a renowned cougar expert, and the Washington Department of Transportation.
The project could lead to placing highway crossings so wandering cougars - also known as mountain lions and pumas - can find new places to breed, improving the wider environment. The same species of cat prowls terrain from Canada to Tierra del Fuego.
""Without a doubt, mountain lions increase the health of ecosystems,"" said Mark Elbroch, one of the world's leading cougar experts with Panthera, a wildcat conservation group that is part of the Olympic Cougar Project.
When a cougar kills a large mammal like a deer or elk, it cannot eat the whole carcass. In the Olympic Peninsula, the apex predator leaves behind a meal for golden eagles, bald eagles, ravens, crows and other birds; mammals such as bear, weasels, bobcats, and coyotes; and a range of invertebrates including all kinds of beetles.
Like bears, cougars claw salmon out of rivers, helping fertilize plant species in the woods. 
The Lower Elwha Klallam, Skokomish, Makah, Quinault, Jamestown S'Klallam and the Port Gamble S'Klallam tribes in the Olympic Peninsula are lending their traditional knowledge to the project, along with the modern expertise of wildlife biologists.
""As an indigenous person, we are taught that we have to walk in two worlds, one of our traditional sense and one of the modern day sense,"" said Vanessa Castle, a Lower Elwha Klallam tribal member who works for the project. ""I think it changes the way these scientists think about these animals."" 
Biologists say big cats on the Olympic Peninsula have lower genetic diversity than the rest of Washington state as they are hemmed in by Interstate 5 and cut off from natural breeding partners in the Cascade mountains. 
Part of figuring out where to build a wildlife crossing - a practice used in habitat conservation - involves tracking the cougars by fitting them with GPS collars that provide a wealth of useful data. Lilu is among about 60 collared cougars on the peninsula. There is no consenus on the total population of the elusive, wide-ranging animals.
""The collaring piece gives us information that we just could not get in any other way,"" said Kim Sager-Fradkin, a wildlife biologist hired by the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe.
Some 100,000 cars travel along I-5 each day, blocking cougars and other wildlife from crossing to the other side of the freeway. 
""It is likely one of the worst barriers for all species in the state,"" said Glen Kalisz, a habitat connectivity biologist with the Washington state Department of Transportation.
In Southern California, transit authorities are soon to break ground on a wildlife crossing over U.S. Highway 101, used by 350,000 cars a day, in one of the last remaining areas where there is natural habitat on both sides of the freeway.
As with the Washington project, the aim is to improve cougars' genetic diversity.

Both the California crossing and the Washington I-5 project are learning from one of the largest such undertakings, along a corridor of I-90 further north in Washington, which is about halfway through building 26 wildlife crossings along 15 miles (24 km) of the highway.

The 95-year-old, the longest-reigning monarch in British history, will add another milestone when she marks her Platinum Jubilee in February, with the government planning four days of celebrations from June 2-5.
Buckingham Palace said Britons aged 8 and over were encouraged to apply for a baking competition to find the ""perfect Platinum Pudding recipe"" dedicated to the queen, while some could also ""plant a tree for the Jubilee"".
During the long holiday weekend in June, people will be able to see the trooping the colour https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-queen-joined-by-cousin-trooping-colour-event-2021-06-12 in her birthday parade, a service of thanksgiving in London's St Paul's Cathedral, a party at the Palace among other events.
In November, culture minister Oliver Dowden said the four days of celebrations would be ""a celebration to remember"".
Elizabeth, who is also the world's current oldest and longest-reigning monarch, became queen on Feb. 6, 1952, on the death of her father George VI.

In September 2015, she overtook the length of time her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria had spent on the throne, remarking that the historical moment was ""not one to which I have ever aspired"".
The plans are similar to those which marked the queen's 60th anniversary in 2012 when Britain held four days of events in her honour, including a huge flotilla on the River Thames and capped off with a star-studded concert at Buckingham Palace.

Sweden has seen the fastest spread of COVID cases in recent weeks as the Omicron variant has surged through the country. A record 60,000 cases were detected last week, despite limited testing capabilities.
""The situation has deteriorated, without doubt. The level of infections in Sweden is at a historically high level,"" Andersson told a news conference.
The new measures, most of which will be introduced on Wednesday, include a work-from-home mandate, where possible, and a cap on the number of people allowed at public events. 
Restaurants will have to close by 11 p.m. and guests will have to be seated and in groups no greater than eight people. Adults will be asked to limit social contact in indoor settings.
The measures will be evaluated after two weeks, but are expected to be in place for at least four weeks.
Still, while infection numbers have soared, the number of COVID patients hospitalized is well below the peaks seen in previous waves. The number of new deaths has also been comparatively low. 
More than 1,000 people are being treated in hospital for COVID and roughly 100 of them are in intensive care units. 
The strain on healthcare is being exacerbated by the spread by other respiratory viruses as well as staff shortages, the National Board of Health and Welfare said. 

""Unfortunately, we need to make another effort to get down the number of new infections,"" Andersson said.
The health agency said on Monday that the peak of the wave will come later than previously expected and that the Omicron variant made the disease harder to predict. The previous assessment was for a peak in mid-January and then a gradual decline.

PARIS (Reuters) - Fifteen years ago, Valerie Pecresse quelled a student uprising over her university reforms with the same blend of consensus-building politics and reformist mettle that she believes will now propel her to the French presidency.
Chosen to run last month by rank-and-file members of the conservative Les Republicains party, voter surveys show Pecresse could beat President Emmanuel Macron in April's election. If she succeeds, she would become France's first woman head of state.
In an office adorned with framed cinema posters, Pecresse, 54, reeled off a list of woes facing France that speak of her social and fiscal conservatism: poor control of national borders, violent city ghettos and a growing pile of debt.
""We need to restore order, both on our streets and in our national accounts,"" she told Reuters.
A minister for higher education and then the budget during Nicolas Sarkozy's presidency, Pecresse said last week she would bring out ""the power hose"" to clean up trouble neighbourhoods where the state had lost authority and lawlessness prevailed.
Critical of Macron for ""burning a hole in the state coffers"" during the pandemic, Pecresse has promised to reform France's generous pension system and cut a bloated public wage bill - both pledges she says Macron has failed to deliver on.
Her style, she says, is ""two-thirds (Angela) Merkel and one-third (Margaret) Thatcher"".
""I am a woman who consults, decides and acts,"" she said. ""The one-part Thatcher is to say 'I'm not for turning',"" referring to a phrase in a 1980 speech when the conservative British leader refused to back down on liberalising reforms.
Pecresse pointed to the cutting of hundreds of jobs at her head office to make way for more high-school staff, reduced spending and higher investment as proof she gets things done. In 2020, she won a second mandate to run the greater Paris region. 
Opponents who had nicknamed her ""the blond"" had paid the price, she said. Asked if France was ready for a woman president, she replied: ""Voters on the right have shown they're ready, and they can be the most reticent to trust a woman."" 
'UNBENDING'
Pecresse's party, which traces its origins to Charles de Gaulle, dominated French politics for much of the post-war era. But after Macron redrew the landscape in 2017, it has struggled to unite its centre-right and staunchly conservative factions.
The defection of a senior conservative lawmaker https://www.reuters.com/article/france-election-zemmour-idUKKBN2JJ073 to the campaign bid of far-right polemicist Eric Zemmour on Sunday underscored the challenge she faces keeping a feuding party together. 
Opinion polls show her in a close-fought race with Marine Le Pen, leader of the traditional far-right, for the second spot in the election's run-off vote. Zemmour follows close behind. Should she make it, she would be the most dangerous opponent for Macron, the surveys suggest. 
Born in an upmarket Paris suburb and educated at France's elite ENA school for politicians and civil servants, Pecresse is a moderate in a conservative party that has lurched rightwards as the far-right fuels anti-immigrant sentiment and a desire among many voters to get tough on law and order. 
Pecresse has toughened her language on immigration and identity, seeking to neutralise the threat from Le Pen and Zemmour, whose promise to ""save France"" https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/french-far-right-commentator-zemmour-announces-presidential-run-2021-11-30 from Islam has polarised France.
She says she would end the automatic right to French citizenship for people born in France and stiffen judicial sentences in places where police have lost control.
On a table in Pecresse's office sits a photograph of Samuel Paty, the teacher decapitated by a Chechen-born teenager in a suburb of Paris in 2020 because he used caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad in a lesson on free speech. 

Pecresse said the teacher's portrait would follow her to the Elysee Palace if she won the election.
""We have to be unbending in the respect of our values,"" Pecresse said. ""In the public space, the law comes before faith. It's the same rights, the same duties for all.""

NUR-SULTAN (Reuters) -Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed victory on Monday in defending Kazakhstan from what he described as a foreign-backed terrorist uprising, and promised leaders of other ex-Soviet states that a Moscow-led alliance would protect them too.
Kazakhstan's biggest city Almaty returned to near-normal on Monday after nearly a week of unrest, by far the worst violence in the 30-year independent history of what had been the most stable former Soviet state in Central Asia.
Cleaners were removing debris from streets still littered with burnt-out cars. Most shops reopened, public transport and regular traffic returned, and the internet was switched back on for several hours in the city, for the first time since last Wednesday.
The square near the mayor's office, burnt out during the uprising, was firmly held by the security forces and closed to the public. Police searched cars at checkpoints.
Putin sent paratroopers last week to protect strategic facilities after anti-government protesters ransacked and torched public buildings. Dozens of people are believed to have been killed in clashes between security forces and demonstrators in cities across the country.
Russia's swift deployment demonstrated the Kremlin's readiness to use force to safeguard its influence in the ex-Soviet Union, at a time when Moscow is also in a standoff with the West over thousands of troops massed near Ukraine.
Putin told a virtual summit of the CSTO military alliance of ex-Soviet states that the body had managed to ""prevent the undermining of the foundations of the state, the complete degradation of the internal situation in Kazakhstan, and block terrorists, criminals, looters and other criminal elements.""
""Of course, we understand the events in Kazakhstan are not the first and far from the last attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of our states from the outside,"" he said. ""The measures taken by the CSTO have clearly shown we will not allow the situation to be rocked at home.""
Kazakhstan's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev told the summit his country had weathered ""an attempted coup d'etat"".
""Under the guise of spontaneous protests, a wave of unrest broke out,"" he said. ""It became clear that the main goal was to undermine the constitutional order and to seize power.""
Russia and Kazakhstan have both portrayed the unrest as a foreign-backed insurrection, although they have not said who they blame for organising it.
Russia has long blamed the West for fomenting so-called ""colour revolutions"" -- uprisings that have toppled governments in countries such as Georgia, Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia -- and promoted its own role helping to suppress them. It backed the leader of Belarus in crushing demonstrations in 2020.
TAKEOVER
The uprising in Kazkahstan began as protests against a New Year's Day fuel price hike quickly spread last week into nationwide demonstrations against the government and ex-leader Nursultan Nazarbayev, 81. The longest-serving ruler of a former Soviet state, he handed the presidency to Tokayev three years ago but was widely believed to have kept the reins of power. 
""The main blow was directed against (the city of) Almaty. The fall of this city would have paved the way for a takeover of the densely populated south and then the whole country,"" Tokayev said. ""Then they planned to seize the capital.""
Kazakhstan has been ruled firmly and with little organised political opposition since independence, but was seen for decades as far less volatile and repressive than its Central Asian neighbours. The violence came as a shock to Almaty residents, who shared a poem online lamenting how the ""garden city"" had been ""raped, seized, trampled and torched"".
Tokayev said a large-scale counter-terrorism operation would soon end, along with a CSTO mission that he said numbered 2,030 troops and 250 pieces of military hardware.
The Kazakh foreign ministry said in a statement the attackers included ""individuals who have military combat zone experience in the ranks of radical Islamist groups"" without providing further details.
The National Security Committee, successor to the Soviet-era KGB, said the situation had stabilised and that security forces had restored control.
Last week Tokayev sacked the head of the committee, Karim Massimov, and his top deputy, Nazarbayev's nephew. Masimov has since been detained on suspicion of treason. Nazarbayev himself has not been heard from, and was stripped of a security post he had retained after giving up the presidency.

Monday was declared a day of mourning for those killed in the unrest. Russian and state media, citing a government social media post, have reported that 164 people had been killed. Health and police authorities have not confirmed that figure, and the original social media post has been deleted.
A former Kazakh prime minister, Akezhan Kazhegeldin, told Reuters on Sunday that Tokayev must move fast to consolidate his grip after appearing to break with Nazarbayev.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Dark Western ""The Power of the Dog"" and a remake of ""West Side Story"" won the biggest awards on Sunday at a diminished Golden Globes ceremony held privately without the usual glitzy lineup of Hollywood's top television and movie stars.
Actors, directors and film studios largely ignored the Globes this year after criticism in 2021 that its organizers, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), operated with questionable ethics policies and no Black members https://www.reuters.com/article/us-awards-goldenglobes-diversity-idUSKBN2AR01A. Longtime broadcaster NBC opted not to air this year's awards.
The HFPA, which has expanded and diversified its membership https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/golden-globes-group-adds-new-members-it-works-diversify-2021-10-01 and overhauled its practices, announced its picks at a Beverly Hills ceremony held behind closed doors. Recipients of HFPA philanthropic grants sat in the audience and announced winners. Honorees were revealed via social media and a live blog.
Steven Spielberg's ""West Side Story,"" a tale of young love set among rival street gangs, was named best musical or comedy film. Released by Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co, the film earned three trophies overall, including best actress for Rachel Zegler.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s ""The Power of the Dog"" also won three awards including best director for Jane Campion.
Other acting honors went to Will Smith for playing the determined father of tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams in ""King Richard"" and Nicole Kidman for her role as Lucille Ball (NYSE:BLL) in ""Being the Ricardos."" 
""Thank you for the acknowledgement!"" Kidman, one of few winners to acknowledge their award, wrote on Instagram. ""Lucille, this is for you and all the other incredible women nominated.""
Andrew Garfield won a best actor award for his role as playwright Jonathan Larson in musical ""Tick, Tick... Boom!""
For television, cutthroat corporate family saga ""Succession"" received the best drama award and ""Hacks,"" about a fading female comedian, was crowned best comedy.
Netflix led all studios with four film awards. HBO and HBO Max landed the most television honors, with six. 
'JOURNEY OF CHANGE'
Mj Rodriguez, was named best TV drama actress for ""Pose"". It was the first Golden Globe given to a transgender actress.
""Wow! ... Thank you!"" she wrote on Instagram. ""This is the door that is going to open the door for many more young talented individuals.""
""West Side Story"" stars Zegler and Ariana DeBose, who won best supporting actress, also acknowledged their wins.
""There is still work to be done, but when you’ve worked so hard on a project- infused with blood, sweat, tears and love- having the work seen and acknowledged is always going to be special. Thank you,"" DeBose tweeted.
The Globes normally draw millions of TV viewers to a celebrity-filled red carpet and champagne-fueled dinner that makes for a glamorous yet informal contrast to the Academy Awards, the industry's highest film honors. 
In the past, winning a Globe provided a boost to movies making a run for the Oscars. This year, the significance is less clear. Awards watchers will follow closely other upcoming award ceremonies like the Screen Actors Guild and Producers Guild of America ahead of the March 27 Oscars.
Critics had objected to the HFPA not having any Black members and raised questions over whether close relationships with Hollywood studios influenced the selection of nominees and winners. In May, Tom Cruise returned the three Golden Globe statuettes he had won.
The HFPA responded https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/golden-globes-group-adds-new-members-it-works-diversify-2021-10-01 by adding 21 new members, six of whom are Black, banning gifts and favors, and implementing diversity and sexual harassment training. The group now has 105 members and plans to expand this year.
""We are on a journey of change and we're not going to rest,"" HFPA President Helen Hoehne said in a statement.

At the ceremony, the HFPA played videos of support from actors Jamie Lee Curtis, who praised the group's charitable work, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, who said winning a Golden Globe in 1977 helped launch his career.
""They understand that to support the arts and creativity, one must cultivate new, original and diverse voices,"" he said of the HFPA.

Wang Yi, who is also a state councillor, made the comments in a call to Kazakhstan's foreign minister Mukhtar Tileuberdi, according to the Chinese foreign ministry.
""Recent turmoil in Kazakhstan shows that the situation in Central Asia is still facing severe challenges, and it once again proves that some external forces do not want peace and tranquillity in our region,"" the ministry quoted Wang telling Tileuberdi.
Government buildings in Kazakhstan were briefly captured or torched in several cities last week as initially peaceful protests against fuel price increases turned violent. Troops were ordered to shoot to kill to put down a countrywide uprising.
Authorities have blamed the violence on ""extremists"", including foreign-trained Islamist militants, for the violence.
Authorities also asked a Russian-led military bloc to send in troops, who the government says have been deployed to guard strategic sites, a move questioned by United States. 
Experts say China worries instability in its neighbour could threaten energy imports and Belt-and-Road projects there, and security in its western Xinjiang region, which shares a 1,770-km (1,110-mile) border with Kazakhstan.
China was willing to ""jointly oppose the interference and infiltration of any external forces"", said Wang. 
China's President Xi Jinping on Friday told Kazakhstan President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev that China resolutely opposed any foreign force that destabilises Kazakhstan and engineers a ""colour revolution"", Chinese state television said.
China and Russia believe ""colour revolutions"" are uprisings instigated by the United States and other Western powers to achieve regime change.
""China does not want to see an expansion of U.S. influence in Kazakhstan and Central Asia as a result of this unrest,"" said Li Mingjiang, associate professor at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. 
""If a colour revolution in a nearby country leads to political democratisation, it could encourage the liberal-leaning intellectual elite in China to try something similar,"" he said.

Since the Vietnam War in the 1960s, China traditionally does not send troops to other countries, citing its policy of non-interference, except under the United Nations Peacekeeping banner. 
Last month it sent six police officers to the Solomon Islands to help train the police force and quell the riots sparked by the country's 2019 switch of diplomatic relations to Beijing from Taiwan.

KYIV (Reuters) - As officials from the United States and Russia began talks https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/prospects-dim-us-russia-start-tense-talks-over-ukraine-crisis-2022-01-10 on Monday over Ukraine's security, Kyiv resident Oleh was among those who questioned why the country at the centre of the crisis was not at the negotiating table.
""I think it should not be this way,"" the 59-year-old said.
""Ukraine must be present during those meetings because it is a more interested party than other countries, more interested party than Russia and the United States. Ukraine must be sitting in the first row.""
Washington hopes that negotiations will avert the threat of a Russian military offensive in Ukraine, while not conceding to Moscow's security demands that include throwing out the prospect of Ukraine joining the NATO alliance.
Ukraine has sought and received assurances from allies that there would be ""no decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine"", as Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba put it last week.
""Ukraine must be present at such talks because they directly concern its security, its life,"" said another Kyiv resident, 57-year-old accountant Valentyna.
Despite its absence from negotiations in Geneva, Ukraine has pressed the European Union and United States to prepare tough measures as part of a diplomatic push to deter Russia.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy spoke to U.S. President Joe Biden on Jan. 2 while Ukrainian and NATO officials meet in Brussels on Monday.
DEFIANCE AND ALARM
Ukrainians have struck a defiant tone, while sounding the alarm about a build-up of tens of thousands of Russian troops near Ukraine's borders.
More than 150 people gathered at a protest in Kyiv on Sunday, holding up signs saying ""SAY NO TO PUTIN"". 
A December survey by the KIIS think-tank said 49% of Ukrainians thought the threat of invasion was real, while 59% said they would vote ""yes"" compared to 28% ""no"" in a referendum on joining NATO.
Furthermore, 33% said they were ready to put up armed resistance against Russia while a further 21% said they were ready for civil resistance actions.
Ukraine has been fighting a war against Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine since 2014, a conflict which Zelenskiy said has killed as many as 15,000 people, despite a peace deal agreed in Minsk in 2015. 
The bombed-out village of Katerynivka in the Luhansk region bears scars of the war: empty streets and houses abandoned and destroyed by shelling.
Local resident Serhiy and his son live just a few hundred meters from the frontline. He said he could hear gunfire almost every day. 
""Everyone wants peace, everyone wants tranquility,"" he said.
Talks begin on Monday in Geneva before moving to Brussels and Vienna, with relations between the United States and Russia at their most tense since the end of the Cold War.
Unlike in Kyiv, some residents in the separatist-held city of Donetsk saw no reason to include Ukraine.

""What's the point in talking to Ukraine? It seems to me they do not take any decisions,"" said 59-year-old Andrei.
""They have already forgotten about the Minsk agreements and do not fulfil them. It seems to me there is no point talking to them about anything because they are not a player in these talks anymore.""

(Reuters) -Britain's Avacta Group is halting sales of its COVID-19 rapid antigen lateral flow test to replace antibodies in the device and boost its ability to detect the Omicron variant, the biotech firm said on Monday, sending its shares plunging nearly 27%.
The London-listed company's test, AffiDX, can detect the Omicron variant when the virus is present in high numbers in samples, but tests carried out by Avacta found AffiDX is less sensitive to Omicron at lower viral loads versus other variants. 
Scientists and governments are scrambling to bolster defences against Omicron with testing, shots, therapies, and by decoding the viral genomes to try and measure how far it has spread as the variant threatens to become dominant globally.
""Our determination to only provide ... high performance diagnostic tests has led us to the ... decision to pause all marketing of the AffiDX lateral flow antigen test,"" Avacta CEO Alastair Smith said, urging others to also assess the sensitivity of their products to Omicron.
Experts and health authorities have warned https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/rapid-nose-swab-tests-covid-may-not-detect-omicron-quickly-enough-expert-says-2022-01-07 that COVID-19 rapid antigen tests - which rely on nose swabs - may not detect Omicron quickly enough since people can transmit it in early stages of the infection before the virus reaches their nose.
The tests are popular for home and travel checkpoints for their quick results and cheaper prices compared with other elaborate tests.
While Avacta did not say when it expects to resume sales of an AffiDX test better-suited to Omicron, it said COVID-19 testing ""remains a long-term commercial opportunity"" for the company. 

Shares in the company slid 26.5% to 85.25 pence in morning trade in London, erasing the roughly 11% gains it recorded in 2021.
Avacta and other test makers also had to pull some of their COVID-19 tests from the British market after a new review system came into force, which has not yet granted approval for their previously accepted products.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Nineteen people were killed, including nine children, and dozens were injured when a fire started by a malfunctioning space heater spread smoke through a low-income building in The Bronx borough of New York City on Sunday, city officials said.
New York City Mayor Eric Adams, just over a week into the job, confirmed 19 people had died from the blaze that broke out around 11 a.m. in the imposing 19-floor Twin Parks North West building which provided affordable housing units and was home to a Gambian community. 
Earlier on Sunday, officials said 32 people had been hospitalized with life-threatening injuries and some 60 people were injured in total as smoke drifted through the building on a cold winter morning. 
""This is a horrific, horrific, painful moment for the city of New York,"" Adams told reporters. ""The numbers are horrific.""
The fire itself started from a space heater in an apartment that spanned the second and third floors of the building, and only made it to the hall, officials said.
But smoke still spread to every floor of the 120-unit building, likely because the door to the apartment was left open, the city's fire department commissioner Daniel Nigro told reporters at a news briefing.
""Members found victims on every floor in stairwells and were taking them out in cardiac and respiratory arrest,"" Nigro said.
Fire marshals had determined through physical evidence and accounts from residents the fire started in a portable electric heater in the apartment's bedroom, Nigro said. He added the heat had been on in the apartment building and the portable heater had been supplementing that heating. 
The catastrophe was likely to stir questions on safety standards in low-income city housing. This was the second major deadly fire in a residential complex in the U.S. this week after twelve people, including eight children, were killed https://www.reuters.com/world/us/least-13-killed-philadelphia-house-fire-local-media-report-2022-01-05 early on Wednesday when flames swept through a public housing apartment building in Philadelphia. 
U.S. Representative Ritchie Torres, a Democrat whose district includes the New York building, told MSNBC that affordable housing developments such as the Bronx one pose safety risks to residents. ""When we allow our affordable housing developments to be plagued by decades of disinvestment, we are putting lives at risk,"" he said.
Adams said many of the residents were from the small west African country of Gambia. The Gambian consulate in New York did not immediately respond to a request for information. 
TRAPPED BY SMOKE 
The building did not have external fire escapes, and residents were meant to evacuate through interior stairways, Nigro said. ""I think some of them could not escape because of the volume of smoke,"" he said.
Some 200 firefighters helped put out the blaze, and some ran out of oxygen in their tanks but pushed through anyway to rescue people from the building, Adams said. 
""I really want to thank them for putting their lives on the line to save lives,"" Adams said.
A Reuters photographer at the scene on Sunday saw emergency responders performing CPR on at least eight people in front of the building. Firefighters with hose lines were working to push smoke out of the building, and one of them was seen breaking a window on an upper floor to release the fumes. 
A NYC emergency management official said everyone who needed housing would be registered and would be placed in hotels for an ""extended period"" until it was safe to return to the building.
Inside a school acting as an emergency shelter, displaced residents sat at tables, dressed in thick coats and with a few belongings huddled around them. Many of the women wore hijabs and several people were on the phone, including one masked woman wrapped in a Red Cross blanket.
A distraught Gambian woman exiting the shelter in heavy rain told Reuters her sister-in-law and her child were missing in the fire.
OWNERSHIP 
The building is owned by a joint venture, Bronx Park Phase III Preservation LLC, made up of three firms: LIHC Investment Group, Belveron Partners and Camber Property Group. 
The building was constructed in 1972 as part of a state program to provide affordable housing, a spokesperson for the joint venture said. All 120 units are covered by subsidy programs, the spokesperson said. 
The fire alarm system appeared to work as designed and the heat was working, the spokesperson added.
At the Angelo Patri Middle School makeshift shelter on Sunday evening, Frantz Sannon was rushing in to see his parents, who had been living on the fourth floor of the building for years. 

Sannon, 45, said his parents must have left their phones in the apartment because he was not able to reach them after learning about the fire.
""I can't wait to get to speak to them right now,"" he said before entering the school.

ALMATY (Reuters) - Kazakhstan's president fired two more top security officials on Sunday after the worst unrest in three decades of post-Soviet independence and authorities said the situation was stabilising, with Russian-led troops guarding key facilities.
The sacked officials were deputies to former intelligence chief Karim Massimov, who was arrested on suspicion of treason after violent protests swept the oil- and uranium-producing Central Asian republic that borders Russia and China.
Thousands of people have been detained and public buildings torched during mass anti-government protests in the past week. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev issued shoot-to-kill orders to end unrest he has blamed on bandits and terrorists.
Russian and state media reported 164 people were killed during the clashes, citing a government social media post. But health and police authorities did not confirm the figure, and the social media post was then deleted. 
The internet has been restricted and telecoms patchy, making it difficult to check figures and confirm statements. 
No single group has emerged to speak for the protesters. Demonstrations against a fuel price rise began a week ago before erupting into a wider protest against Tokayev's government and the man he replaced as veteran president, 81-year-old Nursultan Nazarbayev. 
At Tokayev's invitation, a Russia-led alliance of ex-Soviet states - the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) - sent troops to restore order, an intervention that comes at a time of high tension in Russia-U.S. relations ahead of talks this week on the Ukraine crisis.
Tokayev's spokesman said on Sunday he thought the forces would not be in Kazakhstan for long, and possibly no more than a week or even less. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin and other leaders of CSTO countries will hold a video conference on Monday to discuss the crisis in Kazakhstan, the Kremlin said.
The violence has spurred speculation of a rift in the ruling elite, with Tokayev fighting to consolidate his authority after firing key officials and removing Nazarbayev from a powerful role as head of the Security Council.
The president's website announced the sackings of Marat Osipov and Daulet Ergozhin as deputy heads of the National Security Committee. It gave no explanation in a terse statement late on Sunday. 
Their arrested former boss, Massimov, a two-time prime minister, was seen as close to Nazarbayev. Authorities have not disclosed any details of the allegations against him. He and his lawyer could not be reached for comment.
In a statement meant to quash talk of a rift, Nazarbayev's spokesman said Nazarbayev had been in the capital Nur-Sultan throughout the crisis and chose himself to give up his security council post to Tokayev to help ease the crisis. 
""(He) and the head of state have always been 'on the same side of the barricades'... In these difficult days they have demonstrated the monolithic nature of state power for all of us,"" the statement said, calling for people to rally around Tokayev.
Former Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin told Reuters that Tokayev needed to dispel doubts about who was really in charge.
""I think a lot of people in social networks, critics, continue to say he's a nominee of Nazarbayev, that Nazarbayev is standing behind his back and manipulating him,"" he said.
""Now he has complete formal executive power, the question is how he will deploy it. He needs to take command.""
Tokayev is likely to name new government members when he addresses parliament on Tuesday, his spokesman said. 
He awarded prizes for bravery to 16 police and army officers killed in the violence. 
IMAGE SETBACK
""The situation has been stabilised in all regions of the country,"" the presidential office said, adding law enforcement agencies had seized back control of administrative buildings. 
""The counter-terrorist operation ... will be continued until the complete elimination of the terrorists,"" Deputy Defence Minister Sultan Gamaletdinov said.
The violence has dealt a blow to Kazakhstan's image as a tightly controlled and stable country, which it has used to attract hundreds of billions of dollars of Western investment in its oil and minerals industries.
Police said 6,044 people had been arrested in connection with the unrest.
Russian paratrooper commander Andrey Serdyukov said the CSTO force had finished deploying to Kazakhstan and would remain there until the situation stabilised completely. 
""A number of strategic facilities have been transferred under the protection of the united peacekeeping contingent of the CSTO member states,"" the presidential office said.
Serdyukov said the troops were guarding important military, state and socially-important sites in the city of Almaty and nearby areas. He did not identify the facilities. 
The deployments signal resolute Kremlin backing for the Kazakh authorities in a region Moscow sees as vital to its security along its southern flank.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington was seeking answers from Kazakhstan as to why it needed to call in Russian-led forces to resolve domestic unrest. He also denounced the government's shoot-to-kill order.
CASH MACHINES GUTTED
In Almaty, the biggest city where much of the violence was concentrated, normal life appeared to be returning on Sunday. 
Security forces have set up checkpoints around the city. Smashed windows, gutted cash machines and torched buildings bore witness to the destruction.
The main Republic Square remained sealed off. 
Reuters saw two military vehicles with mounted machine guns driving towards the square. Most of dozens of civilian and police cars torched during the unrest had been removed.
Supermarket chain Magnum said 15 of its 68 stores in Almaty had been looted.

A shopping mall's staff told Reuters that video cameras showed looters attacking an ATM, changing into stolen clothes at the stores and walking out wearing two or three coats.
Yerkin Zhumabekov, a mall manager, said: ""They arrived in cars with no number plates at night, they destroyed everything. They took everything they could, shoes, clothes, cosmetics.""

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Bob Saget, an actor and comedian best known as the jovial dad on the television sitcom ""Full House,"" was found dead in a hotel room in Orlando, Florida, at age 65, authorities and his family said on Sunday.
The cause of Saget's death was unclear. Emergency responders found the actor unresponsive on Sunday afternoon in a room at the Ritz-Carlton in Orlando and pronounced him dead at the scene, the Orange County Sheriff's Office said. 
Detectives found no signs of foul play or drug use, the department said.
Saget had just started a comedy tour and performed near Jacksonville, Florida, on Saturday night. In his last Instagram post, he reflected on the ""really nice audience"" and ""lots of positivity.""
""I had no idea I did a two hour set tonight,"" he wrote. ""I'm back in comedy like I was when I was 26. I guess I'm finding my new voice and loving every moment of it."" Saget played widowed father Danny Tanner on ""Full House"" from 1987 to 1995, and also on a sequel called ""Fuller House"" from 2016 to 2020. In the show, Tanner shared his home with his three daughters, his brother-in-law and best friend.
The actor also hosted ""America's Funniest Home Videos"" from 1989 to 1997.
In contrast to his wholesome TV image, Saget's stand-up act delivered raunchier adult-oriented comedy. He also played a parody of himself in a recurring role on the HBO series ""Entourage.""
""We are devastated to confirm that our beloved Bob passed away today,"" the Saget family said in a statement. 
""He was everything to us and we want you to know how much he loved his fans, performing live and bringing people from all walks of life together with laughter,"" the family said. 
John Stamos, Saget's co-star on ""Full House,"" said he was ""broken"" and ""gutted"" by Saget's death.
""I am in complete and utter shock,"" Stamos wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""I will never ever have another friend like him. I love you so much Bobby.""

Comedian Jon Stewart called Saget ""just the funniest and nicest"" in a tweet on Sunday. ""Seinfeld"" star Jason Alexander said Saget ""was kind and dear and cared about people deeply. He was the definition of 'a good egg.'"" 
The local medical examiner's office will determine the cause of Saget's death, the sheriff's department said.

KABUL, Afghanistan (Reuters) -An infant boy handed in desperation to a soldier across an airport wall in the chaos of the American evacuation of Afghanistan has been found and was reunited with his relatives in Kabul on Saturday.
The baby, Sohail Ahmadi, was just two months old when he went missing on Aug. 19 as thousands of people rushed to leave Afghanistan as it fell to the Taliban.
Following an exclusive Reuters story https://www.reuters.com/world/exclusive-baby-handed-us-soldiers-chaos-afghanistan-airlift-still-missing-2021-11-05 published in November with his pictures, the baby was located in Kabul where a 29-year-old taxi driver named Hamid Safi had found him in the airport and took him home to raise as his own. 
After more than seven weeks of negotiations and pleas, and ultimately a brief detention by Taliban police, Safi finally handed the child back to his jubilant grandfather and other relatives still in Kabul. 
They said they would now seek to have him reunited with his parents and siblings who were evacuated months ago to the United States. 
During the tumultuous Afghan evacuation over the summer, Mirza Ali Ahmadi - the boy's father who had worked as a security guard at the U.S. embassy - and his wife Suraya feared their son would get crushed in the crowd as they neared the airport gates en route to a flight to the United States. 
Ahmadi told Reuters in early November in his desperation that day, he handed Sohail over the airport wall to a uniformed soldier who he believed to be an American, fully expecting he would soon make it the remaining 5 meters (15 feet) to the entrance to reclaim him. 
Just at that moment, Taliban forces pushed the crowd back and it would be another half an hour before Ahmadi, his wife and their four other children were able to get inside. 
But by then the baby was nowhere to be found. 
Ahmadi said he searched desperately for his son inside the airport and was told by officials that he had likely been taken out of the country separately and could be reunited with them later. 
The rest of the family was evacuated - eventually ending up at a military base in Texas. For months they had no idea where their son was. 
The case highlights the plight of many parents separated from their children https://www.reuters.com/world/when-are-my-parents-coming-1300-afghan-children-evacuated-us-limbo-2021-11-10 during the hasty evacuation effort and withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country after a 20-year war. 
With no U.S. embassy in Afghanistan and international organizations overstretched, Afghan refugees have had trouble getting answers on the timing, or possibility, of complex reunifications like this one. 
""We are working to reunify the family,"" a State Department official said. 
The timing is still unknown however, said a second U.S. official with knowledge of the situation, because regular evacuation flights are not currently leaving the country. The U.S. government is in discussions with the Qataris as well as parties in Afghanistan about the case, the second official said.
ALONE AT THE AIRPORT
On the same day Ahmadi and his family were separated from their baby, Safi had slipped through the Kabul airport gates after giving a ride to his brother's family who were also set to evacuate.
Safi said he found Sohail alone and crying on the ground. After he said he unsuccessfully tried to locate the baby's parents inside, he took the infant home to his wife and children. Safi has three daughters of his own and said his mother's greatest wish before she died was for him to have a son. 
In that moment he decided: ""I am keeping this baby. If his family is found, I will give him to them. If not, I will raise him myself,"" he told Reuters in an interview in late November.
Safi told Reuters that he took him to the doctor for a check-up after he was found and quickly incorporated the child into his family. They called the baby Mohammad Abed and posted pictures of all the children together on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. 
After the Reuters story about the missing child came out, some of Safi's neighbors - who had noticed his return from the airport months earlier with a baby - recognized the photos and posted comments about his whereabouts on a translated version of the article. 
Ahmadi asked his relatives still in Afghanistan, including his father-in-law Mohammad Qasem Razawi, 67, who lives in the northeastern province of Badakhshan, to seek out Safi and ask him to return Sohail to the family. 
Razawi said he traveled two days and two nights to the capital bearing gifts - including a slaughtered sheep, several pounds of walnuts and clothing - for Safi and his family. 
But Safi refused to release Sohail, insisting he also wanted to be evacuated from Afghanistan with his family. Safi's brother, who was evacuated to California, said Safi and his family have no pending applications for U.S. entry.
The baby's family sought help from the Red Cross, which has a stated mission to help reconnect people separated by international crises, but said they received little information from the organization. A spokesperson for the Red Cross said it does not comment on individual cases.
Finally, after feeling they had run out of options, Razawi contacted the local Taliban police to report a kidnapping. Safi told Reuters he denied the allegations to the police and said he was caring for the baby, not kidnapping him.
The complaint was investigated and dismissed and the local police commander told Reuters he helped arrange a settlement, which included an agreement signed with thumbprints by both sides. Razawi said the baby's family in the end agreed to compensate Safi around 100,000 Afghani ($950) for expenses incurred looking after him for five months.
""The grandfather of the baby complained to us and we found Hamid and based on the evidence we had, we recognized the baby,"" said Hamid Malang, the chief area controller of the local police station. ""With both sides in agreement, the baby will be handed over to his grandfather,"" he said on Saturday. 
In the presence of the police, and amid lots of tears, the baby was finally returned to his relatives.
Razawi said Safi and his family were devastated to lose Sohail. ""Hamid and his wife were crying, I cried too, but assured them that you both are young, Allah will give you male child. Not one, but several. I thanked both of them for saving the child from the airport,"" Razawi said. 
""We need to get the baby back to his mother and father. This is my only responsibility,"" he said. 
The baby's parents told Reuters they were overjoyed as they were able to see with their own eyes the reunion over video chat. 
    ""There are celebrations, dance, singing,"" said Razawi. ""It is just like a wedding indeed."" 

Now Ahmadi and his wife and other children, who in early December were able to move off the military base and resettle in an apartment in Michigan are still finding their footing and focused on their son's return.
""I was so sad and always crying for my baby,"" said his mother Suraya. ""Now I hope he arrives here safely. Last night, I did not sleep due to happiness.""

MOSCOW/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Russia said on Sunday it would not make concessions under U.S. pressure and warned that this week's talks on the Ukraine crisis might end early, while Washington said no breakthroughs were expected and progress depended on de-escalation from Moscow.
The hard line from Moscow underscored the fragile prospects for negotiations that Washington hopes will avert the danger of a new Russian invasion of Ukraine, at the tensest point in U.S.-Russia relations since the Cold War ended three decades ago.
Talks begin on Monday in Geneva before moving to Brussels and Vienna, but the state-owned RIA news agency quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov as saying it was entirely possible the diplomacy could end after a single meeting.
""I can't rule out anything, this is an entirely possible scenario and the Americans ... should have no illusions about this,"" he was quoted as saying. 
""Naturally, we will not make any concessions under pressure"" or amid constant threats from participants in the talks, said Ryabkov, who will lead the Russian delegation in Geneva.
Moscow was not optimistic going into the talks, Interfax news agency quoted Ryabkov as saying.
The U.S. prognosis was similarly gloomy.
""I don't think we're going to see any breakthroughs in the coming week,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a CNN interview.
In response to Russian demands for Western security guarantees, the United States and allies have said they are prepared to discuss the possibility of each side restricting military exercises and missile deployments in the region.
Both sides will put proposals on the table and then see if there are grounds for moving forward, Blinken said. 
""To make actual progress, it's very hard to see that happening when there's an ongoing escalation, when Russia has a gun to the head of Ukraine with 100,000 troops near its borders,"" Blinken said in an interview with ABC News.
Ahead of the formal talks, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman met with Ryabkov on Sunday in Geneva and told him Washington ""would welcome genuine progress through diplomacy,"" the State Department said.
Ryabkov told reporters his meeting with Sherman had been ""complex but businesslike,"" Russian new agency Interfax said.
Tens of thousands of Russian troops are gathered within reach of the border with Ukraine in preparation for what Washington and Kyiv say could be an invasion, eight years after Russia seized the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine.
The comments from Russia's Ryabkov, who has compared the situation to the 1962 Cuban missile crisis when the world stood on the brink of nuclear war, were consistent with the uncompromising line Russia has been signalling for weeks.
Russia denies invasion plans and said it is responding to what it calls aggressive and provocative behavior from the NATO military alliance and Ukraine, which has tilted toward the West and aspires to join NATO.
Further complicating the picture, Russia sent troops into neighboring Kazakhstan last week after the oil-producing former Soviet republic was hit by a wave of unrest. Russia's foreign ministry reacted furiously https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-reacts-furiously-blinken-jibe-over-troops-kazakhstan-2022-01-08 on Saturday to a jibe by Blinken that ""once Russians are in your house, it's sometimes very difficult to get them to leave.""
RED LINES
Last month, Russia presented a sweeping set of demands including for a ban on further NATO expansion and an end to the alliance's activity in central and eastern European countries that joined it after 1997.
The United States and NATO have dismissed large parts of the Russian proposals as non-starters.
The United States was not willing to discuss pulling some U.S. troops out of eastern Europe or rule out expanding NATO to include Ukraine, Blinken said.
To abandon its demands for a more-limited agenda would be a major climb-down that Russia seems unlikely to make, especially after weeks of troop movements near Ukraine and a series of tough statements from President Vladimir Putin.
The Kremlin leader has said that after successive waves of NATO expansion it is time for Russia to enforce its ""red lines"" and ensure the alliance does not admit Ukraine or station weapons systems there that would target Russia.
Ukraine won a NATO promise in 2008 that it would be allowed to join one day, but diplomats say there is no question of that happening any time soon.
NATO said it is a defensive alliance and Moscow has nothing to fear from it. That is far from Putin's world view, which sees Russia as under threat from hostile Western powers he says have repeatedly broken promises given as the Cold War ended not to expand toward its borders. The United States and its allies dispute such pledges were given.
In two conversations over the past five weeks, U.S. President Joe Biden warned Putin that Russia would face unprecedented economic sanctions in the event of further aggression against Ukraine. The Group of Seven nations and the European Union have joined in threatening ""massive consequences.""

Putin said that would be a colossal mistake that would lead to a complete rupture of relations.
In addition to the Geneva talks, Russia is also due to hold negotiations with NATO in Brussels on Wednesday and at the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Vienna on Thursday.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem has accused radical Israeli groups of threatening the presence of Christians in the holy city, in remarks that Israeli officials rejected as baseless. 
In a column in the Times of London on Saturday, His Beatitude, Theophilos III, said he believed the aim was to drive the Christian community from Jerusalem's Old City, which has sites sacred to Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
Israel captured East Jerusalem, including the Old City, along with the West Bank and Gaza Strip in a 1967 war. It annexed East Jerusalem after the war in a move that has not won international recognition.
""Our presence in Jerusalem is under threat,"" the patriarch wrote in the article, published a day after the Greek Orthodox celebration of Christmas.
""Our churches are threatened by Israeli radical fringe groups. At the hands of these Zionist extremists the Christian community in Jerusalem is suffering greatly, he said.
""Our brothers and sisters are the victims of hate crimes. Our churches are regularly desecrated and vandalised. Our clergy are subject to frequent intimidation.""
By singling out extremists as Israeli, Theophilos's criticism was more personal and trenchant than that of a collective statement issued by the heads of other churches in Jerusalem before Christmas.
Their statement spoke of ""frequent and sustained attacks by fringe radical groups"" but stopped short of identifying them as Israeli. 
A U.S. State Department report published last year on religious freedom around the world said Christian clergy and pilgrims continued to report instances of ultra-Orthodox Jews in Jerusalem harassing or spitting on them.
Church groups have for some time reported attacks of vandalism at religious sites in the city. Theophilos did not accuse any radical groups by name or cite specific incidents. He did not provide evidence that they were Israeli, or that their goal was to drive Christians from the city. 
On Sunday, an Israeli official said the reality on the ground for Christians was completely different from that described by the patriarch, citing a Foreign Ministry statement on Dec 22 that rebutted the earlier church leaders' claims.
""Since the day it was established, the State of Israel has been committed to freedom of religion and worship for all religions, as well to ensuring the freedom of access to holy sites,"" the ministry statement said.
""The statement by Church leaders in Jerusalem is particularly infuriating given their silence on the plight of many Christian communities in the Middle East suffering from discrimination and persecution.""

In his column, Theophilos said the radicals that he criticised ""are not representative of the state of Israel or the Jewish people,"" and called on Jerusalem to remain a diverse ""mosaic community"" of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Iran's sanctions on Saturday came as Tehran's proxy militias continue to attack American troops in the Middle East.
""We will work with our allies and partners to deter and respond to any attacks carried out by Iran,"" Sullivan said in a statement. ""Should Iran attack any of our nationals, including any of the 52 people named yesterday, it will face severe consequences."" 
Iran on Saturday imposed sanctions https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-imposes-sanctions-americans-over-2020-killing-top-general-2022-01-08 on dozens more Americans, many of them from the U.S. military, over the 2020 killing of Soleimani. 
Iran's Foreign Ministry said 51 Americans had been targeted for what it called ""terrorism"" and human rights violations. The step lets Iranian authorities seize any assets they hold in Iran, but the apparent absence of such assets means it will likely be symbolic.
It was not clear why Sullivan's statement referred to 52 people when Tehran said it had sanctioned 51.
Iran's sanctions included U.S. General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It also included former White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien.

Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Quds Force, the overseas arm of the elite Revolutionary Guards, was killed in Iraq in a drone strike on Jan. 3, 2020, ordered by then President Donald Trump.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - The Australian government hit back hard at tennis star Novak Djokovic's assertion that he was assured entry with a medical exemption from coronavirus vaccine requirements, pointing out in court papers filed Sunday that no foreigner has a guaranteed right to enter the country.
""There is no such thing as an assurance of entry by a non-citizen into Australia. Rather, there are criteria and conditions for entry, and reasons for refusal or cancellation of a visa,"" the government said in a filing ahead of a court hearing on the case on Monday.
Djokovic, the world number one, is hoping to win his 21st Grand Slam at the Australian Open, which starts in Melbourne on Jan. 17. But instead of training, the Serbian player has been confined in a hotel used for asylum seekers and is challenging the decision to cancel his visa after being stopped on arrival at Melbourne Airport early on Thursday.
Djokovic, a vocal opponent of COVID-19 vaccine mandates, said in a filing to the court on Saturday that he been granted an exemption from vaccination due to having had the virus in December.
His lawyers said he had the necessary permissions to enter Australia, including an assessment from the Department of Home Affairs that responses on his travel declaration form indicated he met the conditions for quarantine-free arrival. The government disputed this.
It said the department's email was not an assurance ""that his so-called 'medical exemption' would be accepted"", and his responses could be questioned and verified on his arrival.
The government also challenged Djokovic's claim for a medical exemption on the basis he had contracted COVID-19 in mid-December and had recovered two weeks later.
""There is no suggestion that the applicant had ""acute major medical illness"" in December 2021. All he has said is that he tested positive for COVID-19. This is not the same,"" the filing said.
French newspaper L'Equipe published a photograph of the player taken when he was named the daily's Champion of Champions in the days after he said in the court filing he had tested positive for coronavirus, Dec. 16. Other photographs published on social media showed him appearing at functions in Serbia on dates soon after that test. 
It was not clear if Djokovic knew of his positive test at the time of the events shown in the pictures.
Djokovic, 34, has won the Australian Open nine times and the drama over his refused entry has caused a furore in sporting circles, sparked tensions between Serbia and Australia and become a flashpoint for opponents of vaccine mandates around the world.
Djokovic's lawyers will have up to two hours to present their case from 10 a.m. (2300 GMT on Sunday) on Monday, while the government department gets two hours to present its defence from 3 p.m. The case is being heard by the Federal Circuit and Family Court.
WORLD NO. 1 IS A NON-CITIZEN
The government filing on Sunday stressed that even if the court ruled to free Djokovic from detention and let him play in the Open, under Australian law the government had every right to detain him again and remove him from the country because he is a non-citizen. 
That drew particular ire from Djokovic's father, who addressed another small protest in front of Serbia's parliament building in Belgrade on Sunday.
""The politicians are now saying that even if the court decided that he can play, they can detain him again under their laws,"" Srdjan Djokovic said. 
""Are we animals? What are we? We're human beings. This is happening because we are just a small part of the world, but we are proud. They have no respect for him."" 
Australia says its health department notified tournament organising body Tennis Australia in November that a recent COVID-19 infection was not necessarily grounds for exemption in the country, as it is elsewhere. However, Djokovic's lawsuit says the Department of Home Affairs wrote to him this month to say he had satisfied the requirements to enter the country.
TENNIS AUSTRALIA
Tennis Australia CEO Craig Tiley said in his first media interview since the furore began that his organisation had spoken with federal and state officials for months to ensure the safe passage of players.
""Primarily because there is (so) much contradictory information the whole time, every single week we were talking to Home Affairs, we were talking to all parts of government to ensure that ... we were doing the right thing and (following) the right process with these exemptions,"" Tiley told Channel Nine television.
""The conflicting information, and the contradictory information we received, was because of the changing environment. We are in a challenging environment.""
Finance Minister Simon Birmingham, asked about the matter on Channel 9 television, said without referring directly to Djokovic that ""there's a clear difference between visas and entry requirements"" and ""entry requirements ... sit over and above the visa conditions"".

Czech player Renata Voracova, who was detained in the same detention hotel as Djokovic and had her visa revoked after issues with her vaccine exemption, left the country without challenging her status, the Czech Foreign Ministry said.
Djokovic has drawn strong support at home. Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said on Saturday that he had been given gluten-free food, tools to exercise and a SIM card to stay in contact with the outside world.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday that Washington was seeking answers from Kazakhstan officials on why they needed to call in Russian-led security forces to resolve domestic unrest, and he denounced the government's shoot-to-kill order.
""We have real questions about why they felt compelled to call this organization that Russia dominates,"" Blinken said in an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union"" broadcast, adding that Kazakhstan should be able to deal with the protests peacefully. ""We're asking for clarification on that."" 
Kazakhstan authorities said on Sunday they had stabilised the situation across the country after the deadliest outbreak of violence in 30 years of independence, and troops from the Russian-led military alliance were guarding ""strategic facilities"". 
Russia sent in troops last week and Kazakhstan's government authorized the use of deadly force to quell the unrest. 
""The shoot-to-kill order, to the extent it exists, is wrong and should be rescinded,"" Blinken said on Sunday on ABC's ""This Week.""
Blinken said on Friday that Kazakhstan might have a hard time getting rid of Russian troops, prompting an angry response from Russia. 
""One lesson of recent history is that once Russians are in your house, it's sometimes very difficult to get them to leave,"" Blinken said.
Russia responded angrily on Saturday, saying the United States should reflect on its own interventions in countries such as Vietnam and Iraq. 

""If Antony Blinken loves history lessons so much, then he should take the following into account: when Americans are in your house, it can be difficult to stay alive and not be robbed or raped,"" Russia's foreign ministry said on its Telegram social media channel.
The ministry said the deployment in Kazakhstan was a legitimate response to Kazakhstan's request for support from the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, an alliance of ex-Soviet states that includes Russia.

Jan. 9 marks the date in 1992 when Bosnian Serbs declared independence, triggering a war in which 100,000 were killed. It also coincides with Serbian Orthodox Christian holiday.
It was this religious component that led Bosnia's Constitutional Court to declare the holiday illegal as it discriminated against the region's Catholic Croat and Muslim Bosniak communities.
Taking part in the parade were more than 800 armed police officers, including members of anti-terrorist units, gendarmerie and cavalry, who marched alongside students, war veterans and athletes through the streets of the region's largest city Banja Luka. 
Crowds of onlookers and those marching waved Serb red, blue and white flags. The members of a special police unit sang songs referring to the Serb Republic as the state of Christian heritage.
There was no sign of the Serb regiment of Bosnia's joint armed forces, which had been deployed to the parade in previous years. Instead the focus was on the militarised police force, which led the parade with specially-designed combat vehicles as helicopters hovered above. 
""There is no freedom for the Serb people without the state,"" Dodik, who is currently serving as the Serb member in Bosnia's tripartite inter-ethnic presidency, said in an address to the crowd watching the parade.
Dodik, a pro-Russian nationalist, has repeatedly threatened to pull out the Serb representatives from Bosnia's armed forces, tax system and judiciary and create Serb separate institutions. 
Last Wednesday, he was freshly sanctioned by the United States for corruption and threatening the stability and territorial integrity of Bosnia.

The U.S.-brokered Dayton peace agreement in 1995 ended 3-1/2 years of ethnic warfare in Bosnia, dividing the Balkan country into two autonomous regions - the Serb Republic and the Federation dominated by Bosniaks and Croats. 
Dodik's secessionist rhetoric of recent months has encouraged Serb nationalists who in recent days provoked incidents across the Serb Republic, firing in air near the mosques during prayers, publicly praising convicted war criminals and threatening their Muslim neighbours.

KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - At least 16 tourists died in freezing temperatures after being stranded in their vehicles in northern Pakistan, where thousands had flocked to enjoy the snow, officials said on Saturday.
With some 1,000 vehicles still stranded, the government has declared Murree, 64 km (40 miles) northeast of the capital Islamabad, a calamity hit area.
“For the first time in 15 to 20 years such large number of tourists flocked to Murree, which created a big crisis,” Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, Pakistan's interior minister said a video message.
The minister said that around 1,000 cars were stuck in the hill station, a town elevated from the nearby area, confirming that ""16 to 19 deaths have occurred in their cars.""
Army platoons and paramilitary forces have been deployed to help the civil administration in rescue operations, he said.
Late on Friday the government announced the closure of all roads leading to the station to stop any further influx of the tourists.
Prime Minister Imran Khan expressed shock over the ""tragic deaths"" of the tourists. ""Have ordered inquiry and putting in place strong regulations to ensure prevention of such tragedies,"" Khan said in a tweet. 
Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry appealed to people to not visit the hill station.
Snowfall, which began on Tuesday night, continued at regular intervals, attracting thousands of tourists. Due to huge numbers of visitors, many families ended up getting stranded on roads.
Local media reported that over 100,000 vehicles entered the hill station.
Videos shared on social media showed entire families, including children, lying dead in their snow covered vehicles. 

“Were the deaths caused by cold or carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning?,"" Dr. Faheem Yonus, chief of infectious diseases at the University of Maryland UCH, said in a tweet.

Residents gained access to the villages on Saturday after the military captured the communities to organise mass burials, they told Reuters. The state government said 58 people had been killed during the attacks. 
Ummaru Makeri, a resident who lost his wife and three children during the attack, said around 154 people had been buried including several vigilantes who were killed. Residents said the total death toll was at least 200. 
Reuters reported on Friday that at least 30 people had been killed in the Anka local government area in Zamfara, when more than 300 armed bandits on motorbikes stormed eight villages and started shooting sporadically on Tuesday.
The military said it had conducted air strikes in the early hours of Monday on targets in the Gusami forest and west Tsamre village in Zamfara state, killing more than 100 bandits including two of their leaders, following intelligence reports.
One resident who declined to be identified told Reuters the attacks on the villages could be linked to the military strikes.
There have been a series of attacks in northwest Nigeria, which has seen a sharp rise in mass abductions and other violent crimes since late 2020 as the government struggles to maintain law and order.
In a separate incident, 30 students abducted from their college in the northwestern Nigerian state of Kebbi were freed on Saturday, a spokesman for the Kebbi governor said, without providing details.
President Muhammadu Buhari said in a statement on Saturday the military had acquired more equipment to track down and eliminate criminal gangs that have been subjecting people to a reign of terror, including through the illegal imposition of taxes on communities under siege.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States and allies are prepared to discuss with Russia in talks about Ukraine the possibility of each side restricting military exercises and missile deployments in the region, a senior U.S. administration official said on Saturday.
With crucial talks set to start on Monday in Geneva, the senior Biden administration official said the United States is not willing to discuss limits on U.S. troop deployments or the U.S. force posture in NATO countries in the region.
President Joe Biden has warned Russia will face severe economic consequences if Russian President Vladimir Putin were to launch an invasion of Ukraine. U.S. officials on Saturday provided more details on tough sanctions that could be imposed.
One restriction, as described by a source familiar with the plan, could target critical Russian industrial sectors, including defense and civil aviation, and would invariably hit Russia’s high-tech ambitions, such as in artificial intelligence or quantum computing, or even consumer electronics.
The Geneva talks, to be followed by other sessions next week in Brussels and Vienna, are aimed at averting a crisis. Putin has massed tens of thousands of troops along the border with Ukraine, generating fears of an invasion.
It remained unclear whether the United States and its European allies can make progress in the talks with Moscow. Putin wants an end to NATO's eastward expansion and security guarantees, demands the United States says are unacceptable.
But the senior U.S. official, briefing reporters ahead of the talks, said some areas present opportunities for common ground.
""Any discussion of those overlapping areas where we might be able to make progress would have to be reciprocal,"" the official said. ""Both sides would need to make essentially the same commitment.""
Russia says it feels threatened by the prospect of the United States deploying offensive missile systems in Ukraine, even though Biden has assured Putin he has no intention of doing so.
""So this is one area where we may be able to reach an understanding if Russia is willing to make a reciprocal commitment,"" the official said.
The United States is also willing to discuss restrictions by both sides on military exercises, the official said.
""We are willing to explore the possibility of reciprocal restrictions on the size and scope of such exercises, including both strategic bombers close to each other's territory and ground-based exercises as well,"" the official said.
The official said Washington is open to a broader discussion on missile deployment in the region. In 2019, Former President Donald Trump withdrew from the 1987 U.S.-Russia Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, on accusations Moscow was violating the accord.
A separate senior Biden administration official said penalties being explored in the case of a Russian invasion would not start low and be tightened over time.
""Instead, we would adopt a 'start high, stay high' approach in which we – in coordination with our allies and partners – would immediately impose severe and overwhelming costs on Russia’s economy, including its financial system and sectors deemed critical to the Kremlin,"" the official said.
The United States has been discussing with allies and partners in Europe and Asia a range of trade restrictions under consideration, the source familiar with the planning said.
No decisions have yet been taken, but restrictions under consideration could impact U.S. products exported to Russia and certain foreign-made products subject to U.S. jurisdiction. 

Russia could be added to the most restrictive group of countries for export control purposes, together with Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria. These actions could also restrict export of products made abroad if they contain more than a specified percentage of U.S. content. 
In addition, consideration is being given to exercising U.S. jurisdiction, through the Foreign Direct Product Rule used for Chinese telecom company Huawei, to exports to Russia of all microelectronics designed with U.S. software or technology, or produced using U.S. equipment. https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/exclusive-us-could-hit-russia-smartphone-aircraft-part-imports-if-it-invades-2021-12-21

ALMATY (Reuters) - Kazakhstan's former intelligence chief has been arrested on suspicion of treason, the state security agency said on Saturday, as the former Soviet republic cracks down on a wave of unrest and starts to assign blame.
The detention of Karim Massimov was announced by the National Security Committee which he headed until he was fired by President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev on Wednesday after violent protests swept across the Central Asian nation.
Tokayev's office said he had told Russian President Vladimir Putin in a phone call that the situation was stabilising.
""At the same time, hotbeds of terrorist attacks persist. Therefore, the fight against terrorism will continue with full determination,"" it quoted him as saying.
The Kremlin said Putin backed Tokayev's idea to convene a video call of leaders from the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), under whose umbrella Russia and four other former Soviet republics have sent troops into Kazakhstan to help restore order. It was not clear when this would take place.
Dozens of people have been killed, thousands have been detained and public buildings across Kazakhstan have been torched over the past week in the worst violence experienced in the oil and uranium producer since it became independent in the early 1990s as the Soviet Union collapsed.
Tokayev has ordered his troops to shoot to kill to end what he has called attacks by bandits and terrorists.
He said on Friday the state had ""slept through"" instigators' preparations to launch attacks on the biggest city, Almaty, and across the country. Massimov's arrest indicated moves were under way against those deemed responsible. 
Apart from heading the intelligence agency that replaced the Soviet-era KGB, Massimov was twice prime minister and worked closely with former President Nursultan Nazarbayev, the country's ruler for three decades until he turned over the presidency to Tokayev in 2019. 
There were no details of the treason allegations. The security service said other officials were also detained, but did not name them. 
On Friday, a pro-government politician said on television he had information that the security forces had been ordered to abandon Almaty airport so protesters could take it over. He said they had left a security building in the city undefended, enabling people to seize weapons.
It was not immediately possible to verify this account. The airport remains closed but is now under the control of Kazakh security personnel and Russian troops, according to Russia's defence ministry.
SPORADIC GUNSHOTS 
The demonstrations began as a response to a fuel price hike but swelled into a broad movement against Tokayev's Russian-backed government and 81-year-old Nazarbayev.
Tokayev removed Nazarbayev on Wednesday as head of the country's Security Council, a role in which he had continued to wield significant influence. Interfax news agency reported on Saturday that the council's deputy head had also been fired.
In Almaty, where security forces have reclaimed control of the streets since Friday, a Reuters reporter said occasional gunshots were heard on Saturday.
Some businesses began to reopen in the city as people ventured out to buy supplies, and queues formed at petrol stations.
Security forces patrolled the streets and set up checkpoints. The deputy mayor was quoted by Russia's RIA news agency as saying operations to purge the city of ""terrorists and bandit groups"" were still under way and citizens were advised to stay at home.
Zhumadin Patov, the deputy head of a public market in Almaty, said the checkpoints and petrol station closures had complicated food distribution in the city of about 2 million people. 
""There is enough food in warehouses, but it cannot be delivered because of the checkpoints and lack of fuel,"" he said. 
In the capital Nur-Sultan, Reuters filmed police stopping drivers at a checkpoint with armed soldiers nearby. 
The interior ministry said more than 4,400 people had been detained since the start of the unrest. Tokayev announced a national day of mourning for Monday to commemorate those killed.
Access to the internet, which was been largely shut down in Kazakhstan for days, was still heavily disrupted on Saturday.
The deployment of the Russia-led CSTO military alliance at Tokayev's invitation comes at a time of high tension in East-West relations as Russia and the United States prepare for talks next week on the Ukraine crisis.
Moscow has deployed large numbers of troops near its border with Ukraine but denies U.S. suggestions it is planning an invasion, saying it wants guarantees that NATO will halt its eastward expansion.
Washington has challenged the justification for sending Russian troops to Kazakhstan and questioned whether what has been billed as a mission of days or weeks could turn into a much longer presence.

""One lesson of recent history is that once Russians are in your house, it's sometimes very difficult to get them to leave,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday.
Russia's foreign ministry called the remark offensive and said Blinken should reflect on the U.S. track record of military interventions in countries such as Vietnam and Iraq.

The Trump administration rained sanctions down on Iranian officials, politicians and companies after withdrawing the United States in 2018 from Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.

Earlier, a storm in the east left some parts of Kentucky, Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York and Maryland under 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) of snow with coastal New England hardest hit as some towns saw more than a foot (30 cm) of snow on Thursday and into Friday. 

Federal government offices in Washington were closed, and dozens of school districts across the eastern half of the country canceled classes due to the snow and bitter cold.
The storm was the second this week to slam into the eastern United States. On Monday, the region was blanketed by up to a foot (30 cm) of snow, stranding thousands of people for up to 27 hours when nearly 50-mile (80-km) stretch of Interstate 95 in northern Virginia became impassable.

341,"<span>Jan 08, 2022 04:30AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Dozens of people have died and thousands have been detained in Kazakhstan over the past week during the worst violence seen in the Central Asian nation since it became independent in the early 1990s.
Security forces appeared to have reclaimed the streets of the country's main city on Friday, a day after Russian paratroopers arrived to help quash the uprising.
Here is a snapshot of Kazakhstan, its economy and political system.
WHERE IS KAZAKHSTAN AND WHY DOES IT MATTER?
Kazakhstan, located between Russia and China and also sharing borders with three other ex-Soviet republics, is the largest economy in Central Asia, with rich hydrocarbon and metal deposits. It has attracted hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign investment since becoming independent in 1991.
Strategically, it links the large and fast-growing markets of China and South Asia with those of Russia and Europe by road, rail, and a port on the Caspian Sea. It has described itself as the buckle in China's huge 'Belt and Road' trade project.
Kazakhstan is the top global producer of uranium and this week's unrest prompted an 8% jump in the price of the metal that fuels nuclear power plants. It is the world's ninth biggest oil exporter, producing some 85.7 million tonnes in 2021, and its 10th largest producer of coal.
It is also the world's second largest miner of bitcoin after the United States. Bitcoin's ""hashrate"" - the measure of computing power of machines plugged into its network - dropped by over 10% on Wednesday after Kazakhstan's internet was shut off, according to crypto mining firm BTC.com.
WHY ARE PEOPLE ANGRY?
The uprising began as protests in oil-rich western regions against the removal of state price caps on New Year's Day for butane and propane, which are often referred to as 'road fuels for the poor' due to their low cost.
The reform, aimed at easing oil shortages, quickly backfired as prices more than doubled. The protests spread, tapping into a wider sense of discontent over endemic state corruption, income inequality and economic hardships that have all been compounded by the coronavirus pandemic.
Although the richest of the Central Asian republics in per capita income, half of the population in Kazakhstan - the world's ninth largest country by territory - live in rural, often isolated communities with poor access to public services.
While the country's vast natural resources have made a small elite incredibly wealthy, many ordinary Kazakhs feel left behind. About a million people out of a total population of 19 million are estimated to live below the poverty line.
Annual inflation is running at close to 9%, the highest in more than five years, prompting the central bank to hike interest rates to 9.75%. 
WHO IS IN CHARGE?
Career diplomat Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, 68, was elected president in 2019 on promises to continue the broadly pro-business policies of his long-serving predecessor, Nursultan Nazarbayev. But Nazarbayev, a former Soviet Politburo member who led Kazakhstan for nearly three decades, was widely seen as the real power behind the throne.
Tokayev has used the protests - which have sometimes targeted symbols of the Nazarbayev era including statues - to fire the 81-year-old former president from his post as chief of the powerful Security Council.
Nazarbayev has made no public comments or appearances since the protests erupted and it remains unclear to what extent the uprising will weaken the considerable influence he and his family have continued to wield in politics and business.
Tokayev also sacked Nazarbayev's nephew, Samat Abish, as second-in-command of the security police. Nazarbayev's eldest daughter Dariga, a former speaker of the Senate and still a lawmaker, has been spoken of in the past as a possible future president.
ECONOMIC PROSPECTS
Kazakhstan’s per capita gross domestic product in 2020 was $9,122, World Bank data show, slightly above that of Turkey and Mexico but below its annual peak of nearly $14,000 in 2013.
Tokayev's government introduced a stimulus package worth 6% of national output to help smaller and medium-sized businesses weather the COVID-19 pandemic.
The World Bank has forecast economic growth of 3.5% in 2021, rising to 3.7% this year and 4.8% in 2023. It has urged Kazakhstan to boost competition and limit the role of large state-owned enterprises in the economy, tackle social inequality and create a more level economic playing field.
HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS
Western countries and rights groups have long criticised Kazakhstan for its authoritarian political system, its intolerance of dissent, curbs on media freedoms and lack of free and fair elections, though it has also been viewed as less repressive and volatile than its ex-Soviet neighbours.

Amnesty International said this week's protests were a result of the authorities' ""widespread repression of basic human rights"" and it called for the release of all those arbitrarily detained and for investigations of past state abuses.
""For years, the government has relentlessly persecuted peaceful dissent, leaving the Kazakhstani people in a state of agitation and despair,"" said Marie Struthers, Amnesty's Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia.

Massimov, who was fired this week as protests raged across the Central Asian country, was detained along with several other officials, the National Security Committee said in a statement. It did not name them or provide further details.
Reuters was unable immediately to contact Massimov.
Dozens have died and public buildings across Kazakhstan have been ransacked and torched in the worst violence experienced by the former Soviet republic in 30 years of independence.
After several days of violence, security forces appeared to have reclaimed the streets of Kazakhstan's main city by Friday. The Russian-backed president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, said he had ordered his troops to shoot to kill to put down a countrywide uprising.
At Tokayev's invitation, a Russia-led military alliance has been deployed at a time of high tension in East-West relations. Russia and the United States are gearing up for talks next week on the Ukraine crisis.

Massimov is widely viewed as a close ally of former president Nursultan Nazarbayev. He has twice been prime minister and has also served as head of the presidential administration under Nazarbayev.
Nazarbayev, 81, was the longest-serving ruler of an ex-Soviet state until he turned over the presidency to Tokayev in 2019. His family is widely believed to have retained influence in Nur-Sultan, the purpose-built capital that bears his name.

(Reuters) -A Georgia judge sentenced Travis McMichael and his father Gregory McMichael on Friday to life in prison without the possibility of parole for what he called the ""chilling"" 2020 murder of Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man running through their mostly white neighborhood in the southern U.S. state.
Judge Timothy Walmsley also gave a life sentence to their neighbor William ""Roddie"" Bryan but ruled that he could seek parole after 30 years in prison, the minimum sentence allowed for murder under Georgia law. 
Echoing comments made by Arbery's anguished relatives earlier in the hearing at Glynn County Superior Court, the judge condemned the three men for what he described as their mistake of failing to see Arbery as just another neighbor. 
He said he gave the McMichaels the harshest sentence available in part because of their ""callous"" words and actions captured on a cellphone video that sparked national outrage when it became public in the summer of 2020. 
""It was a chilling, truly disturbing scene,"" the judge said of the frame in the video where McMichael begins to lift his shotgun at Arbery while the 25-year-old is about 20 feet away. ""I kept coming back to the terror that must have been in the mind of the young man running through Satilla Shores.""
In November, a jury found Gregory McMichael, 66, his son Travis McMichael, 35, and their neighbor Bryan, 52, guilty of murder, aggravated assault, false imprisonment and criminal intent to commit a felony.
The judge agreed with prosecutors and Arbery's relatives that the three men, who are white, had ""assumed the worst"" about Arbery, who he said was ""hunted down and shot, and he was killed because individuals here in this courtroom took the law into their own hands."" 
Earlier, Arbery's family told the court they believed that racial stereotyping led to the killing of the avid jogger, who grew up and still lived across the highway from the Satilla Shores neighborhood where he died. Defense lawyers had pleaded leniency, saying none of the three men ever intended for Arbery to be killed, and that the maximum punishment should be reserved only for the ""worst of the worst"" offenders.
Before the judge's ruling, Jasmine Arbery addressed the court in a quavering voice to offer a poetic celebration of her younger brother's Blackness, which she said was mistaken for something frightening by his attackers.
""He had dark skin that glistened in the sunlight like gold. He had curly hair; he would often like to twist it. Ahmaud had a broad nose and the color of his eyes was filled with melanin,"" she said. ""These are the qualities that made these men assume Ahmaud was a dangerous criminal. To me, those qualities reflected a young man full of life and energy who looked like me and the people I love.""
JUDGE QUOTES ARBERY'S MOTHER
Linda Dunikoski, the lead prosecutor, had argued for the maximum sentence for just the two McMichaels for what she called ""a demonstrated pattern of vigilantism."" Pointing to Gregory McMichael's former work as an investigator in the local prosecutor's office, she said father and son acted as if they were above the law. 
Defense lawyer Kevin Gough had argued for leniency for Bryan because he was the only one of the three who was unarmed when he pursued Arbery. 
Attorneys for the three men have said they will appeal the convictions. The men also face a federal trial in February on hate-crime charges, accused of violating Arbery's civil rights by attacking him because of his ""race and color.""
The state case hinged on whether the defendants, under a now-repealed Georgia law permitting citizen arrests, had a right to confront Arbery on a hunch he was fleeing after committing a crime. In the end the jury was not swayed by tearful testimony from Travis McMichael, the only defendant to take the stand, that he shot only in self-defense.
Arbery was jogging through the leafy Satilla Shores neighborhood on the afternoon of Feb. 23 when the McMichaels decided to grab their guns, jump in a pickup truck and give chase. 
Bryan joined the chase in his own pickup truck after it passed his driveway, and pulled out his cellphone to record Travis McMichael firing a shotgun at Arbery at close range. Arbery had nothing on him besides his running clothes and sneakers. 
The video fueled national protests against racism in the criminal justice system when it emerged months later and it became clear that none of the men involved had yet been arrested after a local prosecutor concluded the killing was justified.
""They chose to target my son because they didn't want him in their community,"" Wanda Cooper-Jones, Arbery's mother, told the court on Friday. ""When they couldn't sufficiently scare him or intimidate him, they killed him.""

In his sentencing, the judge quoted the mother's remarks, saying they struck him as ""very true.""
""At minimum, Ahmaud Arbery should force us to consider expanding our definition of what a neighbor may be and how we treat them,"" the judge said.

344,"<span>Jan 07, 2022 08:50PM ET</span>",,,,,,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has ordered an inquiry into the behaviour of 13 senior government officials who attended the birthday bash of a delegate to China's legislature, where two of the 170 guests tested positive for the coronavirus.
The officials, along with 19 members of Hong Kong's new ""patriots-only"" legislative council - all of whom have so far tested negative - and the other guests were sent to a quarantine facility this week as authorities scramble to contain the emergence of a new wave of cases.
Lam said in a late Friday statement she ordered ""detailed"" investigations ""as to whether the attendance of 13 officials at the banquet constitutes any breach of discipline.""
""I have instructed all officials being subject to quarantine that they should not continue to discharge their duties and that they are required to take their own vacation leave for quarantine.""
The party for the 53rd birthday of Witman Hung, a city delegate to the national legislature, took place on Monday, before new restrictions on social life came into force but after Lam appealed to Hong Kong people to avoid large gatherings.
A three-month streak of no transmission within the community ended on Dec. 31, with the confirmation of the city's first local infection with the fast-spreading Omicron variant.
Several more cases have been detected since and hundreds of their close contacts have been sent to quarantine.
Senior officials who attended included Home Affairs Secretary Casper Tsui, Director of Immigration Au Ka-wang, police commissioner Raymond Siu and the head of the city's Independent Commission against Corruption, Simon Peh, authorities said.
All four and others have issued public apologies.
It was the second such statement for Au, who paid a fine last year for attending a dinner in a luxury private club with more people than the four allowed at the time.

The global financial hub is one of the world's last places to stick to a goal of stopping local transmission of the virus altogether, by strict quarantines and largely isolating itself from the rest of the world.
The city on Friday banned dining in restaurants after 6 p.m., closed venues including bars and clubs, gyms, beauty salons and swimming pools, and limited group gatherings to no more than four people.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Talks between U.S. and Russian diplomats begin in Geneva on Monday after a weeks-long standoff over Russian troop deployments near its border with Ukraine, with veteran envoys on each side trying to avert a crisis.
Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, the No. 2 official at the U.S. State Department, will face Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov. The two combined have more than half a century of diplomatic experience.
Russia, which moved nearly 100,000 troops close to its border with Ukraine, says it is not preparing for an invasion but wants to see the West back off from its support for Ukraine’s government and halt the eastward expansion of the NATO military alliance.
Washington has already dismissed some of Moscow's demands as unviable, making rapid progress desired by Russia in the meetings unlikely.
An added wrinkle is Russia sending troops to quell anti-government protests in neighboring Kazakhstan this week, raising concern in Washington.
In a phone call last week between Presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin, Biden reiterated that the U.S. and European allies would impose unprecedented sanctions if Russia chose to invade Ukraine. Putin responded that sanctions could lead to a ""complete breakdown in ties."" 
Ryabkov told the Izvestia newspaper this week that Russia's approach was necessarily tough, because its previous attempts at persuasion had been fruitless.
    Ryabkov repeated Moscow's demands for a halt to NATO enlargement, no deployment of its weapons systems in Ukraine and an end to ""provocative"" military exercises.
    ""All these are absolutely necessary integral elements, without which we will be forced to state that the other side is showing a lack of cooperation,"" he said.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken fired back on Friday that Russia was pushing a ""false narrative"" that Ukraine and NATO posed a threat to Russia to justify its troop buildup. 
Other officials will also play lead roles when the talks move to Brussels for a NATO-Russia meeting on Wednesday before a meeting hosted by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in Vienna on Thursday.
Sherman and Ryabkov will lead the two delegations in Geneva, where both sides will air their concerns in an extraordinary session of the U.S.-Russia Strategic Stability Dialogue (SSD), talks normally designed to head off the possibility of nuclear confrontation, a senior State Department official said on Friday.
""Hopefully it will result in identifying a few bilateral issues where there is enough common ground to continue discussions and ultimately address together through the SSD,"" said the official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. 
After the meeting, Washington expects Russian officials to make public comments ""that will not reflect the true nature of the discussions,"" the official added, urging U.S. allies to view those comments with extreme skepticism.
Thomas Graham (NYSE:GHM), a former senior director for Russia on the White House's National Security Council, said Sherman and Ryabkov were vastly experienced and would conduct the talks professionally, understanding that the task is to defuse the current crisis.
""There aren't going to be raised voices or pounding on the table,"" said Graham, now a distinguished fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. 
Andrey Kortunov, an analyst who heads the Russian International Affairs Council, said the Kremlin might see confidence-building measures and some constraint from the West in supplying modern weaponry to Ukraine as sufficient to reduce tensions.
VETERAN DIPLOMATS 
Sherman, 72, a former social worker, has served in Democratic administrations since the 1990s. She is best known for leading negotiations on the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and world powers, which also involved dealing with Russian diplomats.
Sherman, like the deal itself, was criticized by hawks in Washington as being too soft on Iran. In Iran, anti-American protesters reportedly chanted “Death to Sherman” during the negotiations. 
In her previous role as under secretary of state, Sherman traveled to Kyiv in 2014, where she spoke about holding back tears as she walked through the Maidan, the central Kyiv square where Ukrainians gathered in protests that toppled a Russian-backed government. 
Sherman said she was approached by “schoolchildren with flowers” rather than the “dangerous elements” Moscow said were behind the protests, and issued a warning to Putin over his annexation of Crimea and the conflict involving Russia-backed separatists in the Donbass region. 
Ryabkov, 61, is a 40-year veteran of the Soviet and Russian foreign ministries who in recent weeks has delivered some of Moscow's harshest rhetoric and direst warnings on the Ukraine crisis. 
He has more than once compared the situation to the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, when the world came close to nuclear war, and has warned that Russia might be compelled to deploy intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe.

    Kortunov, who has known Ryabkov for years, said the diplomat was less hawkish than some members of Russia's security establishment but would be as flexible or rigid as the Kremlin required.
    ""At the end of the day it's up to Mr Putin to define the red lines, not Ryabkov, and Ryabkov will do his best to articulate the red lines,"" said Kortunov.

(Reuters) - Sidney Poitier, who broke through racial barriers as the first Black winner of the best actor Oscar for his role in ""Lilies of the Field,"" and inspired a generation during the civil rights movement, has died at age 94, Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis said on Friday.
""It is with great sadness that I learned this morning of the passing of Sir Sidney Poitier,"" Davis said in a speech broadcast on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). ""But even as we mourn, we celebrate the life of a great Bahamian: a cultural icon, an actor and film director, an entrepreneur, civil and human rights activist and, latterly, a diplomat.""
Poitier created a distinguished film legacy in a single year with three 1967 films at a time when segregation prevailed in much of the United States. 
In ""Guess (NYSE:GES) Who's Coming to Dinner"" he played a Black man with a white fiancee and ""In the Heat of the Night"" he was Virgil Tibbs, a Black police officer confronting racism during a murder investigation. He also played a teacher in a tough London school that year in ""To Sir, With Love.""
Poitier had won his history-making best actor Oscar for ""Lilies of the Field"" in 1963, playing a handyman who helps German nuns build a chapel in the desert. Five years before that Poitier had been the first Black man nominated for a lead actor Oscar for his role in ""The Defiant Ones.""
His Tibbs character from ""In the Heat of the Night"" was immortalized in two sequels - ""They Call Me Mister Tibbs!"" in 1970 and ""The Organization"" in 1971 - and became the basis of the television series ""In the Heat of the Night"" starring Carroll O'Connor and Howard Rollins (NYSE:ROL).
His other classic films of that era included ""A Patch of Blue"" in 1965 in which his character was befriended by a blind white girl, ""The Blackboard Jungle"" and ""A Raisin in the Sun,"" which Poitier also performed on Broadway.
""If you wanted the sky i would write across the sky in letters that would soar a thousand feet high.. To Sir… with Love Sir Sidney Poitier R.I.P. He showed us how to reach for the stars,"" Whoopi Goldberg, Oscar winning actress and TV host, wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
""The dignity, normalcy, strength, excellence and sheer electricity you brought to your roles showed us that we, as Black folks, mattered!!!,"" Oscar winner Viola Davis tweeted. 
Poitier was born in Miami on Feb. 20, 1927, and raised on a tomato farm in the Bahamas, and had just one year of formal schooling. He struggled against poverty, illiteracy and prejudice to become one of the first Black actors to be known and accepted in major roles by mainstream audiences.
Poitier picked his roles with care, burying the old Hollywood idea that Black actors could appear only in demeaning contexts as shoeshine boys, train conductors and maids.
""I love you, I respect you, I imitate you,"" Denzel Washington, another Oscar winner, once told Poitier at a public ceremony.
As a director, Poitier worked with his friend Harry Belafonte and Bill Cosby in ""Uptown Saturday Night"" in 1974 and Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder in 1980's ""Stir Crazy.""
Poitier was knighted by Britain's Queen Elizabeth II in 1974 and served as the Bahamian ambassador to Japan and to UNESCO, the U.N. cultural agency. He also sat on Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's board of directors from 1994 to 2003.
STARTED ON STAGE
Poitier grew up in the small Bahamian village of Cat Island and in Nassau before he moved to New York at 16, lying about his age to sign up for a short stint in the Army and then working at odd jobs, including dishwasher, while taking acting lessons.
The young actor got his first break when he met the casting director of the American Negro Theater. He was an understudy in ""Days of Our Youth"" and took over when the star, Belafonte, who also would become a pioneering Black actor, fell ill.
Poitier went on to success on Broadway in ""Anna Lucasta"" in 1948 and, two years later, got his first movie role in ""No Way Out"" with Richard Widmark.
In all, he acted in more than 50 films and directed nine, starting in 1972 with ""Buck and the Preacher"" in which he co-starred with Belafonte.
In 1992, Poitier was given the Life Achievement Award by the American Film Institute, the most prestigious honor after the Oscar, joining recipients such as Bette Davis, Alfred Hitchcock, Fred Astaire, James Cagney and Orson Welles.
""I must also pay thanks to an elderly Jewish waiter who took time to help a young Black dishwasher learn to read,"" Poitier told the audience. ""I cannot tell you his name. I never knew it. But I read pretty good now.""
In 2002, an honorary Oscar recognized ""his remarkable accomplishments as an artist and as a human being.""
Poitier married actress Joanna Shimkus, his second wife, in the mid-1970s. He had six daughters with his two wives and wrote three books - ""This Life"" (1980), ""The Measure of a Man: A Spiritual Autobiography"" (2000) and ""Life Beyond Measure: Letters to My Great-Granddaughter"" (2008).
""If you apply reason and logic to this career of mine, you're not going to get very far,"" he told the Washington Post. ""The journey has been incredible from its beginning. So much of life, it seems to me, is determined by pure randomness.""
Poitier wrote three autobiographical books and in 2013 published ""Montaro Caine,"" a novel that was described as part mystery, part science fiction.

In 2009, Poitier was awarded the highest U.S. civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, by President Barack Obama.
The 2014 Academy Awards ceremony marked the 50th anniversary of Poitier's historic Oscar and he was there to present the award for best director.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Tennis world No. 1 Novak Djokovic was joined in Australian immigration detention by Czech women's player Renata Voracova on Friday in a row over COVID-19 vaccines that could scupper the Serbian's shot at a record-breaking 21st Grand Slam. 
Both players were being kept at the modest Park Hotel in inner-city Melbourne, where scores of asylum seekers are also housed behind grey walls and locked windows.
Unlike Djokovic, whose determination to resist deportation and play in the Australian Open has rallied his homeland, 81st-ranked Voracova planned to leave after being caught in similar circumstances, the Czech Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
""Renata Voracova decided to drop out of the tournament due to limited possibilities for training and to leave Australia,"" it said, adding that it had made a diplomatic protest and that several other players were caught in the same situation.
Djokovic, who opposes mandatory vaccinations and was widely criticised in 2020 for hosting a tournament as the pandemic was first raging, was held at the airport on Wednesday. Authorities revoked a visa granted on the basis of a medical exemption from Australia's strict vaccination requirements.
The Australian Border Force (ABF) said on Friday that one person had voluntarily left Australia while a third person's visa had also been cancelled. It did not give names.
The initial decision to grant Djokovic entry outraged many in Australia, which is battling its worst surge of infections and where the adult vaccination rate is more than 90%.
Canberra rejected on Friday suggestions by Serbian supporters, including Djokovic's family, that he was a prisoner. ""He is free to leave at any time that he chooses,"" Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews told reporters.
Djokovic's lawyers won legal approval for him to remain until a full court hearing against the federal government on Monday. That should reveal more details about the exemption granted to Djokovic and the documentation he provided at the border to support it.
The player on Friday took to Instagram to thank his supporters around the world amid the visa row.
""Thank you to people around the world for your continuous support. I can feel it and it is greatly appreciated,"" he wrote.
The Australian Open begins on Jan. 17, but the multi-millionaire superstar sportsman is constrained from training as he sits in a hotel where one Iranian detainee said he had found maggots and mould in the bread.
Djokovic, 34, has not revealed the grounds for his exemption and has consistently refused to disclose his vaccination status. Vaccines are not mandatory in Australia but are required for some activities.
ANTI-VAXX HERO
Hailed as a hero online by anti-vaccination campaigners, Djokovic's plight drew a mixed response from his peers. 
Former World No. 1 Boris Becker, who has coached Djokovic, said he was making a big mistake with his anti-vaccination stance. ""It is one that threatens what remains of his career and his chance to cement himself as the greatest player of all time,"" Becker wrote in the Daily Mail newspaper.
Spain's Rafael Nadal, who like Djokovic has won 20 Grand Slams, said he felt sorry for his rival ""but at the same time, he knew the conditions since a lot of months ago"". 
Australia's Nick Kyrgios said he supported vaccination ""but how we are handling Novak's situation is bad, really bad"".
Djokovic's wife Jelena posted a photo of the couple embracing on a beach to mark Orthodox Christmas, saying: ""The only law that we should all respect across every single border is love and respect for another human being"".
Djokovic had received permission to enter Victoria without a vaccination from the state government, which however does not have the authority to issue visas to international visitors.
The Age newspaper reported that the exemption was because he had contracted COVID-19 in the past six months.
Tennis Australia and Victoria government officials said Djokovic had received no preferential treatment, adding that he was among a handful of approvals for exemptions in an anonymous and independent assessment of 26 applications.
Some critics say Prime Minister Scott Morrison is using the issue to boost his pandemic-fighting credentials with an election looming, which the government denies. 

    The Professional Tennis Players Association, a breakaway group launched by Djokovic, said they were in contact with him.
    ""Djokovic has verified his wellbeing to us,"" the group said in a statement. ""He has also requested that we allow him to personally share the facts of his detainment in his own words, and in his own time.""

Heavy fighting between the Myanmar military, which seized power in a coup last year, and resistance fighters has killed or displaced thousands of civilians in this region and elsewhere.
Many have fled to Thailand, but poor conditions in refugee camps there have prompted some to return to the Myanmar side of the border, and human rights groups have called for more help for the displaced. 
Reuters reporters on the Thai side of the Moei river on Friday saw an estimated 2,000 men, women and children living under tarpaulin on the opposite bank in four separate locations.
One woman from the camp, Sabal Phyu, 42, had waded across the loosely patrolled border to collect donated food and bottled water, before returning to the Myanmar side of the river. 
""Over there, we received good aid donations but it was very crowded and difficult to live. Here, we have more freedom,"" Sabal Phyu told Reuters.
Sabal Phyu said she initially crossed into Thailand with her husband and four children but came back to the border area after being packed into an empty cattle barn with other refugees near the Thai town of Mae Sot.
About 8,000 Myanmar refugees are staying in temporary shelters in Thailand, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. 
A spokesperson for Myanmar's military government did not answer calls from Reuters seeking comment.
Asked about the Thai camp conditions, Thailand government spokeswoman Ratchada Dhanadirek said the country was ""taking care of the refugees"" and carrying out its duties ""according to international human rights standards.""
The United Nations Refugee Agency UNHCR said on Friday it had not been granted access by the Thai government to the sites in Mae Sot where refugees are being hosted and also cannot access the Myanmar side of the border.
UNHCR has supplied mosquito nets, sleeping mats, blankets and facemasks to support the humanitarian response being led by Thai authorities, spokesperson Kasita Rochanakorn said.
The deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch said Thailand needed to do more to support those displaced by fighting in Myanmar.
""Thailand must recognise that their humanitarian obligations to refugees involve more than just allowing some food and medicine packages across the border,"" Phil Robertson said. 
Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military ousted a civilian government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1, triggering protests and sporadic clashes in the countryside between anti-junta militia and the army.

More than 1,400 civilians and protesters have been killed by Myanmar security forces since the coup, according to the Assistance Association of Political Prisoners activist group.
The military has said those figures, widely cited by international organisations, are exaggerated.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The possible failure of a juror in Ghislaine Maxwell's trial to disclose that he was a victim of sexual abuse may not be enough to overturn the British socialite's sex trafficking conviction and warrant a new trial, legal experts said on Thursday.
Maxwell, 60, was convicted last week on sex trafficking and other charges for recruiting teenage girls to have sexual encounters with Jeffrey Epstein. Her lawyers asked for a new trial after the juror told Reuters and other news outlets that he shared his experience of sexual abuse during deliberations. 
It was unclear whether the juror, who asked to be identified by his first and middle names, Scotty David, revealed that experience during pre-trial vetting.
But not all instances of jurors failing to disclose information are significant enough to merit a new trial, experts said, noting that cases where verdicts were overturned largely involved jurors who deliberately omitted information to try to get on the panel. 
""The system does not favor overturning verdicts. We value finality,"" said Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, adding that the judge has ""broad discretion"" in this case.
In U.S. court cases, prospective jurors who the judge decides are biased or have a conflict of interest can be dismissed for cause. After that, both the defense and prosecutors can each dismiss a certain number of jurors for no particular reason, known as a peremptory strike. 
Prospective jurors in the Maxwell case in Manhattan federal court were asked during a pre-trial questionnaire whether they had ever been sexually abused. Those who answered ""yes"" were later questioned by U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan about whether they could be impartial, court records show.
Scotty David told Reuters on Tuesday he ""flew through"" the form. He said he did not remember a question that asked if he was ever a victim of sexual abuse, but would have answered honestly. He told Reuters he was not asked about any personal experience with sex abuse in follow-up questioning. 
Scotty David did not reply to a request for comment on Thursday. Todd Spodek, a lawyer who made appearance in the case on behalf of an unnamed juror after the defense's request for a new trial, also did not respond to a request for comment. 
'SHOULD HAVE BEEN REVEALED'
Some experts said they expected Nathan to examine whether Scotty David could still have been impartial despite his experience with abuse. In deliberations, jurors are allowed to relay their personal experiences so long as they do not use it in place of evidence.
But they said Nathan might be limited in asking what happened in the jury room since judges consider the secrecy of deliberations sacrosanct.
""Just because you're a victim of sexual assault does not mean you can't sit on a jury. Just because you lie about that does not mean she was denied a fair trial,"" said Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma, principal attorney at ZMO Law PLLC. 
For example, in 2016, a New York state judge declined to overturn the manslaughter conviction of a New York City police officer Peter Liang despite a juror's failure to disclose during jury selection that his estranged father had been convicted of manslaughter.
The judge said the defense had not shown the juror's actions violated Liang's right to a fair trial. 
There is some precedent for new trials being ordered when jurors are dishonest. In 2012, the late U.S. District Judge William Pauley ordered a new trial in Manhattan federal court for defendants convicted of running a tax shelter scheme, after revelations that a juror lied during pre-trial screening.
The juror said she only had a bachelor's degree and was a ""stay-at-home wife"" when she had actually graduated from law school. She later admitted to lying to make herself more ""marketable"" as a juror. 
Pauley called the juror ""a pathological liar"" in his ruling and said that if the juror had answered honestly, he would not have let her serve.
Sharon McCarthy, a lawyer who represented one of the defendants, told Reuters the juror ""literally lied in response to every question.""

The Maxwell case would likely have a different outcome, said Pace University law professor Bennett Gershman, who has written about jury misconduct. He noted that the jury acquitted Maxwell on one of the counts, suggesting they were responsible in their deliberations.
""It's something that should have been revealed, but doesn't seem to have compromised the verdict,"" he said.

(Reuters) - The sudden and violent crisis in Kazakhstan has caught Russian President Vladimir Putin at a moment when his attention was firmly focused elsewhere and forced him into a military intervention that carries potential risks.
Putin immediately committed Russian paratroopers on Thursday as part of a peacekeeping force from former Soviet states requested by Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who is facing the most dangerous wave of unrest since the Central Asian nation won independence from Moscow in 1991.
Russian and Western political analysts said the crisis would not shift Putin's focus from Ukraine, where he has forced the West to the negotiating table by mobilising tens of thousands of Russian troops for what Kyiv and Washington say could be a possible invasion within weeks - something he denies.
But Kazakhstan presents at the very least an unwelcome temporary distraction as Russia prepares to open negotiations with the West next week over its demands for security guarantees to protect it from what it sees as threatening NATO behaviour.
Kazakh security forces appeared to be reasserting control on Friday after fuel price protests spiralled into days of violence across the vast country, with looting and the torching of public buildings. 
But the potential for further bloodshed is clear.
Tokayev said in a televised address that the state would fight ""to the end"" against what he called bandits and terrorists, and said he had issued shoot-to-kill orders to his security forces.
The size of the task facing the 2,500 peacekeepers from Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan - and whether it can be completed within days or weeks, as intended - is not yet clear.
""The best mission for Moscow's got to be: you go in, you look big and strong standing in visible places and you never actually have to do anything. There's nothing to be gained from shooting at another country's population,"" said Sam Greene, director of the Russia Institute at King's College, London.
But even a successful intervention could leave in place an unpopular government, risk fuelling anti-Russian sentiment and fail to address the underlying causes of the unrest, he said.
Russia had presumably calculated that failure to act would risk a worse outcome, namely the fall of Tokayev and the emergence of a power vacuum in Kazakhstan, Greene said.
ON A ROLL
But there is also potential upside for the Kremlin in extending a series of strategic interventions it has carried out in former Soviet states since 2020.
In Belarus, it propped up authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko when mass protests threatened to topple him, and since then has used that country's territory and airspace to stage high-profile military drills and strategic bomber flights near the borders of NATO member countries. 
In the Caucasus, Putin brought about a ceasefire in a 2020 war between Armenia and Azerbaijan and sent in peacekeepers, ensuring Russia would remain the key security player in a region where Turkey and Iran also compete for influence.
Now Kazakhstan, the world's top producer of uranium and ninth biggest oil exporter, looks set to become increasingly beholden to Moscow. Tokayev made a point in his televised address on Friday of thanking Putin for his rapid support.
""For Russia, if things do settle down, it will be a substantial win, demonstrating how critical it remains, and also tethering Kazakhstan to it that much more,"" said Olga Oliker, Europe and Central Asia program director at Crisis Group.
Jonathan Eyal of the RUSI think-tank in London said Putin could achieve a further important advantage vis-a-vis China by reasserting Russia as the security guarantor of the Central Asian states, even if he could not hope to match Beijing's economic influence in the region.
""Of course Russia is delighted to have supreme control in security terms in Central Asia. That goes to the narrative of Putin as a sort of re-creator of the Soviet Union,"" Eyal said.
""It allows Putin to portray himself as slightly more equal to the Chinese. He's got an alliance which the Chinese don't have, he's got a gaggle of countries that look up to him as their ultimate protector, which the Chinese don't have. He's got a return to a position of a regional power, if not a global power, which is what he always craved.""
Ukraine, however, remains the bigger concern.

Kazakhstan ""might distract attention from Ukraine at least for some time because definitely it's a serious crisis which should require attention and focus from the Russian side. But I don't think it would completely take Ukraine off the table,"" said Andrey Kortunov, head of the Russian International Affairs Council.
""I think this issue remains a top priority and it will be still an issue that they would like to discuss with the West, no matter what happens in Kazakhstan.""

(Reuters) - Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen met Myanmar's military ruler Min Aung Hlaing on Friday amid criticism of the first visit by a head of government since the army seized power from an elected government last year.
Hun Sen was greeted by an honour guard and red carpet when he arrived on Friday, just as protests by coup opponents broke out in other parts of the country over fears his trip will provide more legitimacy to the ruling junta.
Myanmar state television later showed images of the two leaders bumping elbows and sitting down for talks in gilded chairs.
Hun Sen's two-day visit was the first by a head of government since the army overthrew the civilian administration of Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1 last year, sparking months of protests and a bloody crackdown.
The Cambodian leader, who has been criticised over crackdowns on his political opponents at home, has said he was making the visit to press a Myanmar peace plan sponsored by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
Cambodia is current chair of the 10-member ASEAN, which adopted a five-point ""consensus"" peace plan in April.
Some other ASEAN countries including Indonesia have expressed frustration at the junta's failure to implement the plan, including allowing an envoy to meet Suu Kyi, who has been in detention since the coup.
In Myanmar, opponents of military rule have said Hun Sen, who seized power in Phnom Penh in a 1997 coup, is backing the junta by making the trip.
In Depayin, about 300 km (186 miles) north of the capital, Naypyidaw, protesters burned a poster of the Cambodian prime minister and chanted ""Hun Sen don't come to Myanmar. We don't want dictator Hun Sen"", photographs on social media showed.
There were also reports of protests in the second city of Mandalay and the Tanintharyi and Monywa regions.
In a speech on Wednesday before his trip, Hun Sen called for restraint from all sides in Myanmar and for the peace plan to be followed.
""Brothers in Myanmar, do you want your country to fall into a real civil war or want it solved?"" he said. 
After a phone call this week with Hun Sen, Indonesian President Joko Widodo said in messages on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) if there was no significant progress on the peace plan, then only non-political representatives from Myanmar should be allowed at ASEAN meetings.
HUMANITARIAN ACCESS
In October, junta leader Min Aung Hlaing was barred from attending an ASEAN summit for his failure to cease hostilities, allow humanitarian access and start dialogue, as agreed with ASEAN. 
But in a further sign of divisions in the 10-member bloc, Hun Sen last month said junta officials should be allowed to attend ASEAN meetings.
Min Ko Naing, a leading activist in Myanmar, said in a social media post that Hun Sen would face massive protests over his visit, which would hurt ASEAN.
Hun Sen is one of the world's longest serving leaders and Western countries and human rights groups have long condemned him for crackdowns on opponents, civil rights groups and the media in Cambodia. His party now holds all seats in parliament after a court banned the main opposition party ahead of a 2018 election.

Amnesty International's Deputy Regional Director for Research Emerlynne Gil said the trip risked sending mixed messages to Mynamar's military leader and Hun Sen should instead lead ASEAN to strong action to address the country’s ""dire human rights situation"".
U.S.-funded Radio Free Asia cited a junta spokesman as saying Hun Sen would not meet Suu Kyi, who has been detained since the coup and is on trial, facing nearly a dozen cases that carry a combined maximum sentence of more than 100 years in prison.

TOKYO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and Japan on Friday voiced strong concern about China's growing might in unambiguous terms and pledged to work together against attempts to destabilise the region.
The comments from the two allies, in a joint statement that followed a virtual meeting of their foreign and defence ministers, highlight how deepening alarm about China - and growing tension over Taiwan - have put Japan's security role in focus.
The ministers expressed concerns that China's efforts ""to undermine the rules-based order"" presented ""political, economic, military and technological challenges to the region and the world"", according to their statement.
""They resolved to work together to deter and, if necessary, respond to destabilising activities in the region,"" it said.
The ministers also said they had ""serious and ongoing concerns"" about human rights in China's Xinjiang and Hong Kong regions and stressed the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.
In a separate virtual summit on Thursday, Japan and Australia signed a defence cooperation agreement.
China lodged stern representations with all three countries.
""We deplore and firmly oppose the gross interference in China's internal affairs by the U.S., Japan and Australia and the fabrication of false information to smear China and undermine the solidarity and mutual trust of countries in the region,"" foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a daily briefing in Beijing.
Pacifist Japan has close economic ties to China but is increasingly concerned that it could move against democratic Taiwan https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/taiwan-china-submarines, which it claims as part of China.
""This is clearly a combined message reflecting a common concern, not a case of U.S. arm-twisting to get Japan to sign onto vague euphemisms,"" said Daniel Russel, who served as the top U.S. diplomat for Asia under president Barack Obama and is now with the Asia Society Policy Institute.
""In particular, the expression of joint resolve to respond if necessary to destabilising activities comes across as a powerful expression of alliance solidarity and determination.""
Before the talks, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington and Tokyo planned a new defence deal to counter emerging threats, including hypersonics and space-based capabilities. 
NEW TOOLS
He said the alliance ""must not only strengthen the tools we have, but also develop new ones"", citing Russia's military buildup against Ukraine, Beijing's ""provocative"" actions over Taiwan and North Korea's latest missile launch. North Korea fired a ""hypersonic missile"" this week that successfully hit a target, its state news agency said.
Russia, China and the United States are also racing to build hypersonic weapons, whose extreme speed and manoeuvrability make them hard to spot and block with interceptor missiles.
As its neighbours test hypersonic missiles, Japan has been working on electromagnetic ""railgun"" technology to target them.
""We need to pursue all available means including cooperation with the United States to strengthen comprehensive missile defence capabilities,"" Japan's defence minister, Nobuo Kishi, told reporters.
Tokyo also explained its plan to revise the national security strategy to fundamentally boost defence capabilities, Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said after the meeting.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in October promised to revise Japan's security strategy to consider ""all options including possession of so-called enemy-strike capabilities"".
Kishida's government has approved record defence spending, with a 10th straight annual increase in 2022. 
Jeffrey Hornung, an expert in Japanese security policy at the Rand Corporation, a U.S.-backed think tank, said while Japan's options for using force are limited, it might deem a Taiwan emergency as threatening its own survival.

""There is no coded messaging here,"" Hornung said.
""China is the challenge and they said as much, then detailed all the ways the alliance is determined to work to counter its destabilising activities.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean military officials cast doubts on Friday on the capabilities of what North Korea called a ""hypersonic missile"" test fired this week, saying it appeared to represent limited progress over Pyongyang's existing ballistic missiles.
On Wednesday, North Korea launched what its state media said was the country's second hypersonic missile, which are usually defined as weapons that reach speeds of at least five times the speed of sound - or about 6,200 kms per hour (3,850 mph) - and can manoeuvre at relatively low trajectories, making them much harder to detect and intercept.
While the missile's warhead appeared to reach hypersonic speeds, that capability is shared by other ballistic missiles and Wednesday's test did not appear to demonstrate the range and manoeuvrability claimed in state media reports, a South Korean military official told reporters.
South Korea assessed that it flew for less than the 700 km (435 miles) claimed by North Korea and showed less than the ""lateral"" manoeuvrability reported, the official added.
Wednesday's warhead featured a more conical shape than the first claimed North Korean hypersonic missile tested in September, which was glider-like.
""This is neither a hypersonic glide vehicle nor a hypersonic cruise missile, this is a missile with a mobile warhead,"" the official said of the newest missile, which was first unveiled at a Pyongyang defence exhibition in October.
The assessment mirrors that of international analysts who noted that the test appeared to involve a liquid-fuel ballistic missile with a Manoeuvrable Reentry Vehicle (MaRV), a capability previously fielded by other countries including the United States and South Korea.
""One of my complaints about the 'hypersonic' framing is that it wrongly emphasizes speed when what we really are discussing is manoeuvrability and accuracy,"" Jeffrey Lewis, a missile researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS), said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""So, yeah, the new (North Korea) glider is hypersonic. But more importantly, it's a MaRV.""

While such missiles don't have the range of North Korea's largest intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), analysts say manoeuvrable weapons can be used to evade missile defences. 
On Friday the United States and Japan issued a joint statement pledging to increase joint defence, including against hypersonic weapons.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Thursday accused his predecessor Donald Trump of spreading a ""web of lies"" to undermine U.S. democracy in a speech on the anniversary of the deadly Capitol attack by Trump supporters who tried to undo his 2020 election defeat.
Speaking at the white-domed building where rioters smashed windows, assaulted police and sent lawmakers fleeing for their lives on Jan. 6, 2021, Biden said Trump's false claims https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-false-claims-debunked-2020-election-jan-6-riot-2022-01-06 that the election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud could unravel the rule of law and subvert future elections.
""A former president of the United States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election. He's done so because he values power over principle,"" Biden said. ""He can't accept he lost.""
Biden never actually uttered his predecessor's name during the 25-minute speech, telling reporters afterward he was trying to focus on the threats to America's political system instead of Trump himself.
The tone, including a poke at Trump's ""bruised ego,"" was a departure for Biden, who has focused during most of his first year in office on pursuing his own agenda. Trump issued three statements in the hours following his successor's remarks accusing Biden of trying to divide the country and repeating his false election claims.
Trump's behavior over the past year, like his conduct in office, has been norm-shattering. Unlike other former U.S. presidents denied re-election, Trump has refused to accept the verdict of the voters and pressured fellow Republicans to somehow overturn the results, without success.
His false claims have provided cover for Republicans at the state level to pass new restrictions on voting that they have said are needed to fight fraud. Research shows such fraud is extremely rare in U.S. elections.
Biden's fellow Democrats, a few Republicans and many independent experts have said Trump's continued denials could make it less likely that future U.S. transfers of power will be peaceful - especially those involving closer margins than the 2020 election that Biden won by 7 million votes nationwide.
The speech illustrated that Biden and other Democrats remain wary of Trump's political staying power. In the riot's immediate aftermath, even some Republicans thought his grip on their party had been shaken, but since then Trump has only tightened it.
""Our democracy is very fragile, and the cult of The Big Lie is still very much in action with the help of the vast majority of our colleagues on the other side, who continue to try to rewrite or ignore history,"" Democratic Representative Pramila Jayapal said at an afternoon event.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi led dozens of bundled-up Democratic lawmakers holding lights in a moment of silence on the steps of the Capitol, part of a candlelight prayer vigil that was the final official event of the anniversary. 
Not far away, a vigil at the D.C. jail for the about 40 inmates charged in connection with the Jan. 6 assault was sparsely attended. 
""This is not speedy justice,” said L.A. Warren, 65, who had driven to Washington from his Michigan home for the day and said he, too, had participated in the storming of the Capitol. “A year, that’s a long time, when these people - a lot of them, in my view - was trespassing.” 
'CULT OF PERSONALITY'
Just two Republicans were spotted at a House of Representatives session marking the riot's anniversary: Representative Liz Cheney, who has been shunned by party colleagues after criticizing Trump, and her father Dick Cheney, who served as vice president under President George W. Bush.
""A party that is in thrall to a cult of personality is a party that is dangerous to the country,"" Liz Cheney told reporters on her way out of the Capitol. 
Dick Cheney told reporters that current party leaders do not resemble ""any of the folks I knew"" when he served in Congress. 
America's next federal election is in November, with Republicans favored to retake a majority in at least one of the two chambers of Congress. That could cripple Biden's ability to advance policy and set the stage for two years of legislative gridlock before a potential 2024 Biden-Trump rematch.
According to Reuters/Ipsos polling, 55% of Republican voters believe Trump's false claims, which were rejected by dozens of courts, state election departments and members of his own administration.
Four people died in the hours-long chaos after Trump urged supporters to march to the Capitol and ""fight like hell."" One police officer died on that day after battling rioters and four later died by suicide. Around 140 police officers were injured. U.S. prosecutors have brought criminal charges against at least 725 people https://tmsnrt.rs/3HyfyEg linked to the riot.
Trump remains highly popular among Republican voters and is working to shape the field of Republican candidates https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-revenge-endorsements-drive-republican-congressman-race-2021-09-09 in the Nov. 8 congressional elections. 
Most Republican officeholders have remained loyal to him, and some have sought to play down the riot. Liz Cheney is one of only two Republican members of a House committee investigating the riot, which in recent weeks has unearthed records showing Trump allies urging him to call off the rioters as the attack was unfolding. 

Other Republicans accused Democrats of exploiting the anniversary for partisan gain.
""What brazen politicization of Jan. 6 by President Biden,"" said Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM), who has reversed his position on Trump numerous times, including criticizing him after the riot and then reverting to defending him.

SEOUL (Reuters) - In a letter to China, North Korea blamed ""hostile forces"" and COVID-19 risks for not being able to attend the upcoming Winter Olympics in Beijing and accused the United States of trying to prevent the Games' success, state media said on Friday.
It was unclear whether the letter from North Korea's Olympic Committee and Sports Ministry was referring only to its athletes - who are not eligible to compete after North Korea was suspended from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) until the end of 2022 after failing to send a team to the Tokyo Olympics last year, citing COVID-19 concerns.
A summary of the letter by state news agency KCNA made no mention of a diplomatic delegation, and the country has maintained a strict self-imposed border lockdown that has blocked even its own diplomats from entering and choked off nearly all trade.
The letter criticised unspecified moves by the United States, which in December announced its government officials will boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics because of China's human rights record, while leaving U.S. athletes free to travel to Beijing to compete.
Several other countries, including Britain, Australia, and Canada have also since announced diplomatic boycotts.
""The U.S. and its vassal forces are getting evermore undisguised in their moves against China aimed at preventing the successful opening of the Olympics,"" the North Korean letter said, calling the moves ""an insult to the spirit of the international Olympic Charter and as a base act of attempting to disgrace the international image of China.""
North Korea has sent high-level political leaders to some previous games, including the sister of leader Kim Jong Un, Kim Yo Jong, to the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. Kim Yong Nam, North Korea's second-highest official at the time, visited Beijing for the Summer Olympics in 2008.

China has been North Korea's only major ally since the two signed a treaty in 1961, and international sanctions imposed over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes have made it more dependent than ever on Beijing for trade and other support.
""We could not take part in the Olympics due to the hostile forces' moves and the worldwide pandemic, but we would fully support the Chinese comrades in all their work to hold splendid and wonderful Olympic festival,"" the letter said, according to KCNA.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden used the first anniversary of the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol on Thursday to urge Americans to protect the country's fragile democracy by standing up for the right to vote.
Biden, in remarks from the Capitol's National Statuary Hall, lambasted former President Donald Trump for spreading mistruths that fueled the deadly attack by the Republican's supporters two weeks before Biden's inauguration in 2021. 
Speaking 10 months before the November midterm elections that could give control of one or both houses of Congress to Republicans, Biden, a Democrat, warned that the danger on display a year ago had not gone away. 
""The lies that drove the anger and madness we saw in this place, they have not abated. So we have to be firm, resolute and unyielding in our defense of the right to vote and to have that vote counted,"" Biden said from the U.S. Capitol, where a mob of Trump's supporters attempted to overturn the 2020 election results.
""So now let's step up, write the next chapter in American history, where January 6th marks not the end of democracy but the beginning of a renaissance of liberty and fair play,"" Biden said.
In remarks delivered before Biden spoke, Vice President Kamala Harris also cast a spotlight on Trump supporters' efforts to subvert democracy, calling on Congress to pass voting rights legislation and on Americans to participate. 
""We cannot let our future be decided by those bent on silencing our voices, overturning our votes and peddling lies and misinformation by some radical faction that may be newly resurgent but whose roots run old,"" Harris said. 
""The fragility of democracy is this: that if we are not vigilant, if we do not defend it, democracy simply will not stand; it will falter and fail.""
Biden and Harris plan to travel to Georgia on Tuesday to deliver remarks about voting rights. 
Democrats say federal election reform is necessary to counter a wave of voting restrictions adopted last year by Republican-led states. The laws were inspired by Trump's false claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, which he lost to Biden by a substantial margin.
Americans vote in lower numbers than in many other developed nations, historical data shows, with eligible turnout during presidential elections hovering near 60% for much of the past century. Numbers spiked in the 2020 election to nearly 67%.
Democrats hope that greater voter turnout will favor them, especially as demographic shifts shrink the white majority in the country of roughly 330 million people.
Democrats' efforts to pass voting rights legislation in Congress appeared in jeopardy this week, as centrist Democratic Senator Joe Manchin said he had little interest in a strategy that would allow the party to bypass Republican opposition.
Biden and his advisers had shied away from talking directly about Trump during the Democrat's first year in office, but Thursday marked a turnaround. Biden attacked the ""defeated"" former president's ""bruised ego"" and his followers' refusal to accept reality.
""You can’t love your country only when you win. You can't obey the law only when it's convenient. You can't be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies,"" he said.

""Those who stormed this Capitol and those who instigated and incited and those who called on them to do so held a dagger at the throat of America - at American democracy. 
""Now it’s up to all of us - to “We the People” - to stand for the rule of law, to preserve the flame of democracy, to keep the promise of America alive.""

TOKYO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The question of Japan's security role at a time of rising tension over Taiwan is likely to figure prominently at a meeting on Friday between the foreign and defense ministers of Japan and the United States.
The so-called two-plus-two talks will take place a day after Japan signed a defense cooperation pact with Australia, and as concern about China's increased military and economic might looms large.
Tension over democratically ruled Taiwan has risen over the past two years as China steps up military and diplomatic pressure to assert its sovereignty over the island it claims as its ""sacred"" territory.
""The ministers are expected to talk about security cooperation in the region,"" a Japanese foreign ministry official told reporters ahead of the talks. 
That would ""certainly"" include cooperation that both countries are pursuing with Australia and other partners.
U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price told a regular news briefing on Thursday that the two sides would discuss ways ""to strengthen and modernize our alliances to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific region and to address the COVID-19 pandemic, the climate crisis and other global challenges.""
Japan's Kyodo news agency reported this month, citing unnamed Japanese government sources, that the Japanese and U.S. armed forces have drawn up a draft plan said for a joint operation in the event of an emergency over Taiwan, which China claims as its own and has vowed to retake by force if necessary.
Tokyo, like Washington, maintains a ""one China"" policy that officially recognizes Beijing, not Taipei, and Japan aims to balance its relationships with neighboring China and longtime military ally the United States.
China is Japan's top export destination, accounting for $141 billion in exports in 2020, according to IMF trade data.
Japan's relationship with Taiwan has nevertheless flourished in recent years on a largely nongovernmental basis, and there has been growing debate among politicians and security experts on whether it should get involved if China was ever to take military action against the island.
Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said last month Japan and the United States could not stand by if China attacked Taiwan, remarks that drew a rebuke from Beijing.
Kyodo said Friday's two-plus-two talks could see the allies agree to formalize their work on the Taiwan plan.
The Japanese foreign ministry official declined to comment.
In October, Japan's government signaled a more assertive line https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/biden-promised-us-commitment-defending-senkaku-islands-japan-pm-kishida-2021-10-05 on Taiwan, suggesting it would consider options and prepare for ""various scenarios.""
However, experts do not expect any significant shift in Japan's posture anytime soon.
""The two-plus-two could be an opportunity to broadly speak about what Japan may be willing to do but that would never be acknowledged publicly if they did,"" said Jeffrey Hornung, a Japanese security policy expert at the Rand Corporation, noting that both sides might want to maintain so-called strategic ambiguity.
Daniel Russel, a former top U.S. diplomat for East Asia now with the Asia Society, said Japan had much to weigh up when it came to Taiwan.

""On the one hand, deterring Chinese aggression and defending against relentless incursions in Japanese-controlled waters is a high priority, as is standing alongside the United States and showing support for Taiwan's democracy,"" he said.
""Countervailing factors include pacifist domestic politics and legal constraints (and) immense economic interests in China.""

Kristof, 62, who is from Yamhill, a rural community in western Oregon, said if elected he would tackle homelessness, poverty, drug addiction and inadequate education.

The Santa Fe Sheriff's Office and New Mexico First Judicial District Attorney's Office are ""actively working"" with the Suffolk County Sheriff's Department, New York, and Baldwin's lawyers to get any materials on the phone pertaining to their investigation, according to a press release.
The statement came three weeks after the sheriff's office received a search warrant to seize Baldwin's Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone to examine text messages, emails and other information stored on the device, according to court documents.
A spokesman for the Suffolk County Sheriff's Department and a lawyer for Baldwin did not respond to requests for comment.
Baldwin has a home in Amagansett, Suffolk County.
The ""30 Rock"" actor has said he was holding a revolver on the film set when it went off during rehearsal in October, firing a live round that killed Halyna Hutchins.
The actor said in a television interview he never pulled the trigger and denied responsibility for the shooting. He said he had no idea how a live round got onto the set.
The New Mexico prosecutor overseeing the case has said some people who handled guns on the set may face criminal charges over Hutchins' death.

A Santa Fe detective said she sought the search warrant for Baldwin's phone after she requested it on a voluntary basis and ""was instructed to acquire a warrant,"" according to an affidavit.
The affidavit said suspects, victims and witnesses ""often make and/or receive telephone calls and/or messages before, during and/or after the commission of crime(s). Such information, if it exists, may be material and relevant to this investigation.""

A bomb cyclone is an intense weather event in which the barometric pressure drops quickly, causing heavy precipitation and producing powerful winds.
The heaviest snow will move into Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and Tennessee on Thursday night; up to 3 inches (7.5 cm) of snow are expected in the nation's capital, the second snowstorm in a week. 
New York City could see up to 6 inches (15.24 cm) of snow on Friday, Accuweather said. Winter storm warnings are in place along much of the Northeast coast, according to the National Weather Service, with the heavy snowfall expected as far north as Maine if the storm strengthens fast enough. 

""The farther north you go, the bigger the snow accumulations"" AccuWeather's Chief Video Meteorologist Bernie Rayno said. 
Earlier this week, a winter storm unleashed heavy snow and strong winds throughout much of the U.S. Southeast and mid-Atlantic, forcing schools to close, grounding airplanes and knocking out power for thousands of people.

In interviews with CNN and Reuters, Grisham said she was compiling a group that so far includes about 15 former Trump White House staff. They include Olivia Troye, a former national security aide to former Vice President Mike Pence, and Anthony Scaramucci, a New York businessman who had a brief stint as Trump's communications director, she told Reuters. 
What influence the group could have is unclear. Trump is supporting a handpicked group of Republican loyalists for seats in the November 2022 congressional elections and pondering another run for the White House in 2024. 
More than half of Republicans believe the election was ""stolen"" from Trump, despite the lack of any evidence, Reuters polling shows https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/POLLING/byprjqmdjpe/republican. 
""I can say that next week, a group of former Trump staff are going to come together, administration officials are going to come together, and we're going to talk about how we can formally do some things to try and stop him, and also the extremism, that kind of violence and rhetoric that has been talked about and continues to divide our country,"" Grisham told CNN.
Grisham testified on Wednesday night before the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-call-trump-threat-democracy-us-capitol-attack-anniversary-2022-01-06 on the U.S. Capitol. She did not elaborate on her testimony.
Grisham resigned as Melania Trump's chief of staff on the night of Jan. 6, 2021, after Trump's refusal to work to halt the protesters' attack on the Capitol that day. She had also been White House press secretary for a year.

Even if no criminal charges are brought against Trump, Grisham said, the committee ""is going to show you know, irrefutable proof that he was behind this.""
Grisham released a tell-all book last year that criticized Trump and his entourage, ""I'll Take Your Questions Now: What I Saw at the Trump White House.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris was at Democratic committee headquarters in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, when a pipe bomb was discovered outside, according to a White House official familiar with the matter.
Harris, then the vice-president elect and senator from California, evacuated the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters on Capitol Hill after law enforcement officers discovered the device, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The U.S. Secret Service, which provides Harris' security, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
For a year, the FBI has been looking for a suspect wearing a gray hooded top who they say planted an explosive device next to a park bench outside the DNC and another in an alley behind the Republican National Committee (RNC) headquarters. The devices, which officials believe were planted the night before, were defused.

Their discovery came on the same day as supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol in an attempt https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-call-trump-threat-democracy-us-capitol-attack-anniversary-2022-01-06 to overturn the Nov. 3, 2020, election of Joe Biden and Harris.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Novak Djokovic faced at least 72 hours holed up in a Melbourne hotel for immigration detainees after he was denied entry into Australia on Thursday amid a political firestorm over his medical exemption from COVID-19 vaccination requirements.
The tennis star, who is chasing a record-breaking 21st Grand Slam at the Australian Open, remained in the country after his lawyers launched an appeal seeking to overturn the federal government decision. A court agreed not to deport him before a full hearing scheduled for Monday.
The saga, fuelled by domestic political point-scoring about the country's handling of a record surge in new COVID-19 infections, has led to an international row, with Serbia's president claiming his nation's most celebrated sportsman was being harassed.
""They are keeping him as a prisoner,"" Djokovic's mother, Dijana, said at the family's restaurant in Belgrade. ""It's not fair. It's not human."" 
She said she spoke to the champion on Thursday, and he was struggling to fall asleep. ""His accommodation (is) terrible. It's just some small, immigration hotel, if it is a hotel at all. With bugs, it's all dirty. The food is terrible.""
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison defended the decision to deny Djokovic entry at a televised news briefing.
""There are no special cases, rules are rules,"" he said. ""We will continue to make the right decisions when it comes to securing Australian borders in relation to this pandemic.""
Spanish champion Rafael Nadal told reporters in Melbourne that he felt sorry for his rival ""but at the same time, he knew the conditions since a lot of months ago.""
Djokovic, who has consistently refused to disclose his vaccination status while publicly criticising mandatory vaccines, kicked off the furore when he said on Instagram on Tuesday he had received a medical exemption to compete in the Open starting Jan. 17.
The announcement prompted an outcry in Australia, particularly in the tournament host city of Melbourne, which has endured the world's longest cumulative lockdown to ward off the coronavirus.
COURT BATTLE OVER EXEMPTION
At a hearing in the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia on Thursday evening, lawyers for Djokovic and the government agreed the player could remain in the country until at least Monday. 
Djokovic's fate is tied to a political fight in Australia, characterised by finger-pointing between Morrison's conservative administration and the left-leaning Victoria state government over his medical exemption.
The squabbles rumbled on as Australia's daily COVID-19 infections hit a record high for the fourth consecutive day, overwhelming hospitals and causing labour shortages. 
Under Australia's federal system, states and territories can issue exemptions from vaccination requirements to enter their jurisdictions. However, the federal government controls international borders and can challenge such exemptions.
Djokovic received his exemption from the Victorian government. While the reason for his medical exemption was not officially released, The Age newspaper in Melbourne reported on Thursday that it was on the basis that he had contracted COVID-19 in the past six months.
On his arrival, however, Federal Border Force officials at the airport said Djokovic was unable to justify the grounds for his exemption. 
The Australian task force that sets the exemption parameters lists the risk of serious cardiac illness from inoculation and a COVID-19 infection in the past six months as qualifiers. But Morrison said Tennis Australia had been advised weeks ago that a recent infection did not meet the criteria for exemption.
Tennis Australia and Victoria government officials said Djokovic had received no preferential treatment.
With the Open to start on Jan. 17, Nick Wood, a lawyer for Djokovic, earlier told Judge Anthony Kelly that Tennis Australia had advised they needed to know about his participation in the tournament by Tuesday.
In response, Kelly, who had asked when Djokovic was scheduled to play his first match, said: ""If I can say with the respect necessary, the tail won't be wagging the dog here.""
'NOT HUMAN AND NOT FAIR'
The move by the Australian government to block Djokovic's entry has caused ructions between Canberra and Belgrade.
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) he had spoken with Djokovic and accused the Australian government of harassment.
""This persecution is unfair, starting with the Australian prime minister,"" he later told Serbian media. ""They are acting as if the same set of rules apply to everyone, but they've let in others on the same grounds that Novak had applied to.""
Morrison said he was aware ""representations have been made"" by the Serbian embassy in Canberra but denied accusations of harassment.
Djokovic's father, Srdjan, told media in Serbia that his son was ushered into an isolation room under police guard when he arrived at Melbourne's Tullamarine airport late on Wednesday after a 14-hour flight from Dubai.
His family held an emotional news conference at Djokovic's restaurant in Belgrade, with his nine previous Australian Open trophies on display, before protesting in front of parliament.
""They are keeping him in captivity. They are stomping all over Novak to stomp all over Serbia,"" said his father, who earlier described his son to local media as ""the Spartacus of the new world"".

There was also support on the streets of the Serbian capital.
""He is the best in the history of that sport and they cannot break him in any other way but this one. But they are not going to break him,"" said Belgrade resident Zdravko Cukic.

(Reuters) - A juror in the Ghislaine Maxwell case whose actions prompted the British socialite's lawyer to seek a new sexual abuse trial has turned to a criminal lawyer who defended an NBA player, an Alec Baldwin stalker and a scammer who posed as a wealthy heiress. 
New York attorney Todd Spodek on Wednesday night filed an appearance in Maxwell's case on behalf of Juror No. 50. Spodek did not respond to a request for comment and has not disclosed his client's name in the Maxwell case. 
A jury convicted , 60, on Dec. 29 of sex trafficking and other charges for recruiting and grooming underage girls for abuse by the convicted sex offender, the late Jeffrey Epstein.
On Tuesday a juror identifying himself by his first and middle name, Scotty David, told news media including Reuters that he had been a victim of sexual abuse. The next day Maxwell's lawyer wrote the judge seeking a new trial.
U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan's decision on whether to grant a new trial could hinge on how the juror responded during jury selection to questions about his experiences with sexual abuse, a way of weeding out potentially biased jurors.
Spodek's website and court documents say his clients have included Anna Sorokin, a German woman convicted and sentenced to prison in 2019 for scamming New York hotels, banks and others while posing as a billionaire heiress.
He also represented Genevieve Sabourin, who was convicted and sentenced to 210 days in prison for stalking and harassing actor Baldwin in 2013, his website says.

Court documents say he also represents Eddie Robinson, a former National Basketball Association player who was charged in October with defrauding the league’s health and welfare benefit plan. Robinson has pleaded not guilty. 
Scotty David told Reuters on Tuesday that during deliberations, after some jurors expressed skepticism about the accounts of two of Maxwell's accusers, he shared his experience of having been sexually abused as a child.

MOMBASA, Kenya (Reuters) -China said on Thursday it would appoint a special envoy to foster peace in the turbulent Horn of Africa and wanted to shift focus on the continent to trade over infrastructure.
Foreign Minister Wang Yi made the comments in Kenya, which has been active in diplomatic efforts to halt war in Ethiopia since late 2020 between the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's federal government.
He also visited Eritrea, which borders the northern Tigray region and has been an ally of Abiy in a conflict that has killed thousands of people, uprooted hundreds of thousands, and spread hunger.
""To share political consensus and to coordinate actions, China will appoint a special envoy of the Chinese ministry of foreign affairs for the Horn of Africa,"" Wang told a news conference in the port city of Mombasa, via an interpreter.
Horn of Africa nations should decide their own destiny and convene a peace conference, Wang added. The region's other major war is in Somalia where Islamist militants al Shabaab are battling a Western-backed government.
China has traditionally been more focused on economic development and trade in Africa than politics and diplomacy, and Wang gave no further details of the envoy's role.
Beijing wants to help develop Eritrea's Red Sea coastline, he added, without elaborating on that either.
Eric Olander, managing editor of The China Africa Project website and podcast, saw the visit to Eritrea as strategic in China's rivalry with the United States, which has imposed sanctions on Eritrea for its role in Tigray.
""This is part of a big push to rally countries against the use of sanctions,"" he said. ""I think they (China) feel they're gaining momentum against the U.S.""
State Department spokesman Ned Price said Washington was aware of reports that China will appoint a special envoy, adding that the United States will work with all partners who share objectives in promoting peace and security in the region.
U.S. Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa Jeffrey Feltman met Abiy on Thursday, Price told reporters. He said Washington hopes any positive momentum can be quickly realized after the talks. [nS0N2T500Z]
Feltman will step down from his post this month after more than nine months in the job, and David Satterfield, the outgoing U.S. ambassador to Turkey, will take up the role, Reuters reported on Wednesday.
AVOCADOS AND VACCINES
Chinese officials signed six agreements with Kenyan counterparts, including one allowing Kenyan farmers to export fresh avocados to China. That will enable Kenya to narrow its considerable trade imbalance with China, said Rachel Omamo, Kenya's foreign minister.
Kenya will receive a donation of 10 million COVID-19 vaccine doses from China, both sides said, part of 1 billion extra doses https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/chinas-xi-pledges-10-bln-credit-line-african-financial-institutions-2021-11-29 pledged to Africa by China late last year.
China has been shifting from offering African nations hard infrastructure loans towards increasing trade. ""It is never about what China wants to do, it is about what Africa wants to do,"" he said.
The continent's needs were expanding from the building of roads and railways, Wang said, citing the need for vaccines and export opportunities.
Analysts have also attributed the slowdown in Chinese infrastructure lending in Africa https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/african-nations-mend-make-do-china-tightens-belt-road-2021-11-22 to China's own economic troubles and a commodity price crash that has complicated African debt servicing.
China's interests in the Horn include its naval base in Djibouti, overlooking a key global shipping route. Beijing has granted large loans to landlocked Ethiopia, which relies on Djibouti's port for trade.

The region is also threatened by instability in South Sudan, where China has substantial oil investments, and spillover from Somalia that has brought deadly attacks in neighbouring Kenya.
After Kenya, Wang was due to travel to Comoros, an Indian Ocean archipelago. ""They (China) see the Indian Ocean as a contested space, so it's a priority,"" Olander said. ""Wang simply going to a tiny country like Comoros is symbolic in itself.""

(Reuters) - A legal battle over whether North Carolina's new congressional map illegally favors Republicans over Democrats is headed to a panel of judges, one of several lawsuits that could influence who controls Congress after this year's midterm elections.
Lawyers for Democratic voters and advocacy groups told a trio of state Superior Court judges in Raleigh on Thursday that the map, which the Republican-controlled legislature approved in November, effectively deprives Democratic voters of representation by ensuring Republicans will win a majority of seats under almost any circumstance.
But a lawyer for Republican lawmakers argued that the redistricting process was legal and transparent, and he contended that courts cannot reasonably determine when partisan considerations have crossed the line.
The judges are expected to issue a decision by Tuesday, after the four-day trial concluded on Thursday.
Electoral analysts say Republicans would be favored to win at least 10 of the state's 14 congressional seats under the new map, despite North Carolina's status as a closely divided swing state. Republicans currently hold eight of 13 districts; the state is gaining a seat as a result of population growth.
Republicans need to flip only a handful of seats in the Nov. 8 elections to retake control of the U.S. House of Representatives, where Democrats currently hold a 221-212 edge, including vacancies.
U.S. law requires states to redraw their congressional districts every 10 years using data from the U.S. Census to account for population changes. Many states give authority to lawmakers to create the maps, which can lead to gerrymandering, the process by which one political party manipulates district lines to entrench its own power.
There are more than a dozen pending lawsuits challenging congressional maps in at least six states including Texas, Ohio and Georgia, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.
The plaintiffs in North Carolina including the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters claim the new map is both racially discriminatory and illegally partisan in violation of the state constitution. The case also involves new maps for state legislative districts.
Experts for the plaintiffs testified that the Republican-drawn congressional map was an outlier when compared to thousands of computer-generated maps.
""This is the most extreme Republican gerrymander that's possible,"" said Elisabeth Theodore, a lawyer for some of the voter plaintiffs, said in her closing argument on Thursday. ""This map is deliberately designed to ignore the will of the people expressed through their votes.""
Phil Strach, an attorney for Republican legislators, argued that any map should be expected to favor Republicans, given that Democratic voters tend to cluster in urban areas. But he also questioned whether courts should even engage in the analysis the plaintiffs were requesting.

""What is the line between permissible and impermissible partisan considerations when drawing a map?"" he said. ""The fact is, that is an unanswerable question.""
The state Supreme Court moved North Carolina's scheduled primary election from March to May to allow the case to proceed. Whatever the decision, the case will likely end up in the high court after appeals.

(Reuters) -The more infectious Omicron variant of COVID-19 appears to produce less severe disease than the globally dominant Delta strain, but should not be categorised as ""mild"", World Health Organization (WHO) officials said on Thursday.
Janet Diaz, WHO lead on clinical management, said early studies showed there was a reduced risk of hospitalisation from the variant first identified in southern Africa and Hong Kong in November compared with Delta.
There appears also to be a reduced risk of severity in both younger and older people, she told a media briefing from WHO headquarters in Geneva.
The remarks on the reduced risks of severe disease chime with other data, including studies from South Africa and England, although she did not give further details about the studies or ages of the cases analysed.
The impact on the elderly is one of the big unanswered questions about the new variant as most of the cases studied so far have been in younger people.
""While Omicron does appear to be less severe compared to Delta, especially in those vaccinated, it does not mean it should be categorised as mild,"" director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at the same briefing in Geneva. 
""Just like previous variants, Omicron is hospitalising people and it is killing people."" 
He warned of a ""tsunami"" of cases as global infections soar to records fuelled by both Omicron and Delta, healthcare systems are overwhelmed, and governments struggle to tame the virus, which has killed more than 5.8 million people.
'BILLIONS COMPLETELY UNPROTECTED'
Tedros repeated his call for greater equity globally in the distribution of and access to vaccines.
Based on the current rate of vaccine rollout, 109 countries will miss the WHO's target for 70% of the world's population to be fully vaccinated by July, Tedros added. That aim is seen as helping end the acute phase of the pandemic.
""Booster after booster in a small number of countries will not end a pandemic while billions remain completely unprotected,"" he said.
WHO adviser Bruce Aylward said 36 nations had not even reached 10 percent vaccination cover. Among severe patients worldwide, 80% were unvaccinated, he added. 
In its weekly epidemiological report on Thursday, the WHO said cases increased by 71%, or 9.5 million, in the week to Jan. 2 from a week earlier, while deaths fell by 10%, or 41,000.

Another variant B.1.640 - first documented in multiple countries in September 2021 - is among those being monitored by the WHO but is not circulating widely, said the WHO's technical lead on COVID-19, Maria van Kerkhove.
There are two other categories of greater significance the WHO uses to track variants https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants: ""variant of concern"", which includes Delta and Omicron, and ""variant of interest"".

U.S. SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL
""January 6th, 2021, was a dark day for Congress and our country. The United States Capitol, the seat of the first branch of our federal government, was stormed by criminals who brutalized police officers and used force to try to stop Congress from doing its job. ...
""As I said yesterday, it has been stunning to see some Washington Democrats try to exploit this anniversary to advance partisan policy goals that long predated this event. It is especially jaw-dropping to hear some Senate Democrats invoke the mob's attempt to disrupt our country's norms, rules, and institutions as a justification to discard our norms, rules, and institutions themselves.""

REPUBLICAN U.S. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY, VICE CHAIR OF THE HOUSE JAN. 6 COMMITTEE

""One year ago, a violent attack on our Capitol made it clear just how fragile the American experiment in democracy really is. And while the broken windows have been repaired and many of the rioters have been brought to justice, the truth is that our democracy is at greater risk today than it was back then.
""Although initially rejected by many Republicans, the claims that fanned the flames of violence on January 6th have since been embraced by a sizeable portion of voters and elected officials – many of whom know better. ...
""Historically, Americans have been defenders of democracy and freedom around the world – especially when it’s under attack. But we can’t serve that role when leading figures in one of our two major political parties are actively undermining democracy at home.

Johnson's redecoration of his Downing Street residence has come under intense scrutiny, both for how much it cost and who paid for it. It is just one of several scandals to have dogged the prime minister at the end of last year.
The redecoration by high-profile London interior designer Lulu Lytle has not been seen publicly, but has been described in media reports as involving expensive gold wallpaper and garish furniture.
A donor initially paid tens of thousands of pounds of invoices, and Johnson later repaid the donor after he became aware of the arrangement through media reports. 
While Johnson has been cleared of breaking the rules, the episode has been used by critics to question his ethics, adding to a list of other incidents which have put Johnson's judgment in the spotlight. Opposition politicians have accused him of running a corrupt government that hands out favours to cronies. He denies this.
In a letter to Christopher Geidt, the independent adviser on ministers' interests, Johnson said he could not personally recall the exchange and ""security issues"" meant he had not been able to access an old device.
""I am sorry that the Office of the Independent Adviser has been put in this position and can only repeat the humble and sincere apology I gave when we discussed this matter earlier today,"" he wrote in a Dec. 21 letter published on Thursday. 
The so-called 'missing exchange' came to light in a separate investigation by the electoral watchdog. The watchdog fined Johnson's Conservative Party over incorrectly declared donations which helped fund the flat refurbishment.
Geidt said in a Dec. 17 letter that after reviewing the message exchange, he had not changed his initial conclusion, published in May, which cleared Johnson of a conflict of interest but criticised him for not scrutinising the funding.

Geidt added more general criticism in the letters published on Thursday, singling out the processes that meant he had not seen the messages and saying that withholding information from him for any reason was unwise.
""The episode shook my confidence precisely because potential and real failures of process occurred in more than one part of the apparatus of government,"" he said in a separate reply to Johnson dated Dec. 23.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - The resignation of Sudan's prime minister puts the military firmly back in control of the country but facing a population angry that its hopes for democratic rule have been set back yet again.
Unless a new course towards a transition and credible elections can be charted, more instability within and beyond Sudanese borders is likely, analysts and diplomats say.
After his government was dissolved in a coup in October, Abdalla Hamdok https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/sudans-abdalla-hamdok-2022-01-02 had returned in a bid to salvage a transitional power-sharing arrangement between the military and civilians that was struck following Omar al-Bashir's overthrow in a 2019 uprising. The autocratic Bashir had ruled Sudan for three decades. 
Hamdok departs leaving the country cut off from international economic support https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/exclusive-sudan-cut-off-650-million-international-funding-after-coup-2021-12-08, jolted by frequent anti-military protests, and threatened by resurgent violence https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/aid-groups-warn-rise-darfur-violence-dozens-killed-kreinik-2021-12-09 and displacement in the western region of Darfur. 
His efforts towards a transition fell apart due to the withdrawal of promised support from some political factions and his inability to halt violence against protesters, said a Sudanese mediator involved in talks before and after Hamdok's return.
Most of the fractured civilian coalition that agreed to share power based on a 2019 constitutional declaration says publicly that it will not negotiate with the military.
""The only thing we have to say to them is go back to your barracks,"" said a member of a local resistance committee in Khartoum.
That could leave the military to appoint loyalists to a new administration, building on nominations of Bashir era veterans https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/sudans-military-rulers-draw-bashir-era-veterans-tighten-grip-2021-11-11 that it made after its takeover and that Hamdok partially rolled back.
""The military will name a government unless the civilians get it together and meet with them,"" said the mediator, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""I think in the end people will sit together, and go back to the constitutional declaration, and see how they can adjust it.""
The military said after the coup that it wanted elections in 2023. It says it is committed to a transition towards democracy.
But the takeover deepened distrust of the military among civilian parties, while the protest movement led by the resistance committees has always opposed any political role for the army.
A crackdown on nationwide rallies against the coup that has left nearly 60 people dead and protesters arrested has sharpened anger. Intelligence services have been given restored powers.
FOREIGN FUNDING ON HOLD
Western powers, which still hold some leverage because of several billion dollars of economic assistance paused after the coup, are trying to steer the military away from pressing ahead on its own. 
They urged immediate dialogue https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/us-europeans-warn-sudans-military-against-excluding-civilians-transition-2022-01-04 on Tuesday, warning they would not support any government without the involvement of a broad range of civilian groups. A unilateral approach risked plunging Sudan into renewed conflict, they said.
""The military cares very much because they know that the country will not continue without economic support,"" said one European diplomat. ""If Sudan implodes, that has serious ramifications in a lot of geostrategic issues,"" he said, citing instability in neighbouring Ethiopia and Libya. 
The United Nations mission in Sudan has offered to facilitate dialogue, though diplomats say it remains unclear how such talks could take shape and that powers such as Saudi Arabia or the United States may need to step in. 
""I think certainly trying to reset the transition in the mould that it existed beforehand is unlikely to work now,"" said Ahmed Soliman, a research fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think-tank. 
""There needs to be a different arrangement, a different political way forward in order to start to reestablish some measure of trust."" 
Reaching a deal that sets a new path towards democratic elections appears harder than in 2019, several Western diplomats said. But the exit of Hamdok, a consensus-building former U.N. official, could clear the way for a reckoning. 

""Some viewed Hamdok remaining in the post as a fig leaf, and his resignation may allow for a more substantial conversation among the international community, and it also pushes the civilian groupings to seek common ground,"" said Lauren Blanchard, a Sudan specialist at the U.S. Congressional Research Service.
""It makes clear that a mediation mechanism is needed. Hamdok wasn't able to bridge the gap.""

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain warned Moscow on Thursday that it was working with Western partners on high-impact sanctions targetting Russia's financial sector should it invade Ukraine. 
Russia has massed some 100,000 troops near Ukraine's border and though Moscow says it has no plans to invade its neighbour, President Vladimir Putin has demanded legally-binding guarantees that NATO will not expand further eastwards.
""We will not accept the campaign Russia is waging to subvert its democratic neighbours,"" Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told parliament. ""They have falsely cast Ukraine as a threat to justify their aggressive stance.""
""Russia is the aggressor here,"" Truss said. ""NATO has always been a defensive alliance.""
Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, drawing sanctions and condemnation from the West. Kyiv wants the territory back.
Truss said that any further military incursion into Ukraine by Russia would bring ""massive consequences, including coordinated sanctions to impose a severe cost on Russia's interests and economy."" 
""The UK is working with our partners on these sanctions, including high impact measures targeting the Russian financial sector and individuals,"" Truss said. 
Putin says NATO's expansion eastwards since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union is a threat to Russia which, he says, has nowhere left to retreat to. He has warned the West against ignoring his concerns. 
Truss said she would visit Kyiv later this month and that the situation was reaching a crucial moment with only one way forward: for Putin to step back from the brink.
""It's vital that NATO is united in pushing back against Russia threatening behaviour,"" Truss said. 

Britain, Truss said, was opposed to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline under the Baltic Sea.
""Europe must reduce its dependence on Russian gas,"" Truss said. ""Britain remains opposed to Nord Stream 2 and I'm working with allies and partners to highlight the strategic risks of this project.""

PARIS (Reuters) -France's parliament on Thursday approved President Emmanuel Macron's plans for a vaccine pass to help curb the spread of the Omicron variant after a tumultuous debate whipped up by Macron's comments that he wanted to ""piss off"" the unvaccinated.
Macron told Le Parisien newspaper earlier this week that he wanted to make the lives of those refusing the COVID-19 vaccine so complicated by squeezing them out of public places that they would end up getting jabbed.
Macron's coarse language barely three months before a presidential election was widely seen as a politically calculated, tapping into a intensifying public frustration against the unvaccinated. 
More than 90% of over-12s have received at least two doses, government data shows. Health Minister Olivier Veran said a record number of people since Oct. 1 received a first shot on Wednesday after Macron's comments were published.
Lawmakers in the lower house passed draft legislation including the vaccine pass shortly after 5 a.m. after an all-night session by a margin of 214 to 93. Many of those who voted against the bill were from the far-right or left-wingers.
The legislation will go to the Senate before a final vote in the National Assembly.
People in France have for several months had to show either proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test to enter venues such as cinemas and cafes and use trains. But with Delta and Omicron variant infections surging, the government decided to drop the test option in the new bill.
The vaccine pass rules will apply to over-16s and not over-12 as the government had initially sought.
European countries have been grappling with whether to coerce citizens into getting vaccinated through mandates. Italy on Wednesday made COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for people from the age of 50, with teachers and public health workers already obliged to get the shot.
Prime Minister Jean Castex said countries that had moved towards compulsory vaccinations such as Italy and Austria had lower vaccination rates than France.

Castex also said France was ready to move towards a fourth COVID shot when the time was right.
On Wednesday, France registered a record of more than 332,000 new COVID-19 cases in the last 24 hours, and a further 246 COVID deaths in hospitals, as the country.

(Reuters) - A year after a mob of Donald Trump's supporters assaulted the U.S. Capitol in a failed bid to overturn his 2020 election defeat, the Republican former president continues to repeat false claims blaming widespread voting fraud for his loss to Democrat Joe Biden.
Those claims have been rejected by courts, state governments and members of his own former administration. Trump and his supporters also have sought to play down or deny the violence that unfolded at the seat of the U.S. Congress on Jan. 6, 2021.
Here are some examples of the repudiation of Trump's false claims by state and federal officials.
FEDERAL AGENCIES
The top U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies have concluded that there was no widespread voter fraud in the Nov. 3, 2020, presidential election.
Former U.S. Attorney General William Barr, the nation's top law enforcement official under Trump, said https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-biden/barr-sees-no-sign-of-major-u-s-vote-fraud-despite-trumps-claims-idUSKBN28B5UK on Dec. 1, 2020, that he had not seen any evidence of fraud that would have changed the election results.
Barr was more pointed in a later interview https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/06/william-barrs-trump-administration-attorney-general/619298/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AtlanticPoliticsChannel+%28The+Atlantic+-+Politics%29 with journalist Jonathan Karl for Karl's book ""Betrayal: The Final Act of the Trump Show.""
""If there was evidence of fraud, I had no motive to suppress it,"" Barr told Karl. ""But my suspicion all the way along was that there was nothing there. It was all bullshit.""
The 2020 presidential election was the most secure in American history, according to a statement https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/11/12/joint-statement-elections-infrastructure-government-coordinating-council-election issued by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, on Nov. 12, 2020.
""There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised,"" the statement read.
COURT CASES
State and federal judges dismissed more than 50 lawsuits brought by Trump and his allies challenging the election.
Several judges, including Trump appointees, noted a lack of evidence of fraudulently cast votes.
U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann, a conservative jurist in Pennsylvania, issued a decision https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-pennsylvania/u-s-judge-calls-trump-claim-challenging-biden-win-in-pennsylvania-frankensteins-monster-idUSKBN2810WR on Nov. 21, 2020, that dismissed the Trump campaign's effort to block the certification of Biden's victory in the key election battleground state.
""One might expect that when seeking such a startling outcome, a plaintiff would come formidably armed with compelling legal arguments and factual proof of rampant corruption,"" Brann wrote. ""Instead, this Court has been presented with strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations.""
Of one of the assertions made by Trump campaign, Brann wrote: ""This claim, like Frankenstein's Monster, has been haphazardly stitched together.""
A Trump appointee in Milwaukee, U.S. District Judge Brett Ludwig, similarly rebuked https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election/trump-castigates-supreme-court-barr-as-election-challenges-sputter-idUSKBN28M0T7 a Trump campaign lawsuit contesting the election results in that state.
Unlike other judges who dismissed cases on procedural grounds, Ludwig provided the Trump campaign with a day-long hearing to consider evidence that Wisconsin's election rules were violated. Ludwig found that evidence woefully lacking.
""This court has allowed the plaintiff the chance to make his case and he has lost on the merits,"" Ludwig wrote.
STATE AUDITS
In Georgia, an election battleground state won narrowly by Biden, a post-election audit was conducted by Brad Raffensperger, a Republican who was the state's top election official.
""The audit confirmed that the original machine count accurately portrayed the winner of the election,"" Raffensperger's office said https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-election-georgia/georgia-confirms-bidens-victory-in-state-as-it-completes-hand-audit-of-ballots-idUKKBN280014 on Nov. 19, 2020.
In Arizona, a review https://www.reuters.com/world/us/arizona-republicans-release-findings-widely-panned-election-audit-2021-09-24 of results by Trump allies in its most populous county reaffirmed Biden's victory in the crucial state.
Arizona Senate President Karen Fann, a Republican who paved the way for the ""full forensic audit"" of 2.1 million ballots in Maricopa County, said in September that the review's overall vote tally matched the initial results in November.
THE RIOT
Federal judges have similarly criticized Trump and Republican lawmakers for seeking to downplay the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol.
""I'm especially troubled by the accounts of some members of Congress that Jan. 6 was just a day of tourists walking through the Capitol,"" U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said https://www.reuters.com/world/us/what-planet-are-they-judge-blasts-republicans-downplaying-attack-us-capitol-2021-06-23 during a June court hearing. ""I don't know what planet these people are on.""
""The rioters were not mere protesters,"" Beryl Howell, the chief judge of the federal district court in Washington, said in October, adding that on the day of the riot there was ""shocking criminal conduct that represented a grave threat to our democratic norms.""

According to the Justice Department, about 140 police officers were injured while defending the Capitol.
Federal prosecutors have charged more than 725 people with various crimes arising from the Capitol riot. Of those arrested, 225 people were charged with assault or resisting arrest. More than 75 of those were charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon against police officers.

375,"<span>Jan 06, 2022 05:12AM ET</span>",,,,,,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) -Japan and Australia hailed on Thursday a new agreement to cooperate closely on defence as a breakthrough and a landmark, in the latest step to bolster security ties against the backdrop of rising Chinese military and economic might.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison held a virtual summit to seal a pact that has been in the works for several years.
Australia has been working with Japan, India, the United States and Britain to strengthen defence ties amid concerns about China, including its pressure on Taiwan, freedom of navigation in the region and trade disputes.
The Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA), Japan's first with any country, will allow the Australian and Japanese militaries to work seamlessly with each other on defence and humanitarian operations, Morrison said.
""Japan is our closest partner in Asia as demonstrated by our special strategic partnership, Australia's only such partnership - an equal partnership of shared trust between two great democracies committed to the rule of law, human rights, free trade and a free and open Indo-Pacific,"" Morrison said at a signing ceremony.
""The RAA is a landmark treaty which opens a new chapter for advanced defence and security co-operation of what is a complex and rapidly changing world, something you and I both understand very well,"" Morrison told the Japanese leader.
Kishida called the agreement a ""breakthrough"" and said ties with Australia would remain a model for security cooperation with other countries, a Japanese foreign ministry official told a media briefing.
Kishida and Morrison agreed that the two sides would work to update a 2007 Japan-Australia Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation as soon as possible to set a clear direction for their ties, the official said.
The summit comes as tension over Chinese-claimed Taiwan has been rising as President Xi Jinping seeks to assert China's sovereignty claims over the democratically ruled island.
Kishida and Morrison underscored the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and encouraged the peaceful resolution of issues, according to a joint statement issued after the summit. 
Before the meeting, Morrison said stronger ties with Japan were needed ""to deal with a new and even more challenging environment, particularly within the Indo-Pacific"".

Japan has a status of forces agreement with the United States, which allows the United States to base warships, fighter jets and thousands of troops in and around Japan as part of an alliance that Washington describes as the bedrock of regional security. 
Kishida had been due to travel to Australia on Thursday but scrapped the trip to tackle a surge in COVID-19 cases in Japan.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea fired a ""hypersonic missile"" this week that successfully hit a target, state news agency KCNA reported on Thursday, its second such test as the country pursues new military capabilities amid stalled denuclearisation talks.
The launch on Wednesday was the first by North Korea since October and was detected by several militaries in the region, drawing criticism from governments in the United States, South Korea, and Japan.
North Korea first tested a hypersonic missile in September, joining a race headed by major military powers to deploy the advanced weapons system.
Hypersonic weapons usually fly towards targets at lower altitudes than ballistic missiles and can achieve more than five times the speed of sound - or about 6,200 kms per hour (3,850 mph).
Despite their name, analysts say the main feature of hypersonic weapons is not speed - which can sometimes be matched or exceeded by traditional ballistic missile warheads - but their manoeuvrability.
In Wednesday's test, the ""hypersonic gliding warhead"" detached from its rocket booster and manoeuvred 120 kms (75 miles) laterally before it ""precisely hit"" a target 700 kms (430 miles) away, KCNA reported. 
The missile demonstrated its ability to combine ""multi-step glide jump flight and strong lateral manoeuvring"", KCNA said.
The test also confirmed components such as flight control and its ability to operate in the winter, KCNA added.
""The successive successes in the test launches in the hypersonic missile sector have strategic significance in that they hasten a task for modernizing strategic armed force of the state,"" the KCNA report said.
While it has not tested nuclear bombs or long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) since 2017, in recent years North Korea has developed and launched a range of more manoeuvrable missiles and warheads likely aimed at being able to overcome missile defences like those wielded by South Korea and the United States, analysts have said.
""My impression is that the North Koreans have identified hypersonic gliders as a potentially useful qualitative means to cope with missile defence,"" said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
NEW MISSILE
Hypersonic weapons are considered the next generation of arms that aim to rob adversaries of reaction time and traditional defeat mechanisms.
Last month the United States completed construction of a massive, $1.5 billion long-range radar for a homeland missile defence system in Alaska that it says can track ballistic missiles as well as hypersonic weapons from countries such as North Korea.
Photos of the missile used in Wednesday's test show what analysts said is a liquid-fueled ballistic missile with a conical-shaped Manoeuvrable Reentry Vehicle (MaRV) blasting off from a wheeled launch vehicle in a cloud of flame and smoke.
It is a different version than the weapon tested last year, and was first unveiled at a defence exhibition in Pyongyang in October, Panda said.
""They likely set up at least two separate development programmes,"" he added. ""One of these was the Hwasong-8, which was tested in September. This missile, which shares a few features in common with the Hwasong-8, is another."" 
In a call with Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned the North Korea missile launch and discussed cooperation to achieve complete denuclearization and lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, the U.S. State Department said in a statement.
""We take any new capability seriously, and as we've said, we condemn (North Korea's) continued testing of ballistic missiles, which are destabilizing to the region and to the international community,"" a State Department spokesperson said later.
Talks aimed at persuading North Korea to surrender its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile arsenal have been stalled since a series of summits between leader Kim Jong Un and then-U.S. President Donald Trump broke down with no agreement.
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has said it is open to talking to North Korea, but Pyongyang has said American overtures are empty rhetoric without more substantive changes to ""hostile policies"" such as military drills and sanctions.

The latest test came just hours before South Korean President Moon Jae-in attended a groundbreaking ceremony for a rail line he hopes will eventually connect the divided Korean peninsula, casting doubts over his hopes for an eleventh-hour diplomatic breakthrough with North Korea before his five-year term ends in May.
""We hope that all sides ... speak and act cautiously, persist in the correct direction of dialogue and consultation, and together work towards moving forward the political settlement of the peninsular question,"" China's foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a daily briefing on Thursday.

CHIAYI, Taiwan (Reuters) - Taiwan air force jets screamed into the sky on Wednesday in a drill simulating a war scenario, showing its combat readiness amid heightened military tensions with China, which claims the island as its own.
Before takeoff, flight crews at a base in the southern city of Chiayi - home to U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets that are frequently scrambled to intercept Chinese warplanes - rushed to ready aircraft as an alarm sounded.
The exercises were part of a three-day drill to show Taiwan's battle readiness ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday at the end of this month.
Tensions across the sensitive Taiwan Strait have been rising in the past few years, with Taiwan complaining of repeated missions by China's air force near the democratic island.
Chinese military aircraft frequently fly into the southwestern part of its air defence identification zone (ADIZ), airspace around the island that Taiwan monitors and patrols.
""With the very high frequency of Communist planes entering our ADIZ, pilots from our wing are very experienced and have dealt with almost all types of their aircraft,"" Major Yen Hsiang-sheng told reporters, recalling a mission in which he was dispatched to intercept Chinese J-16 fighters late last year.
China has not ruled out using force to bring Taiwan under its control. 

Taiwan has termed China's activities as ""grey zone"" warfare, designed to both wear out Taiwan's forces by making them repeatedly scramble, and also to test its responses.
In a new year message for China last week, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said military conflict is not the answer. Beijing responded with a stern warning that if Taiwan crossed any red line it would lead to ""profound catastrophe"".

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the two leaders will sign a Reciprocal Access Agreement, which will for the first time set out a framework for the two countries' defence forces to cooperate with each other.
""This treaty will be a statement of our two nations’ commitment to work together in meeting the shared strategic security challenges we face and to contribute to a secure and stable Indo-Pacific,"" Morrison said in a statement on Wednesday.
The strengthened security ties expand on efforts by the United States, Japan, India and Australia - dubbed the Quad - to work on shared concerns about China, including its pressure on Taiwan, trade disputes, and freedom of navigation in the region.
China responded by saying that bilateral treaties should promote regional trust, peace and stability.
""It should not target or harm any third party interests,"" said China's foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin, at a daily news briefing on Wednesday, when asked about the treaty.
Australia and Japan also plan to discuss opportunities to strengthen government and business partnerships on clean energy, critical technologies and materials.
""Our cooperation also includes an expanding agenda for the Quad with India and the United States, and our shared technology-led approach to reducing carbon emissions,"" Morrison said.
Japan's top government spokesman said ""common important challenges will be discussed in a candid manner"" at the summit.

""Japan-Australia relations will be further enhanced, and towards the realisation of a free and open Indo-Pacific, we will reaffirm our cooperation,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters on Wednesday.
Kishida said on Tuesday he would forgo overseas visits before the next session of parliament starts on Jan. 17 to focus on laying out anti-pandemic measures. He had previously planned to travel to Australia in person, according to media reports.

(Reuters) - Election officials in Arizona's most populous county found nearly every conclusion in a partisan ""audit"" of Donald Trump's loss in the 2020 presidential election to be misleading or false, according to an official rebuttal released on Wednesday.
The Maricopa County Elections Department's 93-page report is an attempt to address dozens of claims made by Trump's allies in the Republican Party in their so-called ""full forensic audit"" aimed at casting doubt on his defeat in the battleground state.
While last year's Republican-led review had already been widely discredited by election experts as biased and procedurally flawed, the report, titled ""Correcting The Record,"" marked the first detailed response by county officials.
""We determined that nearly every finding included faulty analysis, inaccurate claims, misleading conclusions and a lack of understanding of federal and state election laws,"" the report says of the audit, which Arizona Republican senators contracted out to a private company called Cyber Ninjas. 
According to the report, the county analysis identified 22 claims that were misleading, 41 that included flawed or misstated analysis and 13 that were demonstrably false.
President Joe Biden, a Democrat, carried Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, by about 45,000 votes, making it critical to his narrow win over Trump in November 2020. Biden's victory was confirmed by a hand recount and multiple post-election tests for accuracy. No evidence has emerged of the widespread fraud that Trump and his allies falsely alleged. 
Led by Arizona Senate President Karen Fann, Republicans nevertheless pushed for a comprehensive review of the election, including a hand recount and examination of tabulation equipment. They released a final report in September that found a vote tally largely matching the official results, although they made several claims of alleged anomalies.
For example, the Cyber Ninjas used information from a third-party commercial database to claim that some 33,000 people may have voted illegally because they moved prior to the election and no longer lived at the address on file with the county.
According to the county's report, Cyber Ninjas flagged problems by using ""soft match"" methods that relied on basic data points such as first name, last name, and birth year, leading to the misidentification of people as illegally casting votes.
""Our review did not find any voter ineligible to vote from their residential address during the November 2020 General Election and found no evidence of double voting,"" the report said.

The partisan audit in Arizona was part of a larger effort by Republicans to undermine faith in the 2020 election and gain more control over the voting process. Since the election, several Republican-controlled state legislatures have passed laws curbing ballot access or placing great power over election administration in the hands of partisan officials.
Maricopa County election officials are scheduled to detail the findings of their report at a public meeting on Wednesday of the county Board of Supervisors.

380,"<span>Jan 05, 2022 11:06PM ET</span>",,,,,,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Novak Djokovic was left stranded at a Melbourne airport overnight, caught in a internatonal political maelstrom over whether Australia would honour the World No. 1's medical exemption from vaccine requirements or send him home due to a visa blunder. 
Djokovic, who is seeking a record-breaking 21st Grand Slam win at the Australian Open, touched down at Melbourne's Tullamarine airport Wednesday about 11:30 p.m. local time after a 14-hour flight from Dubai.
But he was still awaiting permission early Thursday morning to enter the country after it emerged that his team had applied for a visa that does not allow for medical exemptions.
That prompted the local government of Victoria, the state where the Open is played, to say it would not support Djokovic's application, putting his fate in the hands of the federal government and Prime Minister Scott Morrison.
The extraordinary move by the Australian government to potentially block Djokovic from entering the country because of a mistake on his visa form threatened to cause a diplomatic incident between Canberra and Belgrade.
""I've just finished my telephone conversation with Novak Djokovic,"" Serbian president Aleksandar Vucic posted on Instagram. ""I told our Novak that the whole of Serbia is with him and that our bodies are doing everything to see that the harassment of the world's best tennis player is brought to an end immediately. 
""In line with all norms of international law, Serbia will fight for Novak, truth and justice. Novak is strong, as we all know.""
Vucic had summoned the Australian ambassador in Belgrade and demanded that they immediately release Djokovic to play, Serbian media reported. 
Djokovic's father Srdjan said that his son was waiting alone in a room at the airport under armed guard for a final decision on whether he could enter the country.
""I have no clue what's going on, they’ve kept my son in captivity for five hours now,"" Srdjan told the Serbian online version of Sputnik. ""If they don't let him go in half a hour, we'll gather in the streets, this is a battle for everyone.""
""Not the most usual trip from Down Under,"" coach Goran Ivanisevic commented beside an Instagram selfie from the airport lounge, accompanied by face-palm and mind-blown emojis.
Morrison has faced an enormous backlash over his government's decision to grant Djokovic a medical exemption from vaccination to play at the Open, leading to fingerpointing between the Prime Minister's conservative administration and the left-leaning Victorian government led by premier Dan Andrews.
Australia, especially the state of Victoria, has endured the world's longest cumulative lockdown and an outbreak of the Omicron variant has sent case numbers to record levels.
Following the backlash, Morrison suggested Djokovic's participation was not a done deal and he would have to satisfy the federal government, which has responsibility for international borders and visas and was not part of the exemption process.
Morrison said shortly before Djokovic's arrival that there would be ""no special rules"" for him on his exemption.
""If that evidence is insufficient, then he won't be treated any different to anyone else and he'll be on the next plane home,"" Morrison told a media conference earlier.
VISA BUNGLE
Djokovic came in on an Emirates flight but when border officials contacted the Victorian government to ask if the state would formally support the world number one's visa, it said it would not. 
""The Federal Government has asked if we will support Novak Djokovic's visa application to enter Australia,"" Victoria's acting Sports Minister Jaala Pulford said. 
""We will not be providing Novak Djokovic with individual visa application support to participate in the 2022 Australian Open Grand Slam.
""We've always been clear on two points: visa approvals are a matter for the Federal Government, and medical exemptions are a matter for doctors."" 
It was not clear whether the federal government would allow his entry. The Border Force did not respond to a request for comment.
Tennis Australia and government officials moved quickly to stress that Djokovic had received no preferential treatment. 
ANGRY AUSSIES
The Serbian, who has previously declined to reveal his vaccination status, has won nine titles at Melbourne Park including the last three. He confirmed on Tuesday that had received a vaccination exemption to allow him to play at the Australian Open, which starts on Jan. 17.
Australian tennis great Rod Laver, after whom the main showcourt at Melbourne Park in the state of Victoria is named, warned that Djokovic might face hostility from the local crowd.
""I think it might get ugly,"" Laver told News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA). ""I'd think the Victorian people would be thinking 'Yes I'd love to see him play and compete, but at the same time there's a right way and a wrong way.'
""Yes, you're a great player and you've performed and won so many tournaments, so it can't be physical. So what is the problem?""

Melbourne local Christine Wharton said it was a ""disgrace"".
""We've all done the right thing, we've all gone out and got our jabs and our boosters, and we have someone that's come from overseas and all of a sudden he's been exempt and can play, and I think it's an absolute disgrace and I won't be watching it.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday began returning migrants to the Mexican city of Tijuana in an restart of a Trump-era program that forces asylum seekers to wait for U.S. court hearings in Mexico, Mexican authorities and the U.N. migration agency said.
The United States and Mexico last month agreed to relaunch the controversial scheme known as Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), in keeping with a U.S. federal court order.
U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, has struggled to reverse many hardline immigration policies put in place by his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump.
Biden ended MPP soon after his inauguration in January as he sought to pursue what he called a more humane approach to immigration. But a federal judge ruled Biden's move did not follow proper procedure, and in August ordered MPP reinstated.
The program first resumed in December at the international crossing connecting El Paso, Texas, to Ciudad Juarez. More than 200 people have been returned to Mexico so far under the relaunch of MPP, according to the U.N.'s International Organization of Migration (OIM).
Two migrants were returned to Tijuana, across from California, on Wednesday with future appointments in U.S. courts, an official with OIM told Reuters.
The migrant rights advocacy group Al Otro Lado told Reuters the two men were Colombian nationals.
Neither U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) nor Mexico's immigration agency immediately responded to requests for comment.

The United Nations' refugee agency and advocacy groups have criticized the restart of the Trump-era policy, warning migrants face the risk of kidnapping, rape, and extortion in dangerous Mexican border towns.
Under the original 2019 program, some 70,000 migrants seeking asylum were forced to wait weeks and sometimes years in Mexico for a U.S. court date instead of being allowed to await their hearings in the United States.

(Reuters) - Lawrence Brooks, the oldest surviving U.S. veteran who served in World War Two and was referred to by President Joe Biden as ""truly the best of America"", died on Wednesday at the age of 112.
His death was announced by the National WWII Museum. The museum's statement did not mention the cause of the death.
Brooks, an African-American, was drafted into the U.S. Army at the age of 31 and spent World War Two in the predominantly African-American 91st Engineer Battalion. He was stationed in Australia, New Guinea, and the Philippines.
Classified as service personnel, he cleaned and cooked for three of the battalion's white officers and attained the rank of Private 1st Class, the National WWII Museum said.
""As the nation’s oldest known living veteran, he proudly served our country during World War II, and returned home to serve his community and church"", said Stephen Watson, the museum's president.
His wife, Leona, died in November 2008, and he is survived by five children, 13 grandchildren, and 32 great-grandchildren.
""I had the honor of speaking with him last year, and he was truly the best of America. I’m keeping his loved ones in my prayers"", Biden said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
During World War Two, the U.S. military was still segregated by race. Recalling that era, Brooks once said he felt he was treated much better in Australia than he was in the United States.
""I was treated so much better in Australia than I was by my own white people. I wondered about that"", he was quoted as saying by the museum.
Of the 16 million U.S. veterans who fought in World War Two, about 240,000 remained alive as of Sept. 2021, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs.
The museum said that while Brooks remained proud of his military service, his memories of those days were mixed. 
""I had some good times, and I had some bad times,"" Brooks once said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Wednesday vowed to hold accountable anyone involved in last year's deadly Capitol attack by former President Donald Trump's supporters and said the Justice Department's work on the matter is far from done.
In a speech a day before the one-year anniversary of the violence, Garland appeared to address criticism by some Democrats who want his department to act more aggressively against those responsible for the attack on Jan. 6, 2021, that sought to overturn Trump's 2020 election loss.
The department has charged more than 725 people with crimes arising from the riot ranging from disorderly conduct to assaulting police to conspiracy. Of those people, about 165 have pleaded guilty and at least 70 have been sentenced.
""The Justice Department remains committed to holding all January 6th perpetrators, at any level, accountable under law - whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy,"" Garland said at the Justice Department's headquarters.
""We will follow the facts wherever they lead,"" added Garland, the top U.S. law enforcement official.
A mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a failed bid to derail the formal congressional certification of his 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden.
The sprawling investigation is one of the largest and most complex in the FBI's history. The Justice Department has issued more than 5,000 subpoenas, seized about 2,000 electronic devices and reviewed more than 20,000 hours of video footage, Garland said, and its work is ongoing. 
""I understand that this may not be the answer some are looking for,"" Garland said. ""But we will and we must speak through our work. Anything else jeopardizes the viability of our investigations and the civil liberties of our citizens.""
High-profile criminal cases brought so far include several against members or associates of far-right groups such as the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers and the Three Percenters.
A Democratic-led House of Representatives select committee separately is investigating the attack. Steve Bannon, Trump's former White House chief strategist, has been charged by the Justice Department with contempt of Congress for refusing to appear for a deposition and refusing to produce documents sought by the House committee. Bannon pleaded not guilty.
""I think Merrick Garland has been extremely weak, and I think there should be a lot more of the organizers of Jan. 6 that should be arrested by now,"" Democratic U.S. congressman Ruben Gallego told CNN on Tuesday.

Garland reiterated the department's commitment to investigating threats of violence that have been directed toward election workers, lawmakers, judges, airline crews, school board officials and journalists. Garland said threats of violence ""are permeating so many parts of our national life that they risk becoming normalized.""
""Some have been told that their offices would be bombed. Some have been told that they would be murdered, and precisely how - that they would be hanged, that they would be beheaded,"" Garland added.

NEW ORLEANS (Reuters -Louisiana's governor on Wednesday posthumously pardoned Homer Plessy, the plaintiff in the landmark 1896 U.S. Supreme Court case that upheld the ""separate but equal"" doctrine and laid the legal foundation for decades of racial segregation.
Governor John Bel Edwards, who signed the pardon at a ceremony in New Orleans near the spot where Plessy was arrested in 1892 for riding a whites-only train car, traced a line from the historic case to racial inequities in U.S. society today. 
""The stroke of my pen on this pardon, while momentous, it doesn't erase generations of pain and discrimination,"" Bel Edwards said. ""We can all acknowledge we have a long ways to go, but this pardon is a step in the right direction.""
The official act follows a state board's unanimous decision in November to recommend a pardon of Plessy, who deliberately sat in a whites-only rail car to test a Jim Crow-era law aimed at marginalizing him and other Black citizens after the Civil War.
Plessy, a shoemaker who was active in a civil rights group, was immediately arrested. His case was heard in Louisiana by Judge John Howard Ferguson, who ruled against Plessy, setting off a chain of events that led to the 1896 Supreme Court case.
Descendants of the Plessy and Ferguson families were at the event. Plessy, who was 30 years old at the time of his arrest, pleaded guilty in 1897 following the Supreme Court ruling and paid a $25 fine. He died in 1925.
""I feel like my feet are not touching the ground today because the ancestors are carrying me,"" said Keith Plessy, a first cousin three times removed from Plessy. ""Homer Plessy will have his way today.""
In the Plessy vs. Ferguson case, the Supreme Court judges ruled that separate public facilities could be provided to different racial groups as long as they were of equal quality.
The ruling provided the legal basis for segregating schools and other public facilities and held until the Supreme Court's decision in a 1954 case known as Brown v. Board of Education, which started the process of ending racial segregation.
Governor Bel Edwards and other speakers at the event said the pardon highlighted the importance of acknowledging and educating the public about past injustices rather than promoting a sanitized version of history.

In some U.S. school districts, conservatives have sought to ban teaching of concepts from critical race theory, an academic framework that examines how racism has shaped American society.
""We cannot undo the wrongs of the past but we can and should acknowledge them and learn from them,"" said Phoebe Ferguson, a descendant of Judge Ferguson.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and Germany's top diplomats on Wednesday reiterated that they would impose consequences on Russia for an invasion of Ukraine, with German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stressing the need for a diplomatic solution to heightened tensions between Moscow and the West.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his newly installed German counterpart met at the State Department ahead of a series of meetings https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/nato-head-convenes-council-with-russia-jan-12-2022-01-04 with Russian officials in Europe next week.
Alarmed by Russia's military buildup along Ukraine's border, Washington has rallied European allies to threaten Russia with sanctions to try to de-escalate the tensions.
""Strong trans-Atlantic solidarity is the most effective response and most effective tool that we have in countering Russian aggression,"" Blinken said, repeating a pledge https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/blinken-warns-high-impact-economic-steps-if-russia-invades-ukraine-2021-12-01 to go further than any previous sanctions against Russia and ""inflict very significant costs on Russia's economy and financial system"" in the event Russia invades Ukraine.
Baerbock said Russia was aware it was the ""common position"" of Europe and the United States to impose ""severe consequences"" in the event of an invasion, but did not specify what sanctions action Germany would take.
""There is no alternative to a political solution. This has to be clear to the Russian government,"" Baerbock said, according to a live interpretation of her comments following her meeting with Blinken.
Ukraine accuses Russia of massing around 100,000 troops in preparation for a possible invasion, raising fears that a simmering conflict in Ukraine's eastern Donbass region could erupt into open war between the neighboring former Soviet republics.
U.S. President Joe Biden has promised to continue providing military aid to Ukraine to defend itself against potential Russian aggression. 
Baerbock said Germany had a ""different position"" to the United States on the supply of arms to Ukraine, but was supporting Ukraine's armed forces through medical supplies and helping in the treatment of Ukrainian soldiers wounded in the conflict.
Blinken and Baerbock said they also discussed the Russian-backed Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would provide natural gas to Germany, bypassing existing transit routes through Ukraine. 

Baerbock said the new coalition government that took power in Berlin last month supported a joint statement https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-germany-deal-nord-stream-2-pipeline-draws-ire-lawmakers-both-countries-2021-07-21 signed with Washington by its predecessors in July.

U.S. delegations will raise concerns with Russia's security actions in Europe during the talks next week, Psaki told reporters.
U.S. officials are joining three sets of talks next week involving Russia as Washington tries to dissuade Moscow from invading Ukraine after massing tens of thousands of troops along its border. The first is on Monday in Geneva, with the U.S. represented by Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman.
A NATO-Russia Council meeting will be held in Brussels on Jan. 12 and a third meeting will take place Jan. 13 in Vienna involving the Organization of Security and Co-operation in Europe, a group that includes the United States and Russia as members.
In a related event, a NATO-Ukraine Council meeting will take place on Tuesday at NATO headquarters in Brussels.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded legally binding guarantees that NATO will not be expanded further and that Ukraine will not join the transatlantic alliance.
Psaki said the United States in the talks would raise a host of concerns about Russian behavior, such as the seizure of Crimea in 2014, the incursion into Georgia, attempted poisoning of opposition figures, and violation of accords such as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.
""Let's be clear, over the past two decades it is Russia that has invaded two neighboring countries, interfered in many other elections, used chemical weapons to attempt assassinations on foreign soil, and violated international arms control agreements,"" Psaki said.
""We and our allies will be raising those issues, and other issues with Russia in the days and weeks ahead, and certainly as a part of these talks,"" she said.
President Joe Biden told Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday that the United State and its allies will respond decisively with economic sanctions and other steps if Russia were to invade Ukraine. He also promised that the United States and its allies and partners would do “nothing about you without you.”

Psaki said Biden has made clear that progress is possible on some issues between Russia and the West, but that some of Putin's demands are not viable.
""We're not responding to them point by point, and I don't expect we will in these negotiations because in our experience you don't make actual progress by negotiating in public, and also because many of the proposals don't merit such a response,"" she said.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) -Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was discharged from hospital on Wednesday, two days after being admitted with an intestinal obstruction, his latest health complication from a 2018 stabbing.
""Being discharged now. Thank you all,"" the far-right Brazilian leader posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) alongside a religious message and a photo of himself and his doctors giving a thumbs-up gesture.
Bolsonaro's doctor, Antonio Macedo, told reporters the president is recovered and ready to work, adding that he will be on a special diet during the weekend and will not be able to perform vigorous physical activities.
Bolsonaro, who has been in power since 2019 and plans to stand for re-election in a presidential vote scheduled for October, said he will maintain his regular agenda, including a trip to Russia in February.
He was vacationing in the southern Brazilian state of Santa Catarina when he was urgently taken to Sao Paulo's Vila Nova Star hospital in the early hours of Monday after suffering from abdominal pain.
Doctors inserted a nasogastric tube and even considered surgery, but the obstruction was cleared on Tuesday.
A medical bulletin issued on Tuesday evening said the president's digestive tract was showing signs of recovery, that he was doing well on a liquid diet and that doctors had removed the nasogastric tube.
Bolsonaro has undergone a series of emergency surgeries since being knifed during a campaign event in September 2018.

He said on Twitter on Monday that he had started feeling unwell on Sunday after lunch, noting it was his second hospitalization ""with the same symptoms"" in a few months. In July 2021, he was taken to the Vila Nova Star facility for an intestinal blockage after suffering chronic hiccups.
Macedo acknowledged that Bolsonaro could experience a new gut obstruction in the future.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadians are angered by people who are not vaccinated against COVID-19, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday, and he also promised more than 100 million rapid tests will be distributed quickly to provinces that are eagerly waiting.
Trudeau has mainly tried cajoling Canadians into getting inoculated and his comments reflect a growing impatience by various levels of government trying to combat the rapid spread of the Omicron variant.
Most of Canada's 10 provinces have reimposed limits on businesses and gatherings as medical professionals have warned that healthcare systems could be swamped.
""When people see we're in lockdowns, or serious public health restrictions right now, because of the risk posed to all of us by unvaccinated people - people get angry,"" Trudeau told a briefing, saying governments and health workers were frustrated.
Trudeau spoke after being asked about remarks by French President Emmanuel Macron, who said he wanted to ""piss off"" unvaccinated people.
Trudeau also promised a full investigation into footage of passengers snapping selfies, drinking alcohol and congregating close together on a Dec. 30 Sunwing Airlines flight from Montreal to Mexico.
""I'm extremely frustrated ... it's a slap in the face to see people putting themselves, putting their fellow citizens, putting airline workers at risk by being completely irresponsible,"" he said.
Official data show that as of Dec 18, 87.3% of people ages 12 and over had received two vaccine doses. Only 1.3% of children aged from 5 to 12 were fully inoculated.
""There's no magic bullet on this,"" Trudeau said, stressing the importance of vaccines and tests. ""We're going to keep getting through this. There will be better days ahead.""

Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said Ottawa would deliver 140 million rapid tests to the provinces by the end of January, over and above the 120 million already distributed. Local authorities are complaining about a shortage of tests.
Duclos said 7 million booster shots had been administered. Canada has a population of 38 million.

KYIV (Reuters) -The European Union's top diplomat visited the frontline of Ukraine's war with Moscow-backed forces on Wednesday, promising ""massive consequences and severe costs"" for Russia if it launched a new military offensive against its neighbour. 
Josep Borrell flew by helicopter to the easterly Luhansk region, the first EU High Representative to do so since the outbreak of the conflict in 2014, as part of a Western diplomatic push in support of Ukraine. 
Kyiv and its allies have sounded the alarm over the build-up of tens of thousands of Russian troops and military equipment near Ukraine's borders in recent weeks, raising fears of an open war between the two ex-Soviet neighbours.
TV footage showed Borrell walking through a snowy landscape, meeting soldiers and civilians at one of the checkpoints that divides government-controlled Ukraine from the separatist-held territories. The roofs of nearby houses were destroyed and had bullet holes in the walls. 
""The conflict on the borders is on the verge of getting deeper and tensions have been building up with respect to the European security as a whole,"" Borrell told reporters. 
The EU has a firm stance and a strong commitment ""that any military aggression against Ukraine will have massive consequences and severe costs"", he added. 
The Kremlin did not immediately issue a public response to Borrell's visit. Moscow has previously denied planning a new military offensive against Ukraine and accuses Kyiv of building up its own forces in the east of the country. 
Russia has pressed the United States for security guarantees that NATO will halt its eastward expansion. The two sides will meet for talks in Geneva on January 9-10. 
Ukraine has long sought assurances that no decisions about its future, including its right to eventually join the EU and the NATO military alliance, would be made without its involvement. 
Borrell too insisted that the security of Ukraine affected the security of Europe as a whole, and that the EU had to be involved in discussions with Russia. 
""There is no security in Europe without the security of Ukraine. And it is clear that any discussion on European security must include the European Union and Ukraine,"" Borrell said. 

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, who accompanied Borrell, welcomed the trip as ""a very timely visit against the background of Russian blackmail, escalation and threats.""
Relations between Kyiv and Moscow collapsed after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and Moscow-backed forces seized territory in eastern Ukraine that Kyiv wants back.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -A diabetic man who died in the western state of Rajasthan was India's first fatality from the Omicron COVID-19 variant, the health ministry said on Wednesday, adding that overall infections had doubled to 58,097 over the past four days.
The health ministry reported that total Omicron infections had risen to at least 2,135, just over a month since the first case was detected in the country.
Government officials privately say daily cases in the country's third wave of infections could surpass the record of more than 414,000 hit last May. They also warn that many people are taking the Omicron variant lightly and not wearing masks as most cases have been mild.
Top health official Vinod Kumar Paul declined to estimate a new peak but said even mild cases could put pressure on the country's health systems.
""There is no room for complacency,"" he told a weekly media briefing, adding Omicron was driving surges in the cities. ""Don't take it for granted. We don't know, the system can get overwhelmed, your household can get overwhelmed.""
Nevertheless, the government reduced the number of home quarantine days for mild and asymptomatic patients to a week, from 10 or 14 days previously.
Another official at the briefing said the elderly man from Rajasthan, whom he did not identify by name, died of a heart attack a few days ago. Genetic tests later showed he had been infected by the Omicron variant.
ELECTION RALLY FEARS
Despite cases rising and restrictions on movement announced in several regions, political parties have continued to hold mass rallies ahead of state elections due in the next weeks and months.
Health authorities plan to meet election commission officials on Thursday over the matter, officials said, as private health experts raise concerns that the rallies would again lead to a big spike in cases, like in April and May last year.
On Wednesday, the southern state of Tamil Nadu, home to manufacturing plants of companies such as Renault-Nissan, Eicher Motors, Hyundai Motor,  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) and Foxconn, announced a one-day lockdown on Sunday and a daily night curfew, with some exceptions for industries.
Many other states or cities have also placed curfews and closed schools.
Experts, meanwhile, have called for hospitals to get ready.
""With infections expected to be skyrocketing we need: clear communication about self-care to prevent panic-driven trips to the hospitals,"" Bhramar Mukherjee, professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan, wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
""Scale up hospital capacity and optimise care to those who really need it,"" she said.
New Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences cancelled a winter holiday for staff between Jan. 5 and 10. Many doctors and nurses have contracted the virus in recent days.
Authorities, especially in Delhi, have repeatedly said only those who need round-the-clock monitoring should go to hospital while others should recover at home.

Delhi tightened up virus mitigation measures on Tuesday, ordering people to stay home https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-reports-most-covid-19-cases-since-early-september-2022-01-04 on the weekends, in addition to a night curfew.

WASHINGTON/SARAJEVO (Reuters) -The United States on Wednesday imposed fresh sanctions on Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik and current and former officials as Washington warned of further action against those linked to destabilization or corruption.
The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement accused Dodik, already subject to U.S. sanctions under a different authority, of corruption and threatening the stability and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Treasury also slapped sanctions on Banja Luka-based media outlet Alternativna Television (ATV), accusing Dodik of acquiring it to further his own agenda and exerting personal control over it.
ATV strongly condemned the U.S. sanctions as a direct strike on media freedoms and democracy and its management dismissed allegations about ties with Dodik as ""senseless.""
""We are surprised with such a decision and regard as extremely trivial that a great state should take individual insinuations about ties between our media house and politicians as credible sources,"" ATV said in a statement sent to Reuters.
The Treasury designations, which freeze any of Dodik and ATV's U.S. assets and bar Americans from dealing with them, are the first use of an executive order issued in June allowing the United States to target those threatening peace or stability in the Western Balkans.
The U.S. State Department also barred current and former Bosnia and Herzegovina officials from entering the United States, targeting Milan Tegeltija, a former president of the high judicial council, and Mirsad Kukic, a lawmaker and president of the Movement for Democratic Action.
Tegeltija said in a tweet that the sanctions were not based on court proceedings so he did not feel he should defend himself, but were a ""result of the politics which contains a brutal political pressure.""
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a separate statement warned of further action: ""Other leaders and entities linked to corrupt or destabilizing actors may also be subject to future actions by the U.S. Government.""
Bosnia is experiencing its gravest political crisis since the end of the war in the 1990s, reviving fears of a breakup after Bosnian Serbs blocked the work of the central government and Serb lawmakers voted to start pulling the autonomous Serb Republic out of state institutions.
Dodik, who serves as the Serb member of Bosnia's tripartite inter-ethnic presidency, wants to roll back all reforms made after the war and return to the 1995 constitution under which the state was represented by basic institutions only while all powers had belonged to the regions.
""Milorad Dodik's destabilizing corrupt activities and attempts to dismantle the Dayton Peace Accords, motivated by his own self-interest, threaten the stability of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the entire region,"" Brian Nelson, Treasury's under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in the statement.
The U.S.-brokered Dayton peace agreement in 1995 ended 3-1/2 years of ethnic warfare in Bosnia. Some 100,000 people were killed in the conflict and 2 million forced from their homes.
Dodik said he was again being punished but did not know for what, telling Bosnian Serb news agency Srna the United States was accusing him of corruption despite the absence of any criminal proceeding against him. He added he has not brought into question constitutional order in Bosnia or its stability in any way.

""If they think they will discipline me in this way, they are very wrong. I have now only got a motive to fight for the rights that have been taken away from us for 26 years,"" he said.
The international high representative in Bosnia, Christian Schmidt, said that the U.S. decision to impose sanctions on Dodik is ""a logical consequence of the destructive and dangerous attitude in reference to his failure to meet the basic requirements of responsible leadership.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A year after then-President Donald Trump's supporters launched a deadly assault on the U.S. Capitol, signs of heightened security are visible everywhere, from police riot shields ready near doorways to metal detectors outside the House of Representatives chamber. 
Miles of steel fencing that ringed the Capitol complex after the riot came down in July. The thousands of armed National Guard troops deployed immediately after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack have long gone home.
But U.S. Capitol Police officers - in larger numbers and more heavily equipped than in the past - are posted around the grounds, while the department has added defensive equipment. Lighter fencing remains in place in some locations.
Once thronged by 2.5 million visitors a year, Capitol hallways now echo with emptiness. Almost everyone who comes into the complex must be a member of Congress or display a staff ID - a restriction prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Congress passed a $2.1 billion bill in July that provided $100 million for the Capitol Police force, $300 million for new security measures and more than $1 billion for the Pentagon - of which $500 million will go to the National Guard, whose funds were depleted in the security ramp-up after the riot.
Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger, hired to revamp the force after the attack, on Wednesday acknowledged that lawmakers are seeing more security equipment around the Capitol.
""I'm sure that as you walk around the campus there's times when you pass through a door and you'll notice that there's a stack of shields behind the door. So we've got them deployed around the campus in case we need them,"" Manger said, adding that the force plans to hire about 280 more officers this year.
Manger has said the Capitol Police as an organization is stronger and better prepared now than before the riot and has worked to fix leadership, intelligence and planning failures.
Around 140 police officers were injured when Trump's supporters stormed the building, trying to prevent Congress from formally certifying his 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden. The rioters fought with police for hours, smashed windows and sent lawmakers and staff running for their lives.
One officer who battled rioters died the day after the attack and four who guarded the Capitol later died by suicide. Four rioters also died, including a woman https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-death/woman-killed-in-siege-of-u-s-capitol-was-veteran-who-embraced-conspiracy-theories-idUSKBN29C2NV who was shot by a police officer while trying to climb through a shattered window in a door inside the Capitol leading into an area known as the Speaker's Lobby.
Lawmakers from both parties joined in calls for better security after the assault, but the reaction to various steps taken has been partisan. In particular, some House Republicans have voiced complaints about the five metal detectors installed at the entrances to the House chamber, where police on the day of the riot barricaded doors and lawmakers dove for cover as people in the mob tried to force their way in.
Some House Republicans, staunch defenders of gun rights, have called the metal detectors a political show, with congressmen Andrew Clyde and Louie Gohmert filing a lawsuit seeking their removal.
Security is due to be heavier than usual on Thursday, the anniversary of the attack. The House and Senate both are planning events to mark the anniversary and Biden plans to give a speech at the Capitol. The Senate is scheduled to be in session on Thursday. The House is not.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, on Wednesday said the false claims about a stolen election that underpinned last year's attack could bring fresh violence again at some point.
""The insurrection will not be an aberration. It well could become the norm,"" Schumer said, unless Congress addresses ""the root causes"" of Jan. 6 through election reforms.

PARIS (Reuters) -The government on Wednesday defended President Emmanuel Macron's use of coarse language in a stepped-up campaign against France's unvaccinated, after his words drew condemnation from the opposition and mixed reactions from voters.
Macron said he wanted to ""piss off"" unvaccinated people by making their lives so complicated they would end up getting jabbed. He was speaking in an interview with Le Parisien newspaper https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/frances-macron-rules-out-new-covid-19-curbs-ahead-wednesday-meeting-2022-01-04 in which he also called unvaccinated people irresponsible and unworthy of being considered citizens. 
""A president cannot say such things,"" Christian Jacob, chair of the conservative Les Republicans party, told parliament as it discussed a bill to make it mandatory for people to show proof of vaccination to enter many enclosed public spaces.
But spokesman Gabriel Attal said that, amid a ""supersonic https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/supersonic-rise-french-covid-cases-continue-coming-days-government-2022-01-05"" rise in Covid cases, the government stood by Macron's comments.
""Who is pissing off who today?"", Attal said, quoting health workers struggling to cope or businesses hurt by the pandemic. ""It's those who refuse the vaccine.""
People who got the jab are ""exasperated"" with the unvaccinated, Prime Minister Jean Castex said.
With a presidential election due in April in which he is expected to run, Macron may have calculated that enough people are now vaccinated - and upset with remaining anti-vaxxers - for his comment to go down well with voters.
In a country where more than 124,000 people have died of COVID-19, his words resonated with some.
""He's right,"" said 89-year-old Paris pensioner Jean, who has had his COVID-19 booster and a flu shot too. ""Those who are against the vaccine should understand the dangers, and they should get vaccinated.""
But others agreed with lawmaker Jacob that Macron's use of the slang term ""emmerder"" - from ""merde"" (shit) - was unacceptable.
""That shows an aggressive side, it's a bad word, it's not very clever of him,"" said 25-year old sales representative Maya Belhassen. 
""That's not a good comment from a president,"" added newspaper seller Pascal Delord.
TARGETING THE SCEPTICS 
France has historically had more vaccine sceptics than many of its neighbours, and pandemic restrictions have triggered many street protests, but nearly 90% of those aged 12 have now been inoculated, one of the continent's highest COVID-19 vaccination rates. 
People have for several months had to show either proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test to enter venues such as cinemas and cafes and use trains. But with Delta and Omicron variant infections surging, the government decided to drop the test option in the new bill. 
The opposition forced several suspensions of the parliamentary debate on the vaccine pass after the interview was published late on Tuesday.
""I'm in favour of the vaccine pass but I cannot back a text whose objective is to 'piss off' the French,"" Jacob told parliament. ""Is that your objective, yes or no?"" 

A government source said they were not worried about the adoption of the text, despite the heated parliamentary debate, which resumed on Wednesday afternoon, and hundreds of amendments.
The initial plan was for the new legislation to enter into force on Jan.15. One day or two of delay would not change much, the source said. After the lower house of parliament eventually votes it, the bill will go the senate for approval.

SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korea fired what the United States said was a ballistic missile on Wednesday, just hours before South Korean President Moon Jae-in attended a groundbreaking ceremony for a rail line he hopes will eventually connect the divided Korean peninsula.
Nuclear-armed North Korea's first test launch since October underscored leader Kim Jong Un's New Year vow https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkoreas-kim-talks-food-not-nukes-2022-2021-12-31 to bolster the military to counter an unstable international situation amid stalled talks with South Korea and the United States.
The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command called it a ballistic missile launch and the U.S. State Department condemned, it while repeating calls for renewed dialogue with North Korea. 
""This launch is in violation of multiple U.N. Security Council Resolutions and poses a threat to the DPRK’s neighbours and the international community,"" a State Department spokesperson using the initials of North Korea's official name.
The launch took place at 8:10 a.m. (2310 GMT) from an east coast inland location into the sea, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said. Japan's defence minister said the suspected ballistic missile had flown an estimated 500 km (310 miles).
Hours later, Moon visited the South Korean east coast city of Goseong, near the border with North Korea, where he broke ground for a new rail line that he called ""a stepping stone for peace and regional balance"" on the Korean peninsula.
Moon acknowledged the launch raised concerns of tensions, and called for North Korea to make sincere efforts for dialogue. 
""We should not give up the hope for dialogue in order to fundamentally overcome this situation,"" he said. ""If both Koreas work together and build trust, peace would be achieved one day.""
Moon, who has led unprecedented efforts to engage with North Korea, has stuck to what many analysts see as a forlorn hope for a diplomatic breakthrough before his five-year term ends in May. 
Reconnecting the two Koreas by rail was a central issue in meetings between Kim and Moon in 2018, but the efforts went nowhere as talks aimed at convincing North Korea to surrender its nuclear weapons in exchange for easing international sanctions faltered in 2019.
Kim's New Year speech made no mention of efforts by South Korea to restart negotiations or U.S. calls for dialogue.
'VERY REGRETTABLE'
South Korea's National Security Council convened an emergency meeting, expressing concern that the launch ""came at a time when internal and external stability is extremely important"" and calling on North Korea to return to talks.
The missile was fired from Jagang Province on North Korea's northern border with China, South Korea's JCS said, the same province where North Korea tested its first hypersonic missile https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-says-it-test-fired-new-hypersonic-missile-kcna-2021-09-28 in September.
""Our military is maintaining readiness posture in preparation for a possible additional launch while closely monitoring the situation in close cooperation with the United States,"" the JCS said.
Speaking to reporters, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called North Korea's repeated missile launches since last year ""very regrettable.""
The latest launch comes ahead of talks between the U.S. and Japanese foreign and defence ministers on Friday.
U.N. Security Council resolutions ban all ballistic missile and nuclear tests by North Korea, and have imposed sanctions over the programmes.
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, North Korea has become even more isolated, imposing border lockdowns that have slowed trade to a trickle and have prevented in-person diplomatic engagements.
It has stuck to a self-imposed moratorium on testing its largest intercontinental ballistic missiles or nuclear weapons since 2017, but has test fired a variety of new, short-range ballistic missiles, including one from a submarine https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkorea-says-it-conducted-successful-missile-test-submarine-kcna-2021-10-19 in October.
It argues it should not be penalized for developing weapons other countries already possess.

The U.S. government's Congressional Research Service reported last month that North Korea was ""continuing to build a nuclear warfighting capability designed to evade regional ballistic missile defences.""
At a regular news conference on Wednesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin urged all parties to ""bear in mind the bigger picture"", cherish the ""hard won"" peace and stability on the peninsula and stick to the use of dialogue and consultation to reach political settlement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa Jeffrey Feltman will step down from his post this month after more than nine months in the job, and David Satterfield, the outgoing U.S. ambassador to Turkey, will take up the role, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.
Feltman, a veteran U.S. diplomat, assumed the post in April and quickly found himself in the middle of two major crises - Ethiopia's deepening civil war between forces loyal to the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and the army of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, as well as a military coup in Sudan in October.
The news of his departure, which was not previously reported, came before he heads to Ethiopia on Thursday to meet with senior government officials about the peace talks as part of Washington's latest push to bring an end to the conflict.
Feltman, 62, said https://www.reuters.com/world/sense-duty-puts-veteran-us-envoy-middle-ethiopia-conflict-2021-11-05 a ""sense of duty"" brought him out of ""quasi-retirement"" following more than 25 years as an American diplomat with postings to the United Nations, Middle East and North Africa. 
Feltman took the role with an intention to serve for less than a year, a source familiar with the matter said. The source said Satterfield will provide continued U.S. focus, necessary because of ongoing instability and inter-connected challenges in the region.
The State Department declined to comment.
Ethiopian government spokesperson Legesse Tulu declined to comment because it was an internal U.S. government matter. 
Feltman has faced strong headwinds to progress. The year-long war between Ethiopia's government and the leadership of the northern Tigray region, among Africa's bloodiest conflicts, has killed thousands of civilians, displaced millions and sparked famine.
Getachew Reda, the spokesperson of the ruling Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), was not immediately reachable for comment. 
In Sudan, protests have continued for weeks including on Tuesday, two days after the resignation of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok. He served from 2019 until the coup and was reinstated on Nov. 21 in an agreement with the military widely rejected by protesters. 
Satterfield, a veteran of the U.S. Foreign Service with more than four decades of experience, has had a challenging post as U.S. ambassador in Turkey, where he navigated a strained bilateral relationship between the two NATO allies.

Prior to Ankara, he served in Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Tunisia and Syria, among others, and worked twice as the top U.S. diplomat at the State Department for Middle East affairs in an acting capacity.
Turkey's increasing drone exports, most recently to Ethiopia, will be a common thread in Satterfield's old and new roles. Washington in December raised with Turkey its sales of armed drones to Ethiopia. Sources said there was mounting evidence the government used the weapons against rebel fighters.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong announced a two-week ban on incoming flights from eight countries, including the United States and Britain, and tightened restrictions on Wednesday as authorities feared a fifth wave of COVID-19 infections.
The restrictions were announced as health authorities scoured the city for the contacts of a COVID-19 patient, some of whom had been aboard a  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) ship that was ordered to cut short its ""cruise to nowhere"" and return to port.
Incoming flights from Australia, Canada, France, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Britain and the United States, including interchanges, would be banned from Jan. 8 to Jan 21, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam told reporters.
Lam said the government would ban indoor dining after 6.00 pm from Friday, and close swimming pools, sports centres, bars and clubs, museums, and other venues for at least two weeks. Future cruise journeys would be cancelled.
""We're yet to see a fifth wave yet, but we're on the verge,"" Lam said.
Hong Kong recorded 38 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, but only one was a local community transmission, while the rest were people who had returned to the city and tested positive during quarantine.
The global finance hub has stuck to a zero-tolerance strategy by largely isolating itself from the world and enforcing a draconian and costly quarantine regime. 
On Dec. 31, a streak of three months without community cases ended with the first local transmission of the Omicron variant.
Since then, authorities have scrambled to track down and test hundreds of people who had been in contact with a handful of Omicron patients. One patient, however, had no known links, raising fears of a large outbreak.
""We are worried there may be silent transmission chains in the community,"" Lam said. 
Lam said the government would not suspend classes for the time being ""for the benefit of children"".
In response to the outbreak fears, Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc has started operating in split teams in Hong Kong, a bank spokesperson said.
DANCING CLUSTER
The latest contact tracing campaign was sparked by a patient who danced with some 20 friends in a central park on New Year's Eve. Two of the fellow dancers, one of whom was a domestic helper, came up positive in preliminary tests.
The helper's employer and eight other of her close contacts then went on a cruise on Jan. 2. 
As part of its coronavirus restrictions, Hong Kong has restricted cruises to short trips in nearby waters, with ships asked to operate at reduced capacity and to only allow vaccinated passengers who test negative for the virus.
The ""Spectrum of the Seas"" ship, which returned a day early, had about 2,500 passengers and 1,200 staff on board. The nine close contact passengers tested negative for the virus so far, authorities said.
""Spectrum of the Seas is taking appropriate measures under guidelines by the Department of Health,"" Royal Caribbean told Reuters in a statement. 
The nine close contacts were sent to a quarantine centre, while the rest of the passengers and staff will have to undergo several tests, the government said.
Additionally, people who have been to dozens of places across Hong Kong around the same time as the close contacts of recent patients have been issued compulsory testing notices, the government said in a separate statement.
Victoria Park, in downtown Hong Kong, the newly opened M+ modern art museum, ferry piers, restaurants, stores, clinics were among the places listed.

Gabriel Leung, University of Hong Kong dean of medicine and a government adviser, told public broadcaster RTHK there were probably ""five-to-10 invisible transmission chains"" in the city.
""There’s no time to waste,"" Leung said. ""We need circuit-breaker measures.""

398,"<span>Jan 05, 2022 05:51AM ET</span>","TOKYO (Reuters) -The southern Japanese island chain of Okinawa emerged on Wednesday as the epicentre of a new coronavirus surge, with cases more than doubling from the previous day and officials were considering imposing emergency curbs.
New infections in the prefecture jumped to 623 from 225 on Tuesday, the highest since August when Japan was in the midst of its fifth and biggest wave of COVID-19.
Governor Denny Tamaki on Tuesday told reporters the region had entered a sixth wave of infections and the highly transmissible Omicron variant was responsible.
Okinawa, 1,500 km (932 miles) southwest of Tokyo, hosts 70% of U.S. military facilities in Japan. Discoveries of coronavirus clusters and Omicron cases among service members have rankled relations with Japanese authorities there and residents, who number just under 1.5 million.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said Japan was asking the U.S. military to make all efforts to rein in rising infections.
As of Tuesday, a total of 1,191 cases of the Omicron variant had been found in Japan, including 479 cases considered community transmissions, according to the health ministry.
""Omicron is rapidly increasing in some regions,"" Health Minister Shigeyuki Goto told reporters.
While Goto said it was too early to say if a sixth wave of infections had arrived, Japan's major metropolitan areas saw tallies rising to levels not seen for months.
Tokyo reported 390 cases while the western prefecture of Osaka said 244 had been found, the highest levels since September for both.
Nationwide, new cases exceeded 2,000 on Wednesday, according to a tally by national broadcaster NHK, the most since Sept. 26.
Okinawa health experts will meet later on Wednesday to determine whether to ask the central government to impose new restrictions, a prefectural official said. 
It would be the first such declaration of what are known in Japan as quasi-emergency measures since Sept. 30, when all states of emergency and quasi-emergency that had been in effect for a good part of 2021 were lifted.
Tokyo officials may also ask for emergency measures to be reinstated in the capital, the Sankei newspaper said, citing unidentified sources. 

The central government hopes to respond quickly to any requests for emergency steps, Matsuno told reporters. Measures would likely include limiting the opening hours of restaurants and bars.
Separately, a U.S. Marine Corps station in the prefecture of Yamaguchi, in western Japan, reported that 182 people on the base there had tested positive on Tuesday.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Novak Djokovic needs to prove that he has a genuine medical exemption from COVID-19 vaccination when he lands in Australia or he will be ""on the next plane home"", Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday.The world No. 1 announced on Tuesday he received an exemption to play in the Grand Slam tournament in Melbourne and said he was heading to Australia.
Tennis Australia and the Victorian state government said Djokovic was one of a ""handful"" of successful applicants among 26 people who sought exemptions from being vaccinated, but had not received any special treatment in the anonymous application process.
""We await his presentation and what evidence he provides us to support that,"" Morrison told a media conference after chairing a meeting of state leaders about dealing with record levels of COVID infections in the country.
""If that evidence is insufficient, then he won't be treated any different to anyone else and he'll be on the next plane home. There should be no special rules for Novak Djokovic at all. None whatsoever.""
The federal government, which has responsibility for international borders and visas, was not part of the exemption process. Morrison said there had been numerous exemptions granted to people who had been able to support their application.
""So the circumstances are not unique, the issue is whether he has sufficient evidence to support that he would qualify for that exception,"" he said.
The decision to grant Djokovic an exemption to the tournament sparked sharp criticism in Australia, where more than 90% of people over 16 have had two vaccine doses against COVID-19.. 
Melbourne had the world's longest cumulative lockdown to contain COVID, and an outbreak of the Omicron variant has sent case numbers to record levels.
""I think lots of people in the Victorian community will find this to be a disappointing outcome,"" acting Victorian Sports Minister Jaala Pulford told a media conference earlier on Wednesday after news of Djokovic's exemption. 
""But the process is the process; nobody has had special treatment. The process is incredibly robust.""
Tennis Australia CEO Craig Tiley said the two-stage application process was confidential and run by independent experts. All applications were assessed to ensure any exemptions met conditions set out by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI).
Tiley said those reasons included previous adverse response to vaccines, recent major surgery or myocarditis or certified evidence of a COVID infection in the previous six months.
The Serbian, who had declined to reveal his vaccination status, said previously that he was unsure whether he would compete at the Jan. 17-30 tournament in Melbourne due to concerns over Australia's quarantine rules. ""

""We completely understand and empathise with ... people being upset about the fact that Novak has come in because of his statements over the past couple of years around vaccination,"" Tiley told reporters.
""However it is ultimately up to him to discuss with the public his condition, if he chooses to do that, and the reasons why he received an exemption.""

The government's coronavirus task force cancelled the ""Black Nazerene"" procession, which is one of the country's largest religious festivals, before celebrations related to the Jan. 9 procession, were due to start on Friday because of rising COVID-19 infections.
Unlike last year, there will be no in-person masses in the church housing the centuries-old statue, and police will be deployed to discourage people from gathering outside the building, authorities said.
""We understand (the cancellation) for our safety and health reasons,"" Father Douglas Badong, Parochial Vicar of Quiapo Church, told a news conference. He said physical masses will take place in other provinces and online masses for devotees in the capital.
In prior years, devotees clad in yellow and maroon have thronged the life-sized tatute as it is paraded through the streets of Manila aboard a rope-pulled carriage.
The health ministry on Wednesday reported 10,775 new COVID-19 cases, the highest daily spike since Oct. 10, and more then 60 times the 168 cases recorded on Dec. 21. 
The tally, which was nearly double the day before, brought total cases to over 2.86 million, and deaths to more than 51,600, the second highest COVID-19 infections and casualties in Southeast Asia, next to Indonesia. 
Acting Presidential Spokesperson Karlo Nograles urged areas outside the capital region to step up vaccinations amid the threat of the Omicron variant which had already prompted the government to tighten curbs this week. 

""The numbers clearly show these can prevent serious cases of COVID,"" Nograles said in a statement.
The Philippines has so far detected 14 domestic and imported cases of the highly contagious Omicron variant that has driven up COVID-19 case counts and dampened New Year festivities around much of the world.

TORONTO (Reuters) -Canada announced on Tuesday two agreements totalling C$40 billion ($31.5 billion) to compensate First Nations children who were taken from their families and put into the child welfare system and to reform the system that removed them and deprived them of services they needed.
The agreements include C$20 billion for potentially hundreds of thousands of First Nations children who were removed from their families, who did not get services or who experienced delays in receiving services. Another C$20 billion is to reform the system over the next five years.
The agreements come almost 15 years after the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society brought forward a human rights complaint.
The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal repeatedly found child and family services discriminated against First Nations children, in part by under-funding services on reserves so children were removed from their homes and taken off-reserve to get those services.
Canada admitted its systems were discriminatory but repeatedly fought orders to pay compensation and fund reforms, including an appeal it filed last year https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canada-appeal-decision-compensate-indigenous-children-harmed-by-discrimination-2021-10-29.
Canada is also fighting a class-action lawsuit on behalf of First Nations children that the compensation agreement seeks to resolve.
Justice Minister David Lametti said Tuesday the government will drop its appeals once the agreements are finalized in the months ahead.
The reform deal includes C$2,500 in preventive care per child and provisions for children in foster care to receive support beyond age 18.
Funding aimed at reform and preventive services should start flowing in April but may not address deep-rooted problems, said Cindy Blackstock, executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society.
""I see it as words on paper,"" she told Reuters.
""I judge victory when I can walk into a community and a child is able to say to me, 'My life is better than it was yesterday.' Nothing in these words actually changes children's lives until it's implemented.""
Lawyer David Sterns, representing harmed First Nations children and families, said during a press conference that this would be the largest class-action settlement in Canada's history.
""The enormity of this settlement is due to one reason, and one reason only. And that is the sheer scope of the harm inflicted on class members,"" he said.
At the press conference Indigenous Services Minister Patty Hajdu vowed to end discrimination against First Nations children, who are over-represented in foster care across Canada. 

""Canada's decision and actions harmed First Nations children, families and communities,"" she said. ""Discrimination caused intergenerational harm and losses. Those losses are not reversible. But I believe healing is possible.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's daily COVID-19 cases hit a record high for a third day on Wednesday, further straining hospital resources and testing facilities as public anger grew over the handling of the fast-moving outbreak of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
Many Australians, already unhappy about long queues at public testing centres and a shortage of at-home tests, were further incensed when news broke that tennis world number one Novak Djokovic had been given a medical exemption to enter the country. 
Prime Minister Scott Morrison, under pressure at the start of an election year, announced a further relaxing of testing requirements to shorten long lines, and provided access to free rapid antigen tests for pensioners, the poor and veterans.
The rapid surge in cases in recent weeks has led to long lines at publicly-funded polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing centres. That prompted authorities to ask people to only seek PCR tests if symptomatic, which in turn led to a shortage of rapid antigen tests, which can be used at home.
Morrison said supply would remain tight over the next few weeks, with 200 million in new supplies coming in over the next two months.
""There are no magic solutions, full stop. And so this virus will continue to challenge us, and it's important that we all remain calm,"" Morrison said after a National Cabinet meeting.
Officials reported a record 64,774 new cases, the majority in New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria, the country's two most populous states. That exceeded the previous day's tally of around 47,800. 
Infections have surged from only around 1,200 a day since late November, when the first Omicron case was detected in the country.
Australia has recorded more than 612,000 cases and 2,290 deaths since the coronavirus pandemic began, with more than half of those infections reported over the past two weeks.
People admitted to hospitals in NSW and Victoria rose 10% over the previous day, and authorities warned those numbers would rise further over the next several weeks.
""We have got some challenging weeks ahead of us,"" NSW Deputy Health Secretary Susan Pearce told reporters.
Under eased rules announced on Wednesday, incoming travelers will no longer need a second rapid antigen test if they test negative in a first test on arrival. The government also removed the requirement for a PCR test to confirm a positive rapid antigen test.
'TAKEN FOR FOOLS'
Authorities also fielded sharp criticism about the decision to grant Djokovic, who has declined to reveal his vaccination status but has previously stated his objection to mandatory vaccines, a medical exemption to play in the Australian Open tennis Grand Slam tournament.
The decision prompted an outcry on social media and criticism from other sports people, medical professionals and lawmakers. 
Former Australian Rules player Kevin Bartlett tweeted that Australians ""have been taken for fools,"" while another former player Corey McKernan tweeted: ""People with loved ones who are dying/some needing urgent treatment cannot get into their own states. You tell people they can't go to Coles [supermarket] or a cafe without being vaxxed but if you're world number one you get a pass?""
Many Australians, and particularly those in Melbourne which hosts the year's first tennis major later this month, have been subjected to a series of lengthy lockdowns over the past two years.
Federal and state government heavily pushed the importance of vaccinations. As a result, 90% of people over 16 have been double dosed and a booster programme is rolling out.
Stephen Parnis, a former vice-president of the Australian Medical Association, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that Djokovic's approval ""sends an appalling message to millions seeking to reduce"" the risk of COVID-19. ""#Vaccination shows respect, Novak.""
Tennis Australia and the Victorian state government said Djokovic did not receive any special treatment in a blind review process that involved a panel of health experts. 

When asked his opinion, Morrison said Djokovic will have to provide acceptable proof that he cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.
""My view is he should be treated no different to anyone else,"" Morrison told reporters.

The move includes an 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew, movement restrictions, and a ban on mass gatherings, according to documents published on the president's website.
""Calls to attack government and military offices are absolutely illegal,"" Tokayev said in a video address a few hours earlier. ""The government will not fall, but we want mutual trust and dialogue rather than conflict.""
As he spoke, police in Almaty used tear gas and stun grenades to stop hundreds of protesters from storming the mayor's office, a Reuters correspondent reported from the scene.
The oil-rich country's government announced late on Tuesday it was restoring some price caps on liquefied petroleum gas, after the rare protests reached Almaty following a sharp rise in the price of the fuel at the start of the year.
Many Kazakhs have converted their cars to run on LPG, which is far cheaper than gasoline as a vehicle fuel in Kazakhstan because of price caps. But the government argued that the low price was unsustainable and lifted the caps on Jan. 1.
PRICE SPIKE
After the price of the fuel spiked, rallies involving thousands of people erupted on Jan. 2 in the town of Zhanaozen, an oil hub and site of deadly clashes between protesters and police a decade ago.
Demonstrations spread to other parts of surrounding Mangistau province and western Kazakhstan, including provincial centre Aktau and a worker camp used by sub-contractors of Kazakhstan's biggest oil producer, Tengizchevroil. The Chevron-led venture said output had not been affected.
In Almaty, police appeared to have taken control of the main square shortly after deploying flashbang grenades, according to online video streams from the area. But explosions were heard for hours on nearby streets and in other parts of the city.
Videos published online showed torched police cars in the city, as well as armoured vehicles moving through one of its main thoroughfares.
On Tuesday evening, the government announced it was restoring the price cap of 50 tenge (11 cents) per litre, or less than half the market price, in Mangistau province.
Public protests are illegal in the country of 19 million unless their organisers file a notice in advance. 

Tokayev, the hand-picked successor of Soviet-era Communist boss Nursultan Nazarbayev who stepped down in 2019, faces no political opposition in parliament.
The president said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Tuesday that he would hold a government meeting the following day to discuss the protesters' demands. He urged protesters to behave responsibly.

The world number one, who had declined to reveal his vaccination status, said previously that he was unsure whether he would compete at the Jan. 17-30 tournament in Melbourne due to concerns over Australia's quarantine rules.
""I've spent fantastic quality time with my loved ones over the break and today I'm heading Down Under with an exemption permission. Let's go 2022,"" the Serbian said on Instagram.
Organisers Tennis Australia (TA) had stipulated that all participants at the Grand Slam must be vaccinated against the novel coronavirus or have a medical exemption granted by an independent panel of experts.
The panel would consist of doctors from the fields of immunology, infectious disease and general practice and that the move was agreed in conjunction with the Victoria Department of Health.
TA said the 34-year-old Djokovic had applied for a medical exemption which was granted after a ""rigorous review process"" involving two separate independent panels of medical experts.
""One of those was the Independent Medical Exemption Review Panel appointed by the Victorian Department of Health,"" TA said in a statement.
""They assessed all applications to see if they met the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) guidelines.""
It added the process included the redaction of personal information to ensure privacy for all applicants.
A Victorian state government confirmed the exemption, telling the Herald Sun newspaper that any player granted one would have gone through a two-stage process to verify they have a medical condition that meets the criteria for an exemption. 
""I'm ready to live and breathe tennis in the next few weeks of competition. Thanks everyone for the support,"" Djokovic added in his post, which was accompanied by a picture of him in an airport.
Australian Open Tournament Director Craig Tiley said in the TA statement that ""fair and independent protocols"" had been established for assessing medical exemption applications to ensure the Australian Open was safe.
""Central to this process was that the decisions were made by independent medical experts and that every applicant was given due consideration,"" Tiley said.
The exemption, however, was questioned by British doubles player Jamie Murray, who said that he was unlikely to get one if he were in Djokovic's place. 
""I think if it was me that wasn't vaccinated I wouldn't be getting an exemption... but well done to him for getting clear to come to Australia and compete,"" he said after the doubles rubber against Canada in the ATP Cup. 
""At the end of the day you kind of have to trust that he does has a valid reason for the medical exemption.""

Djokovic heads to Australia having trained in Marbella, Spain over the last few days.
Djokovic has won a record nine Australian Open titles, including the last three, and is in a three-way tie on 20 majors with Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal in the all-time list.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden will mark the one-year anniversary of the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by Donald Trump's followers with a speech on Thursday warning of the threats to democracy, while Trump abandoned plans for a news conference that day as he reprised his attacks on Democrats and the media.
The White House said Biden would push back against Trump's false claims, adopted by many of his followers, that his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud, as well as attempts to downplay the violence of the worst assault on the Capitol since the War of 1812.
""The president is going to speak to the truth of what happened, not the lies that some have spread since, and the peril it has posed to the rule of law and our system of democratic governance,"" White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters on Tuesday, in the first preview of Biden's remarks. 
Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will speak Thursday morning at the U.S. Capitol, one year after thousands of Trump supporters raided the complex https://www.reuters.com/world/us/democracy-under-siege-an-hour-by-hour-look-assault-us-capitol-2022-01-04 in a failed attempt to stop the counting of Electoral College votes by lawmakers that officially delivered the Democratic president's election victory. 
Trump on Tuesday canceled a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida that had been scheduled for Jan. 6, saying he would address many of the same topics at a rally in Arizona on Jan. 15 instead.
It was not clear why Trump canceled the news conference, which had originally been announced on Dec. 21. In a statement, Trump blamed what he called the ""bias and dishonesty"" of the House of Representatives probe of Jan. 6, as well as the news media, a favorite target.
The Jan. 6 anniversary comes as Trump continues to fight to block the release of White House records sought by the House committee investigating the attack.
Trump, some fellow Republicans and right-wing media personalities have pushed https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-disinformation/half-of-republicans-believe-false-accounts-of-deadly-u-s-capitol-riot-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKBN2BS0RZ false accounts to downplay the Jan. 6 attack, calling it a non-violent protest or blaming left-wing activists. 
Four people died on the day of the riot, and one Capitol police officer died the day after defending Congress. Dozens of police were injured during the multi-hour onslaught by Trump supporters, and four officers have since taken their own lives https://www.reuters.com/world/us/officer-who-responded-us-capitol-attack-is-third-die-by-suicide-2021-08-02.
Psaki was asked what the president's message will be to the many Republicans who believe Biden stole the election from Trump, despite overwhelming contrary evidence. 

""What he's going to continue to do is speak to everyone in the country. Those who didn't vote for him, those who may not believe he is the legitimate president, about what he wants to do to make their lives better,"" she said. 
The White House is struggling https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-vote-changing-rules-if-republicans-obstruct-voting-rights-law-schumer-2022-01-03 to get voting rights legislation through the U.S. Senate that would counter new laws in Republican-led states that Democrats say would limit left-leaning voters. Two sources told Reuters that Biden and Harris do not plan to use the Jan. 6 event to push for voting rights legislation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Rescue crews in Virginia on Tuesday finished freeing the last of the travelers stranded overnight on a snowed-in highway, ending a crisis that had trapped thousands of people including U.S. Senator Tim Kaine.
Kaine's routine commute from his Virginia home to Washington turned into a 27-hour ordeal when a blizzard made the road headed toward the nation's capital impassable, stranding him and other motorists without food and water in the freezing cold.
A spokeswoman with the Virginia Department of Transportation confirmed the last motorists were freed, more than 24 hours after the storm.
Interstate 95, one of the busiest thoroughfares on the East Coast, was closed for hours in both directions near Fredericksburg, Virginia, about 55 miles (89 km) south of Washington. The region was blanketed by up to a foot (30 cm) of snow.
Traffic on the 47-mile (76-km) stretch of I-95 came to a standstill about 8 p.m. ET on Monday (0100 GMT on Tuesday) and did not begin moving again until Tuesday afternoon.
Kelly Hannon, a spokeswoman for the agency, said responders have also cleared the freeway of a number of abandoned cars and that officials expect it to reopen to motorists by Wednesday morning.
For hours overnight and well after daybreak, hundreds of tractor-trailer trucks and cars lined the snow-clogged roadway as their drivers grew increasingly desperate about their predicament and exasperated by what appeared to be a slow response by authorities.
Kaine, the 2016 Democratic nominee for vice president, was one of the many motorists caught up in the paralysis.
""I started my normal 2 hour drive to DC at 1 pm yesterday,"" he posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Tuesday morning.
The senator finally arrived in Washington 27 hours after leaving Richmond, Virginia, his communications director said. Kaine told CNN he had nothing to eat or drink since setting out on Monday.
Jim DeFede, an investigative reporter with CBS 4 Miami, found himself stuck somewhere in Prince George County. 
""Good morning from I-95 in Virginia where I have been trapped in my car for more than 20 hours,"" he tweeted just after dawn. ""I'm not sure, but I think I now qualify for Virginia residency.""
DeFede later reported that fire and rescue teams had finally arrived early on Tuesday afternoon, guiding his car and other vehicles in reverse to a just-opened exit.
State and local emergency personnel worked through the morning and into the afternoon to clear downed trees, assist disabled vehicles and reroute drivers, Governor Ralph Northam said on Tuesday.
'THIS IS INSANE'
Northam and the Virginia Department of Transportation came under fierce criticism for the state's response and failure to call in the National Guard. Some urged U.S. President Joe Biden to mobilize federal resources to rescue stranded drivers and reopen the highway. 
""This is insane. Nothing is being done, 911 isn't much help, neither is Virginia state police. And the state has yet to contact National Guard. Insane,"" wrote one Twitter user who claimed to have been stuck on I-95 south for hours.
Northam told WTOP radio the National Guard was available, but said it had yet to be mobilized.
The U.S. Department of Transportation posted a Twitter message saying it was ready to help the state reopen the highway and assist motorists. 
Volunteers were doing what they could to help.
""Reply with need AND MILE MARKER and we'll try to connect you to other drivers in your area who might be able to share some supplies with you,"" tweeted Reagan Battalion, a conservative political organization.
In another volunteer effort, someone handed out Schmidt Old Tyme bread after the company agreed to open one of its trucks stranded on the interstate, a local CBS reporter caught in the standstill said.

The heavy snow, in parts of the Southeast and mid-Atlantic states, triggered crashes and spin-outs on I-95, paralyzing that section of the highway. The standstill persisted as temperatures dropped below freezing overnight. 
The fast-moving storm forced the closure of federal offices and schools, grounded airplanes and knocked out electrical power for thousands of people.

(Reuters) - Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes is likely to appeal her conviction for defrauding investors in the blood-testing company, but four legal experts say the fact that the jury acquitted her or failed to reach a verdict on several counts could work against her. 
Holmes on Monday was found guilty https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-jury-theranos-trial-cannot-agree-verdicts-all-charges-2022-01-03 of defrauding investors in the once high-flying Silicon Valley blood-testing startup, but she was acquitted of deceiving patients. The guilty verdict on four of 11 counts came after a months-long trial https://www.reuters.com/world/us/rise-fall-theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-2022-01-04.
A jury found the former Silicon Valley entrepreneur guilty of conspiring to dupe investors and of defrauding three private investors. The jury deadlocked on charges related to other investors, and acquitted Holmes of swindling patients. 
Holmes' lawyers have not yet said whether she would appeal. Attorneys for Holmes did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.
Legal experts not involved in the case said that the fact jurors found in Holmes' favor on some charges will weaken arguments that they were confused or biased.
""In a mixed verdict, it's very hard to say that the jury rushed to judgment,"" said Carrie Cohen, a white-collar defense attorney and former prosecutor in New York. ""It appears that they didn't take evidence from one crime and use it to say, 'Well, she lied to one investor. She must have lied to the three other investors.'""
The experts said a likely focus of an appeal would be rulings made by U.S. District Judge Edward Davila in favor of prosecutors during or before the trial, such as allowing jurors to see a regulatory report from 2015 saying that the conditions in Theranos' lab posed ""immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety."" 
Her attorneys had challenged prosecutors' use of the report, arguing it was irrelevant and would unfairly prejudice jurors against Holmes. The judge found that the evidence could be used to show that Holmes was aware of problems at Theranos. 
The report was among the evidence introduced during the testimony of 29 government witnesses.
But appeals courts are hesitant to disturb jury verdicts, and would consider whether any erroneous ruling was significant enough to have impacted the result, said Vanderbilt Law School professor Christopher Slobogin. 
Another focus for a potential appeal would be the instructions the jury received before deliberations, including on the meaning of ""reasonable doubt."" The judge denied Holmes' call for further instructions on that legal standard, which sets a high bar for conviction in criminal cases. 
In the United States, criminal defendants are presumed innocent unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
Cohen said that arguing the jury was confused about the standard may be an ""uphill battle"" since it decided to acquit on some counts. 
But the mixed verdict may prove helpful at Holmes' sentencing, said Amanda Kramer, a partner at Covington & Burling.

Holmes' attorneys will likely argue that her conviction on only some of the counts after a nearly four-month trial shows ""she wasn't some snake oil salesperson out there just trying to rip people off."" 
""The defense will argue to the judge that that's really meaningful, that she stands apart from the predatory fraudsters that are found guilty across the board,"" Kramer said.

Trump said in a statement that he would instead discuss many of the same topics he would have addressed at the news conference at a rally in Arizona on Jan. 15.
Thousands of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in the worst assault on Congress since the War of 1812. Fueled by Trump's false claims that his November 2020 election defeat was the result of fraud, the rioters tried to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's victory.

One police officer who responded to the scene died the day after the attack, while four others who guarded the Capitol died later by suicide. About 140 police officers were injured during the hours-long attack. Four rioters also died. More than 700 people have been charged with joining in the assault.
The violence led to Trump's second impeachment and numerous investigations. One of them, in the House of Representatives, is seeking to question influential Fox News television personality Sean Hannity about text messages with Trump, his aides and his lawyers during that time.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A U.S. judge on Tuesday appeared skeptical of a bid by Britain's Prince Andrew to dismiss Virginia Giuffre's lawsuit accusing the Duke of York of sexually abusing her when she was 17 and being trafficked by the late financier Jeffrey Epstein.
During a hearing in Manhattan, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan heard arguments on the prince's contention that terms contained in a 2009 settlement between Epstein and Giuffre that paid her $500,000 to resolve a lawsuit she had filed against the financier prevented her from pursuing litigation against Andrew.
A provision in that settlement blocked Giuffre from suing certain third parties in the future, with language to ""forever discharge"" various people who ""could have been included as a potential defendant"" in her resolved lawsuit against Epstein.
Settlements of U.S. civil lawsuits can restrict plaintiffs from pursuing further litigation, even against third parties.
Andrew has denied Giuffre's accusations that he forced her to have sex more than two decades ago at the London home of former Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and abused her at two other Epstein properties.
At the hearing, the prince's Los Angeles-based lawyer Andrew Brettler said Queen Elizabeth's second son was shielded from Giuffre's lawsuit under the terms of the settlement with Epstein, who did not admit liability.
""'Potential defendant' is someone who could have been named a defendant in that lawsuit, but was not,"" Brettler said. ""I think it's unquestionable that Prince Andrew could have been sued in the 2009 Florida action.""
Kaplan said the key question in Prince Andrew's case was what Giuffre and Epstein intended, noting that ""we don't have Mr. Epstein here"" to explain how broad a release he wanted.
""We're talking about whether there are two or more reasonable interpretations,"" Kaplan told Brettler. ""I understand your point of view. I understand the other point of view.""
Giuffre's lawyer David Boies said the settlement did not excuse the prince because Giuffre did not claim that Andrew was ""people who were doing the trafficking,"" but rather was ""someone to whom girls were trafficked.""
Kaplan said he would rule on Andrew's dismissal motion ""pretty soon,"" but was not specific. The judge has said a trial could begin between September and December if no settlement is reached.
Epstein killed himself at age 66 in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.
Maxwell, 60, was convicted https://www.reuters.com/world/us/maxwell-jury-resume-deliberations-after-judge-warns-omicron-risk-2021-12-29 on Dec. 29 of recruiting and grooming girls for Epstein to abuse between 1994 and 2004. 
Giuffre's accusations were not part of that case, and she did not testify.
'HUGE BURDEN'
While the prince is not accused of criminal wrongdoing, his ties to Epstein have cost him many royal duties and damaged his reputation. His troubles grew after critics said he failed in a 2019 BBC interview https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-royals-andrew/britains-prince-andrew-categorically-denies-sex-claims-idUSKBN1XP2CX to appear sympathetic toward Epstein's abuse victims.
Giuffre sued Andrew for unspecified damages less than a week before the expiration of a New York law giving accusers a two-year window to bring claims over alleged child abuse occurring long ago.
Andrew has said Giuffre is seeking another ""payday"" in her campaign against Epstein and former associates such as Maxwell, from whom she sought $50 million in a since-settled 2015 defamation lawsuit.
During the hearing, Brettler said it was ""inherently unfair and unjust"" for Giuffre to wait so long to sue, and subject the prince to the ""huge burden"" of finding witnesses and materials to defend against her decades-old claims.

Kaplan rejected Brettler's claim that dismissal of the lawsuit is warranted because Giuffre has not provided enough specifics about the prince's alleged abuses.
""She has no obligation to do that in a complaint,"" Kaplan told Brettler. ""I'm telling you that, straight out, right now. It's not going to happen.""

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A South African corruption inquiry pointed to systemic graft during former President Jacob Zuma's tenure in the first part of its report published on Tuesday, after more than three years of investigations involving more than 300 witnesses.
The inquiry chaired by senior judge Raymond Zondo was established in 2018 to examine allegations of high-level graft during Zuma's nine years in power from 2009, after scandals and sleaze had overshadowed South Africa's politics for years.
Zuma denies wrongdoing and has refused to cooperate with the inquiry, leading to his imprisonment in July for contempt of court. He was placed on medical parole in September before being ordered back to jail by the high court - a decision he is appealing.
The allegations levelled against Zuma include that he allowed businessmen close to him - brothers Atul, Ajay and Rajesh Gupta - to plunder state resources and influence policy, in what is widely referred to in South Africa as ""state capture"".
The Guptas, who also deny wrongdoing, left South Africa after Zuma was ousted before the end of his second term by now-President Cyril Ramaphosa's allies on the executive of the governing African National Congress party to which they both belong.
The first instalment of the Zondo commission's report focused on alleged corruption involving state airline South African Airways (SAA) and related entities, a media company controlled by the Guptas and the revenue service.
On SAA, it said the airline declined into ""an entity racked by corruption and fraud"" while Zuma was in power. Two former finance ministers told the inquiry that the SAA chairwoman at the time was retained because of the personal preferences of Zuma.
""This is the antithesis of accountability. President Zuma fled the Commission because he knew there were questions that would be put to him which he would not have been able to answer,"" the report said. Spokespeople for Zuma and SAA did not immediately answer phone calls seeking comment.
COLLAPSE OF GOVERNANCE
The inquiry found the Guptas employed ""a calculated strategy ... to appropriate public funds from state-owned enterprises"" and said the influence that they exerted over Zuma was ""considerable"".
It said the revenue service, SARS, was ""systemically and deliberately weakened, chiefly through the restructuring of its institutional capacity, strategic appointments and dismissals of key individuals, and a pervasive culture of fear and bullying"". It cited Zuma and a former SARS commissioner as playing critical roles in dismantling it. SARS did not immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment.
Addressing public procurement broadly, the inquiry said there were patterns of abuse at every stage and that governance had collapsed at state companies.
It recommended the government publish a national charter against corruption in public procurement, establish an independent anti-corruption agency, ensure protection for whistleblowers and that legislation on political party funding be amended.
Two further parts of the report will be submitted to Ramaphosa by the end of February.
At a ceremony at the Union Buildings, the seat of government, Ramaphosa promised a plan to implement the inquiry's recommendations by the end of June after Zondo handed him the first part of the report. 

Ramaphosa has made tackling corruption a priority since taking over from Zuma, although some opposition politicians have criticised him for doing too little to stop the rot when he was Zuma's deputy between May 2014 and February 2018.
Zondo declined to comment on the report's contents at Tuesday's ceremony.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A New York prosecutor will not pursue a misdemeanor sex crime charge against former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, saying he could not prove the elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt.
Albany County District Attorney David Soares said in a statement on Tuesday that his office had investigated the complaint made by former Cuomo aide Brittany Commisso and that he found her to be ""cooperative and credible.""
""I, like most New Yorkers, remain deeply troubled by allegations like the ones at issue here,"" his statement said. ""Such conduct has no place in government or in any workplace.""
Cuomo, a Democrat who ran New York for a decade, resigned in August after a state investigation concluded that he sexually harassed 11 women, most of them state employees.
Commisso, then a Cuomo aide in her early 30s, said Cuomo, 64, groped her breast at the Executive Mansion in Albany in 2020. In October, Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) filed https://www.reuters.com/world/us/misdemeanor-complaint-related-sex-crime-filed-against-ex-ny-governor-cuomo-court-2021-10-28 a criminal complaint in court that charged Cuomo with forcible touching.
The complaint appeared to take even the prosecutor by surprise. He asked that Cuomo's initial court appearance be postponed to Jan. 7, saying Apple had acted unilaterally and that the sheriff's complaint was ""potentially defective."" 
Cuomo's lawyer Rita Glavin did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the sheriff declined to comment. Cuomo has said he has never touched anyone inappropriately and that his efforts to be a friendly boss may have been mistaken for flirting.
Commisso expressed disappointment about the decision by the Albany County district attorney. ""I think it's deterring women from coming forward,"" she told the New York Post on Tuesday.
Her lawyer, Brian Premo, said Commisso intended to pursue a civil case against Cuomo. 

Commisso's complaint was the most serious individual case discussed in the state attorney general's report that led to Cuomo's downfall, although news reports said the U.S. Justice Department began investigating whether there was a pattern of Cuomo harassing female employees.
Other county prosecutors have investigated some of the other individual complaints and declined to bring charges.

GAZA (Reuters) - A Palestinian prisoner on Tuesday ended a hunger strike that lasted nearly five months after Israel agreed not to extend his detention, his family and Palestinian officials said, although Israeli officials did not confirm a deal had been made.
Hisham Abu Hawash, 40, was arrested by Israel in October 2020 and began his hunger strike in protest of his detention without charge. 
An Israeli security official speaking on condition of anonymity described him as an operative of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group and said he was ""arrested for involvement in terrorist activity"".
Abu Hawash was hospitalized in December. The Islamic Jihad threatened to launch attacks against Israel if he died, raising concerns of renewed violence after an 11-day war in May between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza.
""We congratulate the free (man), Abu Hawash,"" Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), ""for gaining his freedom by force of his will."" 
Abu Hawash's lawyer Jawad Boulos said Israel had agreed not to extend his detention beyond Feb. 26. Egypt helped mediate the deal, Palestinian officials said. Dozens gathered outside Abu Hawash's home in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron to celebrate.
Abu Hawash accepted the terms, his family said. 
Spokespeople for Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, the Shin Bet domestic security agency, the military and the Prisons Authority did not immediately comment. 
Abu Hawash is one of hundreds of Palestinians in Israeli ""administrative detention,"" in which suspects in militant activities can be held for up to 60 days without charge. That period can be extended if a court approves.

Israel says such measures are required to prevent violence in cases where there is insufficient evidence to prosecute, or where going to court would risk exposing the identity of secret informants.
The United Nations, European Union and rights groups have criticised the practice.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -A Hong Kong court sentenced a barrister and activist to 15 months in prison on Tuesday for inciting an unauthorised assembly to commemorate those who died in China's 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in and around Beijing's Tiananmen Square. 
Chow Hang-tung, of the since-closed Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, was arrested the day before the June 4 anniversary of the crackdown last year.
Police have banned Hong Kong's annual Tiananmen vigils for the last two years, citing coronavirus restrictions. 
But coming after the mass pro-democracy protests in 2019, many activists saw the bans as an attempt to shut down displays of defiance to Beijing. Authorities denied that was the reason.
Despite the ban, thousands lit candles across the city in 2020, and smaller crowds did the same in 2021.
Chow's charge relates to social media posts titled ""Lighting a candle is not a crime: Stand one's ground,"" and her Ming Pao newspaper article titled ""Candlelight carries the weight of conscience and the Hong Kong people persevere in telling the truth.""
Magistrate Amy Chan said she found the posts and article were meant ""to encourage, persuade, make suggestions to and put pressure on members of the public,"" and ""amounted to inciting others to knowingly take part in an unauthorised assembly.""
Chan added the assembly caused ""a public health risk."" 
Chow, 36, who represented herself, had pleaded not guilty, saying she wanted to ""incite others not to forget June 4,"" not to encourage a gathering.
Chan said she found the argument ""simply unbelievable,"" adding Chow's academic qualifications would have allowed her to be more clear in her writing.
""It can be foreseen that the public space to discuss June 4 will disappear entirely,"" a tearful Chow told the court after the verdict. ""Tyranny is greedy, red lines will keep expanding.""
Last month, eight pro-democracy activists were sentenced to up to 14 months for their role in the 2020 vigil. Among them, Chow received a 12-month sentence.
Five months of the sentence announced on Tuesday will run concurrently, meaning Chow will only serve 10 months in addition to her previous sentence.
STATUES REMOVED, MUSEUM CLOSED
Sixteen other activists are already serving sentences of 4-10 months related to the 2020 vigil. Two democracy campaigners facing similar charges, Nathan Law and Sunny Cheung, had fled Hong Kong before they were charged.
Chow also faces charges of inciting subversion under a security law imposed by Beijing in 2020. The Alliance dissolved amid that investigation, with police accusing it of being an ""agent of foreign forces,"" which the group had denied.
Asked to comment on Chow's sentence, a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said ""the United States condemns actions by the Hong Kong Government to stifle protected freedoms, including freedom of assembly and freedom of speech.""
The United States and its allies would continue to insist that Beijing honours its commitments to those freedoms, the spokesperson said.
The former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of wide-ranging freedoms, traditionally holds the largest June 4 vigil in the world.
But commemorations have become increasingly difficult. Last month, top international universities across the global financial hub removed Tiananmen monuments, including the ""Pillar of Shame"" https://www.reuters.com/world/china/hong-kong-university-fences-off-tiananmen-statue-campus-2021-12-22 in the University of Hong Kong and the ""Goddess of Democracy"" https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/two-more-tiananmen-monuments-removed-hong-kong-university-campuses-2021-12-24 at Chinese University..

A June 4 museum was raided by police during the investigation into the Alliance and shut, and its online version cannot be accessed in Hong Kong. https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/access-website-dedicated-tiananmen-victims-appears-restricted-hong-kong-2021-09-30
China has never provided a full account of the 1989 crackdown. The death toll given by officials days later was about 300, most of them soldiers, but rights groups and witnesses say thousands may have been killed.

CAPE TOWN (Reuters) -Authorities said on Tuesday they had finally contained a suspected arson fire at South Africa's parliament building after a second-day flare-up that completely destroyed the lower house National Assembly chamber. 
A 49-year-old man accused of setting the fire appeared in court to face five charges including arson and possession of an explosive device. A lawyer for suspect Zandile Christmas Mafe said he denied the accusations and would plead not guilty.
The National Assembly in the New Wing of the parliament complex was ""completely destroyed from bottom right through to the top,"" Cape Town City Chief Fire Officer Ian Schnetler told journalists. ""It is going to take a lot of rehabilitation to get that back to where it was.""
In a statement, city officials said the fire had been brought under control at midnight.
""Teams are now working their way through the maze-like building, room-for-room, as they attempt to locate and extinguish"" hot spots, the statement said. 
""This is a lengthy process, as some rooms are needing to have their interior wooden cladding pulled apart, in order to identify any concealed hot spots.""
The fire initially broke out on Sunday. By Monday, authorities had withdrawn some fire trucks and said they were putting out embers, only for the flames to flare up again causing more extensive damage to the New Wing. 
The fire also caused the partial collapse of the roof of the Old Wing, which dates back to 1884 and houses the upper chamber, the National Council of Provinces.
Magistrate Zamekile Mbalo ordered suspect Mafe, a resident of Cape Town's largest township Khayelitsha, held in custody for seven days until Jan. 11 for a bail hearing. Prosecutors said they would oppose bail.
Eric Ntabazalila, spokesperson for the Western Cape Province's National Prosecuting Authority, declined to say what kind of explosive device was found with Mafe. Authorities have not disclosed any possible motive for setting the blaze.

""My client denies and rejects these charges and therefore he is pleading not guilty and he will continue to plead not guilty,"" Mafe's lawyer Luvuyo Godla told journalists on the steps of Cape Town Magistrate's court.
Officials have said important sections of the complex were saved, including a museum with art works and heritage objects, and an embroidered tapestry telling the story of the Eastern Cape on the ground floor of the Old Assembly Building.

(Reuters) - U.S. authorities have arrested a Colombian man for his alleged involvement in the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moise, an American law enforcement official told Reuters, adding that the man will make an initial court appearance on Tuesday.
The arrest of the former military officer paves the way for the first criminal charges in the brazen murder, which triggered a political crisis in the Caribbean nation. Haitian authorities have arrested 45 people in connection with the crime but have not formally charged anyone.
Mario Palacios is scheduled to make an initial appearance in federal court in Miami on Tuesday afternoon, the law enforcement official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
The arrest was first reported by the Miami Herald, which added that Palacios would face charges of ""conspiracy to provide material support resulting in the death of a foreign leader, and conspiracy to kidnap and kill a foreign leader.""
The official confirmed the Herald's account. 
The U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the case.
""Prime Minister Ariel Henry wants justice to prevail in the villainous assassination of Jovenel Moise,"" said a spokesman for the prime minister's office when asked about the arrest.
Haitian authorities identified Palacios as being part of a group of former Colombian soldiers who participated in the July raid on Moise's residence. 
Palacios was detained in Jamaica in October and was being deported back to Colombia on Monday when he was arrested https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/colombian-suspected-involvement-killing-haiti-president-held-panama-sources-2022-01-04 in Panama, according to two people familiar with the matter.
A Panamanian official who asked not to be further identified said Palacios had expressed the intention of turning himself in to U.S. authorities. Panama's migration authority has not responded to requests for comment
Colombia's national police said on Tuesday that they had coordinated with Panamanian and U.S. authorities to enforce an Interpol red notice against Palacios, adding that he was sent to Florida on Monday night after a meeting with FBI personnel.

Critics in Haiti have complained of slow progress, intimidation and witness tampering in that country in the investigation of Moise's killing.

LONDON (Reuters) -British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said that England could withstand a surge in COVID-19 infections without shutting down the economy as Britain reported another record daily high in cases, fuelled by the Omicron variant. 
Johnson has resisted imposing stringent lockdown measures in England, betting that a vaccine booster drive and caution among the population would be enough to constrain the latest wave.
The United Kingdom reported 218,724 new COVID cases on Tuesday, a new record for the number of cases reported on a single day - although a figure that also was skewed by reporting lags over the holidays.
Johnson said he was sticking to the ""Plan B"" measures introduced in England last month, which included the wearing of face coverings on public transport and in shops but did not restrict gatherings or close businesses.
""Together with the Plan B measures that we introduced before Christmas, we have a chance to ride out this Omicron wave without shutting down our country once again. We can keep our schools and our businesses open, and we can find a way to live with this virus,"" Johnson said.
""But the weeks ahead are going to be challenging, both here in the UK and across the world. There is no escaping the fact that some services will be disrupted by staff absences,""
Johnson has warned that hospitals would face considerable pressure in coming weeks and on Tuesday announced daily COVID-19 testing for 100,000 critical workers. [L8N2TK3TC]
While admissions have risen since mid-December, they have not tracked the trajectory of daily cases, possibly reflecting the impact of vaccines and booster shots, the likely lower severity of Omicron and the time lag in people going into hospital.
Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said that the mortality rate had not risen with the increase in cases, while Johnson said that over 60% of people in intensive care with COVID had not received a vaccine.
Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, said that the pattern in hospitalisations may change as the Omicron wave seeps into older age groups.

""Hospitalisations are still generally going up across the country, and we may see high levels for some weeks,"" he told BBC Radio.
""Vaccination is holding up in terms of protection against severe disease, assisted by the fact that Omicron almost certainly is substantially less severe, but it still puts pressures on the health system.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian COVID-19 cases soared to a pandemic record on Tuesday as the Omicron variant ripped through most of the country, driving up hospitalisation rates as the once-formidable testing regime buckled under lengthy wait times and stock shortages.
The country which for a year and half used a system of constant testing, contact tracing and lockdowns to squash most outbreaks, clocked 47,799 new infections, up nearly a third on Monday's number which was also a record.
Political leaders have pointed to a largely successful, if slow, vaccination rollout and few deaths, relative to new case numbers - four on Tuesday. But hospitalisations, another closely watched measure, are higher than at any other time in the pandemic: 1,344 in the most populous state New South Wales.
In Victoria, the second state, the authorities said one in four people showing up for a swab test was returning a positive result. Almost everyone in that state's intensive care units was unvaccinated, the authorities said. Victoria had 14,020 new cases, nearly double the previous day's count.
Other states which had spent much of the pandemic with domestic borders closed and long stretches without a new case, showed similar numbers. A month ago, Queensland reported a day with six new cases; on Tuesday it recorded 5,699.
Across the country, political leaders have been re-shaping their messaging for a population that is more than 90% vaccinated and a variant that some medical experts say is more transmissable but less virulent than previous strains.
After nearly two years of campaigning for widespread testing, the authorities want asymptomatic people to bypass government-funded clinics, where high volumes have blown out turnaround times to several days, and take their own rapid antigen tests.
But that has brought a new pressure point: an explosion in sales of home testing kits, resulting in reports of stockpiling, empty shelves and inflated prices on the few kits which have not yet been sold. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has ruled out subsidising the personal testing kits, citing a heightened role for ""personal responsibility"".
""The problem at the moment is that the lack of (rapid antigen tests) is completely hampering 'personal responsibility' and it is a frustration that is a glaring hole in the current management of COVID,"" Chris Moy, vice president of the Australian Medical Association, told ABC Radio on Tuesday, using Morrison's phrase.
Opposition leader Anthony Albanese, who most polls suggest will defeat Morrison at an election due within months, said that ""when it comes to healthcare, and rapid antigen testing, the prime minister has said that you are on your own"".
The country's competition regulator said it would set up a team to look into complaints about allegations of price gouging https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/australian-regulator-review-price-hike-covid-19-antigen-tests-2022-01-04 for the at-home rapid antigen tests. 
Despite the spike in infections fuelled by Omicron, dual-dose vaccination levels of nearly 92% in people above 16 have helped Australia to keep the death rate lower than the previous virus outbreaks. 
Authorities do not specify the coronavirus variant that caused the deaths, although New South Wales officials said 74% of patients in the state's intensive care units since Dec. 16 were infected with the Delta variant.
The record spike in infections and hospitalisations comes as 2 million more Australians became eligible for their COVID-19 booster shots from Tuesday after authorities shortened the wait time between second and third shots to four months. 

Just over 2.5 million Australians have so far received their booster shot, which health officials hope will keep rates of death and serious illness low.
Australia crossed half a million coronavirus cases since the pandemic began, with nearly 50% in the last two weeks. Still, its 547,160 cases and 2,270 deaths, from a population of 25 million, are lower than numbers seen in many developed countries.

The club, which had long said they would never change the Redskins name, softened their stance in mid-2020 after a naming rights sponsor to their suburban stadium in Landover, Maryland urged the NFL team to rebrand.
The team said they would be known as Washington Football Team while they worked to finalize a replacement name and logo.
""We can't wait to hit the ground running with our team name and identity on a clear path -- one without distracting obstacles, legal or otherwise,"" team president Jason Wright said in a statement.
""And while we've always understood it would be a nearly impossible task to select a name that all of our fans would identify with as their first pick, we are very excited about our final selection, which aligns with our values, carries forth our rich history, represents the region and, most importantly, is inspired and informed by you, our fans.""
Wolves and RedWolves had been popular suggestions among fans during the rebranding process.
""Once we began looking into Wolves ... we became aware of a notable challenge: trademarks held by other teams would limit our ability to make the name our own,"" Wright said.

The team that became the Washington Redskins was founded in 1932 as the Boston Braves. Its name was changed to the Redskins the following year and it moved to Washington in 1937. Many American professional and collegiate sports teams have nicknames on Native American themes.
The team have won three Super Bowls and are one of the NFL's marquee franchises, ranked by Forbes last August as the league’s fifth most valuable franchise at $4.2 billion.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Nineteen people from China's Uyghur Muslim ethnic group filed a criminal complaint with a Turkish prosecutor on Tuesday against Chinese officials, accusing them of committing genocide, torture, rape and crimes against humanity.
Lawyer Gulden Sonmez said it was necessary because international bodies had not acted against Chinese authorities, who have been accused of facilitating forced labour by detaining around a million Uyghurs and other primarily Muslim minorities in camps since 2016. 
China initially denied the camps existed, but has since said they are vocational centres and are designed to combat extremism. It denies all accusations of abuse.
About 50,000 Uyghurs - with whom Turks share ethnic, religious and linguistic connections - are believed to reside in Turkey, the largest Uyghur diaspora outside Central Asia.
The complaint was filed with the Istanbul Chief Prosecutor's Office.
China's embassy in Turkey and the prosecutor's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
""The international criminal court should have already started this trial, but China is a member of the (United Nations) Security Council and it does not seem possible within this dynamic,"" Sonmez said outside the city's main courthouse.
Surrounding the lawyer were more than 50 people holding photos of missing family members and signs calling for the prosecution of Chinese officials. Some waved the blue-and-white flags of the independence movement of East Turkestan, a group Beijing says threatens the stability of its far western region of Xinjiang.
The complaint relates to 116 people who the complainants say are still detained in China and was filed against 112 people, including members of the Chinese Communist Party, directors and officers at labour camps.
""Turkish legislation recognises universal jurisdiction. Torture, genocide, rape (and) crimes against humanity can be prosecuted in Turkish courts and criminals can be tried,"" Sonmez said. 
'RESCUE MY SISTER'
Medine Nazimi, one of those who filed the criminal complaint, said her sister had been taken away in 2017 and she had not been heard from since.
""My sister and I are Turkish citizens so I want my government to rescue my sister,"" Nazimi said.
Some of the Uyghurs living in Turkey have criticised Ankara's approach to China after the two nations agreed an extradition treaty. Turkey's foreign minister said in March the deal was similar to those Ankara has with other states and denied it would lead to Uyghurs being sent back to China.
Some Turkish opposition leaders have accused the government of overlooking Uyghur rights in favour of other interests with China, which the government denies.

President Tayyip Erdogan told his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in July that it was important to Turkey that Uyghur Muslims lived in peace as ""equal citizens of China"", but said Turkey respected China's national sovereignty.
U.N. experts and rights groups estimate more than a million people, mainly from the Uyghur and other Muslim minorities, have been detained in recent years in camps in Xinjiang.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Authorities in India's capital Delhi on Tuesday ordered people to stay home over coming weekends, with COVID-19 cases quadrupling in a week.
Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, the most senior elected official in the capital's administration, was one of the 37,379 new COVID-19 cases reported in India in the space of 24 hours. 
Kejriwal, who announced his infection the day after addressing an election rally https://twitter.com/ArvindKejriwal/status/1477938357153927170 without a mask, is among scores of political leaders - including Prime Minister Narendra Modi - holding events across India in front of large crowds.
In the northeasterly Manipur state, Modi addressed several hundred people at an election rally, many sitting in close proximity with their masks pulled down.
In Uttar Pradesh, the ruling party and opposition groups also held big gatherings where many went without masks.
Mega-rallies last year helped the Delta variant to wreak havoc https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/exclusive-scientists-say-india-government-ignored-warnings-amid-coronavirus-2021-05-01 in India, and with several state elections due in coming months, health experts and the public are growing worried.
India's daily case load was the highest since September and experts suspect the highly transmissible Omicron variant has begun to overtake Delta, although hospital admissions have not jumped yet.
Delhi is reporting more than 4,000 cases a day, and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said that, although most patients were showing mild or no symptoms and recovering fast, people would be required to stay indoors on Saturdays and Sundays.
On weekdays, most offices will have to ensure that half their employees work from home, he told a media briefing.
Delhi, India's financial capital Mumbai and the technology hub Bengaluru have already imposed curbs on movement during the night, and some cities have also closed schools and colleges.
Kejriwal, who addressed a rally in the state of Uttarakhand, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) he had isolated at home with mild symptoms and urged anyone he had recently been in contact with to do likewise and take a test for COVID-19.

The federal government has encouraged local authorities to impose movement curbs if more than 5% of COVID-19 tests are positive. Delhi registered a 6% infection rate on Monday.
India has so far recorded 482,017 official deaths from COVID-19.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has scheduled a special meeting of allied ambassadors and top Russian officials for next week as both sides seek dialogue to prevent open conflict over Ukraine, a NATO official said on Tuesday.
Alarmed by Russia's military build-up along Ukraine's border, the Western military alliance has been seeking a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council for months but the forum seemed in jeopardy after an espionage dispute in October. 
The meeting of the council, a format used for dialogue since 2002, will take place in Brussels on Jan. 12 after U.S. and Russian officials hold security talks on Jan. 10 in Geneva.
The European Union's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, flew to Ukraine on Tuesday for a two-day trip to show support for Kyiv, which aspires to join the bloc and NATO. 
In preparation for next week's diplomacy, NATO foreign ministers will hold a video conference on Friday at 1300 GMT, chaired by Stoltenberg, the alliance said in a statement.
Moscow wants guarantees that NATO will halt its eastward expansion and end military cooperation with Ukraine and Georgia, which have territorial disputes with Russia. 
Moscow also denies U.S. assertions that it is planning an invasion of Ukraine and accuses Kyiv of building up its own forces in the east of the country.
""Any dialogue with Russia would have to proceed on the basis of reciprocity, address NATO's concerns about Russia's actions... and take place in consultation with NATO's European partners,"" the NATO official said of the Jan. 12 meeting.
Maria Zakharova, Russia's foreign ministry spokesperson, confirmed that Russian officials will attend the NATO-Russia Council meeting in Brussels.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and other senior Russian officials are expected to attend the Brussels talks, after meeting U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman in Geneva.
On Jan. 13, talks will continue in the broader format of the Vienna-based Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which includes the United States and its NATO allies, as well as Russia, Ukraine and other former Soviet states.
The EU's Borrell, who was central to the bloc's strategy of increased sanctions on top Russian officials in 2021, believes ""the EU cannot be a neutral spectator in the negotiations if Russia really wants to discuss Europe's security architecture"", according to an EU spokesperson.

The European Union sees Ukraine as a ""strategic partner"", the spokesperson said.
Borrell, accompanied by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, will visit Ukraine's contact line with Russian-backed separatist rebels during his visit. EU foreign ministers are expected to discuss their next steps later in January.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress' probe of the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol by Donald Trump supporters soon begins weeks of public hearings that will put the investigation in the spotlight as campaigning intensifies for the November elections.
The probe into the worst attack on Congress since the War of 1812 has largely played out behind closed doors so far. The House of Representatives Select Committee on Jan. 6 has interviewed more than 300 witnesses about the violence by Trump supporters seeking to overturn his election defeat and Trump's response to it.
The committee's members are racing to finish their work before elections on Nov. 8. The seven Democrats and two Republicans know their efforts could be shut down if Republicans take back a majority of the House as forecasters believe is likely. Media coverage of the hearings could become campaign fodder.
House Republican leadership refused to take part in the probe as about 55% of Republican voters https://www.reuters.com/world/us/georgia-governors-race-tests-trumps-stolen-election-claims-2021-12-20 now believe former President Trump's claims that his defeat was the result of widespread fraud. Multiple courts have rejected that contention but it has nonetheless spurred a wave of new state limits on voting. 
The House probe is moving in parallel to the Justice Department's prosecution https://tmsnrt.rs/3HyfyEg of about 725 accused rioters on charges ranging from disorderly conduct to conspiracy. About 165 people so far have pleaded guilty to taking part in the attack and the first trials could begin next month.
Members of the House committee warn that the false claims of voter fraud that inspired the violence are also undermining faith in the U.S. democratic system.
""Our democracy was inches from ruin,"" Representative Bennie Thompson, the committee's chairman, said at a congressional hearing last month. ""We want to figure out why and share that information with the American people.""
'TO HELL AND BACK'
The Select Committee is tasked with investigating and reporting on what led to the attack, in which Trump supporters assaulted police, smashed windows and sent members of Congress and then-Vice President Mike Pence running for their lives.
The committee is aiming to release an interim report in the summer of 2022 and a final report in the fall, a source familiar with the investigation said.
""We will be conducting multiple weeks of public hearings, setting out for the American people in vivid color exactly what happened, every minute of the day on Jan. 6, here at the Capitol and at the White House, and what led to that violent attack,"" Republican Representative Liz Cheney said last month.
The only public hearing so far, held in July, featured testimony https://www.reuters.com/world/us/police-who-defended-us-capitol-testify-riot-probes-first-hearing-2021-07-27 from four police officers about the physical and verbal assaults they faced responding to Capitol riots.
""I feel like I went to hell and back to protect the people in this room,"" said then-District of Columbia police officer Michael Fanone, referring to lawmakers. ""The indifference shown to my colleagues is disgraceful,"" Fanone added, slamming his hand onto the witness table.
Around 140 police officers were assaulted during the riot, according to the Justice Department. One officer who battled rioters died the day after the attack and four who guarded the Capitol later died by suicide. Four rioters also died, including one who was shot by police as she tried to climb inside the building through a shattered window.
A CRIMINAL REFERRAL
Trump has loomed large in the committee's work since the beginning, and that focus has become more apparent in recent weeks.
During a Dec. 13 hearing, Cheney read text messages sent by Trump supporters to his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, imploring the then-president to speak out against the violence.
Cheney said the committee wants to ask Meadows: ""Did Donald Trump, through action or inaction, corruptly seek to obstruct or impede Congress' official proceeding to count electoral votes?""
Cheney was pointing to a specific statute — a felony in the U.S. criminal code — and suggesting Trump might have violated it.
Ultimately, the Justice Department will decide whether to charge Trump, but the committee could issue a ""criminal referral,"" increasing the political pressure on Attorney General Merrick Garland to act.
In November the Justice Department charged Trump ally Steve Bannon with ""contempt of Congress,"" a misdemeanor offense, after he defied a Select Committee subpoena for his testimony. Bannon has vowed to fight the charges, saying he has a lawful basis for declining to testify.

The committee has recommended similar charges against two other Trump allies.
Trump is separately under investigation by state prosecutors in Georgia over whether he unlawfully pressured election officials to change the vote tally in his favor.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A former North Korean defector who made a risky and rare cross-border return home last week had struggled in South Korea, officials and media reports said on Tuesday, sparking fresh debate over how such defectors are treated in their new lives.
South Korea's military identified the man who crossed the heavily armed Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) separating the two Koreas on Saturday as a North Korean who defected to the South in a similar area just over a year ago. 
The man's plight shed new light on the lives of re-defectors and raised questions about whether they had received adequate support after making the dangerous journey from the impoverished, tightly controlled North to the wealthy, democratic South.
The re-defector was in his 30s and making a poor living while working as a janitor, a military official said. 
""I would say he was classified as lower class, barely scraping a living,"" the official said, declining to elaborate citing privacy concerns. 
Officials, who said they saw little risk of the man being a North Korean spy, have launched an inquiry into how he evaded guards despite being caught on surveillance cameras hours before crossing the border.
North Korean officials have not commented on the incident and state media have not reported it.
LITTLE INTERACTION
South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported police in the northern Seoul district of Nowon who provided safety protection and other care to him raised concerns in June over his possible re-defection, but no action was taken due to a lack of concrete evidence. 
Police declined to comment. An official at Seoul's Unification Ministry handling cross-border affairs said on Tuesday the re-defector had received government support for personal safety, housing, medical treatment and employment. 
The man had little interaction with neighbours, and was seen throwing away his belongings a day before he crossed the border, Yonhap reported. 
""He was taking out a mattress and bedding to garbage dumps on that morning, and it was strange because they were all too new,"" a neighbour was quoted by Yonhap as saying. ""I thought about asking him to give it to us, but ended up not doing that, because we've never said hi to each other."" 
As of September, around 33,800 North Koreans had resettled in South Korea, daring a long, risky journey - usually via China - in pursuit of a new life while fleeing poverty and oppression at home. 
Since 2012, only 30 defectors are confirmed to have returned to the North, according to the Unification Ministry. But defectors and activists say there could be many more unknown cases among those who struggled to adapt to life in the South. 
About 56% of defectors are categorised as low income, according to ministry data submitted to defector-turned-lawmaker Ji Seong-ho. Nearly 25% are in the lowest bracket subject to national basic livelihood subsidies, six times the ratio of the general population. 

In a survey released last month by the Database Center For North Korean Human Rights and NK Social Research in Seoul, around 18% of 407 defectors polled said they were willing to return to the North, most of them citing nostalgia. 
""There's a complex range of factors including longing for families left in the North, and emotional and economic difficulties that emerge while resettling,"" the Unification Ministry official said, vowing to examine policy and improve support for defectors.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A woman who has sued Britain's Prince Andrew for sexual abuse agreed in a 2009 civil settlement with Jeffrey Epstein to restrictions on her ability to sue others, language that could potentially impact whether the lawsuit against the prince goes forward.
The settlement was made public on Monday as part of Virginia Giuffre's 2021 civil lawsuit against Andrew, whom she accuses of forcing her to have sex two decades ago when she was 17. Andrew has denied the accusation and said Giuffre's 2009 deal with Epstein shields him from any liability. 
The deal also provided for Giuffre, also known as Virginia Roberts, to be paid $500,000.
It will now be up to U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in New York to determine whether the clause in the 2009 pact blocks Giuffre's lawsuit against Andrew. The litigation is in its early stages, and Kaplan has said it could go to trial between September and December of 2022 if no settlement is reached.
A hearing over Andrew's motion to dismiss the civil lawsuit is scheduled for Tuesday.
Giuffre in May 2009 sued Epstein, alleging he sexually assaulted her in 1998 when she was 15. She also said that she was ""required to be sexually exploited by (Epstein's) adult male peers, including royalty, politicians, academicians"" and others. The lawsuit was dismissed in December 2009.
Andrew argued in a 2021 court filing that the settlement agreement shielded him from liability because he fell into the category of ""royalty"" from liability. Andrew said the settlement was intended to protect ""any and all persons who Giuffre identified as potential targets of future lawsuits.""
The agreement released on Monday in federal court in Manhattan said ""any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant from all, and all manner of, action and actions of Virginia Roberts"" was released from liability.
Andrew's lawyers on Monday declined comment on the filing. 
David Boies, an attorney for Giuffre, called the liability release ""irrelevant"" to Giuffre's claim against Andrew. 
""The release does not mention Prince Andrew. He did not even know about it,"" Boies said in a statement. ""The reason we sought to have the release made public was to refute the claims being made about it by Prince Andrew's PR campaign.""
Giuffre said in her lawsuit against Andrew that he forced her to have sex at the London home of former Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell and at two of Epstein's homes. 
Andrew, 61, has moved to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing Giuffre is seeking a ""payday"" from her accusations against Epstein and his associates. The prince has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing.
Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 at the age of 66 while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges.
Andrew gave up many royal duties in November 2019, saying that his association with Epstein had become a ""disruption to my family's work.""

Giuffre's lawsuit is separate from the criminal trial against Maxwell that concluded last week. Maxwell, 60, was convicted https://www.reuters.com/world/us/maxwell-jury-resume-deliberations-after-judge-warns-omicron-risk-2021-12-29 of recruiting and grooming girls for Epstein to abuse between 1994 and 2004.
Giuffre's claims did not form the basis of any of the charges Maxwell faced and she did not testify for either side during the three-week criminal trial.

It said that the five countries - which are the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council - consider it their primary responsibility to avoid war between the nuclear states and to reduce strategic risks, while aiming to work with all countries to create an atmosphere of security.
""We affirm that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought,"" the English-language version of the statement read.
""As nuclear use would have far-reaching consequences, we also affirm that nuclear weapons — for as long as they continue to exist — should serve defensive purposes, deter aggression, and prevent war.""
Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu said the joint statement could help increase mutual trust and ""replace competition among major powers with coordination and cooperation,"" adding that China has a ""no first use"" policy on nuclear weapons, state news agency Xinhua reported.
France also released the statement, underscoring that the five powers reiterated their determination for nuclear arms control and disarmament. They would continue bilateral and multilateral approaches to nuclear arms control, it said.
The statement from the so-called P5 group comes as bilateral relations between the United States and Moscow have fallen to their lowest point since the end of the Cold War, while relations between Washington and China are also at a low over a range of disagreements. 
The Pentagon in November sharply increased https://www.reuters.com/world/pentagon-sharply-raises-its-estimate-chinese-nuclear-warheads-2021-11-03 its estimate of China's projected nuclear weapons arsenal over the coming years, saying Beijing could have 700 warheads by 2027 and possibly 1,000 by 2030.
Washington has repeatedly urged China to join it and Russia in a new arms control treaty.
Geopolitical tensions between Moscow and Western countries have increased over concerns about Russia's military buildup near neighbouring Ukraine. Moscow says it can move its army around its own territory as it deems necessary.
Last Thursday U.S. President Joe Biden told https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/biden-speak-with-ukraine-president-sunday-white-house-2021-12-31 his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, that a possible move on Ukraine would draw sanctions and an increased U.S. presence in Europe. 

U.S. and Russian officials will hold security talks https://www.reuters.com/world/us-russian-officials-set-security-talks-jan-10-us-official-2021-12-28 on Jan. 10 to discuss concerns about their respective military activity and confront rising tensions over Ukraine, the two countries said.

Henry's office said on Monday that ""bandits and terrorists"" had tried to shoot the prime minister at a church in the northern city of Gonaives where the ceremony marking the 218th anniversary of independence was taking place.
Video footage broadcast on social media showed Henry and his entourage scrambling toward their vehicles as an armed group began shooting outside the cathedral in Gonaives.
Haitian media pointed to possible gang involvement in the shooting, which they said killed one person and injured two more.
Gangs' hold on parts of Haiti has strengthened since the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in July.
Police, who called Saturday's attack the work of ""armed groups,"" were unable to immediately confirm casualties. Prior to the incident, a local gang boss had made threats against Henry in local media.
The prime minister's office said arrest warrants had been issued for the suspects who fired on Henry's convoy.

The attack has renewed concerns about the safety of officials in Haiti since Moise's assassination.
Henry, whose administration is facing mounting challenges to its legitimacy, was sworn in as prime minister barely two weeks after Moise's killing at the hands of suspected mercenaries. The country has yet to set a date to elect Moise's successor.

SAO PAULO/BRASILIA (Reuters) -Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was hospitalized on Monday with an intestinal blockage and may need to undergo surgery in the latest complication from a 2018 stabbing.
Bolsonaro said he started feeling unwell on Sunday afternoon after lunch and doctors have inserted a nasogastric tube. Medical officials described his condition as stable and improving.
""More tests will be conducted for a potential surgery on an internal obstruction in the abdominal region,"" Bolsonaro posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), along with a photo of himself giving a thumbs-up in his hospital bed.
Bolsonaro said it was the second hospitalization ""with the same symptoms"" since he was stabbed https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-election-bolsonaro-idUSKCN1LM2YJ during a September 2018 campaign event and underwent a series of emergency operations.
Vila Nova Star hospital confirmed in a medical note that Bolsonaro was admitted to the hospital in the early hours of Monday with an intestinal blockage.
""He is in stable condition, undergoing treatment,"" it said. ""At the moment, there is no forecast for him being discharged.""
In a separate statement in the evening, Vila Nova Star said that Bolsonaro was improving and that he had taken a brief walk in a hallway. The hospital added that he was not suffering from fever-like symptoms or abdominal pain, but that it was not yet clear if he would need surgery.
TV network Globo showed images of Bolsonaro, who had been vacationing in the southern state of Santa Catarina, walking down the stairs of the presidential plane after landing in Sao Paulo around 1:30 a.m. local time (0430 GMT).

In July 2021, he was taken to the Vila Nova Star hospital in Sao Paulo due to an intestinal blockage after suffering from chronic hiccups https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-president-bolsonaro-hospitalized-brasilia-says-source-2021-07-14.

Democratic President Joe Biden attempted to scrap his Republican predecessor's policy - often referred to as 'Remain in Mexico' - soon after taking office last January.
But after Texas and Missouri sued, a federal judge ruled it had to be reinstated. The Biden administration restarted https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-restart-trump-era-border-program-forcing-asylum-seekers-wait-mexico-2021-12-02 the program in early December in El Paso, Texas. On Monday, 36 migrants were brought to the El Paso immigration court, the first to have their hearings under the reinstated program, the officials said.
The administration last week asked https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-asks-us-supreme-court-hear-remain-mexico-case-2021-12-29 the U.S. Supreme Court whether it needed to continue to implement the policy, officially called the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP). Under the policy, put in place by former President Donald Trump, migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexican border to seek asylum must wait in Mexico for their cases to be decided, instead of being allowed to await their hearings in the United States.

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in October that the Trump program had ""endemic flaws"" and ""unjustifiable human costs."" 
The U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, has called for ending the program, saying it puts asylum seekers at risk and harms their due process rights.

(Reuters) - A court in Ontario, Canada, has awarded C$107 million ($83.94 million), plus interest, to the families of six people who died when the Iranian Revolutionary Guards downed a Ukraine International Airlines plane near Tehran two years ago.
Iran shot down the airliner in January 2020. All 176 people onboard were killed, including 55 Canadian citizens and 30 permanent residents.
The six family members awarded compensation by the Ontario court lost spouses, siblings, children, nieces and nephews aboard Flight 752, their lawyer, Mark Arnold, said in a statement on Monday. They had filed a civil lawsuit against Iran and other officials they believe were to blame for the incident.
The lawyer said his team will look to seize Iranian assets in Canada and abroad. He said Iran has oil tankers in other countries and his team will be looking to seize whatever it can to pay what the families are owed.
The decision by Justice Edward Belobaba of Ontario's Superior Court of Justice was dated Dec. 31 and announced by Arnold on Monday.
The case was filed by Shahin Moghaddam, Mehrzad Zarei and Ali Gorji. Fearing reprisals from Iran, some of the other plaintiffs withheld their names, CBC News reported earlier.
A special Canadian forensic team had produced a report in mid-2021 that accused Iran of incompetence and recklessness over the downing of the Ukrainian passenger plane. Iran criticized the report as being ""highly politicized"".
The report found that while the shooting down of Ukrainian International Airlines flight 752 had not been premeditated, it did not absolve Iranian officials of responsibility for the incident.
Iran admitted it shot down the airliner shortly after takeoff from Tehran in January 2020 and blamed a ""disastrous mistake"" by forces on high alert during a confrontation with the United States.

At the time, Iran was on edge about possible attacks after it fired missiles at Iraqi bases housing U.S. forces in retaliation for the killing days before of its most powerful military commander, Qassem Soleimani, in a U.S. missile strike at Baghdad airport.

Iran and groups allied with it in Iraq and other countries have been holding events to honour Soleimani, the commander of the Quds Force, the overseas arm of the elite Revolutionary Guards. He was killed in Iraq in a drone strike on Jan. 3, 2020, ordered by then President Trump.
""If Trump and (former secretary of state Mike) Pompeo are not tried in a fair court for the criminal act of assassinating General Soleimani, Muslims will take our martyr's revenge,"" Raisi said in a speech on Monday.
""The aggressor, murderer and main culprit - the then president of the United States - must be tried and judged under the (Islamic) law of retribution, and God's ruling must be carried out against him,"" Raisi added.
Under Iran's Islamic laws, a convicted murderer can be executed unless the family of the victim agree to take ""blood money"" through a reconciliation. 
Iranian judicial officials have communicated with authorities in nine countries after identifying 127 suspects in the case, including 74 U.S. nationals, Prosecutor-General Mohammad Jafar Montazeri told state television.
""The criminal former president (Trump) is at the top of the list,"" he said. 
On Sunday, Iran urged the United Nations Security Council in a letter to hold the United States and Israel, which Tehran says was also involved in the killing, to account, Iranian media said.
Days after the assassination, the United States told the United Nations that the killing was self-defence. The then U.S. Attorney General William Barr said Trump clearly had the authority to kill Soleimani and the general was a ""legitimate military target"".
Hundreds of supporters of Iran-backed militia groups gathered on Sunday at Baghdad international airport to mark the anniversary of Soleimani's death and to chant anti-American slogans.
Two armed drones were shot down on Monday as they approached an Iraqi military base hosting U.S. forces near Baghdad's international airport, Iraqi security sources said.

Late on Sunday, Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi movement seized a United Arab Emirates-flagged cargo vessel which it said was engaged in ""hostile acts"" but which the Saudis said was carrying hospital equipment. 
In Israel on Monday, the Jerusalem Post newspaper said its website had been hacked in what it called an apparent threat to the country, with an illustration that appeared to recall Soleimani.

(Reuters) - The White House was expected to make a fresh push as early as Monday to persuade the U.S. Senate to confirm President Joe Biden's nominees for top posts at agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission, an administration official said.
The attempt will involve renewing the nominations for Gigi Sohn at the FCC, Alvaro Bedoya at the FTC and Alan Davidson to head the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, said the official, who did not wish to be named. The nominations, which expired when the December session of Congress ended, will help Senate Democrats move forward with the confirmations.
The nominations have been held up due to Republican opposition. The delay has kept Democrats from having a majority at these agencies and acting on priorities such as robust antitrust enforcement and net neutrality rules.
Sohn - a former senior aide to Tom Wheeler, who served as FCC chairman under then-President Barack Obama - faces the most opposition from Republicans and has not received a vote from the Senate Commerce Committee.
Biden waited more than nine months to make nominations for the FCC, which has not been able to address some key issues because it currently has one vacancy and is split 2-2 between Democrats and Republicans.

The Senate Commerce Committee deadlocked 14-14 on the nomination of Bedoya for the FTC in December but under its rules it can proceed to the full Senate for a vote. The FTC is also split between the two parties. 
Davidson cleared the Senate Commerce Committee by voice vote late last year to head the NTIA but his nomination may require a formal roll-call vote on the Senate floor due to opposition from some Republicans.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati Monday said criticism of Saudi Arabia by the leader of Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah group did not serve the national interest or represent the country's official stance.
Saudi Arabia and a number of other Gulf Arab states withdrew ambassadors and expelled Lebanese envoys in October and November over what the kingdom later said was arch-foe Hezbollah's dominance of the Lebanese state. 
In a speech, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah accused Saudi Arabia's king of terrorism on Monday.
""King, the terrorist is the one who has exported ... Daeshi ideology to the world, and it is you,"" Nasrallah said, using an acronym for Islamic State, the hardline Islamist group that declared a caliphate straddling parts of Syria and Iraq in 2014. 
Mikati responded in a statement, distancing himself from the Hezbollah leader.
""What ... Nasrallah said about the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia this evening does not represent the position of the Lebanese government and most Lebanese. It is not in Lebanon's interest to offend any Arab country, especially the Gulf states.
""For God's sake, have mercy on Lebanon and the Lebanese people and stop the hateful sectarian and political rhetoric.""
Lebanese officials including President Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, and Mikati have called for dialogue with Saudi Arabia to resolve the diplomatic crisis, which has piled onto an economic meltdown now in its third year. 
Saudi Arabia has called on Lebanon to end ""terrorist Hebzollah's"" influence over the state. Mikati's government contains several ministers backed by Hezbollah and its ally the Amal movement. 

Mikati formed a government in September with the aim of negotiating an International Monetary Fund (IMF) support programme and kickstarting economic recovery.
But he has been unable to convene Cabinet since Oct. 12 amid demands by Hezbollah and Amal to limit the probe into the deadly August 2020 Beirut blast.

CAPE TOWN (Reuters) -A new blaze broke out on Monday at the complex housing the two chambers of South Africa's national parliament in Cape Town, one day after a devastating fire swept through the buildings.
""The fire and rescue service confirms that the fire at parliament has flared up. The void beneath the roof sheeting of the National Assembly is on fire,"" a spokesman for the city's fire services said on Monday afternoon.
Police have charged a 49-year-old man with arson and other offences including theft, and he was expected to appear in court on Tuesday.
National Assembly speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula said the arson, if confirmed, would represent an attack on the country's democracy.
The initial fire on Sunday caused the roof of the New Wing housing the assembly's lower chamber to collapse. The roof of the Old Wing, which dates back to 1884 and houses the upper chamber National Council of Provinces (NCOP), also partially collapsed.
However, important sections including a museum with artworks and heritage objects were saved, as was an embroidered tapestry telling the story of the Eastern Cape on the ground floor of the Old Assembly Building, officials said.
Earlier on Monday firefighters had managed to extinguish most of the initial blaze. As the new fire flared, parliament said firefighters had been reinforced with additional equipment and personnel.
A Reuters journalist at the scene said the speed of the wind, a key factor in the Cape's fire season, had increased significantly and could hamper attempts to douse flames.
A city update released around 10 p.m. local time (2000 GMT)said the fourth and fifth floors of the new wing, above the national assembly, were ""completely gutted"" as wind-fanned flames threatened historic Tuynhuys, the Cape Town office of President Cyril Ramaphosa.
""Heavy duty, aerial firefighting (equipment) have just arrived, that can operate within the current strong winds,"" city officials said. 
The parliament has played a crucial role in South Africa's transition from white minority rule as the place where transformative legislation has been passed, helping roll back repressive policies implemented under the apartheid era.
In a separate statement, the elite Hawks police said the suspect was believed to have gained entry to the parliament through a window in one of the offices.

""There is a possibility of other charges being added as there was a security breach here,"" Hawks spokesperson Nomthandazo Mbambo told eNCA television.
Speaker Mapisa-Nqakula said President Ramaphosa's address to parliament, set for Feb. 10, would still go ahead. Lawmakers will still debate and approve the budget and committees will continue their work, parliamentary officials said.

""The way forward for the country as a whole is to continue with the path that we are on,"" he told broadcasters. ""Of course we will keep all measures under review, but the mixture of things that we are doing at the moment is I think the right one."" 
Despite a huge surge in infections, Johnson has so far mainly resisted imposing new restrictions in England, which accounts for more than 80 percent of the UK population. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which control their own rules, have imposed some new measures.
Johnson said pressure on hospitals would be ""considerable"" in the next couple of weeks, but Omicron was ""plainly milder"" than previous variants, and the country was in a stronger position than it was earlier in the pandemic.
Britain had a ""very, very high level"" of vaccination, he said, and it was continuing to build up its defences with the booster programme.
""The majority of people who are in ICU (intensive care) have not been vaccinated and the vast majority - about 90% - have not been boosted,"" he said during a visit to a vaccination centre in Buckinghamshire, south east England.

Johnson imposed limited measures in England, known as ""Plan B"", last month, including the wearing of face coverings on public transport and in shops, but stopped short of ordering restrictions on gatherings or closing businesses.
The government said on Sunday that older school children in England would be required to wear face coverings when they return after the Christmas break.

The ship was heading to the Saudi port of Jizan, just north of Yemen, from the Yemeni Red Sea island of Socotra when it was attacked just before midnight on Sunday, Saudi state news agency SPA reported, quoting coalition spokesman Brigadier General Turki al-Malki.
Saudi Arabia is leading a military coalition that has been battling the Houthis for more than six years. The alliance has accused the Houthis of attacking shipping in the Red Sea, one of the world's busiest maritime lanes leading to the Suez Canal.

The Houthis' military spokesman, Yahya Sarea, confirmed seizure of the vessel which he said was carrying military equipment and engaged in ""hostile acts targeting the security and stability of the Yemeni people"". He added that the crew, ""of different nationalities"", were still on board.
In a press briefing broadcast on the group's Masirah TV, Sarea shared photos and videos that he said they were of the seized ship showing armoured vehicles, weapons and ammunition. He added the vessel had been taken to the Houthi-controlled port of Salif, north of Hodeidah.
SPA said the vessel was carrying equipment from a shuttered field hospital.
The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said late on Sunday it had received reports of an attack on a vessel near Yemen's port of Ras Isa, which lies slightly north of Hodeidah, and an investigation was under way.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - The United States has urged Sudanese leaders to ensure civilian rule and end violence against anti-military protesters after Abdalla Hamdok resigned as prime minister, throwing a transition towards elections deeper into uncertainty. 
Hamdok, an economist and former United Nations official widely respected abroad, had served as prime minister under a military-civilian power-sharing deal that followed the overthrow of former leader Omar al-Bashir in 2019. 
The military dissolved his government in an October coup, but he returned a month later under a deal to form a government of technocrats ahead of 2023 elections.
Hamdok resigned on Sunday after being unable to forge a consensus to bring the transition forward.
""After PM Hamdok's resignation, Sudanese leaders should set aside differences, find consensus and ensure continued civilian rule,"" the U.S. State Department's Bureau of African Affairs tweeted.
Some Sudanese were saddened by the loss of a leader whom they said stood out for his wisdom. Others, still angry with Hamdok for returning after the coup, expressed their resolve to end military rule.
""Hamdok didn't achieve what we needed him to but he also didn't come out and tell us what the roadblocks were so that we could rally around him and support him,"" said Najat, a pharmacist in Khartoum. 
Mayada Khairi, an activist, said: ""Whether he comes or goes makes no difference for us because our issue became bigger and our war became bigger ... we will continue the revolutionary line."" 
'TURBULENT TIMES'
Jibril Ibrahim, a former rebel leader who served as finance minister under Hamdok but expressed support for the military before the coup, lamented his resignation.
""Our nation needs political compromise today more than ever to navigate safely through these turbulent times. There is a room to accommodate everyone.""
Hamdok's resignation came hours after the latest mass rallies against the military. At least 57 civilians have been killed as security forces have moved to contain or disperse demonstrations since the Oct. 25 coup, according to medics aligned with the protest movement. 
Further protests are planned for Tuesday.
Hamdok had been an important partner for foreign nations as Sudan sought to emerge from decades of isolation and sanctions under Bashir and to end an economic crisis, with Western backing.
The United Nations Special Representative in Sudan, Volker Perthes also regretted Hamdok's decision, adding that the crisis risked further derailing progress made since the uprising that helped topple Bashir. 
The U.S. State Department said any new appointments should follow the power-sharing deal struck in 2019.

""Sudan's next PM and cabinet should be appointed in line with the constitutional declaration to meet the people's goals of freedom, peace, and justice,"" it said. 
""Violence against protesters must cease.""

442,"<span>Jan 03, 2022 08:41AM ET</span>","(Reuters) - Sudan's Abdalla Hamdok has resigned as prime minister, six weeks after returning to his post following a military coup in October.
The move deepens uncertainty around Sudan's political future and a transition towards elections since the 2019 downfall of long-serving ruler Omar al-Bashir.
WHY DID HAMDOK RESIGN?
Hamdok https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/sudans-abdalla-hamdok-2022-01-02 had served as prime minister for more than two years under a power-sharing arrangement between civilians and the army, until the military toppled him in October, accusing politicians of hostility to the army.
Under an agreement to partly reverse that coup, he returned to lead a government of technocrats, intended to serve until elections in 2023. But his deal with the military was opposed by key political parties and by the protest movement that had brought down Bashir. 
Hamdok had said he would only stay in his post only if he could mobilise political support. But on Jan 2 in a televised address he said he had been unable to unite polarised factions sufficiently to be able to move forward with the transition.
""To our armed forces and all the military apparatus: the people are the ultimate authority,"" he said.
CAN HE BE REPLACED?
Though democracy activists questioned whether Hamdok's consensus-building style could work amid the political turmoil of Sudan's transition, he was widely respected at home and a key partner for the international community.
Military leaders worked hard to persuade him to come back after the coup, and it is unclear what other figures they might call on next. 
DOES THIS MEAN FULL MILITARY CONTROL?
Since Hamdok's return on Nov. 21, he rolled back some appointments to senior state posts made by the military after the coup, including Bashir-era veterans.
Whether these reversals stick will be one test of the military's intentions. 
High-profile pro-democracy figures including several former ministers had been released, though arrests of protesters have continued, as have dispersals of demonstrations by security forces using tear gas and live rounds. Medics say dozens of people have been killed since October.
""Resistance committees"" organising the protests and most prominent political parties say they reject negotiation or partnership with the military.
WHY DOES IT MATTER?
The fate of the transition will determine the balance of power in Sudan, a country of 46 million people in which a popular uprising had carved a way out from decades of autocracy, internal conflict and economic isolation under Bashir.
Hamdok's government had secured agreement for relief on more than $56 billion in foreign debt - a step thrown into doubt by the coup. It had carried out painful economic reforms that it said were starting to bear fruit against a backdrop of shortages and widespread poverty. 

It had also agreed to take steps to follow other Arab states in normalising ties with Israel. Transitional authorities had struck a partial peace deal with rebels in Sudan's south and in Darfur, where unrest and displacement has increased.
Sudan's course will have a bearing on a volatile region bordering the Sahel, the Red Sea and the Horn of Africa where international powers are vying for influence. The conflict in Ethiopia's Tigray region sent tens of thousands of refugees into Sudan one year ago, and renewed tensions over farmlands on the neighbours' disputed border.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong independent online publication Citizen News said on Monday its decision to shut down was triggered by the closure of a pro-democracy media outlet last week following a police raid and seven arrests.
Stand News, a prominent pro-democracy news site, closed last week after 200 police officers raided its newsroom, froze its assets and arrested seven people on suspicion of conspiring to publish seditious material.
Citizen News said on Sunday it will cease operations from Tuesday, describing the media environment in the Chinese-ruled city as ""deteriorating,"" and citing the need to ensure the safety of its staff.
""The decision was made within a short period of time. The trigger point was the fate of Stand News,"" Chris Yeung, chief writer at Citizen News and former president of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, told reporters.
""We could not rule out that ... we might be exposed to some risks.""
Established in 2017, Citizen News described itself as independent, with no party affiliation and promoting freedom, openness, diversity and inclusion. It had 40 employees.
Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise that wide-ranging individual rights, including a free press, would be protected. But rights groups and some Western governments say freedoms have been eroded, in particular since Beijing imposed a national security law on Hong Kong in 2020.
Hong Kong's government denies targeting the media and curbing freedoms in the global financial hub. China says rights advocacy is being used as an attempt to disrupt Hong Kong's progress after the security law restored stability.
Stand News was the most prominent remaining independent pro-democracy publication in Hong Kong after a national security investigation in June 2021 led to the closure of jailed tycoon Jimmy Lai's Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily newspaper.

Two former senior editors of Stand News were charged on Thursday with conspiracy to publish sedition materials and denied bail. 
""What changed is not us, but the outside environment,"" Citizen News Chief Editor Daisy Li told reporters.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said on Sunday that Israel would offer a fourth dose of COVID-19 vaccine to people over 60 and to medical staff as it faces a surge in Omicron variant infections.
Israel last week approved a fourth dose of the vaccine developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech, a second booster, for people who are immune-compromised and the elderly living in care homes.
""We now have a new layer of defence,"" Bennett said in a televised news conference, adding that Israel's top government medical official, whose approval is needed to expand the booster campaign, had signed off on the latest move.
""Israel will once again be pioneering the global vaccination effort,"" Bennett said.
Earlier, the Health Ministry's Director-General Nachman Ash said Israel could reach herd immunity as Omicron infections mounted and Merck & Co's molnupiravir anti-viral pill was approved for use in COVID-19 patients over 18.
Herd immunity is the point at which a population is protected from a virus, either through vaccination or by people having developed antibodies by contracting the disease.
The highly transmissible Omicron variant has caused a wave of coronavirus cases, with worldwide infections hitting a record high, with an average of just over one million cases detected each day between Dec. 24 and 30, Reuters data showed.
Deaths, however, have not risen to the same degree, raising hopes that the new variant is less lethal, a view Bennett also echoed in describing the second booster as largely a bid to prevent serious illness among the elderly. 
Daily cases in Israel are expected to reach record highs in the coming three weeks. Bennett said that up to 50,000 people might soon be infected each day, while eligibility for testing could be tightened to help relieve long lines at testing stations.
""The (infection) numbers will have to be very high in order to reach herd immunity,"" Ash told 103 FM Radio earlier. ""This is possible but we don't want to reach it by means of infections, we want it to happen as a result of many people vaccinating.""
The head of the health ministry's coronavirus task force, Salman Zarka, said herd immunity was far from guaranteed, because experience over the past two years showed that some COVID-19 patients who recovered were later reinfected.
Israel's health ministry says around 60% of its 9.4 million population are fully vaccinated, almost all with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which means they have either received three doses or have recently had their second.

But hundreds of thousands of those eligible for a third inoculation have so far not taken it. 
Over the past 10 days, daily infections have more than quadrupled. Severe cases have also climbed, but at a far lower rate, rising from about 80 to around 100.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in vowed on Monday to use his last months in office to press for a diplomatic breakthrough with North Korea, despite public silence from Pyongyang over his attempts for a declaration of peace between the two sides.
""The government will pursue normalisation of inter-Korean relations and an irreversible path to peace until the end,"" Moon said in his final New Year's address before his five-year term ends in May. ""I hope efforts for dialogue will continue in the next administration too."" 
In his own address on New Year's Eve, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made no mention of Moon's calls for a declaration officially ending the 1950-1953 Korean War, or of stalled denuclearisation talks with the United States.
Moon held multiple summits with Kim, including once in Pyongyang, during a flurry of negotiations in 2018 and 2019, before talks stalled amid disagreements over international demands that the North surrender its arsenal of nuclear weapons, and Pyongyang's call for Washington and Seoul to ease sanctions and drop other ""hostile policies.""
Moon is pushing an ""end of war declaration"" as a way to jumpstart those stalled negotiations and his administration has hinted at backchannel discussions.
But North Korea has not publicly responded to the latest push, and the United States has said it supports the idea but may disagree with the South over its timing.
""It is true that there is still a long way to go,"" Moon acknowledged, but argued that if inter-Korean relations improve, the international community will follow.
Moon said his outreach to North Korea had been enabled by a large military buildup https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/moons-push-military-independence-may-echo-far-beyond-his-presidency-2021-10-22 that helped make South Korea safer.
""Peace is possible on strong security,"" he said.

The COVID-19 pandemic overshadowed the standoff with North Korea, as Pyongyang put the country into an unprecedented lockdown and Moon faced domestic pressure to tamp down the first major coronavirus outbreak outside of China in early 2020.
Since then, South Korea used aggressive tracking and tracing, as well as social distancing rules and a belated but thorough vaccination campaign to keep overall cases and deaths relatively low by global standards.

Hamdok, who had failed to name a government as protests continued against the military takeover in October, said a roundtable discussion was needed to produce a new agreement for Sudan's political transition.
""I decided to give back the responsibility and announce my resignation as prime minister, and give a chance to another man or woman of this noble country to ... help it pass through what's left of the transitional period to a civilian democratic country,"" Hamdok said in a televised address.
The announcement throws Sudan's political future even deeper into uncertainty, three years after an uprising https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/sudans-political-strife-2022-01-02 that led to the overthrow of long-time leader Omar al-Bashir.
An economist and former United Nations official widely respected by the international community, Hamdok https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/sudans-abdalla-hamdok-2022-01-02 became prime minister under a power-sharing agreement between the military and civilians following Bashir's overthrow.
Ousted and placed under house arrest by the military during a coup on Oct. 25, he was reinstated in November.
But the deal for his return was denounced by many in the civilian coalition that had previously supported him and by protesters who continued to hold mass demonstrations against military rule.
RISK OF 'DISASTER'
On Sunday Hamdok said he had tried in vain to forge a consensus between deeply divided factions that would have allowed for the completion of a peace process signed with some rebel groups in 2020, and the preparation of elections in 2023. 
""I have tried as far as I am able to spare our country the danger of slipping into disaster,"" Hamdok said. ""Despite all that was done to bring about the desired and necessary agreement to fulfill our promise to the citizen of security, peace, justice and an end to bloodshed, this did not happen."" 
In the latest rallies on Sunday, hours before Hamdok's speech, security forces fired tear gas at demonstrators in Khartoum as protesters marched toward the presidential palace.
At least three people were killed, bringing to 57 the death toll in protests since the Oct. 25 coup, a doctors' committee aligned with the protest movement said. Six died and hundreds were injured in nationwide demonstrations on Thursday.
The military has said it will allow peaceful protests, and will hold to account those found responsible for violence. 
Among the economic reforms Hamdok oversaw were the removal of costly fuel subsidies and a sharp devaluation of the currency. 

Those enabled Sudan to qualify for relief on at least $56 billion of foreign debt and a long-running economic crisis had shown signs of easing. The coup put the debt relief deal in doubt and froze extensive Western economic backing for Sudan. 
On his return as prime minister in November, Hamdok said he wanted to preserve the economic steps taken by the transitional government and halt bloodshed after rising numbers of casualties from the crackdown on protests.

WILMINGTON/, De. (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden on Sunday told Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy the United States and its allies will ""respond decisively"" if Russia further invades Ukraine, the White House said in a statement.
The call came days after Biden held a second conversation https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/biden-speak-with-ukraine-president-sunday-white-house-2021-12-31 in a month with Russian President Vladimir Putin amid tensions on Russia's border with Ukraine, where Russia has massed some 100,000 troops.
""President Biden made clear that the United States and its allies and partners will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine,"" White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said in a statement following the call. 
Biden and Zelenskiy discussed preparations for a series of upcoming diplomatic meetings to address the crisis, according to the White House. 
Zelenskiy said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that they discussed joint actions on keeping peace in Europe and preventing further escalation. 
""The first international talk of the year with @POTUS proves the special nature of our relations,"" Zelenskiy tweeted. He said the joint actions of Ukraine, the United States ""and partners in keeping peace in Europe, preventing further escalation, reforms, deoligarchization were discussed. We appreciate the unwavering support of Ukraine.""
Representatives from U.S. and Russia are set to hold talks on Jan. 9-10 in Geneva, followed by Russia-NATO Council talks and a meeting of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.
Biden has said he told Putin it was important for the Russians to take steps toward easing the crisis before those meetings. 
Putin’s foreign affairs adviser told reporters last week that Putin warned Biden that pursuit of sanctions ""could lead to a complete rupture of relations between out countries and Russia-West relations will be severely damaged.""

Kremlin officials have stressed they want guarantees that any future expansion of NATO must exclude Ukraine and other former Soviet countries. The Russians have demanded that the military alliance remove offensive weaponry from countries in the region.
Biden expressed support for diplomatic measures to ease tensions while also reaffirming ""the United States’ commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" the White House said.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Russian jets bombed areas near the northwestern Syrian city of Idlib on Sunday, witnesses and rebel sources said, marking a new year flare-up for the last opposition-held bastion.
War planes flying at high altitude, which tracking centres said were Russian Sukhoi jets, dropped bombs on several towns and a main water pumping station serving the overcrowded city of Idlib, whose wider population is more than a million.
No immediate comment was available from Russia or the Syrian army, which says it targets the hideouts of militant groups who control the region but deny any attacks on civilians.
An official at the city's water utility service said it was out of action as a result of the strikes. 
A senior U.N. official who confirmed the water station was ""badly damaged"" in an air strike said such attacks worsened the humanitarian plight of millions of displaced Syrians. 
""Continued destruction of civilian infrastructure will only cause more suffering of civilians. Attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure must stop,"" U.N. deputy regional humanitarian coordinator Mark Cutts said in a tweet.
Witnesses said the strikes in the last 24 hours in the rebel-held enclave also hit livestock and poultry farms close to the Bab al Hawa border crossing with Turkey. 
""The Russians are focusing on infrastructure and economic assets. This is to add to the suffering of people,"" Abu Hazem Idlibi, an official in the opposition administration, said.
Other targets included villages in the Jabal al-Zawiya region in the southern part of Idlib province, with no immediate reports of casualties, residents and rescuers said.
A series of raids after midnight on Saturday hit makeshift camps that house thousands of displaced families near Jisr al Shuqhur, west of Idlib with two children and a woman were killed and 10 civilians wounded, the civil defence service said.

There has been a relative lull in air strikes since November after a renewed Russian-led campaign followed by Turkish army reinforcements inside the enclave raised the prospect of a wider resumption of violence.
A deal brokered nearly two years ago between Russia, which backs Syrian President Bashar al Assad's forces, and Turkey, which supports opposition groups, ended fighting that had displaced more than a million people within a few months.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean has crossed the heavily fortified border in a rare defection to North Korea, South Korea's military said on Sunday.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said it carried out a search operation after detecting the person around 9:20 p.m. (1220 GMT) on Saturday on the eastern side of the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) separating the two Koreas.
""We've confirmed that the person crossed the Military Demarcation Line border about 10:40 p.m. (1340 GMT) and defected to the North,"" the JCS said. 
The JCS said it could not confirm whether the person was alive, but sent a notice to the North via a military hotline asking for protection. 
The border crossing, which is illegal in South Korea, came as North Korea carries out strict anti-coronavirus measures since shutting borders in early 2020, though it has not confirmed any infections. 
A public and political uproar emerged after North Korean troops shot dead a South Korean fisheries official who went missing at sea in September 2020, for which Pyongyang blamed anti-virus rules and apologised.
Two months earlier, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared a national emergency and sealed off a border town after a North Korean defector who he said had COVID-19 symptoms illegally crossed the border into the North from the South.
The North's prolonged lockdowns and restrictions on inter-provincial movement have also pushed the number of North Korean defectors arriving in the South to an all-time low.

Cross-border relations soured after denuclearisation negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington stalled since a failed summit in 2019. 
South Korea and a U.S.-led U.N. force are technically still at war with North Korea since the 1950-1953 Korean War ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty.

For years Leakey served in various roles in the government including as director of the state-run National Museums of Kenya and twice as board chairman at the Kenya Wildlife Service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta said Leakey had ""served our country with distinction"". 
""Besides his distinguished career in the public service, Dr. Leakey is celebrated for his prominent role in Kenya's vibrant civil society where he founded and successfully ran a number of institutions.""
Leakey was the son of palaeontologists Louis and Mary Leakey, whose work helped demonstrate that human evolution began in Africa. He was celebrated for his work to save wildlife from poachers and for leading campaigns against the ivory trade. 
Paula Kahumbu, a wildlife conservationist who heads WildlifeDirect, told Reuters she had been mentored by Leakey, as had many other young Kenyans.
""Very courageous, he was a person who stood for integrity whether it was in wildlife conservation, whether it was related to archaeological and paleoanthropological research at museums or whether it was related to politics,"" she said. 
Leakey also served Kenya's head of civil service from July 1999 to March 2001, at a time when then president Daniel Arap Moi was under pressure from donors to tackle corruption and other inefficiencies in government.
He was a co-founder of the Safina Party in 1995.

At the time of his death, he was serving as chairman of the Turkana Basin Institute at Stony Brook University in the United States, which works to facilitate research and education in palaeontology and archaeology in northern Kenya.
Leakey was also a fellow of the UK-based Royal Society and an honorary fellow of the African Academy of Sciences.

(Reuters) -The congressional committee investigating last year's Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol is looking at issuing subpoenas to Republican members of Congress to force their cooperation, the panel's chairman said on Sunday.
Representative Bennie Thompson, a Democrat, said on NBC's ""Meet The Press"" that the committee is examining whether it can lawfully issue subpoenas to sitting members of Congress.
""I think there are some questions of whether we have the authority to do it,"" Thompson said. ""We're looking at it. If the authorities are there, there'll be no reluctance on our part.""
Thompson chairs the House of Representatives Select Committee on Jan. 6, which is expected to hold public hearings and issue reports in the coming months.
The committee is trying to establish then-President Donald Trump's actions while thousands of his supporters attacked police, vandalized the Capitol and sent members of Congress and then-Vice President Mike Pence running for their lives. Congress had been meeting to count the electoral votes that gave Democrat Joe Biden victory in the November 2020 presidential election.
Multiple people close to Trump, including conservative media TV hosts, urged him during the riot to make a televised speech telling his supporters to stop the attack. Trump waited hours before releasing a prerecorded message.
Representative Liz Cheney, the panel's Republican vice chair and a harsh critic of Trump, told ABC News he had committed ""dereliction of duty"" on Jan. 6 and the panel should consider ""enhanced penalties"" for that kind of action. The American people, she said, need to understand ""how dangerous Donald Trump was.""
The committee sent a letter on Dec. 22 to Representative Jim Jordan, a Republican and ardent Trump ally, asking for testimony about his telephone conversations with Trump on Jan. 6.
Jordan said in a recent Fox News interview that he had ""real concerns"" about the committee's credibility, but was reviewing its letter to him.
The request came two days after a similar letter to Republican Representative Scott Perry.
The committee requested Perry's testimony about Trump's attempts to oust Jeffrey Rosen, who was acting head of the U.S. Justice Department during the closing weeks of his presidency, and replace him with Jeffrey Clark, an official who at the time was trying to help Trump overturn his election defeat.

Perry declined to cooperate, posting on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on Dec. 21 that the committee ""is illegitimate, and not duly constituted.""
An appeals court ruled earlier last month that the committee was legitimate and entitled to see White House records Trump has tried to shield from public view.

CAPE TOWN (Reuters) -A fire at the South African parliament caused extensive damage on Sunday, collapsing the roof and gutting an entire floor in one building and a man in his 50s was arrested in connection with the blaze.
The fire broke out in the early morning and authorities said the sprinkler system appeared to have been tampered with and so did not work. By afternoon, firefighters were still trying to contain the blaze in one of the several buildings that make up the parliament complex in the legislative capital, Cape Town.
A person was arrested inside parliament, Public Works and Infrastructure Minister Patricia De Lille told reporters, adding that the case had been handed over to an elite police unit called the Hawks.
""It's the role of the Hawks to investigate any attack on political institutions,"" De Lille said.
Parliament said in a statement the suspect was a man in his 50s.
There were no reports of any injuries. 
The cause of the blaze was not yet known but De Lille said that according to a report that she received, a standard maintenance fire drill had been conducted just before parliament closed for the Christmas and New Year holidays and everything including the sprinklers was working.
""What was discovered this morning is that somebody has closed one of the valves and so then there was no water to trigger that automatic sprinkler system coming on,"" De Lille said, adding that CCTV footage confirmed that somebody was in the building from the early hours of the morning. 
President Cyril Ramaphosa told reporters after visiting the site that parliament's work would continue despite the blaze. He also praised firefighters for saving a ""very important national asset of our government"".
PARTLY CONTAINED
The parliamentary complex, some of which dates back to 1884, consists of a cluster of buildings. The National Assembly, or lower House of Parliament, is situated in what is known as the New Wing. 
The upper house, or National Council of Provinces (NCOP), is located in what is called the Old Wing or Old Assembly, which is also used for committee meetings.
""The fire has been contained in the Old Wing. Firefighters are currently trying to control the fire in the New Wing, where the fire has affected the National Assembly Chamber,"" parliament said in a statement.
Jean-Pierre Smith, a Cape Town mayoral committee member responsible for safety and security, said the roof of the old building had collapsed, and added the fire had gutted the third floor of the building, including office space and the gymnasium. 
He also told reporters that the parliament's fire alarm only rang when firefighters were already on site.
By afternoon smoke had partially subsided after billowing for hours from the roof and entrance of the National Assembly. But City of Cape Town fire services chief Jermaine Carelse said the fire was still active, and was now concentrated on the first and third floor.
The fire, which started just before 6 a.m., was the second at the parliament in less than a year. In March there was a blaze caused by an electrical fault.

""It is egregious that such a thing happened in the first place, there must be no question about it. Whether it was a result of security breaches, which may be apparent to some people, we don't know,"" Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly Lechesa Tsenoli said.
National Assembly Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula told reporters that Ramaphosa's state of the nation address to a joint session of parliament would go ahead as planned on Feb.10 but an alternative venue would have to be used.

Prime Minister Naftali Bennett met his national security adviser and other experts to discuss efforts to contain the outbreak and prevent it passing into humans. So far no human transmission has been reported, Bennett's office said.
Israeli media said children who had visited the reserve may have touched a stricken crane and thus contributed to the spread of the flu.
""This is the worst blow to wildlife in the country's history,"" Environment Minister Tamar Zandberg tweeted as rangers in hazardous material suits collected carcasses of the cranes from the lake at the Hula Nature Reserve and outlying marshes. 

Hundreds of thousands of chickens had been culled, she said.
Authorities were looking to ease import quotas and bring in eggs from abroad to head off an egg shortage due to the cull.

Junior European Affairs Minister Clement Beaune, who on Friday had said the flag would remain for ""several days"", said it had been taken down as planned.
""It was scheduled that the flag was to be taken down this Sunday, we hadn't established an exact time"", Beaune told France Inter radio.
He dismissed the idea that the government had given in after far-right leader Marine Le Pen on Saturday said she would appeal to France's Council of State to remove the EU flag.
""The government has been forced to remove the EU flag from the Arc de Triomphe, a beautiful patriotic victory at the start of 2022"", Le Pen said on Sunday.
""We didn't back down, there was no change of plan ...I fully assume France's destiny is in Europe,"" Beaune said.
He said Le Pen and other leaders had got it all wrong when they said the EU flag had supplanted the French flag as the latter is not permanently displayed on the Arc de Triomphe.

French President Emmanuel Macron, who has yet to say if he will run for re-election in April, defeated Le Pen in a 2017 run-off by 66%-34%.
Most polls show there will be a rematch between the two in the upcoming presidential election, with Macron expected to win again, albeit with a slimmer margin.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility from Gaza militants for the rocket firing or comment from Hamas, the Islamist armed group that rules the coastal Palestinian enclave.
Hamas has occasionally test-fired rockets, launching them toward the sea. Hamas-affiliated Paltimes news website said, however, that Saturday's launch was probably a malfunction. 
After dark fell, Israel's military said it struck at ""terrorist targets in the Gaza Strip"".
Hamas Radio said some of the group's security posts and a training camp were struck by Israeli aircraft and tanks. There were no casualties.
In a rare countermeasure, Hamas’s Aqsa TV said militants fired two surface-to-air missiles towards Israeli planes. Israel’s military confirmed that a missile had been launched at one of its planes, which was unscathed. 

In Gaza, Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem blamed Israel for the escalation.
The Israel-Gaza frontier has been largely quiet since an 11-day war in May. But on Wednesday, gunfire from Gaza that wounded an Israeli civilian drew tank fire from the Israeli military, wounding three Palestinians.

DENVER (Reuters) - Three people are missing and feared dead after a wind-stoked wildfire roared through two towns in Boulder County, Colorado, prompting thousands of evacuations and destroying nearly 1,000 homes, authorities said on Saturday.
Officials initially said there were no reports of fatalities or missing residents following the rare urban wildfire that erupted Thursday morning on the northern outskirts of the Denver metropolitan area.
Wind gusts in excess of 100 miles per hour (160 kph) pushed flames eastward into the towns of Superior and Louisville, prompting the evacuation of both communities.
In about two hours, the fire had scorched 6,000 acres, officials said.
Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said the three missing people, whom he declined to identify, all lived in homes that were consumed by the blaze. 
""The structures where these folks would be are completely destroyed and covered with about eight inches of snow,"" Pelle said at a Saturday news briefing, adding cadaver dogs will be deployed on Sunday to search the dwellings.
Pelle said 991 homes in Superior, Louisville and in unincorporated parts of the county have been destroyed, making it the most destructive wildfire in state history in terms of residences lost.
Officials initially said sparks from downed power lines that were toppled by the gale-force winds may have sparked the blaze, but an inspection by utility company  Xcel Energy  (NASDAQ:XEL) found no damaged or downed lines near the fire's believed origin.

Pelle said detectives are investigating all avenues to determine what ignited the conflagration. Acting on a tip, the sheriff said a search warrant was issued in connection to the probe, but declined to offer any details.
U.S. President Joe Biden has declared the scene a national disaster, freeing up federal funds to assist affected people and businesses in recovery efforts, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said in a statement.

(Reuters) -With just over a month until the Beijing Winter Olympics opening ceremony the CEO of the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) said he is increasingly concerned if the Games can go ahead as planned.
""We're worried,"" COC CEO David Shoemaker told the CBC in a New Year's eve interview. ""We're confident that these Games can still be scheduled safely. 
""But we're taking it day-by-day and wake up every morning to make sure that is how we still feel about it.""
The National Hockey League (NHL) last month said it would not send players to the men's ice hockey tournament citing the pandemic's ""profound disruption"" to its schedule.
As of Saturday the NHL had postponed 90 games for COVID-19 related reasons.
Other winter sports have also experienced disruptions to events that serve as Olympic qualifiers, including alpine skiing, bobsleigh and curling.
Shoemaker said that if the COC believes athlete safety is compromised it will not hesitate to pull the plug on Beijing as it did in March 2020 when they decided not to send a team to the Tokyo Summer Olympics if they were to go ahead as scheduled.
The Tokyo Games were later delayed for one year.
""We have yet to have a conversation with the IOC (International Olympic Committee) about postponement but we're having conversations on a very frequent basis with the participating winter sport nations and it may well come up,"" said Shoemaker.
The greatest concern currently for the COC is getting athletes into the Beijing bubble without testing positive for COVID-19 and face three-to-five weeks quarantine in China.

""Medical experts agree, and the consensus point of view is that it may well be that the safest place from Omicron in February will be the Olympic bubble in Beijing,"" said Shoemaker.
""The real challenge for us over the next 30 days is how do we make sure that Canadian participants can get to Beijing without contracting the virus and therefore become able to test negative to get into that scenario.""

The National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party Lopez Obrador heads had governed the municipality until recently before it fell back to the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, that has long ruled it.

In order to start an investigation, the prosecutor's office needs a complaint he said has so far not been presented.

Lopez Obrador remains popular in Mexico, with his approval rating at 64.3%, according to the latest Mitofsky poll on Saturday.

Atlacomulco city council did not immediately respond to requests for information on the incident. 
In the past, Lopez Obrador has said that he does not agree with the erection of images of his person.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) -Pope Francis used his New Year's message on Saturday to issue a clarion call for an end to violence against women, saying it was insulting to God.
Francis, 85, celebrated a Mass in St. Peter's Basilica on the day the Roman Catholic Church marks both the solemnity of Holy Mary Mother of God as well as its annual World Day of Peace.
Francis appeared to be in good form on Saturday following an unexplained incident on New Year's Eve where he attended a service but at the last minute did not preside over it as he had been expected to.
At the start of the Mass on Saturday, he walked the entire length of the central aisle of basilica, as opposed to Friday night, when he emerged from a side entrance close to the altar and watched from the sidelines. 
Francis suffers from a sciatica condition that causes pain in the legs, and sometimes a flare up prevents him from standing for long periods. 
Francis wove his New Year's homily around the themes of motherhood and women - saying it was they who kept together the threads of life - and used it to make one of his strongest calls yet for an end to violence against them.
""And since mothers bestow life, and women keep the world (together), let us all make greater efforts to promote mothers and to protect women,"" Francis said. 
""How much violence is directed against women! Enough! To hurt a woman is to insult God, who from a woman took on our humanity - not through an angel, not directly, but through a woman,"" he said, in a reference to Jesus's mother Mary.
During an Italian television programme last month, Francis told a woman who had been beaten by her ex-husband that men who commit violence against women engage in something that is ""almost satanic"".
Since the COVID-19 pandemic began nearly two years ago, Francis has several times spoken out against domestic violence, which has increased in many countries since lockdowns left many women trapped with their abusers.
Public participation at the Mass was lower than in some past years because of COVID restrictions. Italy, which surrounds Vatican City, reported https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/italy-reports-record-144243-coronavirus-cases-155-deaths-2021-12-31 a record 144,243 coronavirus related cases on Friday and has recently imposed new measures such as an obligation to wear masks outdoors. 

In the text of his Message for the World Day of Peace, issued last month, Francis said nations should divert money spent on armaments to invest in education, and decried growing military costs at the expense of social services.
The annual peace message is sent to heads of state and international organisations, and the pope gives a signed copy to leaders who make official visits to him at the Vatican during the upcoming year.

French health authorities reported 219,126 new confirmed cases in a 24-hour period, the fourth day in a row that the country has recorded more than 200,000 cases.
France joined the United States, India, Brazil, Britain and Russia in having had more than 10 million cases.
Saturday's figure was the second highest after the 232,200 record on Friday when French President Emmanuel Macron warned the next few weeks would be difficult.
In his New Year's Eve address, Macron did not mention a need for more restrictive health measures than those already announced, adding that the government should refrain from further limiting individual freedoms.
But the government said earlier on Saturday that from Monday wearing masks in public spaces would be mandatory for children as young as six versus 11 before.
And some big cities, including Paris and Lyon, have re-imposed wearing of masks in the street for everyone.
The seven-day moving average of new cases in France, which smoothes out daily reporting irregularities, rose to an all-time high of 157,651 - jumping almost five-fold in a month.

The number of people hospitalised for COVID-19 has increased by 96 over 24 hours, standing at a more than seven-month peak of 18,811. But that figure is still almost half the record 33,497 reached in November 2020.
The COVID-19 death toll increased by 110 over 24 hours to 123,851, the 12th highest globally. The seven-day moving average of new daily deaths has reached 186, a high since May 14.

(Reuters) - The Omicron coronavirus variant dampened New Year festivities around much of the world, with Paris cancelling its fireworks show, London relegating its to television, and New York City scaling down its famous ball drop celebration in Times Square.
The illuminated ball made of Waterford crystal panels slid down its pole at the midnight hour in Times Square, but only 15,000 spectators were allowed into the official viewing area instead of the usual 58,000.
A year ago, the newly available vaccine offered hope that the COVID-19 pandemic may be under control by the start of 2022. Instead, the sudden arrival of Omicron has brought a surge in coronavirus cases across the globe.
Worldwide infections hit a record high over the past seven-day period, with an average of just over a million cases detected a day between Dec. 24 and 30, up some 100,000 on the previous peak posted on Wednesday, according to Reuters data. Deaths, however, have not risen in kind, bringing hope the new variant is less lethal.
New York City reported a record 44,000 cases on Wednesday and another 43,000 on Thursday, leading some critics to question whether the celebrations should go ahead at all.
But officials decided an outdoor party of vaccinated, masked and socially distant revellers was safe, and a better option than the virtually vacant celebration that rung in 2021.
""I would be lying if I said I'm not concerned,"" said Sue Park, a Columbia University student who was one of the 15,000 allowed to watch in person. ""Definitely I think it's worth it to come and celebrate. It will just be more meaningful to be in the crowd.""
Elsewhere around the globe, events were scaled back or cancelled outright, such as with the traditional fireworks over the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur.
Midnight passed in Paris without a planned fireworks display or DJ sets, as city officials cancelled events planned on the Champs-Elysees following the advice of a scientific panel that declared mass gatherings would be too risky.
In the Netherlands, where outside groupings of more than four people are banned, police dispersed several thousand people who had defiantly gathered at Amsterdam's central Dam Square, ANP news agency reported. 
But in London, where a fireworks display and light show had been cancelled in October, officials announced on Friday the spectacle would come to life on the television screen, as Big Ben rang in the New Year for the first time since 2017 following a restoration.
BBC images of the fireworks showed very light vehicle traffic and virtually no in-person spectators.
Earlier, Britain a study of a million cases that found those with Omicron were around a third as likely to need hospitalisation as those with the previously dominant Delta variant. The results were ""in keeping with the encouraging signs we have already seen,"" said Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the UK Health Security Agency.
In the wake of encouraging data, Cape Town abruptly lifted a curfew just in time for the New Year, after South Africa became the first country to declare its Omicron wave had crested - and with no huge surge in deaths.
South Africa had first raised the alarm about the new fast-spreading coronavirus variant racing around the world.
""I'm just hoping that Cape Town goes back to the old Cape Town that we all knew about,"" said Michael Mchede, manager of a Hard Rock cafe by the white sands of Camps Bay Beach, who was thrilled to get the place ready to host an unexpected bash.
Hours earlier, the Australian city of Sydney also feted the New Year with something like full swagger, as spectacular fireworks glittered in the harbour above the Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA) House.
People in Madrid queued for hours to get into the main Puerta del Sol square where celebrations went ahead with multiple security checkpoints, mandatory masks and capacity at 60% of normal levels.
Saul Pedrero, a 34-year old clerk, made the trip from Barcelona, which has some of Spain's strictest controls, including a 1 a.m. curfew.
""It seems like another country. Here you can do everything and nobody says anything,"" he said.
A lavish firework display lit up the festivities, which Spaniards mark by stuffing 12 grapes into their mouths to accompany each chime of the clock striking midnight.
In Asia, celebrations were mostly abridged or cancelled. In South Korea, a traditional midnight bell-ringing ceremony was cancelled for the second year, while festivities were banned in Tokyo's glittering Shibuya entertainment district, and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida took to YouTube to urge people to wear masks and limit numbers at parties.

China, where the coronavirus first emerged in late 2019, was on high alert, with the city of Xian under lockdown and New Year events in other cities cancelled.

KINGSTON (Reuters) - A former Colombian military member implicated in last year's assassination of Haiti President Jovenel Moise will be deported from Jamaica to his home country on Jan. 3, Jamaica's attorney general said on Saturday.
Mario Antonio Palacios, 43, is accused by Haitian authorities of forming part of a mercenary group that assassinated Moise in July during an assault on his private residence, during which his wife was also injured. 
Palacios was arrested in Jamaica last October and convicted for illegally entering the country from the Dominican Republic. 
Jamaica's government had issued a deportation order for illegally entering the country. But the island nation has no formal extradition treaty with Haiti, where Palacios is wanted, a local police spokesman said.
""The information supplied did not link him to the assassination and essentially indicated that he was a suspect for attempted armed robbery, without any detail,"" Marlene Malahoo Forte said in a statement to Reuters. 
""Our attempts to get further and better particulars from the Haitian government were unsuccessful.""

Lawyers for Palacios have asked for his immediate release from Kingston's Horizon Adult Remand Centre, arguing that his detention is unlawful, she said.
Neither Palacio's lawyers nor Haiti government officials immediately responded to requests for comment.

(Reuters) - Dan Reeves, a longtime NFL head coach and former player, died Saturday at the age of 77, his family said in a statement.
Reeves died ""due to complications from dementia,"" the statement read. He was ""surrounded by his loving family at his home in Atlanta,"" according to the statement.
Reeves spent his entire eight-season career as a player with the Dallas Cowboys. A running back, he played in two Super Bowls, helping the Cowboys win Super Bowl VI in 1972.
In 1981, the Denver Broncos hired Reeves as their head coach. Reeves was 37 at the time, making him the youngest head coach in the league at the time. 
In 1983 the Broncos acquired famed quarterback John Elway. Reeves and Elway made three Super Bowl appearances together — after the 1986, 1987 and 1989 seasons — but lost all three games.
After spending four seasons with the New York Giants, Reeves was hired by the Atlanta Falcons in 1997. He led the Falcons until 2003, when he was fired mid-season.
Reeves's second season with the Atlanta Falcons, in 1998, was one of the most successful in the team's history. The team posted a 14-2 record and won its first NFC championship.

""Our hearts go out to Dan's wife and high school sweetheart Pam; his children Dana, Lee and Laura; his grandchildren and great grandchildren; and the entire Reeves family,"" the Denver Broncos said in a statement.
""Dan Reeves leaves a lasting legacy in our game as a player and coach,"" Arthur Blank, the Atlanta Falcons owner and chairman, said in a statement. ""His track record of success in Dallas, Denver, New York and Atlanta over several decades speaks for itself, marking a long and successful life and career in football.""

CAPE TOWN (Reuters) -President Cyril Ramaphosa lauded the late Archbishop Desmond Tutu as ""our moral compass and national conscience"" as South Africa bade farewell at a state funeral on Saturday to a hero of the struggle against apartheid.
""Our departed father was a crusader in the struggle for freedom, for justice, for equality and for peace, not just in South Africa, the country of his birth, but around the world,"" Ramaphosa said, delivering the main eulogy at the service in St George's Cathedral, Cape Town, where for years Tutu preached against racial injustice.
The president then handed over the national flag to Tutu's widow, Nomalizo Leah, known as ""Mama Leah"". Tutu, who was awarded the Nobel Peace prize in 1984 for his non-violent opposition to white minority rule, died last Sunday aged 90.
His widow sat in a wheelchair in the front row of the congregation, draped in a purple scarf, the colour of her husband's clerical robes. Ramaphosa wore a matching necktie.
Cape Town, the city where Tutu lived for most of his later life, was unseasonably rainy early on Saturday as mourners gathered to bid farewell to the man fondly known as ""The Arch"".
The sun shone brightly after the requiem Mass as six white-robed clergy acting as pall bearers wheeled the coffin out of the cathedral to a hearse. 
Tutu's body will be cremated and then his ashes interred behind the cathedral's pulpit in a private ceremony.
""Small in physical stature, he was a giant among us morally and spiritually,"" said retired Bishop Michael Nuttall, who served as Tutu's deputy for many years.
Life-size posters of Tutu, with his hands clasped, were placed outside the cathedral, where the number of congregants was restricted in line with COVID-19 measures.
Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who leads the global Anglican Communion, said in a recorded message: ""People have said 'when we were in the dark, he brought light' and that... has lit up countries globally that are struggling with fear, conflicts, persecution, oppression."" 
Tutu's family members were visibly emotional. 
His daughter, Reverend Nontombi Naomi Tutu, thanked well-wishers for their support as the Mass began, her voice briefly quivering with emotion.
'RAINBOW NATION' 
Widely revered across South Africa's racial and cultural divides for his moral integrity, Tutu never stopped fighting for his vision of a ""Rainbow Nation"" in which all races in post-apartheid South Africa could live in harmony.
Hundreds of well-wishers queued on Thursday and Friday to pay their last respects as his body lay in state at the cathedral.
As Anglican archbishop of Cape Town, Tutu turned St George's into what is known as a ""People's Cathedral"" a refuge for anti-apartheid activists during the turbulent 1980s and 1990s when security forces brutally repressed the mass democratic movement. 
A small crowd of around 100 people followed the funeral proceedings on a big screen at the Grand Parade, opposite City Hall where Tutu joined Nelson Mandela when he gave his first speech after being freed from prison. 

“We have come to give our last respects to our father Tutu. We love our father, who taught us about love, unity and respect for one another,” said Mama Phila, a 54-year-old Rastafarian draped in the green, red and yellow colours of her faith. 
Mandela, who became the country's first post-apartheid president and who died in December 2013, once said of his friend: ""Sometimes strident, often tender, never afraid and seldom without humour, Desmond Tutu's voice will always be the voice of the voiceless.""

SEOUL (Reuters) -North Korean leader Kim Jong Un capped off his 10th year in power with a speech that made more mention of tractor factories and school uniforms than nuclear weapons or the United States, according to summaries by state media on Saturday.
North Korea's main goals for 2022 will be jump starting economic development and improving people's lives as it faces a ""great life-and-death struggle,"" Kim said in a speech on Friday at the end of the 4th Plenary Meeting of the 8th Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), which began on Monday.
The meetings coincided with the 10-year anniversary of Kim https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkorea-after-10-years-kim-jong-un-better-armed-more-isolated-than-ever-2021-12-15 effectively assuming leadership of the country after the death of his father in 2011.
Kim has used previous speeches around the New Year to make major policy announcements, including launching significant diplomatic engagements with South Korea and the United States.
But summaries of his speech published in North Korean state media made no specific mention of the United States, with only a passing reference to unspecified discussions of inter-Korean relations and ""external affairs.""
The domestic focus of the speech underscored the economic problems Kim faces at home, where self-imposed anti-pandemic border lockdowns have left North Korea more isolated than ever before, with international aid organisations warning of possible food shortages and a humanitarian crisis.
""The main task facing our Party and people next year is to provide a sure guarantee for the implementation of the five-year plan and bring about a remarkable change in the state development and the people's standard of living,"" Kim was quoted as saying.
Kim spent the majority of his speech detailing domestic issues from an ambitious plan for rural development to people's diets, school uniforms and the need to crack down on ""non-socialist practices.""
The big focus on rural development is likely a populist strategy, said Chad O'Carroll, founder of NK News, a Seoul-based website that tracks North Korea.
""Overall, Kim might be aware that revealing sophisticated military development plans while people are suffering food shortages and harsh conditions outside of Pyongyang might not be such a good idea this year,"" he wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Saturday's state media report cited the development of ""one ultra-modern weapon system after another"" as a major achievement of the past year and said Kim called for bolstering the national defence to face an unstable international situation.
A tractor factory he discussed in the speech was likely used to build launch vehicles for missiles, foreign analysts have said, and North Korea is believed to have expanded its arsenal despite the lockdowns.

The reports of Kim's speech did not mention the United States' call for denuclearisation talks, or South Korea's push for a declaration to formally end the 1950-1953 Korean War as a way to restart those negotiations.
North Korea has previously said it is open to diplomacy, but that the American overtures appear hollow while ""hostile acts"" such as military drills and sanctions continue.

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen had a New Year message for China on Saturday: military conflict is not the answer, but Beijing responded with a stern warning that if Taiwan crossed any red line it would lead to ""profound catastrophe"".
China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and has increased military and diplomatic pressure in the past two years to assert its sovereignty claims.
""We must remind the Beijing authorities to not misjudge the situation and to prevent the internal expansion of 'military adventurism',"" Tsai said on Saturday in her New Year's speech, broadcast live on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Taiwan says it is an independent country and has repeatedly vowed to defend its freedom and democracy.
Chinese President Xi Jinping said https://www.reuters.com/world/china/look-future-stay-focused-xi-tells-china-new-years-address-2021-12-31 in his New Year address on Friday that the complete unification of ""the motherland"" was an aspiration shared by people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
On Saturday, after Tsai's speech, Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson of the Taiwan Affairs Office in Beijing, said: ""We are willing to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification.""
""But if 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces continue to provoke and coerce, or even cross any red line, we will have to take decisive measures.""
The pursuit of independence will only throw Taiwan into a ""deep chasm"" and bring about ""profound catastrophe"", Zhu added.
In recent months, Beijing has sent repeated air missions over the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan has said it will not give in to threats.
""The military is definitely not an option for solving cross-strait disagreements. Military conflicts would impact economic stability,"" Tsai said. 
To ease tension in the region, both Taipei and Beijing must ""work hard to take care of people's livelihoods and calm the hearts of the people"" in order to find peaceful solutions to problems together, she said.

Tsai also said Taiwan would continue to monitor the situation in Hong Kong, adding that interference in the recent legislative election https://www.reuters.com/world/china/hong-kong-patriots-only-election-draws-record-low-turnout-2021-12-19 and the arrests https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/hong-kong-police-arrest-6-current-or-former-staff-online-media-outlet-2021-12-28 this week of senior staff at the pro-democracy media outlet Stand News ""made people worry even more about human rights and freedom of speech in Hong Kong"". 
""We will hold fast to our sovereignty, uphold the values ​​of freedom and democracy, defend territorial sovereignty and national security, and maintain peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region,"" Tsai said.

(Reuters) -Comedic actress Betty White, who capped a career of more than 80 years by becoming America's geriatric sweetheart after Emmy-winning roles on television sitcoms ""The Golden Girls"" and ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show,"" died on Friday, less than three weeks shy of her 100th birthday.
The agent, Jeff Witjas, told People magazine: ""Even though Betty was about to be 100, I thought she would live forever."" No cause was cited.
In a youth-driven entertainment industry where an actress over 40 faces career twilight, White was an anomaly who was a star in her 60s and a pop culture phenomenon in her 80s and 90s.
Playing on her eminent likability, White was still starring in a TV sitcom, ""Hot in Cleveland,"" at age 92 until it was canceled in late 2014.
White said her longevity was a result of good health, good fortune and loving her work.
""It's incredible that I'm still in this business and that you are still putting up with me,"" White said in an appearance at the 2018 Emmy Awards ceremony, where she was honored for her long career. ""It's incredible that you can stay in a career this long and still have people put up with you. I wish they did that at home.""
White was not afraid to mock herself and throw out a joke about her sex life or a snarky crack that one would not expect from a sweet-smiling, white-haired elderly woman. She was frequently asked if, after such a long career, there was anything she still wanted to do and the standard response was ""Robert Redford.""
""She was great at defying expectation. She managed to grow very old and somehow, not old enough. We’ll miss you, Betty,"" former costar and friend Ryan Reynolds wrote in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post.
""Old age hasn’t diminished her,"" the New York Times wrote in 2013. ""It has given her a second wind."" 
Minutes after news emerged of her death, U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters: ""That's a shame. She was a lovely lady."" His wife Jill Biden said: ""Who didn't love Betty White? We're so sad about her death.""
Betty Marion White was born on Jan. 17, 1922, in Oak Park, Illinois, and her family moved to Los Angeles during the Great Depression, where she attended Beverly Hills High School.
A DEBUT IN THE 1930s
White started her entertainment career in radio in the late 1930s and by 1939 had made her TV debut singing on an experimental channel in Los Angeles. After serving in the American Women's Voluntary Service, which helped the U.S. effort during World War Two, she was a regular on ""Hollywood on Television,"" a daily five-hour live variety show, in 1949. 
A few years later she became a pioneering woman in television by co-founding a production company and serving as a co-creator, producer and star of the 1950s sitcom ""Life with Elizabeth.""
Through the 1960s and early '70s White was seen regularly on television, hosting coverage of the annual Tournament of Rose Parade and appearing on game shows such as ""Match Game"" and ""Password."" She married ""Password"" host Allen Ludden, her third and final husband, in 1963.
White reached a new level of success on ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show,"" playing the host of a home-making television show, the snide, lusty Sue Ann Nivens, whose credo was ""a woman who does a good job in the kitchen is sure to reap her rewards in other parts of the house."" White won best-supporting actress Emmys for the role in 1975 and 1976.
She won another Emmy in 1986 for ""The Golden Girls,"" a sitcom about four older women living together in Miami that featured an age demographic rarely highlighted on American television. White also was nominated for an Emmy six other times for her portrayal of the widowed Rose Nylund, a sweet, naive and ditzy Midwesterner, on the show, which ran from 1985 to 1992 and was one of the top-rated series of its time.
After a less successful sequel to ""The Golden Girls"" came a series of small movie parts, talk-show appearances and one-off television roles, including one that won her an Emmy for a guest appearance on ""The John Larroquette Show.""
By 2009 she was becoming ubiquitous with more frequent television appearances and a role in the Sandra Bullock film ""The Proposal."" She starred in a popular Snickers candy commercial that aired during the Super Bowl, taking a brutal hit in a mud puddle in a football game.
A young fan started a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) campaign to have White host ""Saturday Night Live"" and she ended up appearing in every sketch on the show and winning still another Emmy for it.
The Associated Press voted her entertainer of the year in 2010 and a 2011 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that White, then 89, was the most popular and trusted celebrity in America with an 86% favorability rating.
White's witty and brassy demeanor came in handy as host of ""Betty White's Off Their Rockers,"" a hidden-camera show in which elderly actors pulled pranks on younger people.
""Who would ever dream that I would not only be this healthy, but still be invited to work?"" White said in a 2015 interview with Oprah Winfrey. 

White, who had no children, worked for animal causes. She once turned down a role in the movie ""As Good as It Gets"" because of a scene in which a dog was thrown in a garbage chute.
She looked forward to her milestone birthday, writing on Twitter just three days before her death, ""My 100th birthday ... I cannot believe it is coming up.""

Between 2 million and 4 million gallons (7.6 million to 15 million liters) of raw sewage leaked into the Dominguez Channel, which empties into the Los Angeles harbor, it was discovered on Thursday, according to a press release from the City of Long Beach. 
The leak occurred in the city of Carson and was caused by the failure of a 48-inch sewer main line, the release stated. It was not immediately clear why the line failed. 
City water quality teams from Long Beach are testing the level of pollutants in the affected areas, which includes 7 miles (11 km) of beaches. Swimming in the waters will remain prohibited until the amounts of pollution return to within normal levels. 

Tourists in the area for New Year's celebrations were disappointed with the news. 
""You come all this way and you don't get to play in the sand or the ocean? That doesn't seem fair,"" Sandi Williams, who had traveled from suburban Massachusetts, told the Los Angeles Times. ""We were so looking forward to this change in scenery, but like everywhere, there's catastrophe.""

(Reuters) - U.S. federal judges need ""more rigorous"" ethics training to ensure they are not hearing disputes in which they have a financial interest, U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts said in a year-end report published on Friday, citing a recent Wall Street Journal investigation.
The newspaper reported in September that 131 federal judges broke disqualification rules and the judicial ethics code by presiding over cases involving companies in which they or family members owned stock.
In his annual report on the federal judiciary, Roberts said most judges scrupulously follow the rules, and the violations identified by the Wall Street Journal were mostly ""isolated"" and ""unintentional"" oversights caused by conflict-checking procedures failing to reveal a financial conflict.
""But for those judges who had multiple violations, or professed ignorance of the ethics rule, there is a more serious problem of inadequate ethics training,"" Roberts said in the report.
Roberts said the federal judiciary's policymaking body has already begun to enhance ethics training courses for judges to ensure they are aware of their obligations.
""Collectively, our ethics training programs need to be more rigorous,"" Roberts said. ""That means more classtime, webinars, and consultations. But it also requires greater attention to promoting a culture of compliance, even when busy dockets keep judicial calendars full.""

The House of Representatives on Dec. 1 voted 422-4 in favor of a bipartisan bill imposing more stringent public financial reporting requirements on federal district and appellate court judges. The Senate has not yet acted on a companion bill.
The Courthouse Ethics and Transparency Act, spurred by the Wall Street Journal's investigation, would set a 45-day window for judges to report stock trades of more than $1,000 and also require the judiciary to post disclosure forms online.

WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) -President Joe Biden said on Friday he told his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin that a move on Ukraine will draw sanctions and an increased U.S. presence in Europe, where tensions are high after Russia's military buildup at the border.
The U.S. and Russian leaders exchanged warnings over Ukraine in a 50-minute call on Thursday to address Russian military actions. 
""I made clear to President Putin that if he makes any more moves, if he goes into Ukraine, we will have severe sanctions. We will increase our presence in Europe, with our NATO allies, and there will be a heavy price to pay for it,"" Biden told reporters as he left a Wilmington, Delaware, restaurant. 
Biden says Putin agreed on ""three major conferences"" next month with senior staff to help find a resolution and said he expected progress from those negotiations. However, he added, ""I made it clear that it only could work if he de-escalated.""
Asked if Moscow faces sanctions if it kept troops on the border, Biden said, ""I'm not going to negotiate here in public but we made it clear that he cannot - emphasize cannot - move on Ukraine.""
Biden will speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday, a White house official said earlier on Friday. 
He will reaffirm support for Ukraine, discuss Russia’s military buildup and review preparations for diplomatic efforts to calm the situation in the region, the official said.
The Biden-Putin exchange set the stage for lower-level engagement between the countries that includes the U.S.-Russia security meeting on Jan. 9-10, followed by a Russia-NATO session on Jan. 12, and a broader conference including Moscow, Washington and other European countries on Jan. 13.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken sought to lay the groundwork for those talks on Friday in calls with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and others, the State Department said. 
In conversations with the foreign ministers of Canada and Italy, Blinken discussed a united response to deter further Russian aggression against Ukraine.

The attempted launch, which came as indirect U.S.-Iran talks take place in Austria to try to salvage a 2015 nuclear deal, drew criticism from the United States, Germany and France.
""For a payload to enter orbit, it needs to reach speeds above 7,600 (metres per second). We reached 7,350,"" the spokesman, Ahmad Hosseini, said in a documentary about the launch vehicle broadcast on state TV and posted online.
On Thursday, Hosseini did not clarify whether the devices had reached orbit, but suggested the launch was a test ahead of coming attempts to put satellites into orbit.
Iran, which has one of the biggest missile programmes in the Middle East, has suffered several failed satellite launches in the past few years due to technical issues.
Washington has said it is concerned by Iran’s development of space launch vehicles, and a German diplomat said Berlin had called on Iran to stop sending satellite launch rockets into space, adding that they violated a U.N. Security Council resolution. [bL1N2TF0B4]
France said on Friday the rocket launch aimed at sending three research devices into space violated U.N. rules and was ""even more regrettable"" as nuclear talks with world powers were making progress.
Iran's foreign ministry rejected the U.S., German and French criticism of Tehran's launch of the satellite-carrying rocket.
""Scientific and research advances, including in the field of aerospace, are the inalienable right of the Iranian people, and such meddling statements will not undermine the Iranian people's determination to make progress in this field,"" it said in a statement carried by state media.
Tehran denies that its space activity is a cover for ballistic missile development or that it violated a U.N. resolution.
A U.N. resolution in 2015 ""called upon"" Iran to refrain for up to eight years from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons following an agreement with six world powers. Some states said the language did not make such a pledge obligatory.
Iran says it has never pursued the development of nuclear weapons and, therefore, the resolution does not apply to its ballistic missiles, which Tehran regards as an important deterrent and retaliatory force against U.S. and other adversaries in the event of war.
Iran launched its first satellite Omid (Hope) in 2009, and its Rasad (Observation) satellite was sent into orbit in 2011. Tehran said in 2012 that it had successfully put its third domestically made satellite, Navid (Promise), into orbit.

In April 2020, Iran said it successfully put the country's first military satellite into orbit, following repeated failed launch attempts in previous months.
The United States imposed sanctions on Iran's civilian space agency and two research organisations in 2019, saying they were being used to advance Tehran's ballistic missile programme.

New York City's bash - the biggest and most iconic in the United States - will once again be carried out in a scaled-down way https://www.reuters.com/world/us/new-york-city-scale-down-new-years-eve-celebrations-times-square-2021-12-23, city officials said. But it will be far larger than a year ago when only a few dozen people https://www.reuters.com/world/us/after-year-like-no-other-new-yorks-times-square-empties-out-new-years-eve-2020-12-31 were invited to watch the ball drop in Times Square. 
For decades, partygoers have filled the streets around Times Square on New Year's Eve, standing for hours in the cold waiting to see a glittering crystal ball glide down a pole mounted atop a building in the year's final seconds. When the ball reaches the bottom, the crowds erupt in hugs, kisses and good cheer. 
About 15,000 people who show proof of full vaccination will be allowed inside a fenced area to witness the ball drop this year - about a fourth of a pre-pandemic year. 
But it's still a world away from where the city was a year ago, said Paul Warshaw, a co-founder of balldrop.com https://www.balldrop.com, who has spent two decades producing parties largely focused on New Year's Eve celebrations. 
After having no events last year, Warshaw said that he's producing about 40 events catering to upward of 25,000 people on Friday in New York. That's in line with pre-pandemic levels. 
""There is a good amount of excitement, though people are proceeding with caution,"" Warshaw said, stressing that all his indoor events would adhere to strict proof-of-vaccination and other safety policies. 
Top U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci urged people to avoid large gatherings to celebrate the arrival of 2022.
Speaking on CNN this week, Fauci told people to stay away from big parties, saying ""there will be other years to do that, but not this year."" 
Fauci said family gatherings of people who are vaccinated and had received the booster shot were safe. 
Chris Beyrer, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said stubbornly low levels of vaccine coverage in the U.S., which stand at about 63% fully vaccinated, make this New Year's Eve far more dangerous than it should have to be. 
""It's one of the coldest times of the year, so that means the celebrations are happening inside,"" he said. ""And it's those indoor celebrations that we worry about, especially those mixing generations.""
Adding to the worry, Beyrer said, are the frustratingly inadequate levels of testing available for people who want to take one to ensure parties they host or attend are as safe as possible.
Despite a livelier atmosphere this year as compared to a year ago, the realities of the Omicron wave of cases has hit some cities and high-level names hard.

Los Angeles earlier this month reversed plans for an outdoor countdown party in Grand Park, opting to stream the celebration for the second year in a row. 
Rapper LL Cool J on Wednesday said he had tested positive for COVID-19 and had to step down as a headliner on ABC's annual ball drop show, ""Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest."" And TMZ reported this week that Sean ""Diddy"" Combs had canceled his star-studded bash in Miami, telling 500 invitees that coronavirus made it an untenable party for the second straight year.

Iran said on Thursday it had used a satellite launch rocket to send three research devices into space, as indirect U.S.-Iran talks take place in Austria to try to salvage a 2015 nuclear deal.
The satellite launch was in breach of U.N. Security Council resolutions, France's foreign ministry said. 
""These activities are all the more regrettable as they come at a time when we are making progress in the nuclear negotiations in Vienna,"" the French foreign ministry said.
""We call on Iran not to launch further ballistic missiles designed to be capable of carrying nuclear weapons, including space launchers.""
Iranian state TV showed footage on Thursday of what it said was the firing of the launch vehicle from the Imam Khomeini Space Center in northern Iran at dawn.
The U.S. State Department said on Thursday Washington was aware of reports on the launch, adding such launches defy a U.N. Security Council resolution enshrining the 2015 nuclear deal.
A German diplomat said such launches could be used to test technology for ballistic missiles which in principle could be used to deliver nuclear weapons.
Tehran denies its space launch activity is a cover for ballistic missile development.

The 2015 deal extended the time Iran would need to obtain enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb - if it chose to - to at least a year from about two to three months, in return for a lifting of sanctions.
The latest indirect talks between Iran and the United States on the 2015 deal resumed on Monday. On Tuesday, Washington expressed caution over upbeat comments by Iran and Russia about the talks, saying it was too soon to say if Tehran had returned to the negotiations with a constructive approach.

CAPE TOWN (Reuters) -Young activists hailed Archbishop Desmond Tutu as a role model for fighting global injustice as they waited in line on Friday to pay their last respects to the anti-apartheid hero whose body lay in state at St George's Cathedral in Cape Town.
Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize winner widely revered across racial and cultural divides in South Africa for his moral rectitude and principled fight against white-minority rule, died on Sunday https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/tears-tutu-giant-struggle-neighbour-who-brought-round-groceries-2021-12-29 aged 90.
""We as young activists believe the Arch stood for the same values that we want to aspire to in society,"" Irfaan Mangera, a pro-Palestinian South African activist, told Reuters as he waited in the long queue, draped in the Palestinian keffiyeh.
Using Tutu's nickname, Mangera added: ""The Arch was one of the figures who continuously united us against oppressive systems globally, locally and we want to continue in that path as young South African activists who emulate the values of non-racialism and non-sexism."" 
TEARS AND CELEBRATIONS
Among the many mourners was Mandla Mandela, a grandson of South Africa's first Black president, Nelson Mandela, who had been a friend and ally of Tutu.
""People like Arch were able to lead protests and marches right here in the Cape and this is why, when we look back at his life, we are celebrating today and particularly with his support for oppressed nations across the globe,"" he said.
Earlier, members of the clergy and church wardens lined the street as a guard of honour, awaiting the arrival of the simple pine coffin with rope handles, as the cathedral's marching band filled the air with the sound of drums, flutes and trumpets.
A teary Thandeka Tutu, the eldest daughter, hugged her sisters after climbing out of the hearse. Six black-robed pall bearers then carried the closed coffin to an inner sanctuary of the cathedral amid a cloud of incense from an Anglican thurible.
Tutu's body began lying in state on Thursday. A requiem mass funeral service will take place on Saturday and President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to deliver the main eulogy.
The cathedral's dean, Father Michael Weeder, told news broadcaster eNCA that Tutu's body would continue to lie in state through the night into Saturday after the public viewing ends at 5 p.m. (1500 GMT).

Since Sunday, church bells across South Africa have been rung every day in Tutu's honour. Churches around the country continued to hold thanksgiving services for him on Friday.
Tutu, who requested the cheapest coffin and did not want any lavish funeral expense, will be cremated and his remains interred behind the cathedral pulpit, from which he often used to preach against racial injustice.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Former South Korean President Park Geun-hye was released from prison on Friday nearly five years after being convicted of corruption, fuelling debate over whether she would play any role ahead of a March presidential election. 
Park, 69, was the country's first democratically elected leader to be thrown out of office when the Constitutional Court upheld a parliament vote in 2017 to impeach her over a scandal that also led to the imprisonment of the chiefs of two conglomerates, Samsung (KS:005930) and Lotte. 
South Korea's top court in January upheld a 20-year prison sentence imposed after Park was found guilty of colluding with a friend, who is also in jail, to receive tens of billions of won from the companies, mostly to fund her friend's family and non-profit foundations. 
President Moon Jae-in granted a special pardon to Park last week, citing her deteriorating health and expressing hope to ""overcome unfortunate past history and promote national unity"".
Justice ministry officials delivered the pardon to Park at the hospital where she has been staying for a month at midnight on Thursday, the Yonhap news agency reported, adding she remained there on Friday. The hospital declined to comment.
Her lawyer has said Park, the daughter of a former military ruler, had offered an apology for causing public concern and thanked Moon for making a ""tough decision"".
Park's release comes as her old party, the main opposition conservative People Power Party, and Moon's Democratic Party are in a tight presidential race.
Her imprisonment divided the country, with right-wing, pro-Park groups staging weekly rallies to denounce Moon and his policies and call for Park's release, until COVID-19 distancing rules stifled the rallies last year.
Hundreds of Park's supporters braved freezing temperatures to flock to the hospital where she was staying late on Thursday to celebrate her release, with more than 1,000 bouquets of flowers arriving. 
About 200 people held a protest in downtown Seoul against her release, Yonhap reported. 
It was not clear if Park would resume any political activity but she said in a memoir released on Thursday that her conviction was politically motivated and she expressed hopes to ""meet the people again one day"".

People Power's presidential candidate Yoon Suk-yeol, who investigated the Park scandal as prosecutor-general, said on Friday he had done his job as a public servant, adding he would like to visit Park when her health improved.

WILMINGTON, Del./MOSCOW (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday exchanged warnings over Ukraine but conveyed some optimism that diplomatic talks in January could ease spiraling tensions.
In a 50-minute call, their second conversation this month, Biden said he needed to see Russia decrease its military build-up near Ukraine, while Putin said sanctions threatened by Washington and allies could lead to a rupture in ties. The call was requested by Putin.
""President Biden reiterated that substantive progress in these dialogues can occur only in an environment of de-escalation rather than escalation,"" said White House press secretary Jen Psaki.
Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said the call created a ""good backdrop"" for future talks.
The leaders' exchange set the stage for lower-level engagement between the countries, including a Jan. 9-10 U.S.-Russia security meeting, followed by a Russia-NATO session on Jan. 12, and a broader conference including Moscow, Washington and other European countries slated for Jan. 13.
Despite the talk of diplomacy, the tone of the call was described by officials on both sides as ""serious."" And neither country detailed significant progress towards a resolution or the outlines of any deal.
In Kyiv, leaders worry about the 60,000 to 90,000 Russian troops that have gathered to its north, east and south. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization security alliance has been making its own preparations from the west.
Washington has not been convinced by a report over the weekend that Russia would be pulling back about 10,000 troops, with officials saying they've seen little evidence of a drawdown. The United States deployed its JSTARS military plane in Ukrainian airspace for the first time earlier this week, though different types of surveillance aircraft are common in the region.
For his part, Biden reiterated his threat of unprecedented sanctions if Russia chose to invade Ukraine.
""Biden laid out two paths,"" including diplomacy and deterrence, including ""serious costs and consequences,"" said a senior administration official.
""Both leaders acknowledged that there were likely to be areas where we could make the meaningful progress as well as areas where agreements may be impossible, and that the upcoming talks would determine more precisely the contours of each of those categories.""
Aides have said the possibilities include measures that would effectively disconnect Russia from the global financial system, while further arming NATO.
Ushakov said Putin ""immediately responded"" that any sanctions now or later ""could lead to a complete breakdown in ties between our countries."" He added: ""Our president also mentioned that it would be a mistake that our descendants would see as a huge error."" 
Moscow's troop deployments over the past two months alarmed the West, following its seizure of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014 and its backing of separatists fighting in eastern Ukraine. 
Russia denies planning to attack Ukraine and says it has the right to move its troops on its own soil as it likes. 
Moscow, worried by what it says is the West's re-arming of Ukraine, has said it wants legally-binding guarantees the 30-member NATO alliance will not expand further eastwards, and that certain offensive weapons will not be deployed to Ukraine or other neighboring countries. 
The Kremlin said Biden appeared to agree with Putin's contention that Moscow needed some security guarantees from the West and also that he said the United States did not intend to deploy offensive weapons in Ukraine.

A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Kremlin's characterization of Biden's remarks.
Putin has compared the current tensions to the Cold War-era Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. Washington regards many of his demands, including restrictions on NATO expansion, as non-starters.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - The bodies of 15 people killed when a trailer carrying migrants overturned in Mexico were returned to Guatemala on Thursday and reunited with families who will lay them to rest as the year ends. 
In all, 56 people were killed when a truck packed with migrants flipped over in the state of Chiapas earlier this month. Of the 37 Guatemalan nationals identified among the victims, the remains of only 19 have so far been returned.
Guatemala's foreign ministry has said there are 18 other victims who are still being identified, but whose bodies will be repatriated in the coming days.
The incident underscored the dangers migrants face on the road to the U.S. border, often at the hands of human-traffickers known as coyotes. Dozens of migrants have died from violence or accidents in Mexico over the past decade.
The 15 victims, all male, whose bodies were returned on Thursday were transferred by the Mexican Air Force, Mexico's government said. The Guatemalan Air Force then transported their bodies in caskets to the homes of their families. 
A Mexican government statement said officials have so far identified 50 of the victims from the trailer accident from Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador and Ecuador. 

Another 74 Guatemalans have been discharged from various hospitals in the city of Tuxtla Gutierrez in Chiapas, near the site of the accident. There are still 27 people hospitalized, more than half of them in serious condition. 
Following the incident, the United States, Mexico, Guatemala and other countries pledged to crack down https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-coordinate-with-mexico-regional-countries-crackdown-people-smuggling-2021-12-12 on international people-smuggling networks they blamed for the deaths.

""The rights and interests of Hong Kong residents, including freedom of speech and freedom of the press, are safeguarded in accordance with the law,"" China's embassy said late on Thursday.
""The Chinese side once again urges the UK to right its wrongs and stop interfering in any form in Hong Kong affairs, which are China's internal affairs,"" the spokesperson added.

But the official Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, said in an editorial on Friday that ""freedom of the press"" was being used as an excuse to sow ""anti-China chaos"" in Hong Kong. It accused foreign politicians of ""recklessly discrediting"" Hong Kong police.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - During British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell's trial on sex abuse charges, her lawyers argued she was a scapegoat for Jeffrey Epstein and attacked the credibility of four women who said she set them up as teenagers to have sexual encounters with the financier.
But ultimately, Maxwell's decade-long relationship with Epstein - her former boyfriend and employer - along with powerful testimony from the women who said that Maxwell was central to the abuse, doomed the defense, legal experts said. 
Epstein died by suicide in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges.
In Maxwell's month-long trial that ended with her conviction https://www.reuters.com/world/us/maxwell-jury-resume-deliberations-after-judge-warns-omicron-risk-2021-12-29 on Wednesday, prosecutors displayed never-before-seen photos of her and Epstein. One showed Maxwell rubbing Epstein's foot against her chest and another the pair riding a red motorbike, with Maxwell's arms around his waist.
""Those photos were just murder. If I was a juror, I'd be like, these guys were Siamese twins,"" said defense attorney Paul Applebaum.
Prosecutors also introduced bank records showing Epstein transferred Maxwell around $30 million over the years, arguing she was willing to do whatever it took to keep him happy and maintain her luxurious lifestyle. 
""The biggest challenge for the defense was the financial, personal and long-term connection between Epstein and Maxwell,"" said Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School. 
She said that the evidence of their ties posed a common sense question for the jury: ""How could Maxwell not know what was going on, and if she wasn't helping Epstein, why didn't she report him or disengage?""
QUESTIONED MOTIVES
To try to argue that Maxwell was not, in fact, aware of Epstein's misdeeds, the defense attacked the credibility and motives of the women who testified about her role. 
Questioning the integrity of female accusers has been part of the standard defense playbook in sexual abuse cases for decades. 
Federal evidence rules now restrict attorneys' ability to ask witnesses about sexual encounters unrelated to the case at hand. Maxwell's lawyers sought an exemption, and a pre-trial hearing on that topic was sealed from the public. 
Ultimately, the defense steered clear of asking the women about their other sexual behaviors. 
Maxwell's attorneys did cite two of the women's histories of drug abuse and argued that the memories of all four had been corrupted over the decades. 
One defense witness was Elizabeth Loftus, a psychologist who said people can form ""false memories.""
Maxwell's attorneys also pressed the women on why they did not mention Maxwell's role during initial conversations with law enforcement, arguing they changed their stories because they thought it would help them win money from a compensation fund run by Epstein's estate.
All four women said they received awards of more than $1 million.
There are signs the jury scrutinized all four of the women's testimony closely. They asked to review transcripts of the testimony and that of other witnesses - including two of their ex-boyfriends - who corroborated key portions of their accounts. 
They also requested a transcript of Loftus' testimony, suggesting they considered the defense's argument about how the women's memories could have been manipulated. 
But the conviction indicates the jury believed the accounts of the two most crucial witnesses: Carolyn, and a woman who testified under the pseudonym Jane. Both said they were 14 when Epstein started abusing them, and that Maxwell herself touched their bare breasts.
Carolyn said Maxwell sometimes handed her hundreds of dollars in cash after she massaged Epstein. Jane said Maxwell often arranged her travel from her Florida home to Epstein's properties in New York and New Mexico, where they had sexual encounters.

Prosecutors focused on the couple's close relationship between 1994 and 2004 to refute the defense's assertion that Maxwell was not aware of Epstein's abuse. 
""When you're with someone for 11 years, you know what they like,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Alison Moe said in her Dec. 20 closing argument. ""Epstein liked underage girls. He liked to touch underage girls. Maxwell knew it.""

485,"<span>Dec 30, 2021 05:05PM ET</span>",,,,,,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon on Thursday said the defense secretary would be the individual solely responsible for approving requests that would involve District of Columbia National Guard troops in civilian law enforcement activities. 
The move came as a result of a months-long Pentagon review of how the military generally handles requests for the National Guard within Washington, D.C. 
The district's National Guard is the only one in the country that reports to the president, with the authority previously delegated to the Army secretary by the defense secretary.
The review came after questions were raised about whether the National Guard was deployed quickly enough to try and help stop the Jan. 6 mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol building. 
""The Secretary of Defense is now the single approval authority for all requests that would involve District of Columbia National Guard personnel participating directly in civilian law enforcement activities or that require the deployment of DCNG (D.C. National Guard) personnel within 48 hours after receipt of the request,"" a Pentagon statement said. 
The Pentagon said it also has created a unit within the building to act as a single point for such requests. 
William Walker, then the District of Columbia’s National Guard commander, told senators during a hearing in March that Pentagon officials took more than three hours to approve a request by the U.S. Capitol Police for National Guard troops to back up police under attack by rioters at the Capitol on Jan. 6.

Four people died in the riot by supporters of then-President Donald Trump and one Capitol police officer died the next day of injuries sustained while defending Congress.
Hundreds of police were injured during the hours-long onslaught and four officers who guarded the Capitol subsequently took their own lives.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell is going to appeal her conviction https://www.reuters.com/world/us/maxwell-jury-resume-deliberations-after-judge-warns-omicron-risk-2021-12-29 for setting up teenage girls to have sexual encounters with financier Jeffrey Epstein, but experts said she will struggle to clear the high legal bar needed to overturn the verdict.
U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan dealt several blows to the defense during the month-long trial that ended on Wednesday, including denying a request to have some witnesses testify anonymously and another to block lawyers for two of the accusers from taking the stand.
Legal experts said Maxwell's lawyers are likely to cite such rulings in any appeal of her conviction on five of six counts, including sex trafficking, by a jury in federal court in Manhattan.
But to succeed, her lawyers would have to show that Nathan violated federal rules of evidence or abused her discretion.
""We have already started working on the appeal, and we are confident that she will be vindicated,"" Maxwell's lawyer Bobbi Sternheim told reporters on Wednesday, without going into specific legal grounds.
Even if an appellate court agreed that Nathan made a mistake, Maxwell's lawyers would need to show that it mattered to the outcome of the case. A ""harmless error"" is not enough to overturn a conviction, according to Bennett Gershman, a professor at Pace Law School.
""It's a very heavy burden,"" Gershman said, adding that federal appellate courts tend to defer to trial judges. 
An avenue of appeal for the defense might be to argue that the testimony of Kate, one of the accusers, was improperly admitted. 
While described in the indictment as a victim, Nathan instructed the jury that Kate was actually over the age of consent at the time of her alleged encounters with Epstein. However, Nathan said the jury could still consider her testimony if they found it useful.
""While the court limited that testimony, and gave the jury an appropriate limiting instruction, the defense may continue to argue that Kate's testimony should have been excluded,"" said Sarah Krissoff, a partner at the Day Pitney law firm and a former federal prosecutor.
The defense also objected to Nathan's instruction to the jury that they could find Maxwell guilty if she deliberately ignored evidence of Epstein's wrongdoing, a legal concept known as ""conscious avoidance."" 
Maxwell's lawyers argued that prosecutors' theory of the case was that Maxwell was an active participant, not a mere bystander, and accused prosecutors of trying to ""have it both ways."" 
Nathan ultimately allowed the instruction after noting that the defense itself had sought to show during opening statements and cross-examination of witnesses that Maxwell was unaware of Epstein's behavior. 
""Maxwell will have an uphill battle challenging the conscious avoidance charge, as the government presented a factual basis for such a charge,"" Krissoff said. 
Maxwell's lawyers may also raise on appeal Nathan's ruling preventing three defense witnesses from testifying anonymously. 
Three of Maxwell's four accusers testified under pseudonyms or used only their first names to protect their privacy as victims of sexual abuse.
But Nathan said privacy concerns did not apply to the defense witnesses because none of them intended to testify about sensitive personal topics or sexual conduct. 

Gershman said that any appeal would be hampered by the fact that Maxwell's lawyers waited until near the end of the trial to ask for anonymity.
""If they felt this was a serious concern, they should have raised this before the trial,"" he said.

(Reuters) - The congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol on Thursday urged the Supreme Court to deny a request by former President Donald Trump to shield some of his White House records.
In a written brief, the committee asked the high court to leave in place a lower court ruling that cleared the way for investigators to see telephone records, visitor logs and other documents for the closing weeks of Trump's presidency.
""Although the facts are unprecedented, this case is not a difficult one,"" lawyers for the House of Representatives committee said in their brief.
The committee has said it needs the requested materials to understand the role Trump may have played in fomenting the riot.
More than 100 police officers were injured during the multi-hour onslaught by Trump supporters, and four officers have since taken their own lives.
U.S. President Joe Biden had previously determined that the records, which belong to the executive branch, should not be subject to executive privilege, which protects the confidentially of some internal White House communications, and that turning them over to Congress was in the country's best interests.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled this month that Trump had no basis to challenge Biden's decision to allow the documents to be handed over. That decision will remain on hold until the Supreme Court acts.
On Dec. 23, Trump asked the Supreme Court to block the release of White House records, arguing the committee's request is ""exceedingly broad"" and an ""unprecedented encroachment on executive privilege.""

The documents are with the National Archives, the U.S. government's official body for preserving government records.
The Select Committee's lawyers said in Thursday's brief that each passing day without the documents handicaps a committee whose authorization expires on Jan. 3, 2023.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors decided to end their criminal case against two Manhattan jail guards who admitted to falsifying records on the night the financier Jeffrey Epstein killed himself on their watch.
In a Thursday filing in Manhattan federal court, prosecutors asked a judge to dismiss claims against Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, after both complied with the six-month deferred prosecution agreements they agreed to https://www.reuters.com/world/us/jeffrey-epsteins-jail-guards-avoid-prison-agreement-with-prosecutors-2021-05-22 in May.
Epstein was found hanging in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center on Aug. 10, 2019, while awaiting trial for sex trafficking, in what New York City's medical examiner called a suicide.
Noel and Thomas were accused of falling asleep and surfing the internet that night rather than checking on Epstein every 30 minutes.
Both admitted to having ""willfully and knowingly"" falsified records to make it seem they were monitoring Epstein properly.
Their deferred prosecution agreements required that they each perform 100 hours of community service and cooperate with a federal probe arising from Epstein's death.
William Barr, the U.S. attorney general at the time, had been angered that such a high-profile inmate was able to kill himself while in federal custody.
Epstein had been on suicide watch the month before died.
Thomas' lawyer Montell Figgins said his client was happy with the dismissal and looked forward to putting the matter behind him. Noel's lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Epstein's longtime associate, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, was convicted https://www.reuters.com/world/us/maxwell-jury-resume-deliberations-after-judge-warns-omicron-risk-2021-12-29 on Wednesday of helping recruit and groom underage girls for Epstein to abuse over at least a decade.

489,"<span>Dec 30, 2021 01:36PM ET</span>","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia on Thursday designated a member of the Pussy Riot punk band, a prominent art collector and a well-known satirist as ""foreign agents"", the latest in a series of moves critics say are designed to stifle dissent.
Capping a year of crackdowns on Kremlin critics unseen since the Soviet era, Russian authorities this week ordered the closure of the country's oldest human rights group Memorial International.
2021 also saw the jailing of Alexei Navalny, the Kremlin's top critic, and his movement banned. Many of his allies were forced to flee. 
The government says it is enforcing laws to thwart extremism and shield the country from what it says are malign foreign influences.
On Thursday, Russia's justice ministry added Nadezhda Tolokonnikova from Pussy Riot, art collector Marat Gelman, satirist and Kremlin critic Viktor Shenderovich and five others to the list of ""foreign agents"" that has now grown to 111 names from 17 as of late 2020.
The term ""foreign agent"" carries negative Soviet-era connotations and subjects those listed to stringent financial reporting requirements. It also obliges them to preface anything they publish with a disclaimer stating they are foreign agents.
Shenderovich is one of Russia's most prominent satirists, best known for a political caricature puppet show televised in the 1990s. 
Tolokonnikova helped launch Pussy Riot, which became known for a series of provocative performances including protesting against the leaders of the Russian Orthodox Church. 
She is also one of the founders of independent news outlet Mediazona, which was itself labelled ""foreign agent"" in late September. 
On Thursday, Mediazona said the justice ministry had put it on the list for citing other ""foreign agents"" and receiving money from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) advertisements.
Media outlets have complained that carrying ""foreign agent"" disclaimers is akin to defacing their own products and severely dents advertising revenue.

Several Russian media outlets with the label opted to shut down as finding sponsors and advertisers became almost impossible.
The Kremlin rejects the idea that media are being persecuted and says the legislation is needed to protect Russia from foreign meddling and that journalists and NGOs can be manipulated.

CAPE TOWN (Reuters) -A booster dose of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) Inc's single-dose COVID-19 vaccine was 84% effective at preventing hospitalisation in South African healthcare workers who became infected as the Omicron variant spread, researchers said on Thursday.
The real-world study, which has not been peer-reviewed, was based on a second dose of the J&J vaccine administered to 69,092 workers between Nov. 15 and Dec. 20.
An initial course of inoculation has been shown to offer only greatly reduced protection against infection by Omicron, which is spreading quickly through many countries after first being identified in southern Africa and Hong Kong in late November. 
However, several studies have suggested that a booster dose provides significant protection against severe illness from the variant.
The South African study showed the J&J vaccine's effectiveness at preventing hospitalisation rose from 63% shortly after a booster was administered to 84% 14 days later. Effectiveness reached 85% at one to two months post-boost.
""It reassures us that COVID-19 vaccines continue to be effective for the purpose they were designed, which is to protect people against severe disease and death,"" said Linda-Gail Bekker, the study's co-lead investigator.
""This is yet another piece of evidence that we have not lost that impact even in the face of a very mutated variant.""
Bekker said the jury was ""still out"" on the issue of further boosters for the J&J vaccine, which is administered as a single shot for the first full dose, and which is easier to transport to remote African rural areas than the rival, two-dose  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) mRNA vaccine due to better heat tolerance. 
""What we are showing is that two doses really restore full protection, and I don't think we can extrapolate from this that we are going to need a third or a fourth boost at all.""
Researchers said their analysis had several limitations, including short follow-up times. Those averaged eight days for healthcare workers who had received their boost within the previous 13 days, or 32 days for those boosted 1-2 months earlier.

In a company statement, Mathai Mammen, global head at Janssen Research & Development, said the firm believed protection could be due to robust T-cell responses induced by the vaccine.
""Furthermore, these data suggest that Omicron is not affecting the T-cell responses generated by our vaccine,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A 2009 settlement agreement between the late financier Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia Giuffre, which bears directly on Giuffre's civil lawsuit accusing Britain's Prince Andrew of sexual abuse, will be made public early next week.
In a joint order on Wednesday, U.S. District Judges Lewis Kaplan and Loretta Preska in Manhattan ordered the agreement's release on or about Jan. 3, 2022, finding no reason to keep it under seal.
Kaplan oversees Giuffre's lawsuit accusing https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/prince-andrew-is-sued-by-jeffrey-epstein-accuser-over-alleged-sexual-abuse-2021-08-09 Andrew of forcing her to have sex more than two decades ago when she was under 18 at the London home of former Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and abusing her at two of Epstein's homes.
Andrew has denied Giuffre's claims.
Preska oversees Giuffre's lawsuit accusing Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz of defaming her when he denied her claim that he was among the men Epstein compelled her to have sex with.
The prince's lawyer, Andrew Brettler, has contended https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/prince-andrew-seeks-dismissal-accuser-giuffres-lawsuit-2021-10-29 that the 2009 settlement with Epstein released the Duke of York from liability from Giuffre's lawsuit because it covered ""royalty,"" and Epstein insisted it cover anyone Giuffre might sue.
Giuffre's lawyer, David Boies, countered that the settlement applied ""at most"" to people involved in underlying litigation in Florida, where Epstein had a home, and that Prince Andrew should not use it as a ""get out of jail free card.""
Andrew has not been charged with crimes. Giuffre's civil lawsuit seeks unspecified damages.
Kaplan is scheduled on Jan. 4, 2022 to hear oral arguments on whether to dismiss Giuffre's lawsuit against Andrew.
In a filing on Tuesday, Brettler called for the case to be halted or thrown out https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/prince-andrew-questions-accuser-giuffres-ability-pursue-sex-abuse-lawsuit-2021-12-28 because Giuffre has long lived in Australia, depriving the Manhattan court of jurisdiction, and cannot support her claim that she is a Colorado resident.

Sigrid McCawley, another lawyer for Giuffre, in a statement called that argument ""another in a series of tired attempts by Prince Andrew to duck and dodge the legal merits of the serious case Virginia Giuffre has brought.""
Epstein, a registered sex offender, killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Maxwell was found guilty https://www.reuters.com/world/us/maxwell-jury-resume-deliberations-after-judge-warns-omicron-risk-2021-12-29 by a U.S. jury on Wednesday of helping Epstein sexually abuse teenage girls.

Wesley Carr, who himself helped conduct part of the funeral service for Diana at Westminster Abbey after her death in a Paris car crash in August 1997, urged a senior figure in the royal household to include a performance by John, a friend of the princess.
""This is a crucial point in the service and we would urge boldness. It is where the unexpected happens and something of the modern world that the princess represented,"" Carr wrote in the note released by the National Archives.
""I respectfully suggest that anything classical or choral (even a popular classic such as something by [composer Andrew]Lloyd Webber) is inappropriate. Better would be the enclosed song by Elton John (known to millions and his music was enjoyed by the princess), which would be powerful.""
Documents show John's 1970 ballad ""Your Song"" was initially considered, but Carr noted that the singer's 1973 ode to Marilyn Monroe ""Candle In the Wind"" was already ""being widely played and sung throughout the nation"". Its performance would be ""imaginative and generous to the millions who are feeling personally bereaved"".
He added that if the words were ""too sentimental"" they did not need to be printed in the order of service.
There is no detail of any response from the Palace, but John went on to perform the song, with revised lyrics dedicated to ""England's Rose"". It was one of the most poignant moments of the funeral, watched by as many as 2.5 billion people. 

The re-released version, lamenting a woman's death at a young age in the pitiless glare of fame, went on to become the second-biggest selling physical single of all time.
In 2019, John said he was so worried about getting the words wrong when performing at the funeral that he had a teleprompter installed by the piano.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Two former senior editors of Hong Kong's Stand News were charged with conspiring to publish seditious materials and denied bail by a court on Thursday, a day after a police raid on the pro-democracy media organization that prompted its closure. 
About 200 officers raided the online publication's office, froze its assets and arrested seven current and former senior editors and former board members on Wednesday.
Media advocacy groups and some Western governments criticised the raid and arrests https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/hong-kong-police-arrest-6-current-or-former-staff-online-media-outlet-2021-12-28 as a sign of further erosion of press freedoms since China imposed a sweeping national security law in the former British colony last year.
Magistrate Peter Law in the West Kowloon Magistrates' Court denied bail applications for former Stand News chief editor Chung Pui-kuen and acting chief editor Patrick Lam. Hong Kong laws restrict media coverage of bail hearings.
Along with Best Pencil (Hong Kong) Limited, the corporate entity behind Stand News, the two men were charged with conspiring ""to publish and/or reproduce seditious publications,"" according to the charge sheet.
Four former members of the Stand News board - former democratic legislator and barrister Margaret Ng, pop star Denise Ho, Chow Tat-chi and Christine Fang - were released on police bail pending further investigations. They were not charged yet. 
Police said all four are due to report to police in late March.
Ng told reporters as she left the police station that, ""continuing to care for each other is very important"". 
Ho, a Canadian citizen, left without comment.
The seven people arrested on Wednesday also included Chung's wife, Chan Pui-man. Formerly a senior editor with the pro-democracy Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily newspaper, she was already being held in prison on different charges and was re-arrested there.
Reuters could not reach Best Pencil or any of the seven arrested on Wednesday or their legal representatives for comment.
PROMISED RIGHTS 
Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise that wide-ranging individual rights, including a free press, would be protected.
But pro-democracy activists and rights groups say freedoms have been eroded, in particular since China imposed the new national security law after months of at times violent pro-democracy protests.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken described Wednesday's arrests as unjust and called on Hong Kong and Chinese authorities to ""cease targeting Hong Kong's free and independent media,"" saying it undermined the financial hub's credibility.
Hong Kong's government denies targeting the media and curbing its freedoms. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, said the action against Stand News was aimed at seditious activity.
""These actions have nothing to do with so-called suppression of press freedom,"" she told reporters. ""Journalism is not seditious ... but seditious activities could not be condoned under the guise of news reporting."" 
'BLACK SHEEP'
Set up in 2014 as a non-profit organisation, Stand News was the most prominent remaining independent pro-democracy publication in Hong Kong after a national security investigation this year led to the closure of jailed tycoon Jimmy Lai's Apple Daily newspaper. 
Stand News shut down hours after the raid and all of its employees were dismissed. Its website was not accessible on Thursday and its London bureau chief, Yeung Tin-shui, said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) his office had also closed. 
Beijing's main representative Liaison Office in Hong Kong, said Stand News was an ""out-and-out political organisation"" that ""kept publishing articles that incited others to use violence and even split the country"".

The Chinese foreign ministry's Hong Kong office said support for press freedom was being used as an excuse to disrupt stability in the city.
""Those who engage in activities that endanger national security ... under the cover of journalism are the black sheep tarnishing the press freedom and will be held accountable,"" it said in a statement.

In advance of the talks, which Russia hopes will eventually hand it new security guarantees, Russian President Vladimir Putin and his U.S. counterpart Joe Biden are due to discuss Ukraine and other subjects by phone later on Thursday.
The Kremlin said on Thursday that the call was taking place at Putin's request. 
""The purpose of the conversation is to continue discussion of all questions that were on the agenda of the fairly recent video call talks,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. 
In a telegram wishing Biden a happy new year on Thursday, Putin said Russia and the United States must work together constructively and engage in dialogue based on mutual respect and consideration of each other's national interests. 
Russia has alarmed Western countries by massing tens of thousands of troops near its border with Ukraine in the past two months. Moscow denies planning to attack Ukraine and says it has the right to move its troops on its own soil as it sees fit.
Moscow, worried by what it says is the West's re-arming of Ukraine, has said it wants legally-binding guarantees from the NATO military alliance over its eastern expansion and weapons deployment. 
""During the talks we will seek firm legal guarantees on Russia's security from the U.S. side, namely that NATO will not move eastwards and that weapons systems threatening Russia will not be deployed near our borders,"" Maria Zakharova, Russia's foreign ministry spokesperson, told a briefing on Thursday. 
Russia is set to hold talks with NATO in Brussels on Jan. 12, before a broader meeting on Jan. 13 involving the Vienna-based Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which includes the United States and its NATO allies, as well as Russia, Ukraine and other former Soviet states.

Zakharova said the Jan. 13 talks would take place in Vienna.
Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea in 2014 and backed a pro-Russian separatist uprising that same year which saw Kyiv lose control over a swath of eastern Ukraine.

Xian reported 155 new local cases for Dec. 29, official data showed. That takes its number of local infections to more than 1,100 since the flare-up began on Dec. 9 and compelled authorities to put the city of 13 million under lockdown. 
Despite the low case count compared with clusters in many cities around the world, Xian officials have imposed tough curbs on travel within and out of the city since Dec. 23, as Beijing demands each outbreak be contained quickly. 
""Xian has reached a live-or-die stage in its fight against the virus,"" Zhang Fenghu, a city government official, told a news conference on Wednesday.
Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), two of the world's largest memory-chip makers, have warned that the lockdown could affect their chip manufacturing bases in the area.
Xian is also a major tourism destination, drawing visitors to its collection of terracotta warriors buried with China's first emperor more than 2,000 years ago.
Authorities have embarked on multiple rounds of citywide testing to trace transmissions. A sixth round began on Thursday, a day after a fifth round.
Many residents have been barred from leaving their housing compounds unless going out to take COVID-19 tests or attend to essential matters approved by authorities.
The Xian police have dispatched personnel to each residential compound to make sure COVID curbs are properly implemented, a police official told a news briefing on Thursday.
The restrictions have curtailed access to daily necessities, with many people unable to go out to shop, leaving them dependent on deliveries.
But the curbs have caused a staffing crunch at companies involved in ensuring the delivery of supplies and the government was working on resolving the issue, a Xian government official said on Wednesday.
WUHAN ANNIVERSARY 
A Xian resident surnamed He told Reuters she tried to order groceries on the online app of Alibaba-backed supermarket chain Freshippo but could not secure many items including potatoes and cucumber.
The app posted a message under many items saying: ""Delivery staffers are not available"", according to a screenshot He provided.
Several city districts have arranged for the delivery of free groceries to some residential compounds, state media said.
The total supply of necessities in Xian was sufficient, a spokesperson at the commerce ministry told reporters.
The Xian lockdown, now in its eighth day, coincides with the second anniversary of early signs of the coronavirus outbreak in the central city of Wuhan.
Wuhan health authorities said in a notice issued on Dec. 30, 2019, that some pneumonia patients were stricken by an illness of an ""an unknown cause,"" according to state media. 

Also on Thursday, thousands of people left messages on the social media account of the late COVID-19 whistleblower Li Wenliang on the anniversary of the day - also Dec. 30, 2019 - that he learned of the possibility of a pneumonia-causing virus in Wuhan.
As of Wednesday, mainland China had reported 101,890 confirmed coronavirus cases, including both local and imported ones, with a death toll of 4,636.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese bishops and religious leaders briefed senior Hong Kong Catholic clergymen on President Xi Jinping's vision of religion with ""Chinese characteristics"" in an unprecedented meeting organised by the mainland's representative office in the city, according to four clerics.
The clerics who attended or had knowledge of the Oct 31 meeting described it as Beijing's most assertive move yet in its attempts to influence Hong Kong’s diocese, which is answerable to the Vatican and includes some high-ranking leaders who have long been defenders of democracy and human rights in the semi-autonomous territory.
While Hong Kong's Catholic leaders have met their mainland counterparts individually in the past, it was the first time the two sides had met formally - and the first time mainland religious officials had instigated such a meeting, the clerics said. 
Despite the meeting's symbolism, the mainland officials and religious leaders generally avoided an overtly political message, they said.
The meeting, which has not been revealed publicly, also sheds light on what some religious figures, politicians and diplomats describe as the expanding role of Beijing's Central Government Liaison Office in Hong Kong, which formally represents the mainland in the city but has traditionally kept a low profile.
The Liaison Office and officials from the State Administration of Religious Affairs monitored the Zoom sessions as three leading bishops and about 15 religious figures from mainland China's state-backed official Catholic church and about 15 senior clergymen in Hong Kong participated in the day-long meeting.
The Vatican regards Hong Kong as a single diocese so it has only one bishop. 
The Liaison Office and the State Administration of Religious Affairs did not respond to requests for comment.
Susanne Ho, a spokeswoman for the Hong Kong Catholic Diocese, told Reuters the diocese ""does not disclose details of private meetings"". 
Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni had no comment. 
NO MENTION OF XI
Without mentioning Xi or issuing any instructions or orders, the mainland speakers described how Xi's policy of ""sinicization"" aligned with long-term Vatican policies of inculturation - adapting Christianity in traditional, non-Christian cultures, two of the clerics said. 
Xi has been an active proponent of sinicization, setting out policies to foster religions with what he calls ""Chinese characteristics"" and closer ties to the party and state. It includes tying religions more closely to Chinese culture, patriotism and goals of the ruling Communist Party and state to achieve Xi’s ""Chinese dream"". 
""This was just the first step and I felt they knew that they could not come into this too heavy or dogmatically,"" said one cleric.
""We all know the word sinicization carries a political agenda behind it, and they didn't have to spell that out.""
""Xi was the elephant in the room,"" the second cleric said.
The Hong Kong side spoke broadly about the long-standing policy of inculturation, avoiding giving any political offence and any topics that could invite mainland interference, the two clerics said.
NEW BISHOP'S ORDINATION
The meeting came just weeks ahead of the ordination this month of new Hong Kong Bishop Stephen Chow, a moderate Vatican appointment that followed two failed attempts to fill the post after Beijing had sought to influence the decision, amid other pressures.
The Hong Kong side was led by a senior priest, Reverend Peter Choy, a figure widely seen by local Catholics as close to Beijing and, earlier, its preferred choice for bishop.
Chow, Bishop-elect at the time, attended the event only briefly after it was opened, which may give him room to manoeuvre in future, three of the clerics said.
Acting Bishop Cardinal John Tong opened and closed the event, they said.
A diocese spokesperson said Choy, Chow and Tong had no comments.
While some of Hong Kong's government and commercial elites are Catholic and pro-Beijing, including the city's leader Carrie Lam, other Catholics have long been active in the pro-democracy and anti-government activist movements.
Earlier this month, Xi told a conference in Beijing, described in official reports as the National Work Meeting on Religious Affairs, that all religions in China needed to embrace the Communist Party, expanding on one of his long-held policies.
""(We) must maintain the party's essential direction on religious work, we must continue our country's direction for the sinicization of religion, we must continue to take the large numbers of religious believers, and unite them around the party and the government,"" Xi said.
REMAINING STRONGHOLD
Some diplomats and activists say they are closely watching developments following Beijing's imposition of a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong in June 2020. 
They see Hong Kong's broad religious freedoms and traditions, like the rule of law, as one of the remaining strongholds of the ""one country, two systems"" model under which Britain handed its former colony back to Chinese rule in 1997.
The Basic Law, the mini-constitution that governs ""one country, two systems"", explicitly provides for freedom of conscience and broad religious freedom, including the right to preach in public.
The church in Hong Kong operates essentially on pre-1997 lines, staying in close touch with the Vatican and hosting an extensive foreign missionary presence. 
A deal struck between China and the Holy See in 2018 to ease long-running friction by giving the Chinese government a significant say in the Vatican's appointment of bishops does not apply to Hong Kong, Vatican officials say. 
Chinese and Hong Kong officials have repeatedly said that the city's wide-ranging freedoms, including that of religious belief and affiliation, remain intact.

The October meeting ended with a loose understanding by both sides that future sessions should be held but no dates were set, three clerics said.
""The pressure is building on us in Hong Kong...some of us see (sinicization) as code for Xi-nification,"" one of them said. ""We are going to have to be clever to resist.""

In early January, after the information on ""SARS cases"" was shared in a WeChat group, Li was reprimanded by the local police, according to the same Weibo post. 
On Jan. 12 he went to hospital, infected with the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease and died on Feb. 7, 2020. 
His death led to an outpouring of grief on social media at a time when people were on edge about the virus and authorities were under fire over a perceived lack of transparency and a hardline approach taken to whistleblowers like Li. 
Since then confidence has grown in China's response to the pandemic, but people have continued to post to Li online, especially on certain anniversary days as they did on Thursday.
""Happy new year Dr. Li, we will remember you forever,"" wrote a user called Tdby.
Others posted candle emojis, brief messages of thanks and exclamations of how two years have gone by so quickly, in the comments section of one of Li's posts on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Many wrote conversationally as if they were speaking to him beyond the grave.
Fang Kecheng from the Chinese University of Hong Kong said Li's Weibo microblog has become a place online where people express their feelings they are not comfortable expressing elsewhere.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A jury on Wednesday convicted British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell of recruiting and grooming four teenagers for the late financier Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse. [nL1N2TE1OS]
Here are 10 key moments from the trial: 
- In her opening statement, prosecutor Lara Pomerantz called Maxwell a predator who manipulated girls and groomed them for abuse by Epstein, her employer and onetime boyfriend. Maxwell saw recruiting girls for Epstein to have sex with as a means to maintain a luxurious lifestyle, Pomerantz said. 
""They were exploiting kids,"" Pomerantz said. ""They were trafficking kids for sex.""
- Maxwell defense lawyer Bobbi Sternheim began her opening statement by citing the biblical story of Adam and Eve to argue that Maxwell, like many women before her, was being blamed for a man's bad behavior. Epstein killed himself in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell.
""Epstein's death left a gaping hole in the pursuit of justice for many of these women,"" Sternheim said. ""She's filling that hole, and filling that empty chair."" 
- A woman known by the pseudonym Jane testified that Epstein first abused her in 1994, when Jane was just 14. 
Maxwell sometimes took part in sexual encounters with Jane and Epstein, and acted as if it were normal, Jane testified. 
""It made me feel confused because that did not feel normal to me,"" she said. ""I'd never seen anything like this or felt anything like this."" 
- Under cross-examination by Maxwell attorney Laura Menninger, Jane acknowledged she did not initially tell the FBI everything about Maxwell's involvement. She said later under further questioning by prosecutors that she was not comfortable sharing all the details.
""I was sitting in a room full of strangers and telling them the most shameful, deepest secrets that I'd been carrying around with me my whole life,"" she said. 
- Prosecutors displayed for the jury a green massage table that was seized from Epstein's Palm Beach, Florida, estate in 2005. Three of the four accusers said they gave Epstein massages that escalated into sexual activity.
Pomerantz called the word massage a ""ruse designed to get young girls to touch Epstein."" 
- Prosecutors showed the jury images depicting Maxwell's and Epstein's intimate relationship during the 1990s. The never-before-seen digital photographs showed Maxwell kissing Epstein on the cheek or rubbing his bare foot.
- A woman known by her first name, Carolyn, testified that Maxwell once touched Carolyn's breasts and buttocks while Carolyn was nude and told her she had a ""great body for Mr. Epstein and his friends.""
""Money will not ever fix what that woman has done to me,"" Carolyn said, sobbing on the stand.
- Jeffrey Pagliuca, an attorney for Maxwell, asked Carolyn why she did not mention Maxwell in her initial discussions with law enforcement but implicated her later in a claim to a victim's compensation fund run by Epstein's estate. The questioning was part of Maxwell's efforts to paint the accusers' accounts as unreliable.
""You know that if any information you submitted is false, you can be in criminal trouble?"" Pagliuca said, referring to the fund.
- Elizabeth Loftus, a prominent psychologist, testified for the defense that people can confidently recount events that did not happen. Her testimony was part of the defense's effort to argue that the accusers' memories had been manipulated over time. 
""When you have post-event suggestion or intervention, people get very confident about their wrong answers,"" Loftus testified.

- Minutes before the defense rested its case, Maxwell stood up, and with Sternheim's arm around her lower back, told U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan that she was declining to testify in her own defense.
""Your honor, the government has not proven the case beyond a reasonable doubt, and so there is no need for me to testify,"" Maxwell said

WASHINGTON/REHOBOTH BEACH, Del. (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin will speak on Thursday, the White House said, as Washington crafts a common response to Russia's military build-up on the Ukraine border with European allies.
The two leaders will discuss a range of topics, including upcoming security talks between the countries and a tense situation in Europe, White House National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne said in a statement on Wednesday.
The call will take place at 3:30 p.m. ET (2030 GMT), the White House said.
Horne said Biden had spoken with leaders across Europe about the situation on the Ukraine border, while Biden administration officials were in touch with NATO, the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
Moscow has alarmed the West by massing tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine in the past two months, following its seizure of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014 and its backing of separatists fighting Kyiv troops in eastern Ukraine.
Russia denies planning to attack Ukraine and says it has the right to move its troops on its own soil as it likes.
Moscow, worried by what it says is the West's re-arming of Ukraine, has said it wants legally-binding guarantees NATO will not expand further eastwards, and that certain offensive weapons will not be deployed to Ukraine or other neighboring countries. 
U.S. concerns have not ebbed in recent weeks, according to a senior Biden administration official. Other U.S. officials said that despite a report over the weekend that Russia would be pulling back about 10,000 troops from its border with Ukraine, they had seen little evidence to support that so far.
""We are at a moment of crisis and have been for some weeks now given the Russian build-up, and it will take a high level of engagement to address this and to find a path of de-escalation,"" said one of the officials, who declined to be named.
That person said Putin requested the call with Biden.
""When President Biden has asked to speak with President Putin over the course of 2021, President Putin has said, Yes, let's talk. And when President Putin says, I'm interested in touching base and having a phone call, President Biden says yes.""
Biden is likely to reiterate during the call that the United States will take swift economic action against Russia in the case of an invasion. They will also reinforce the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in such a case.
But the U.S. president has been pushing direct diplomacy as an alternative.
The Biden administration has been in deep talks with Ukraine as well as a host of NATO allies, including those bordering Russia, according to Horne, the White House spokesperson.
Biden will likely speak with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy soon, another official said. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with the Ukrainian leader on Wednesday and expressed ""unwavering support for Ukraine's independence,"" according to a spokesperson.
JSTARS, a type of U.S. military spy plane, operated in Ukrainian airspace for the first time earlier this week, though different types of surveillance aircraft are common in the region, officials said.
Biden on Tuesday said ""we'll see"" when asked if he would meet Putin on Jan. 10, the same day U.S. and Russian officials are due to hold security talks. But Biden is not expected to attend those talks or meet with Putin that day, an official said.
Russia and NATO are also set to hold talks on Jan. 12, with a broader meeting including Moscow, Washington and other European countries slated for Jan. 13.

Putin has compared to the current tensions to the Cold War-era Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. Washington regards some of his demands, including restrictions on NATO expansion, as non-starters.
Conversations between Putin and Biden are likely to touch on other issues, too, including the ongoing talks with Iran over its nuclear program, a U.S. official said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ghislaine Maxwell was found guilty by a U.S. jury on Wednesday of helping the late financier Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse teenage girls, sealing a remarkable fall from grace for the British socialite.
Maxwell, 60, was accused of recruiting and grooming four teenagers between 1994 and 2004 for Epstein, her former boyfriend, who killed himself in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges of his own. 
She was convicted on five of six counts, including one count of sex trafficking. Lawyers for Maxwell, who faces up to 65 years in prison, vowed to appeal.
Maxwell's trial was widely seen as the reckoning Epstein never had and one of the highest-profile cases in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which encouraged women to speak out about sexual abuse by famous and powerful people.
During the month-long trial, jurors heard emotional and explicit testimony from four women who portrayed Maxwell as central to their abuse by Epstein. Three of the four said Maxwell herself touched their bare breasts or took part in the encounters, which often began as massages.
Maxwell's attorneys sought to undermine the women's credibility, arguing that they were motivated by money to implicate Maxwell since all four had received million-dollar awards from a compensation fund for Epstein's victims.
But the women disputed those characterizations, saying they decided to testify out of a desire for justice, not money.
""Money will not ever fix what that woman has done to me,"" testified one woman, known by her first name Carolyn, who said Maxwell once touched her bare breasts and buttocks as she prepared to massage Epstein when she was 14 in 2002.
Carolyn's case was at the heart of the sex trafficking charge because she said Maxwell would sometimes hand her hundreds of dollars in cash after she gave Epstein erotic massages. Epstein would masturbate during the encounters in his Palm Beach, Florida estate, Carolyn testified.
The jury deliberated for five full days before reaching the verdict. 
After the verdict was read, Maxwell, wearing a burgundy turtleneck, poured herself a glass of water. Defense attorney Jeffrey Pagliuca patted her upper back. An expressionless Maxwell looked briefly at two of her siblings seated in the front row as she left the courtroom. 
Annie Farmer, one of the women who testified against Maxwell, said: ""I am so relieved and grateful that the jury recognized the pattern of predatory behavior that Maxwell engaged in for years and found her guilty of these crimes.""
Maxwell's lawyer, Bobbi Sternheim, told reporters the defense was disappointed with the verdict.
""We have already started working on the appeal, and we are confident that she will be vindicated,"" Sternheim said outside of the courthouse.
Maxwell will return to Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC), where she has been held in isolation since July 2020. Maxwell has voiced concerns about her treatment at the jail, asserting that guards have disrupted her sleep at night and that the stench of raw sewage has permeated her cell. 
Sternheim asked U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan after the verdict was read to ensure that Maxwell received her booster vaccine against COVID-19. Nathan said the shot was available at MDC, and that she would look into it. 
'ROAD TO JUSTICE'
The conditions at MDC are a far cry from the opulence that Maxwell, a daughter of late British press baron Robert Maxwell, had been accustomed to most of her life. 
Her father founded a publishing house and owned tabloids including the Daily Mirror. He was found dead off his yacht near the Canary Islands in 1991. 
Ghislaine Maxwell dated Epstein for several years in the 1990s, when the pair attended high society parties and traveled on luxurious private jets. 
During the trial, prosecutors showed jurors bank records indicating Epstein paid Maxwell millions of dollars over the years. They said Maxwell was motivated to do whatever it took to keep Epstein happy in order to maintain her luxurious lifestyle.
Maxwell's attorneys argued prosecutors were scapegoating her because Epstein was no longer alive.
""Epstein's death left a gaping hole in the pursuit of justice for many of these women,"" Sternheim said. ""She's filling that hole, and filling that empty chair.""
But prosecutors countered by describing Maxwell as Epstein's ""partner in crime.""
""Ghislaine Maxwell made her own choices. She committed crimes hand in hand with Jeffrey Epstein. She was a grown woman who knew exactly what she was doing,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Alison Moe said.
Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, applauded the verdict in a statement that said Maxwell was convicted of ""one of the worst crimes imaginable.""
""The road to justice has been far too long,"" his statement said. ""But, today, justice has been done. I want to commend the bravery of the girls – now grown women – who stepped out of the shadows and into the courtroom.""
Epstein's arrest and suicide drew attention to Maxwell's role in his abuses, and to the financier's relationships with prominent figures like former U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, Britain's Prince Andrew and billionaire investor Leon Black. 
None has been charged with crimes related to Epstein.
The prince, a former friend of Epstein, is defending against a civil lawsuit in Manhattan claiming he sexually abused Virginia Giuffre, another of Epstein's accusers. Andrew has denied her claims. 
'THAT DID NOT FEEL NORMAL'
During the trial, prosecutors displayed for the jury a green massage table that was seized from Epstein's Florida estate in 2005, backing up the women's descriptions of the massages.
The one charge Maxwell was acquitted on - enticing an underage girl to travel for the purpose of illegal sexual activity - carried a maximum penalty of five years in prison.
That charge pertained to a woman known by the pseudonym Jane, who testified that she was 14 when Epstein first abused her in 1994. 
Jane said she often traveled to Epstein's homes in New Mexico and New York, where some of the abuse took place, and that Maxwell sometimes helped coordinate her travel.
Maxwell at times took part in her sexual encounters with Epstein and acted as if it was normal, Jane testified. 
""It made me feel confused because that did not feel normal to me,"" Jane said. ""I'd never seen anything like this or felt anything like this."" 
Despite the not-guilty verdict on that count, the jury appeared to find other aspects of Jane's story credible. They convicted Maxwell of transporting a minor to travel for illegal sex acts, another count that pertained solely to Jane. 

Moe said during her closing argument that Maxwell's presence made young girls feel comfortable with Epstein. Otherwise, receiving an invitation to spend time with a middle-aged man would have seemed ""creepy"" and ""set off alarm bells,"" Moe said.
""Epstein could not have done this alone,"" she said.

502,"<span>Dec 29, 2021 08:10PM ET</span>",,,,,,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China will take ""drastic measures"" if Taiwan makes moves towards formal independence, a Beijing official warned on Wednesday, adding that Taiwan's provocations and outside meddling could intensify next year. 
China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and in the past two years has stepped up military and diplomatic pressure to assert its sovereignty claim, fuelling anger in Taipei and concern in Washington.
China was willing to try its utmost to seek peaceful reunification with Taiwan but would act if any red lines on independence were crossed, Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman of the Taiwan Affairs Office, told a media briefing. 
""If separatist forces in Taiwan seeking independence provoke, exert force or even break through any red line, we will have to take drastic measures,"" Ma said. 
In a statement late on Wednesday, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council urged Beijing to ""seriously reflect on its work towards Taiwan and make correct judgement on the situation"". 
The Council reiterated its call for dialogue on an equal basis and said it has maintained a policy of ""not provoking"" to safeguard peace across the Taiwan Strait and in the region.
Taiwan has emerged as a key factor in strained relations between Taiwan and the United States, the island's most important international backer and arms supplier despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties.
Taiwan says it is an independent country and vows to defend its freedom and democracy.
China regularly describes the island as the most sensitive issue in its ties with the United States.
Ma said provocation by pro-independence forces and ""external intervention"" could grow ""sharper and more intense"" in coming months. 
""Next year, the Taiwan Strait situation will become more complex and severe,"" he said.
Beijing has sent repeated air missions over the Taiwan Strait in recent months to pressure Taiwan. It has said it will not give in to threats.

While the United States recognises only one China, it is required by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself and has long followed a policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" on whether it would intervene militarily to protect Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack. 
The defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the Communists, who established the People's Republic of China.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - The United States, with the completion of the three final deportation flights of Guatemalans in 2021, marked a second year of steady decline in the amount of migrants sent back to the Central American country during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Guatemala this year received 17,806 of its citizens deported from the United States via 184 flights. Nearly 4,000 of the deportees were minors, according to data from the Guatemalan Institute of Migration(IGM).
Compared to pre-pandemic figures in 2019 of 54,599 Guatemalan deportees, this year marked a 38% decrease in the number of people sent back by air. In 2020, when some flights were suspended, the United States sent back 21,057 people.
Gerson Sanchez, a 40-year-old merchant from northern Guatemala, said that he and 23 others were arrested in early December crossing into Texas from the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. He was deported on Tuesday from McAllen, Texas, on a flight with 125 other people.
""It was my first time trying to get to the United States to work, but after the bad experience in that detention center, I prefer not to try again,"" Sanchez said. 
Despite the decrease in deportations from the United States via air, problems at the southern border are worsening as record numbers of migrants arrive in hopes of crossing, according to Ursula Roldan, a migration expert at Guatemala's Rafael Landivar University. 

""This is due to the containment policies of the United States initiated under the Trump administration. This worries us because borders are places of risk due to human trafficking and drug trafficking and migrants are trapped in this area,"" Roldan said. 
By contrast, the number of Guatemalans deported via land from Mexico doubled in 2021 compared to the previous year. The IGM received 1,194 buses with a total of 40,696 people, compared to 22,901 people deportees in 2020.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Mourners held a candlelight prayer ceremony outside the Soweto home of late Archbishop Desmond Tutu on Wednesday, weeping over the memory not only of a world-renowned lion of the anti-apartheid movement but of a kind and loyal neighbour.
Tutu, who died at 90 on Sunday, lived for a while on the same township street as his longtime friend Nelson Mandela, where residents take pride in being the only people in the world to grow up with two Nobel Peace Prize winners for neighbours.
""Come December time, Father Tutu and Mom Tutu used to bring groceries for all the grannies here. He used to look after the elders. So losing someone like him is painful. We're filled with tears,"" Nkele Tshakela told mourners standing alongside the street. 
Usually abuzz with tourists drawn to its vibrant culture and history as a battleground during white minority rule, Vilakazi Street had a sombre mood as mourners laid flowers outside Tutu's home and sang gospel hymns. Bishops and deans of the Anglican Church and Johannesburg Mayor Mpho Phalatse lit candles.
Tutu ""lived a life of servanthood and did not seek personal gain,"" Phalatse said. Bishop Steve Moreo of the Anglican Diocese of Johannesburg remembered his affectionate laugh and love.
Tutu's funeral will be held on Saturday at Cape Town's St George's Cathedral, where he led marches and campaigns to end apartheid from the front steps.
Cape Town held an interfaith and musical tribute at its city hall on Wednesday evening, attended by members of Tutu's family, as various quotes espousing Tutu's life philosophy were digitally displayed against a backdrop to the podium.
""If we all live our lives just taking a small amount of the values that he lived with, can you imagine the different world, the different country ... (and) the change that will be made?"" Alan Winde, the Western Cape premier said in his tribute. 
Tutu will be cremated after Saturday's funeral service and his ashes interred beneath the floor of St George's, the cathedral's dean, Father Michael Weeder, told Reuters, pointing down at a slab of orange tiles aligned with the cross hung at the back of the cathedral. 

Asked about his last memory of Tutu, a sobbing Weeder said: ""The fact that the last meal that he had, his last supper was the Eucharist on Christmas day, and Archbishop Thabo (Makgoba) said on a few times he would say, 'kealeboga, kealeboga' (thank you) repeatedly.""
""So I think we will always say he died a happy death and I'm very pleased with that and grateful.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia's Memorial Human Rights Centre was ordered to shut by a Moscow court on Wednesday, a day after its sister organisation - Russia's oldest human rights group - was forced to close.
The Human Rights Centre keeps a running list of individuals it classifies as political prisoners, including Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.
The list includes Jehovah's Witnesses and Muslims convicted of terrorism that Memorial says were victims of ""unproven charges based on fabricated evidence because of their religious affiliation"".
""Pozor! Pozor!"" (Shame! Shame!) Memorial supporters chanted outside the court, wrapped up against a temperature of -12 degrees Celsius (10 Fahrenheit).
The U.N. human rights office in Geneva said Russian courts had decided to ""dissolve two of Russia’s most respected human rights groups and further weaken the country’s dwindling human rights community"".
""We urge the Russian authorities to protect and support people and organizations that work to advance human rights across the Russian Federation,"" it added.
State prosecutors had said the centre's work justified terrorism and extremism, something it denied.
They had also accused it of failing to systematically label its content as that of a ""foreign agent"" - an official designation carrying pejorative Soviet-era connotations that it was given in 2014.
There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin, which says it does not interfere in court decisions.
The European Court of Human Rights on Wednesday told Russia to suspend the closure of the two Memorial organisations, while it continued to examine a 2013 application against Moscow's foreign agent legislation. There was no immediate response from Russia.
The Centre operates a network of offices across the predominantly Muslim North Caucasus region, where it has documented rights abuses in places such as Chechnya and provided legal and practical help to victims.
Those offices will have to be shut unless the Centre wins an appeal.
Anna Dobrovolskaya, the centre's executive director, said outside the court that the authorities appeared set on purging all human rights groups, starting with Memorial.
'TOO AWKWARD' 
""We can't say this was a complete surprise for us,"" she said.
""There was a feeling that the space (for rights work) is shrinking. Many people will be really upset when they see these events, and many people will write about the onset of medieval and dark times."" 
She said the ruling would have a chilling effect on other rights activists. ""Obviously our work had become too awkward, and bothered someone.""
The ruling, like the Supreme Court's decision on Tuesday to shut down Memorial International, famous for chronicling and keeping alive the memory of Stalin-era crimes, was condemned by international rights groups.
""In two days, Russia's courts delivered a one-two punch to Russia's human rights movement,"" tweeted Rachel Denber of New York-based Human Rights Watch.
""Almost exactly 30 years after the end of the Soviet era, authorities are setting new, repressive boundaries on what can be said about the past and what can be said and done about abuse in today’s Russia.""
The legal onslaught capped a year in which Navalny, the Kremlin's leading critic, was jailed, his movement banned and many of his associates forced to flee. Moscow says it is simply thwarting extremism and shielding Russia from malign foreign influence.
Critics say Vladimir Putin, in power as president or prime minister since 1999, and at odds with the West on everything from Ukraine to Syria, is turning back the clock to the Soviet era, when all dissent was crushed.
Memorial was established in the final years of the Soviet Union and initially investigated the crimes of the Soviet period, but later began inquiring into modern-day abuses too.
One supporter outside the court, who only gave his first name, Yegor, said the Memorial Human Rights Centre ruling was ""appalling"" for the Russian people.

""It was a genuinely useful organisation that defended the rights of innocent people who were being persecuted for their convictions,"" he said. 
""There needs to be an opposition, people with different views. That's what the principles of political competition are about.""

(Reuters) - Former U.S. President Donald Trump has resolved a dispute with the PGA of America over the golf association's decision earlier this year to pull a major professional tournament from a Trump-owned golf course, the PGA of America said.
In a press release, the PGA said it had reached a confidential settlement with the Trump Organization that resolves legal claims stemming from its decision in the wake of the storming of the U.S. Capitol to shun Trump's golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey.
""While the terms of the settlement will remain confidential, representatives from both the PGA and the Trump Organization expressed satisfaction with the agreement,"" the press release stated.
The PGA of America said on Jan. 10 it was stripping Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, of the 2022 PGA Championship, one of four prestigious majors on the annual golf calendar, following a vote by its board of directors.
“It has become clear that conducting the PGA Championship at Trump Bedminster would be detrimental to the PGA of America brand,” PGA of America President Jim Richerson said in a video announcing the decision.
More than 100 police officers were injured during the multi-hour onslaught by Trump supporters, and four officers have since taken their own lives.
    A Capitol Police officer, Brian Sicknick, suffered strokes and died of natural causes one day after responding to the attack, the District of Columbia's chief medical examiner determined in April. 
More than 700 people have been arrested in connection with the assault on the Capitol.

The PGA press release did not say whether Trump golf courses will host future PGA tournaments.
""We look forward to continuing to support the mission of the PGA and its Professionals, who are the best in the golf industry,"" Eric Trump, a son of the former president and a Trump Organization executive, said in a statement included as part of the press release.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday named Rina Amiri, a former U.S. government adviser who criticized the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, as a special envoy for Afghan women, girls and human rights.
""We desire a peaceful, stable, and secure Afghanistan, where all Afghans can live and thrive in political, economic, and social inclusivity. Special Envoy Amiri will work closely with me toward that goal,"" Blinken said in a statement. 
Amiri has spent two decades advising governments, the United Nations and think tanks on Afghanistan-related issues. Under former President Barack Obama, she served as a senior adviser to the U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Blinken named Stephenie Foster, a State Department veteran, as a new senior adviser for women and girls to U.S. operations to evacuate and resettle Afghans at risk of retaliation from the Taliban after it took over the country.
The Taliban overran Afghanistan in August as the former Western-backed government collapsed and the last U.S. troops withdrew after 20 years of war.
Since then, the Taliban have curbed the rights of women and girls, banning most of the former from working and most of the latter from attending schools in what U.S. officials decry as back-tracking by the Islamist extremists from assurances they would observe human rights.
The Biden administration has come under fire from women's rights groups for failing to ensure safe passage for activists and others that had long been targeted by the Taliban. 
Amiri told Reuters earlier this year that the process of evacuating women at risk had been a disaster.
Biden had made clear early on in high-level policy discussions that concerns about women's rights would not sway his decision to exit Afghanistan, despite promising during the campaign to forge a gender-sensitive foreign policy, she said.

The Taliban earlier this week decreed that women traveling more than 45 miles (72 km) should be accompanied by a close male family member. They also banned the playing of music in vehicles.
The United States and other governments have accused the Taliban of failing to establish an “inclusive” government and they have expressed concern over reports of summary executions and the disappearances of former Afghan security force members.

Lauterbach said the under-reporting was due to fewer tests being performed at workplaces and at doctors practices during the holiday season, as well as only a few of those test results being submitted to authorities.
Lauterbach also expressed concern about a clear rise in cases of the Omicron variant and appealed to people to celebrate the New Year only in small groups.
Der Spiegel magazine reported on Wednesday that Lauterbach is in favour of shortening quarantine periods over fears the country will soon grind to a halt given how many people are having to self-isolate protectively.
Germany's Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases currently recommends that infected people go into quarantine for 14 days, even if they are vaccinated or recovered.
Hajo Zeeb of the Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology also doubted the accuracy of Germany's reported figures for the coronavirus and the Omicron variant. 
""The figures now are certainly under-reported,"" he told the media group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland. 
The RKI on Wednesday reported 2,686 new cases of the variant, bringing the total number to 13,129. Four people have died with the variant.
The seven-day incidence rate, which has been a key metric for determining coronavirus policy, was reported as 205.5 cases per 100,000 residents, the lowest figure since early November.
This translated into 40,043 new cases over the past 24 hours. In neighbouring France, by comparison, authorities on Wednesday reported 208,000 new cases.
A spokesperson for the German Health Ministry said earlier Wednesday that the government expects a clearer picture of the infection situation early next year.
""The number of infections is an important indicator, but of course it's not the only one,"" the spokesperson said.

The sinking incidence rate comes despite repeated warnings by health officials of an impending fifth wave of infections.
The Health Ministry confirmed Tuesday that Germany is buying 1 million packs of Paxlovid from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), which has said that the pill cuts by 89% the chance of hospitalization or death for adults at risk of severe disease.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hours before Kabul fell to the Taliban on Aug. 15, the Afghan Air Force was melting down. Instead of unleashing air attacks against advancing insurgents, some airmen were fighting each other.
At the Kabul airport, some Afghan Air Force personnel guarding the airfield tried to force their way onto a military helicopter preparing to lift off, according to the Afghan Air Force pilot flying the craft and two other people familiar with the incident. The chopper’s destination was across town, but the guardsmen were convinced it was leaving the country and were determined not to be left behind, the pilot told Reuters. Another guard, trying to stop them, pointed his gun at the cockpit.
Bedlam ensued. Shots rang out. Bullets pierced the helicopter. Debris and metal flew, injuring the pilot and another airman on board; both required treatment. “My face became full of blood,” the pilot said. 
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fled the country later that day, hastening the collapse of the U.S.-backed government faster than even the most pessimistic defense analysts had predicted. Within hours, the Taliban stormed into Kabul, triggering a chaotic American evacuation that has damaged the presidency of U.S. leader Joe Biden.
The melee involving Afghan Air Force members ahead of Kabul’s fall hasn’t been previously reported. Reuters also learned exclusive details from airmen and former Afghan officials who participated in the secret operation to fly Ghani and his entourage to neighboring Uzbekistan on Aug. 15, and the role the chaos at the airport may have played in the timing of his departure.
Those episodes are among the detailed accounts compiled by Reuters from more than two dozen people, including pilots, military personnel, government officials and other veterans of the conflict in Afghanistan and the United States. Their stories provide new insight into the final days of the Afghan Air Force, once the crown jewel of the nation's military.
The United States had spent billions building a flying force in Afghanistan to give Kabul an edge over Islamic insurgents. Bombing raids killed countless Taliban fighters, who had no air power of their own.
But that project unraveled in just weeks after the United States began withdrawing support in mid-2021 as part of its final pullout from the country.
Militants in sneakers and battered pickup trucks swiftly seized unprotected air bases as soldiers guarding those facilities gave up, often without a fight. Ammunition ran low. Aircraft fell into disrepair. Pilots pulled functioning planes and choppers back to Kabul to protect the capital, the last government stronghold. 
But they would never execute that strategy. News of Ghani’s departure triggered a mass exodus of airmen trying to save their equipment - and themselves. Pilots, aircrews and even some of their relatives piled haphazardly into aircraft and fled the country. More than a quarter of the nation’s fleet ended up in neighboring Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, Afghan and U.S. officials say.
""To be honest, we lost control"" at the end, one former Afghan Air Force official said.
The fall was so swift that the Pentagon immediately dispatched U.S. forces to Kabul to cripple dozens of U.S.-supplied aircraft left behind to make them worthless to the Taliban.
John Michel, a retired brigadier general who once led the U.S. training mission for the Afghan Air Force, expressed sadness, but not surprise, at the force's demoralized finale. He contends that the U.S. template upon which it was modeled was not suited for a place like Afghanistan.
""It was an overly ambitious project that was, from the beginning, doomed,"" Michel said. 
BUILT TO FAIL
The rapid disintegration was emblematic of the wider failures of the 20-year U.S. involvement in Afghanistan.
Along with elite Special Forces units, the Afghan Air Force had been held up by the United States as proof that the drive to create a modern military to fight the Taliban was bearing fruit. The effort produced hundreds of courageous pilots who performed admirably under fire. But the force remained dependent on its American partners for core functions including aircraft maintenance and logistics. Impoverished Afghanistan, rife with corruption, lacked the military-industrial ecosystem and deep bench of talent needed for such an endeavor to stand on its own.
The Biden administration’s decision this year to withdraw from Afghanistan all U.S. military personnel and contractors supporting the Afghan Air Force quickly exposed this weakness. Video chats with remote support staff could not replace on-the-ground help.
Asked about Reuters' findings about the crippling effects of ending hands-on assistance, the Pentagon said it had supported the Afghan Air Force even after the withdrawal, paying airmen's salaries, training pilots overseas, even conducting air strikes from overseas bases outside Afghanistan in support of Afghan air and ground forces into early August.
General Frank McKenzie, head of the U.S. military's Central Command, warned Congress in April that he was concerned about ""the ability of the Afghan Air Force to fly ... after we remove the support for those aircraft.""
It didn't take long. As the Taliban rolled through Afghanistan, grabbing province after province, the Afghan Air Force was asked to do more than ever to support the floundering ground war: bombing raids, medical rescues, troop transports. Its aircraft, meanwhile, were failing from overuse and lack of maintenance. The force lost one out of five usable aircraft between the end of June and the end of July alone, according to Pentagon data.
Ammunition too, was in short supply, Reuters has learned. An Afghan pilot, who asked to be identified only by his first name, Shah, recalled flying a dangerous medical evacuation mission in July to recover wounded and dead Afghan troops in Spin Boldak, near the border with Pakistan. Shah said he had two armed MD-530 attack helicopters to escort his UH-60 Black Hawk chopper. But one of the pilots warned they were low on ammunition and might not be able to help if Shah came under Taliban fire, the airman recalled.
Shah described a desperate scramble at the recovery site. ""We were piling up bodies,"" he recalled. ""There was even no time to check (for) their heart beat, due to high risk."" Shah is still in Afghanistan, hiding from the Taliban.
A shortage of laser-guided bombs used for precise targeting of Taliban positions was also a guarded secret in Kabul in the final weeks of the war, said Hamdullah Mohib, who was Afghanistan's national security adviser.
""Our fear was that if we made this information public, it would further embolden the Taliban and demoralize ground troops,"" Mohib told Reuters.
The Pentagon, in a statement to Reuters, confirmed it halted a delivery of GBU-58 laser-guided bombs prior to the collapse of Afghanistan, but did not elaborate. A U.S. defense official said Washington did not believe that decision harmed Afghan military operations. 
Lords of the skies over Afghanistan, Afghan Air Force pilots such as Colonel Mohammad Tawiq Safi found themselves in peril as regional air bases below them fell to the Taliban.
Safi was a wing commander in Mazar-e-Sharif, overseeing operations in north and northeast Afghanistan. He told Reuters he knew trouble was afoot on Aug. 14 when local Afghan Army troops stopped answering his calls. Soldiers meant to protect the city - and his airfield - had abruptly folded. The 150 or so remaining airmen were on their own.
Safi gave the order to his airmen to retreat to Kabul, 200 miles away, where the Afghan Air Force had hoped to regroup for counter-attacks. By the time he got his own A-29 Super Tucano light attack plane aloft, he said, the fast-closing insurgents had struck his aircraft. Safi managed a landing, but was badly injured. Rescued by helicopter, Safi was ferried to Uzbekistan where he was hospitalized and ultimately evacuated to the United States in October.
The Taliban also hunted Afghan pilots on the ground. In the final months of the war, the Islamic militants devoted special attention to assassinating airmen when they stepped off base - a deliberate strategy to weaken the deteriorating air advantage of the U.S.-backed government. At least seven pilots were killed off base this year in a series of targeted killings https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/afghan-pilots-assassinated-by-taliban-us-withdraws-2021-07-09, Reuters reported in July.
More would follow. The last to die in this Taliban hit campaign may have been Hamidullah Habibi, a U.S.-trained Black Hawk helicopter pilot. A week before the Taliban seized Kabul, Habibi was killed in the capital on Aug. 7 https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/afghan-air-force-pilot-killed-kabul-bombing-attack-claimed-by-taliban-2021-08-07 by a sticky bomb attached to a vehicle, former officials and a family member said. The Taliban claimed responsibility.
The airmen also faced danger from their fellow countrymen as Afghanistan came unglued. Pilots controlled a precious means of escape, and some Afghans were willing to do anything to get on board their aircraft. 
The Aug. 15 scuffle between airmen at the Kabul airport was foreshadowed days earlier in Herat province in northwest Afghanistan.
The Taliban declared victory in Herat on Aug. 12. Shortly before that, government officials and soldiers in the province wrangled over who could evacuate using the last available Afghan Air Force helicopters at Camp Zafar, home of the Afghan Army's 207th Corps, said a pilot and two former Afghan officials familiar with the incident.
Abdul Sabur Qane, Herat's provincial governor, and Ismail Khan, a powerful militia commander, demanded to be flown out with two other associates, the Afghan sources said. But the Afghan Army wouldn't let them. There were hundreds of soldiers at the base and only a couple of helicopters. The message: Either everyone leaves or no one does, the people said.
""The soldiers, they didn't allow them"" to take the choppers, the pilot said.
Khan and his associates were later captured by the Taliban, then released. Khan and Qane could not be reached for comment.
WRECKING BALL
When the United States lost the war to the Taliban, it left behind a war chest of weaponry that will arm America's former enemies for years to come. Images from Afghanistan have shown insurgents toting M4 Carbine assault rifles, clad in American-made body armor and piloting U.S.-supplied armored vehicles. Ensuring they didn't inherit an Air Force, too, became an urgent final mission for the United States.
Afghan pilots estimate they flew 46 aircraft to neighboring Uzbekistan and at least another 17 to Tajikistan, where they remain. The United States is weighing requests by those Central Asian countries to keep some of those aircraft, U.S. officials told Reuters.
Then there was the handiwork of U.S. Army Major Frank Kessler. A member of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division, Kessler flew into Afghanistan on Aug. 17, two days after the fall of Kabul. His mission was to locate Afghan aircraft and other military equipment, then trash it to keep it out of Taliban hands.
In his first interview about his mission, Kessler told Reuters that his team of about 100 people located 73 military aircraft at the Kabul airport. Kessler's job was made harder by a restriction handed down from top brass: Don’t use explosives and keep a low profile.
The international spotlight was burning white hot on the Kabul airport in August. Washington had struck a fragile agreement with the conquering Taliban to allow the U.S. military to conduct evacuation operations at the airfield through Aug. 31. Blowing up planes at the airport could further panic the throngs of Afghans trying to board flights out. The sound might also tip off the Taliban that the Americans were destroying some of the most prized spoils of war. Subtler methods were needed.
""We couldn't take a thermite grenade or attach C-4 (explosives) to all the equipment there,"" Kessler said.
He declined to say exactly how the team disabled the aircraft, mostly UH-60 Black Hawk and Russian-made Mi-17 helicopters. But a U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the sabotage ran the gamut from low-rent vandalism such as clogging fuel lines with sand to the removal of sensitive, high-tech equipment. Images of the Kabul airport released by media organizations following the U.S. evacuation showed choppers and planes with windows bashed in, avionics ripped out and doors missing.
""We had Air Force personnel there ... (who) understand how planes work and how to make them not work,"" Kessler said.
The new Taliban government has expressed aspirations of building its own Air Force. It has encouraged U.S.-trained Afghan pilots to come out of hiding to help.
There have been few takers.
Six Afghan Air Force personnel still inside Afghanistan told Reuters they are terrified of their former adversaries and desperate to leave the country. Five of those in hiding described precautions like moving from house to house, deleting sensitive information from their cell phones and, in some cases, separating from family due to fears for their relatives' safety.
David Hicks, a retired U.S. brigadier general who once commanded training for the Afghan Air Force, now leads a charity to evacuate and resettle former Afghan personnel. His group believes it has helped get hundreds of fliers and their family members out, but estimates far more still remain in Afghanistan.
""It's not an understatement to say that they're in a desperate situation,"" Hicks said. 
FINAL FLIGHT
After the Aug. 15 confrontation at the Kabul airport that injured two airmen, airfield security forces stopped yet another Afghan Air Force helicopter from taking off. This one was assigned to Ghani's presidential fleet. It eventually was cleared for departure, but only after one of the pilots aboard argued with the forces and Ghani's security got involved, according to several Afghans familiar with the incident.
The stand-off worried the president's inner circle. Concerns were rising about the ability of Ghani's own forces to protect him, Mohib, the national security adviser, told Reuters. While not the only factor, the incident contributed to the decision that it was time to get Ghani out of Afghanistan, Mohib said.
""One of the reasons the decision was made that it was time to evacuate was because that helicopter was actually taken hostage,"" Mohib said. ""The fear was that some (Afghan soldiers) had gone rogue.""
The disorder continued as Ghani and his entourage began boarding three helicopters on the palace grounds to flee to Uzbekistan, one of the pilots told Reuters. After the president, his wife and some top-ranking officials, including Mohib, were aboard, some of Ghani’s bodyguards fought each other for the remaining seats, exchanging punches, a pilot told Reuters.
The three helicopters left the palace together just before 3 p.m., flying low to avoid radar as they headed north to keep the mission secret, the pilot said. A fourth helicopter followed in short order. One of the choppers was so crowded that the crew ordered body armor thrown overboard to lighten the load. The four aircraft carried a total of 54 people, half of them presidential security.
The pilots were told their destination just minutes before lift-off. They couldn't notify their families and left with nothing but their flight suits, two of the pilots told Reuters. Uzbek officials were surprised, too. The Afghans' unannounced landing at Termez airport triggered a scramble by Uzbek security, two Afghan pilots told Reuters.
The Uzbek foreign ministry declined to comment.
Arriving on Uzbek soil, Ghani mustered a last token of presidential gratitude for the crew.
""You saved all of our lives,"" the grim-faced president told them, one of the pilots told Reuters.
Ghani soon flew on to Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which announced he and his family had been admitted on “humanitarian grounds.” 
Reuters was unable to reach Ghani through the UAE foreign ministry or via former members of his government.
Around 17 airmen - pilots, flight engineers and maintenance crew - had helmed Ghani’s mad dash to Uzbekistan. They boarded a charter flight to Abu Dhabi on Aug. 16 and eventually were moved into a humanitarian camp there. All are still awaiting U.S. resettlement. 
Saying they feel forgotten by the U.S. government, and worried for their families back in Afghanistan, two of the pilots appealed for American help during interviews with Reuters.

""We did our duty,"" one said.
A U.S. embassy spokesperson in Abu Dhabi declined to comment on the pilots' individual cases, but said in a statement that processing, screening and vetting of Afghans for relocation to the United States was a top priority.

511,"<span>Dec 29, 2021 05:56AM ET</span>","SYDNEY (Reuters) -Novak Djokovic has pulled out of the Serbia team for the ATP Cup in Sydney, event organisers said on Wednesday, raising further doubts over whether the world number one will defend his Australian Open title next month.
There has been intense speculation over Djokovic's participation in both events, with the 34-year-old, who is opposed to COVID-19 vaccinations, repeatedly declining to say if he has been inoculated against the virus.
Organisers of the Australian Open, which starts on Jan. 17, have stipulated that all participants must be vaccinated against the coronavirus or have a medical exemption granted by an independent panel of experts.
""Novak Djokovic has officially withdrawn from the ATP Cup in Sydney, we have no update as yet on his plans for the Australian Open,"" a Tennis Australia spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.
""Regarding the medical exemption process, which pertains to all players, there is a rigorous and independent process in place. As with all medical information it is subject to confidentiality.""
The global men's tennis governing body ATP did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
ATP Cup organisers said Serbia's team would now be led by world number 33 Dusan Lajovic.
Owing to Djokovic's current world ranking, Serbia received top billing for the 16-team event, which runs from Jan. 1-9, and have been drawn in Group A along with Norway, Chile and Spain.
Djokovic has won a record nine Australian Open titles, including the last three, and is in a three-way tie on 20 major titles with Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal in the all-time list.
His father Srdjan told a Serbian television channel last month that Djokovic would probably pull out nL4N2SK0VQ of the major, saying Tennis Australia's stance on mandatory vaccination was tantamount to ""blackmail"". 

The season-opening ATP Cup also saw Austria, which failed the eligibility criteria following the withdrawal of Dominic Thiem and Dennis Novak, replaced by France.
Russia, which won the 2021 title, will be missing Andrey Rublev and Aslan Karatsev from that team.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -The Indian government on Monday ""refused"" to renew a permission that is vital for Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity (MoC) to be able to secure foreign funds, cutting off a key source the charity has depended on to run its programs for the impoverished. 
Nobel-laureate Mother Teresa, a Roman Catholic nun who died in 1997, founded the MoC in 1950. The charity has more than 3,000 nuns worldwide who run hospices, community kitchens, schools, leper colonies and homes for abandoned children.
The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi refused permission to the charity under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) on Saturday after it received some ""adverse inputs"", a government statement said. 
""While considering the MoC's renewal application, some adverse inputs were noticed,"" the home ministry said, without providing details. 
The ministry also rejected an earlier allegation of the West Bengal state chief minister Mamata Banerjee that the bank accounts of the charity were frozen. 
Later, the MoC in a statement confirmed their FCRA application was not renewed and that it has asked its centres not to operate any foreign contributions accounts until the matter is resolved.
The move comes as hardline Hindu outfits affiliated to Modi's party have accused the MoC of leading religious conversion programmes under the guise of charity by offering poor Hindus and tribal communities food, medicine, money, free education and shelter. MoC has rejected these allegations.
Earlier, chief minister Banerjee of West Bengal, where MoC has its headquarters, wrote in a tweet that she was shocked to hear that at Christmas, the Union Ministry had frozen all the bank accounts of the MoC in India. 
""Their 22,000 patients & employees have been left without food & medicines. While the law is paramount, humanitarian efforts must not be compromised,"" said Banerjee, an opposition leader and vocal critic of the Modi government.
The federal government said the accounts of MoC were frozen by the bank based on the request of the charity itself. 
Vicar General Dominic Gomes of the Archdiocese of Calcutta said the freeze of the accounts was ""a cruel Christmas gift to the poorest of the poor"". 
The row comes days after hardline Hindu vigilante groups disrupted Christmas church services in parts of India, including in some states ruled by Modi's party ahead of local elections in the coming months.
ATTACKS ON MINORITIES
Since Modi came to power in 2014, right-wing Hindu groups have consolidated their position across states and launched attacks on minorities, claiming they are trying to prevent religious conversions.
Christians and other critics note Christians represent only 2.3% of India's 1.37 billion people, while Hindus are the overwhelming majority. They repudiate the excuse given by some Hindu groups of preventing conversions as a reason for violence against Christians.
The Hindu newspaper on Monday reported disruption of Christmas celebrations at the weekend and last week, including the vandalising of a life-size statue of Jesus Christ at Ambala in Haryana, a northern state governed by Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). 
It said activists burnt a model of Santa Claus and chanted anti-Christmas slogans outside a church in Varanasi, Modi's parliamentary constituency and Hinduism's holiest city. 
Elias Vaz, national vice-president of the All India Catholic Union, condemned the latest incidents.
""The strength of India is in its diversity and the people who have done this at Christmas are the real anti-nationals,"" Vaz said.

Contacted by telephone, the federal and state governments declined to comment on the protests. 
Several Indian states have passed or are considering anti-conversion laws that challenge the constitutionally protected right to freedom of belief in the country.

513,"<span>Dec 29, 2021 05:31AM ET</span>","BEIJING (Reuters) -A lockdown of 13 million people in the Chinese city of Xian entered its seventh day on Wednesday, with many unable to leave their residential compounds and relying on deliveries of necessities as new COVID-19 infections persisted. 
Xian reported 151 domestically transmitted infections with confirmed symptoms for Tuesday, or nearly all of the 152 cases nationwide, bringing the total number of local Xian cases to nearly 1,000 during the Dec. 9-28 period. No cases of the Omicron variant have been announced in the city so far.
While the Xian outbreak is small compared with outbreaks in many other places around the world, officials have imposed tough curbs on travel within and leaving the city from Dec. 23, in line with Beijing's drive to immediately contain outbreaks as they appear.
People in the city have not been allowed to leave town without clearance from their employer or community authorities. 
A 32-year-old mechanic went to Xian on a business trip and had planned to leave last week, only to find he had to stay for longer after local community officials refused to grant the certificate to clear his departure. 
That means he has missed his wife's birthday and might be forced to spend the New Year in Xian. ""I just want to go home,"" he told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Since Monday, the Xian government has suspended granting permission to people seeking to leave their homes to buy essentials, as epidemic containment measures rose a notch. 
The city said in-person shopping could be resumed for people in less risky areas once mass testing returned negative results, without saying exactly when stay-at-home orders would be lifted. 
The measure stirred complaints on social media from some residents about the uncertain access to fresh produce. 
Several district-level governments in Xian have started arranging grocery deliveries to peoples' homes, or setting up temporary booths in large residential compounds selling fresh produce, the city government said on Wednesday.
A 23-year-old student in Xian, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said his family had received one free package of vegetables delivered to his home since the shopping restriction, and has not yet been told when the next batch will arrive.
There was no choice on what was delivered, but the package included the most common groceries: ""Although I do crave certain food, there is no disruption to my daily life.""
MANUFACTURING HIT
Authorities started another round of city-wide testing on Wednesday, the fifth since Dec. 21. The number of infections found from mass testing started to decline in the fourth round, while the numbers in the first three were elevated, a local official said on Wednesday. 
Samsung (KS:005930), which operates a sprawling semiconductor base in Xian, said on Wednesday it had decided to ""temporarily adjust operations"" at manufacturing facilities in the city due to the COVID-19 situation. 
Chinese electric vehicle company BYD Co (OTC:BYDDF) reiterated on Wednesday that the virus had caused some impact, without giving a timeline on when operations may normalise.

""Our production has been affected by the epidemic outbreak to some degree,"" BYD told Reuters. ""We are currently actively making adjustments in response.""
Western Superconducting Technologies said on Tuesday its current production wasn't at full capacity as it complied with government's COVID-19 curb, while it will produce at full capacity once the Xian outbreak is under control.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's change of leadership in Xinjiang could indicate greater emphasis on economic development in the region, experts said, although its security crackdown targeting minority Muslims is unlikely to see a significant change in direction.
On Saturday, the official Xinhua news agency reported that Chen Quanguo, whose heavy handed security campaign in the western region drew international sanctions, had been replaced after five years.
Chen, 66 and a member of China's Politburo, a top policy-making body, was succeeded as Xinjiang Communist Party secretary by Ma Xingrui, who was governor of Guangdong. Analysts said Ma's stewardship of Guangdong, China's largest provincial economy, may point to why he was chosen. 
""I suspect one rationale behind this appointment is to signal 'normalcy' in Xinjiang, though it will not be normal there, and to stress 'economic development' of the region,"" said James Millward, professor of history at Georgetown University.
The United States has labelled China’s treatment of ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang as genocide. The United States and a few other countries plan a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics in February over the issue.
U.N. experts and researchers have estimated that more than a million ethnic Uyghurs have been detained in internment centres since 2016.
China rejects all accusations of abuse and says its policies in Xinjiang are necessary to eradicate extremism. In late 2019, Beijing said all those who had been in what it called ""vocational training centres"" had ""graduated"".
Last week, U.S. President Joe Biden signed into law legislation banning imports from Xinjiang over concerns about forced labour, provoking further Chinese condemnation.
Asked by Reuters if the change in leadership in Xinjiang was made in response to international pressure or if it signals a change in policy for the region, China's foreign ministry said, ""this matter is a normal personnel change in China
MISSION COMPLETED?
Chen was seen to have ""completed his mission"" in Xinjiang, said Wu Qiang, a Beijing political analyst and former Tsinghua University lecturer who was among analysts who believe Chen could be rewarded for his work there with a promotion in the wider reshuffle ahead of next year's Communist Party Congress.
""I don't think his political career ends here,"" Wu said.
Chen had previously been party chief in Tibet, another restive border region, where he honed some of the tactics used in Xinjiang. 
Xinhua said Chen will move to another role but did not give details.
""I believe that Xinjiang's policies will indeed experience some adjustments, for example, stressing development and starting to pay as much attention to development as stability,"" Wu said.
This year, for example, China stepped up promotion of Xinjiang as a destination for domestic tourists.
Experts said that while Ma, an aerospace engineer and former industry executive, may have been chosen for his economic credentials, the move does not indicate a change in direction: Chen had implemented the measures in Xinjiang, but China's broader approach was spearheaded by President Xi Jinping. 
In a speech on Saturday, Ma, 62, said that he would ""persist in taking social stability and long-term stability as the general goal of Xinjiang's work,"" according to state media, indicating continuity with Chen.
During a visit to the Xinjiang International Grand bazaar in the provincial capital Urumqi on Monday, Ma said ""high quality"" economic growth would be a focus of his tenure.

""We must modernise supply chains,"" Ma said, according to a Xinjiang Daily report.
""We must deepen reform of 'decentralization and management of services', promote tax and fee reduction, create a good market-oriented, rule-of-law, and international business environment.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Harry Reid, the pugnacious son of a Nevada hard-rock miner who rose from poverty to become the U.S. Senate majority leader and earned a reputation as a fierce partisan fighter during an era of political gridlock in Washington, died on Tuesday. He was 82.
Reid, a former amateur boxer who represented Nevada in the U.S. Congress as a Democrat for more than three decades, died after a long battle with pancreatic cancer, his wife of 62 years, Landra, said in a statement. 
""I've had the honor of serving with some of the all-time great Senate Majority Leaders in our history. Harry Reid was one of them. And for Harry, it wasn't about power for power's sake. It was about the power to do right for the people,"" U.S. President Joe Biden said in a written statement.
U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said late on Tuesday that the country had lost an honorable public servant, adding that the Reid made a meaningful difference in people’s lives.
""Harry Reid rose through the ranks in Washington, becoming Senate Majority Leader, but he never forgot his humble beginnings in Searchlight, Nevada – and he always fought for working families and the poor,"" Harris said in a separate written statement.
As majority leader, Reid served as President Barack Obama's point man in the Senate and helped secure congressional passage of Obama's signature healthcare law, known as Obamacare, in 2010 over furious Republican opposition.
Obama on Tuesday posted to social media a recent letter he had written to Reid: 
""You were a great leader in the Senate, and early on you were more generous to me than I had any right to expect,"" Obama said in the letter. ""I wouldn't have been president had it not been for your encouragement and support, and I wouldn't have got most of what I got done without your skill and determination.""
Reid retired in 2016, one year after suffering broken ribs and facial bones and injuring an eye in an accident while exercising at home.
He had ascended to the job of majority leader in 2007 despite being a political moderate who differed from many in his party on abortion, the environment and gun control. In that job Reid regularly clashed with the Republicans and maintained poor relations with the opposition party's leaders.
""I always would rather dance than fight but I know how to fight,"" Reid said in 2004, in a reference to his boxing career.
In 2012, Mitch McConnell, then the Senate's top Republican, labeled Reid ""the worst leader in the Senate ever"" while Reid accused McConnell of a breach of faith on an important issue. 
During Reid's time as majority leader, major legislation languished because Democrats and Republicans could not compromise. His relationship with McConnell was so strained that the Republican leader shunned Reid during crucial U.S. fiscal policy talks and dealt directly with Vice President Joe Biden.
""The nature of Harry's and my jobs brought us into frequent and sometimes intense conflict over politics and policy. But I never doubted that Harry was always doing what he earnestly, deeply felt was right for Nevada and our country. He will rightly go down in history as a crucial, pivotal figure in the development and history of his beloved home state,"" McConnell said in a written statement.
In 2013, fed up with Republican procedural moves blocking Obama's judicial and executive branch nominees, Reid pushed through the Senate a historic change to the Senate's filibuster rules, preventing a minority party from blocking presidential appointments except those to the Supreme Court.
Republicans said the move was a naked power grab.
Reid was first elected to the House in 1982 and was sent to the Senate by Nevada voters in 1986. He showed remarkable resilience, fighting off spirited re-election challenges.
HUMBLE ORIGINS
Tact was not Reid's strong suit. He called Republican President George W. Bush a ""loser"" and ""liar"" and said Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan was ""one of the biggest political hacks we have in Washington.""
He apologized in 2010 for referring to Obama, the first black U.S. president, in private conversations two years earlier as ""light-skinned"" with ""no Negro dialect,"" saying, ""I deeply regret using such a poor choice of words.""
Reid became a Mormon as a young man and eventually became the highest-ranking member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in U.S. public office.
During the 2012 presidential race, Reid became a Democratic attack dog, accusing Obama's Republican challenger Mitt Romney of paying no federal income taxes for 10 years. Romney insisted he paid ""all the taxes required by law.""
Harry Mason Reid was born into a poor family in the tiny desert mining town of Searchlight, Nevada, on Dec. 2, 1939. His father was a miner with an eighth-grade education who committed suicide in 1972. 
His mother, who never finished high school, took in laundry from brothels to help out financially. The family lived in a small cabin with no indoor plumbing, hot water or telephone.
""I learned in America, it doesn't matter the education of your parents, what their religion is or isn't, their social status - we had none - the color of their skin or their economic status. I am an example of this. If I made it, anyone can,"" Reid said in 2007.
Reid attended a two-room school through eighth grade, then hitchhiked 40 miles (64 km) each week to high school, boarding with local families before hitchhiking home each weekend.
He graduated from Utah State University in 1961 and then worked nights as a U.S. Capitol policeman while he attended law school at George Washington University in Washington. He earned his law degree in 1964 and moved back to Nevada.
Reid was a trial lawyer and held various Nevada state offices. He headed the Nevada Gaming Commission from 1977 to 1981.
In the Senate, Reid won passage of an ethics measure barring senators from accepting gifts, meals or trips from lobbyists in 2007.

He voted for Iraq war resolutions in 1991 and 2002. While Reid remained a backer of the first Iraq war, he reversed himself and opposed the second one, accusing Bush's administration of misleading the nation into it.
Reid and his wife, Landra, had five children.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The parents of a girl killed in a clothing store dressing room by a Los Angeles police officer's stray bullet last week called for justice on Tuesday, the day after police released video showing the chaotic moments leading to the fatal shooting. 
The 14-year-old girl, Valentina Orellana-Peralta, was inadvertently shot dead in a North Hollywood store on Dec. 23 when a police officer opened fire on a man who was bludgeoning another shopper after accosting and menacing several others. 
The suspect was killed. But police said one round from the officer's rifle apparently pierced the wall of a fitting room where the girl was hiding, out of view, with her mother, striking the teenager in the chest. The girl, who had been shopping for a dress, died instantly in her mother's arms.
""It is like my whole heart has been ripped out of my body,"" her father, Juan Pablo Orellana Larenas, said in a statement read by the family's attorney, Ben Crump, during a news conference outside of Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) headquarters. ""We want justice for our daughter. Valentina's life mattered.""
The parents wept as they stood next to a wreath with flowers and photographs of their Chilean-born daughter. They wore signs around their necks that read ""justice for my daughter"" written in both English and Spanish. 
The parents and their lawyers did not specify how they would like justice to be served.
The parents described their daughter as an exceptional student who aspired to become an engineer.
""She had great dreams of becoming an American citizen. She wanted to be here in the United States because this was the land of opportunity,"" Crump said. 
Orellana-Peralta was born and raised in Chile's capital, Santiago, and came to the United States six months ago with her mother to visit an older sister, the Los Angeles Times reported. 
Her mother had been working on documentation to stay in the United States with her daughter permanently.
Police Chief Michel Moore issued a statement promising a ""thorough, complete and transparent"" investigation. The California attorney general's office also has opened an independent inquiry.
Store security video released on Monday showed the suspect's erratic, threatening behavior after he entered the store with his bicycle, and the pandemonium that ensued as he began attacking customers with a heavy, metal cable lock. 
Police also released recordings of 911 emergency calls from store employees and others reporting an armed suspect assaulting customers, triggering an evacuation.
Audio-video footage from several officers' body-worn cameras showed the final, violent moments of the incident as police arrive on the scene with guns drawn and close in on the suspect, who was bludgeoning a woman. 
The policeman nearest the suspect can be heard shouting, ""She's bleeding, she's bleeding,"" just before he rounds a corner and confronts the assailant, as the woman tries to crawl away.
The suspect, holding the bike lock and another large object in his hands, is seen standing with his back to the outside of the fitting room, several steps from the bleeding victim as the officer raises his rifle and fires three shots at him.
The man, identified as Daniel Elena-Lopez, 24, died at the scene. The Los Angeles Times has reported he had several prior felony convictions.

The 14-year-old girl was found shot to death shortly afterward in the dressing room as police searched the store for any additional victims, police said. The woman beaten with the cable lock was taken to a local hospital and survived.
The officer who fired the shots has been placed on administrative leave pending the investigation, police said.

DENVER (Reuters) - A hotel clerk gravely wounded in a Denver-area shooting spree died on Tuesday, bringing to five the number of people killed in Monday night's rampage by a gunman, who was slain by police, authorities said.
Police in Denver and the adjacent suburb of Lakewood announced the latest death at a news briefing a day after the rampage, which spanned both municipalities and two tattoo shops.
Police identified the gunman as 47-year-old Lyndon James McLeod. They did not offer a possible motive and provided few details about McLeod, except to say that all of the dead but one, the hotel clerk, were known to him. McLeod's ties to the victims were not explained.
McLeod died following an exchange of gunfire with a Lakewood police officer who, despite taking a bullet to the abdomen, was able to fire her weapon, fatally striking the gunman, police said.
Lakewood police spokesman John Romero declined to name the officer, a three-year veteran of the force, but called her actions “heroic.”
“She took a situation that was horrendous and put herself in harm’s way to stop it,” Romero said, adding that the officer underwent surgery and was expected to survive.
Denver Police Chief Paul Pazen said McLeod had been on ""law enforcement’s radar"" prior to the shooting as the subject of investigations in 2020 and again in 2021, but was never charged with a crime. Pazen declined to discuss the nature of the probes.
Police said the shooting began shortly after 5 p.m. on Monday when McLeod entered a tattoo parlor near downtown Denver and opened fire, killing two women and critically wounding a man.

He then shot dead a man at a home in east Denver before firing at others on the city’s west side without hitting anyone. Police said McLeod then got into a running gun battle with Denver police who were pursuing him.
He ultimately drove to Lakewood and entered another tattoo shop, where he fatally shot a man, then stormed into a hotel and shot the clerk, leading to his deadly encounter with the Lakewood officer.

(Reuters) - John Madden, the beefy, exuberant Super Bowl-winning coach of the Oakland Raiders who became one of America's best-known TV sports announcers and lent his name to a wildly successful football video game franchise, died on Tuesday at age 85, the National Football League (NFL) said. 
The league said he died ""unexpectedly"" but did not provide further details. 
Madden, inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2006, brought unbridled enthusiasm and a sense of fun to NFL games during a three-decade broadcasting career. He was the master of onomatopoeia, using terms like ""boom,"" ""whap"" and ""doink"" to explain football plays to viewers.
The son of an auto mechanic, Madden appealed to fans as an exponent of America's most popular sports league - and as a advertising pitchman for such varied products as beer, hardware stores and foot fungus medicine.
His ""Madden NFL,"" sold by EA Sports, became one of the best-selling sports video games of all time. Launched in 1988 and sold for decades, the game carried his name and he helped make it as realistic as possible.
The video game's popularity gave rise to its own legend: The ""Madden Curse"" held that the NFL star shown on the game's cover might suffer an injury or a precipitous drop in productivity. 
Before becoming a TV commentator, Madden served as head coach of the Raiders from 1969 to 1978. In those days, the Raiders were considered the NFL's outlaws, with outrageous, rebellious players, an excitable, arm-flailing coach and an owner, Al Davis, whose motto said it all: ""Just Win, Baby.""
With players like Kenny ""The Snake"" Stabler, Gene Upshaw, Art Shell (LON:RDSa), Willie Brown and Fred Biletnikoff, winning became almost second nature for the Raiders under Madden.
The highlight of his coaching career was a 32-14 stomping of the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl XI on Jan. 9, 1977.
An indelible image came moments after the game ended when the Raiders players hoisted the coach to their shoulders and carried him off the field in victory, with Madden flashing a huge smile with his right hand thrust toward the sky.
UNCANNY ABILITY
Madden won numerous Emmy awards during his broadcasting career and was recognized as one of the best color announcers ever to call NFL games. He possessed an uncanny ability to explain the intricacies of the game in an entertaining way that satisfied hard-core fans and football neophytes alike.
Madden became one of the highest-paid sports announcers. During his career, he called games for all the major U.S. broadcast TV networks. He retired as an announcer in 2009 after working Super Bowl XLIII.
""My dad worked hard. He was a mechanic,"" Madden said in his Hall of Fame induction speech in 2006. ""... I have never worked a day in my life. I went from player to coach to a broadcaster, and I am the luckiest guy in the world.""
""I don't think there's anybody who has made the NFL more interesting, more relevant, and has educated more people about football than John Madden,"" Al Michaels, his long-time on-the-air partner, told the New York Times in 2008.
Madden was known for certain idiosyncrasies. He developed a fear of flying after his coaching career and traveled to games as a broadcaster by bus - but not just any bus.
He logged 80,000 miles annually aboard the ""Madden Cruiser,"" an $800,000, 45-foot (13.7-meter) luxury vehicle with multiple TVs, sauna, shower, two bathrooms, a full kitchen, and a bedroom with a queen-sized bed.
Madden was born on April 10, 1936, in Minnesota and grew up in northern California. After playing college football at Cal Poly, he was drafted by the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles in 1958, but sustained a career-ending knee injury during training camp.
He turned to coaching and his success as San Diego State's head coach drew the notice of the Raiders, who hired him as assistant coach. He became one of youngest head coaches in pro football when the Raiders handed him the job at age 32.
The Raiders never had a losing season and made the playoffs eight times under Madden, whose .759 regular-season winning percentage (103 wins, 32 losses, seven ties) stood as the best for an NFL coach with at least 100 career victories. He retired after the 1978 season due to a stomach ulcer and fatigue.

""Nobody loved football more than Coach. He was football,"" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement Tuesday. ""There will never be another John Madden, and we will forever be indebted to him for all he did to make football and the NFL what it is today.""
Madden married wife Virginia in 1959. They had two sons.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The judge in British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell's sex abuse trial on Tuesday asked jurors to meet every day this week, saying a change to the schedule could help avoid a mistrial caused by the rapid spread of the COVID-19 Omicron variant.
U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan said a positive COVID-19 case among jurors would ""(put) at risk our ability to complete this trial.""
Maxwell, 60, is accused of recruiting and grooming four teenage girls to have sexual encounters with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein between 1994 and 2004. 
The trial had been scheduled to break on Thursday and Friday ahead of New Year's Eve, but, ""Given the Omicron variant, I must require deliberations every day going forward until they reach a verdict,"" the judge told lawyers in the case before calling in the jury to dismiss them for the evening. 
Over a three-week trial, jurors have heard emotional and explicit testimony from the four accusers, three of whom said Maxwell herself touched their nude bodies.
Jurors began deliberations on the afternoon of Dec. 20. 
""Our deliberations are moving along and we are making progress,"" the jury told the judge in a note, which Nathan read aloud in court on Tuesday. 
Nathan has not had to replace any of the 12 jurors.
If one juror were unable to continue serving, an alternate juror would be seated, and the jury would have to begin deliberations from scratch. 

Five alternate jurors sat through the three-week trial, but have not been present for deliberations.
Maxwell, the daughter of late British media baron Robert Maxwell, has pleaded not guilty to six counts of sex trafficking and other crimes. Her lawyers argue prosecutors are treating her as a scapegoat for Epstein, who killed himself in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges.

520,"<span>Dec 28, 2021 05:41PM ET</span>","(Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday expressed caution over upbeat comments by Iran and Russia about talks in Vienna to salvage the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, saying it was still too soon to say if Tehran had returned to the negotiations with a constructive approach.
Iran and Russia both gave upbeat views on Tuesday about talks that kicked off this week to salvage Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with global powers, although Western nations have said the negotiations are going too slowly.
Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said a deal was possible in the near future if other parties showed ""good faith"" while Russian envoy Mikhail Ulyanov said a working group was making ""indisputable progress"" in the eighth round of talks.
Speaking at a telephonic press briefing, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said there was some progress in the last round of talks but it was too soon to tell whether Tehran, in the current round, returned to the table to build on those gains.
""It's really too soon to tell whether Iran has returned with a more constructive approach to this round,"" Price said. ""We are now assessing, in the course of these talks, whether the Iranians came back with an agenda of new issues or preliminary solutions to the ones already presented,"" Price said.
The original agreement lifted sanctions against Tehran in exchange for restrictions on its atomic activities but Donald Trump pulled Washington out of the deal in 2018, a year after he became U.S president. Iran later breached many of the deal's nuclear restrictions and kept pushing well beyond them.
The latest round of indirect talks between Iran and the United States resumed on Monday in Vienna, with Tehran focused on getting U.S. sanctions lifted again, as they were under the original bargain, despite scant progress on reining in its atomic activities. 
Iran refuses to meet U.S. officials directly, meaning other parties to the deal besides the United States and Iran --- Russia, China, France, Britain, Germany and the European Union -- must shuttle between the two sides.
The seventh round of talks, the first under Iran's new hardline President Ebrahim Raisi, ended 11 days ago after some new Iranian demands were added to a working text. 
""The Vienna talks are headed in a good direction,"" Iranian Minister Amirabdollahian said in comments to reporters broadcast by state media. ""We believe that if other parties continue the round of talks which just started with good faith, reaching a good agreement for all parties is possible.""
The U.S. delegation, led by Special Envoy Rob Malley, will be in a better position in the coming days to determine whether Iran has to come to the latest round of talks with a 'fundamentally different position,"" Price said.
Iran insists all U.S. sanctions must be lifted before steps are taken on the nuclear side, while Western negotiators say nuclear and sanctions steps must be balanced in the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA).
URGENT NEGOTIATIONS
European negotiators also said some technical progress had been made in the last round of talks to accommodate Iranian requests, but warned that the parties only had weeks, not months, to salvage the deal.
France, Germany and the United Kingdom said in a statement on Tuesday that technical progress had been made in the last round and the parties now needed to fully focus on the key outstanding issues, particularly nuclear and sanctions.
They said while they were not setting an artificial deadline, there were weeks not months left to strike a deal. 
""The negotiation is urgent - and our teams are here to work swiftly and in good faith towards getting a deal.""
Ulyanov, the Russian envoy, said on Tuesday that a working group was making progress. ""Sanctions lifting is being actively discussed in informal settings,"" he wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
The 2015 deal extended the time Iran would need to obtain enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb - if it chose to - to at least a year from about two to three months. Most experts say that time is now less than before the deal, although Iran says it only wants to master nuclear technology for civil uses.
Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said Israel would not automatically oppose a nuclear deal but world powers must take a firmer position.

Israel says it will never allow Iran to get nuclear weapons and that all options are on the table. Israeli leaders have said that a nuclear Iran would pose an existential threat to Israel.

(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday allowed a criminal case relating to the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol attack to move forward, declining to dismiss charges against four members of the far-right Proud Boys group.
In a written ruling https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21170590/proud-boys.pdf, U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly rejected arguments by the four Proud Boys defendants that obstruction charges should be thrown out.
The defendants — Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs, Zachary Rehl, and Charles Donohoe — have been charged with violating a federal law that makes it a felony to obstruct an official government proceeding, among other charges.
That obstruction charge has been used by prosecutors in more than 230 of the 700 criminal cases against participants in the assault.
Four people died on the day of the riot by supporters of then President Donald Trump and one Capitol police officer died the next day of injuries sustained while defending Congress.
Hundreds of police were injured during the several-hour onslaught and four officers who guarded the Capitol have since taken their own lives.
The Proud Boys defendants said the obstruction law is unconstitutional because it is vaguely written and could chill free speech rights.
Kelly, who sits in the District of Columbia, rejected that argument.

""No matter Defendants political motivations or any political message they wished to express, this alleged conduct is simply not protected by the First Amendment,"" Kelly said in his ruling. ""Defendants are not, as they argue, charged with anything like burning flags, wearing black armbands, or participating in mere sit-ins or protests.""
About 40 defendants allegedly affiliated with far-right groups like the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers and the Three Percenters have been charged with conspiring either to impede Congress or law enforcement officials protecting the Capitol.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia's Supreme Court ordered the country's oldest human rights group to disband on Tuesday for breaking a law requiring it to act as ""a foreign agent"", capping a year of crackdowns on Kremlin critics unseen since the Soviet era.
The closure of Memorial International bookmarks a year in which Alexei Navalny, the Kremlin's top critic, was jailed, his movement banned and many of his allies forced to flee. Moscow says it is simply enforcing laws to thwart extremism and shield the country from what it says is malign foreign influence.
Critics say that Vladimir Putin, in power as president or prime minister since 1999, is turning back the clock to the Soviet era when there was zero tolerance of dissent. The Kremlin, at odds with the West on everything from Ukraine to Syria, says it is impossible to recreate the Soviet Union. 
The legal assault on Memorial, which documents and keeps alive the memory of Josef Stalin's 1937-38 ""Great Terror"" among other episodes, is an attempt to whitewash Soviet Russia's darkest chapters which do not chime with the Kremlin's narrative of a resurgent country with nothing to be ashamed of, they say. 
""Memorial is a special organisation with its own ideology. We combine what's called relevant human rights activities with historical studies and comprehending the historical path of Russia in the 20th century. It seems that such a union does not please someone in the Russian leadership,"" Oleg Orlov, a Memorial board member, said outside the court.
As the court heard the case against Memorial, which said it was a force for good even if it sometimes made minor bureaucratic errors, four policemen clad in fur hats carried away a bearded protester after he shouted: ""There are no laws, there is no property, there are no rights, there are no choices.""
As the man was carried away, he shouted: ""Russians love the son of a bitch Stalin.""
A state prosecutor told the court that Memorial had promoted what he called a false image of the USSR as ""a terrorist state"" and blackened the memory of the communist state's behaviour during World War Two. He said ""someone"" was paying Memorial for such treachery.
Memorial is open about the fact that it receives funding from abroad, one of the main reasons the authorities have labelled it a foreign agent. Its website lists funding from Poland, Germany, Canada and the Czech Republic. 
Though Putin has made clear he is no fan of communism, modern school text books have praised Stalin's role as a moderniser and as the man who helped the Soviet Union defeat the Nazis in World War Two, one of the cornerstones of the image which Putin has tried to forge for modern Russia. 
Memorial said in a statement that the ruling showed the modern Russian state objected to its interpretation of Soviet history.
""The decision ... confirmed that the history of political terror ... does not remain an academic theme for Russia of interest for just specialists but an acute problem for modern Russia. Our country needs an honest and scrupulous reflection on its Soviet past,"" it said. 
Memorial would find legal ways to continue its work because it was not an organisation or even a movement, it said. 
""Memorial is the need for Russia's citizens to know the truth. Nobody will succeed in 'liquidating' this need.""
International rights groups and the U.S. State Department condemned the ruling.
""We urge Russian authorities to end their harassment of independent voices and human rights defenders and stand in solidarity with those who have been targeted for repression for exercising their rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters.
Established in the ""glasnost"" era of Soviet liberalisation by prominent dissidents including Nobel Peace Prize-winner and nuclear physicist Andrei Sakharov, Memorial served as Russia's main rights group through two wars in Chechnya in the 1990s.
More recently, it has spoken out against repression of critics under Putin and has published lists of people it regards as political prisoners. 
The authorities placed the group on an official list of ""foreign agents"" in 2015, a move that entailed numerous restrictions on its activities.
Prosecutors last month accused the Memorial Human Rights Centre and Memorial International, its parent structure, of violating the foreign agent law.
Prosecutors said Memorial International breached the regulations by not marking all its publications, including social media posts, with the label. They accused the Moscow-based centre of condoning terrorism and extremism, something it denied.

A separate court hearing about the fate of the Memorial Human Rights Centre was due on Wednesday. 
Putin, a former intelligence officer in the Soviet KGB security service, said this month that Memorial had defended organisations Russia considers extremist and terrorist, and that its list of victims of Soviet-era repression included Nazi collaborators.

WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) -U.S. and Russian officials will hold security talks on Jan. 10 to discuss concerns about their respective military activity and confront rising tensions over Ukraine, the two countries said.
A spokesperson for U.S. President Joe Biden's administration announced the date late on Monday, and said Russia and NATO were also likely to hold talks on Jan. 12, with a broader meeting including Moscow, Washington and other European countries set for Jan. 13.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov confirmed those dates on Tuesday and said he hoped the talks with the United States in Geneva would start a process that would give Moscow new security guarantees from the West.
Such guarantees are a longstanding demand of Moscow, which alarmed the West by massing tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine in the past two months following its seizure of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014 and its backing of separatists fighting Kyiv troops in eastern Ukraine.
The European Union demanded a say in any security deal. 
""Any discussion about European security must happen in coordination with and participation of EU,"" said EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell after talking to British foreign minister Liz Truss.
The Jan. 12 NATO meeting would be held in EU hub Brussels, Ryabkov said, while the Jan. 13 talks would involve the Vienna-based Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which includes the United States and its NATO allies, as well as Russia, Ukraine and other ex-Soviet states.
CONCERNS ON THE TABLE
Russia has denied plans for an assault on Ukraine but says it could take unspecified military action if its security demands are not met.
Moscow, worried by what it says is the West's re-arming of Ukraine, has said it wants legally-binding guarantees NATO will not expand further eastwards, and that certain offensive weapons will not be deployed to Ukraine or other neighbouring countries.
The U.S. administration has threatened to impose economic sanctions if Russia attacks Ukraine. It says it cannot promise a sovereign state such as Ukraine would never join NATO.
""When we sit down to talk, Russia can put its concerns on the table, and we will put our concerns on the table with Russia's activities as well,"" said the spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Council, who declined to be identified. The spokesperson said no decisions would be made about Ukraine without Ukraine.
A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Reuters the United States would keep the Harry Truman carrier in Europe for now rather than sending it to the Middle East. 
The official said there were no plans to move it closer to Ukraine and despite the Russian troop buildup, there was still no U.S. warship in the Black Sea. 
Biden on Monday signed into law a spending bill that, among other things, will provide $300 million for an initiative supporting Ukraine's armed forces and billions more for European defence broadly.

Russia's annexation of Crimea and support for the separatist uprising in the east of Ukraine resulted in Kyiv losing control of a swath of territory in a conflict it says killed 15,000 people. 
Major combat ended with a ceasefire in 2015, but deadly clashes still take place regularly.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jurors deliberating in the sexual abuse trial of British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell in New York have so far sent several notes to U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan. The notes do not reveal what jurors are thinking about her guilt or innocence but they do provide a glimpse into some of the evidence they have been discussing since the late afternoon of Dec. 20:
WHAT DOES 'ENTICEMENT' MEAN? 
On Monday, jurors asked Nathan for a definition of the word ""enticement."" Maxwell faces one charge of enticing an underage girl to travel for illegal sexual activity, and another count of conspiracy to do the same. 
The charge of enticement relates to Jane, the pseudonym for a woman who testified during the trial's first week that she started having sexual contact with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein in 1994 when she was 14, and that Maxwell participated in some of their encounters.
Nathan said she would reply that to entice means ""to attract, induce or lure using hope or desire."" 
JANE'S TRAVEL
Jurors on Monday also asked Nathan whether they could convict Maxwell if they found that she helped coordinate Jane's return travel from New Mexico - one of the places Jane said she was abused by Epstein - but not her travel there. 
Nathan said she found the question confusing and referred the jury to the instructions she gave them before the deliberations began. 
The request suggested that the jury was closely scrutinizing Jane's account of Maxwell's role in arranging her travel. Maxwell faces one count of transporting a minor for illegal sex acts and another count of conspiracy to do the same. 
Jurors also requested the transcript of the testimony of Juan Alessi, a former Epstein employee who said he drove Jane to an airport to travel with Epstein and Maxwell, as well as the testimony of David Rodgers, Epstein's former pilot who said Jane was sometimes a passenger on the globetrotting investor's private jet. 
ACCUSER CAROLYN'S TALKS WITH THE FBI
Jurors on Dec. 21 asked Nathan for details about the testimony of Carolyn, who said Epstein began abusing her when she was 14 in 2002. 

Defense attorney Jeffrey Pagliuca sought to undermine Carolyn's credibility, pressing her about why she did not mention Maxwell's alleged role in her abuse during a 2007 conversation with the FBI. 
Jurors asked the judge to see the record of the FBI conversation. Nathan told the jury it was not in evidence, but said they could review the trial transcript.

CAPE TOWN (Reuters) -As South Africa celebrated the life of anti-apartheid hero Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who died on Sunday, one of his daughters recalled the day he saved a young man from being burned alive by an angry mob as one of her proudest memories.
In 1985, the country was in a state of emergency as banned liberation parties, including the now ruling African National Congress, sought to ratchet up political pressure and overthrow white-minority rule.
At a funeral in July of that year on the outskirts of Johannesburg, archived video footage shows Tutu, clearly visible in his purple clerical robes, stepping in to push back against angry young mourners who were beating and kicking a defenceless man curled up in the foetal position on the dusty ground.
Accused of being an apartheid collaborator, the man is doused with petrol and is moments away from being ""necklaced"" - the term used to describe having a tyre placed around your neck, doused with flammable liquid and then set alight. The intervention of Tutu and other clergy save the man. 
""To see that and to see him going in. There were so many things striking about it,"" Nontombi Naomi Tutu, one of four of Tutu's children, told Reuters outside the family home in Cape Town.
""One was that he had the courage to go into the crowd and say: 'No, this is not how we do it.' But, the other is that those young people listened ... There was still that respect for Daddy and the other clergy ... That is my proudest moment, that whenever I think what made me proud of Daddy that is the thing that I always go to,"" she said.
Tutu used the pulpit to preach against the repressive white-minority regime in South Africa, which came to an end in the 1990s, and regularly spoke at the funerals of young activists killed by the state's security apparatus. 
Nontombi, 61, a reverend herself and who bears a striking resemblance to her larger-than-life father, also fondly remembered family road trips from Alice in the Eastern Cape to Swaziland where she and her three siblings attended school.
""He was a regular father. The one thing I have to say, as much as Ma was the disciplinarian, it was when Daddy would say something like: ‘I am so disappointed’. That hit, it was really hard and that was what we never wanted, to disappoint Daddy, because it took so much to disappoint him,"" Nontombi said.

To accommodate mourners wishing to visit St George’s Cathedral to pay their final respects, Tutu's remains will lie in state at the cathedral for an extra day on Thursday, in addition to Friday, a statement from the Desmond & Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation said.
The archbishop, who didn't want any lavish spending and requested the cheapest coffin available, will be cremated privately and his ashes interred in the cathedral, the Foundation added.

(Reuters) - Former U.S. President Donald Trump has resolved a dispute with the PGA of America over the golf association's decision earlier this year to pull a major professional tournament from a Trump-owned golf course, the PGA of America said.
In a press release, the PGA said it had reached a confidential settlement with the Trump Organization that resolves legal claims stemming from its decision in the wake of the storming of the U.S. Capitol to shun Trump's golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey.
""While the terms of the settlement will remain confidential, representatives from both the PGA and the Trump Organization expressed satisfaction with the agreement,"" the press release stated.
The PGA of America said on Jan. 10 it was stripping Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, of the 2022 PGA Championship, one of four prestigious majors on the annual golf calendar, following a vote by its board of directors.
“It has become clear that conducting the PGA Championship at Trump Bedminster would be detrimental to the PGA of America brand,” PGA of America President Jim Richerson said in a video announcing the decision.
Four people died on the day of the Jan. 6 riots, and one Capitol police officer died the next day of injuries sustained while defending Congress. More than 100 police officers were injured during the multi-hour onslaught by Trump supporters, and four officers have since taken their own lives.
More than 700 people have been arrested in connection with the assault on the Capitol.

The PGA press release did not say whether Trump golf courses will host future PGA tournaments.
""We look forward to continuing to support the mission of the PGA and its Professionals, who are the best in the golf industry,"" Eric Trump, a son of the former president and a Trump Organization executive, said in a statement included as part of the press release.

527,"<span>Dec 28, 2021 11:42AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) -A senior U.N. official called on Myanmar authorities to investigate the reported killing of at least 35 civilians that opposition activists blamed on government soldiers, saying he was ""horrified"" at the violence.
The ruling military has not commented on the killings near Mo So village in Kayah State on Friday and several calls since Saturday to junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun went unanswered.
State media reported on Sunday that soldiers had fired on and killed an unspecified number of ""terrorists with weapons"" in the village. It did not say anything about civilians. 
U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths said there were credible reports the civilians, including at least one child, were forced from vehicles, killed and burned. He did not elaborate on why he considered the reports credible.
""I am horrified by reports of an attack against civilians... I condemn this grievous incident and all attacks against civilians throughout the country, which are prohibited under international humanitarian law,"" he said in a statement.
Griffiths called for ""a thorough and transparent"" investigation so the perpetrators could be brought to justice.
The Save the Children aid group said two of its workers, travelling to their home villages for the year-end holiday, had been killed by the Myanmar military in the attack. It suspended operations in Kayah State and parts of neighbouring Karen State and the Magway region.
The two staff were both new fathers who were passionate about educating children, the group said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that violence against civilians was intolerable.
""The UN Security Council must convene as soon as possible to set out the steps they will take to hold those responsible to account,"" chief executive Inger Ashing said. 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned the attacks and called on the international community to end the sale of arms and dual-use technology to the Myanmar military in an effort to prevent the ""recurrence of atrocities"".
""The targeting of innocent people and humanitarian actors is unacceptable, and the military’s widespread atrocities against the people of Burma underscore the urgency of holding its members accountable,"" Blinken said in a statement, using another name for the country.
Two residents and the Karenni Human Rights Group, which operates in the area, said soldiers had killed more than 30 civilians.
They said details were sketchy but it appeared the victims had been in vehicles, including at least one truck, that were stopped on a road. They were killed and the bodies set ablaze, the residents and the rights group said.
CHARRED BODIES
A villager who declined to be identified for security reasons said he knew there had been a fire at the site on Friday but could not go there as there was shooting.
""I went to see this morning. I saw dead bodies that had been burnt and also the clothes of children and women spread around,"" he told Reuters by phone on Saturday.
Photographs posted by the rights group showed charred bodies, some in the back of a burned-out truck. Reuters was not able to independently verify the authenticity of the pictures.
Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military on Feb. 1 overthrew the elected government of Nobel Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
Some opponents of the military have taken up arms, some linking up with ethnic minority guerrillas who have for years been fighting the government for self-determination in various parts of the country, including Kayah State in the east.
The killings and burning of bodies in Kayah State followed similar violence https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-soldiers-accused-killing-11-after-charred-remains-found-2021-12-08 in the central Sagaing region on Dec. 7 when villagers said soldiers rounded up 11 people, shot them and then set fire to their bodies.
The military government has not commented on that incident.
Since Myanmar's military launched the coup, more than 1,300 people have been killed in crackdowns on protests and more than 11,000 have been jailed, according to a tally by the Association for Assistance of Political Prisoners rights group.
The military disputes the group's death toll.

Fighting has also flared in Karen State, also in the east, between the army and the Karen National Union (KNU) insurgent group.
Thai authorities say more than 5,000 villagers from Myanmar have fled across a border river to the safety of Thai territory since Dec. 16.

(Reuters) - The congressional committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol is aiming to release an interim report in the summer of 2022 and a final report in the fall, a source familiar with the investigation said on Tuesday.
The timetable, first reported by the Washington Post, would allow the committee to release findings before the November 2022 congressional elections. Republicans, who generally oppose the Select Committee's work, are currently favored to reclaim control of the U.S. House of Representatives in that election, which would allow them to end the panel's work.
The House's Jan. 6 Select Committee is investigating the causes of the attack, including former President Donald Trump's actions and his efforts to change the results of the election.
Trump told the crowd of supporters he would never concede the Nov. 3 election and urged them to ""fight like hell"" before they went to the Capitol, where lawmakers were preparing to certify Democrat Joe Biden's victory.
The committee has issued more than 50 subpoenas and heard from more than 300 witnesses in its investigation of the attack.
The panel has been working mostly behind closed doors, but its leaders have said they plan to hold public hearings in the months ahead.

Four people died on the day of the riot, and one Capitol police officer died the next day of injuries sustained while defending Congress. Hundreds of police were injured during the multi-hour onslaught by Trump supporters, and four officers have since taken their own lives.
More than 700 people have been arrested in connection with the assault on the Capitol.

The Associated Press (AP) reported this month that researchers at the University of Toronto had found that senator Krzysztof Brejza was hacked in 2019 using Pegasus software, during an election in which he was running the campaign of the largest opposition party.
AP also reported that the Citizen Lab project at the University of Toronto found Ewa Wrzosek, a prosecutor critical of the government's judicial reforms, and Roman Giertych, a lawyer who has represented opposition figures, had had their phones hacked.
All three say that Poland's ruling nationalists Law and Justice (PiS) party was responsible for the hacking. 
Stanislaw Zaryn, a spokesman for the Polish security services, said that he could not comment on the methods used by Polish security services or on whether services had investigated specific individuals. 
He has previously said that any suggestion that Polish services were engaged in domestic political battles was false. 
A PiS spokeswoman declined to comment further. ""The security services have commented on this topic,"" she said.
""The prosecutor's office is doing nothing, it is paralysed,"" Brejza told Reuters by telephone, adding that he and his wife had notified prosecutors about possible phone hacking in September.
""The prosecutors' office is playing for time - they do not want to launch an investigation or refuse to launch an investigation, they just treat it as a hot potato that is best to throw somewhere else,"" Brejza said. 
He said the complaint had been passed between prosecutors' offices around the country without any effect.
The National Prosecutors' Office and prosecutor's office in Ostrow Wielkopolski, which is currently dealing with Brejza's case, did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comments.
Government critics say that the prosecutors' office has been politicised. Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro, the architect of judicial reforms that the European Union says undermine the independence of courts, also serves as prosecutor general.

The NSO Group says it makes technology for use by governments and law enforcement agencies to combat crime and terrorism, and has safeguards in place to prevent misuse.
Digital rights researchers say Pegasus has been used to spy on civil society in several countries.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) -Hundreds of troops loyal to Somalia's Prime Minister Mohammed Hussein Roble camped on Tuesday near the residence of his political rival President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, a day after the president tried to suspend the prime minister.
Roble has called Mohamed's plan to suspend him a coup attempt. A statement from the United States, which operates in Somalia against Islamist militants, called on all sides to avoid escalation but also appeared to back the prime minister.
A Reuters photographer at the scene said the security forces had taken no action by Tuesday afternoon apart from assembling. But the gathering spurred fears of a potential clash between forces loyal to the two men.
""Troops have camped in our village. ...If the notorious Villa Somalia (presidential palace) starts war then there will be a crossfire,"" Canab Osman, a mother of seven who operates a grocery shop in a nearby district of the capital Mogadishu told Reuters.
Another resident and local elder, Farah Ali, told Reuters security forces that had amassed in the area were fitting pickup trucks with artillery weapons.
Somalia, where no central government has held broad authority for 30 years, is in the midst of a protracted indirect election process to choose new leadership, repeatedly held up amid confrontation between Mohamed and Roble. 
In April, an attempt by the president to extend his four-year term by two years led army factions loyal to each man to briefly seize rival positions in Mogadishu.
The U.S. State Department African Affairs Bureau said in a tweet late on Monday that it was prepared to act against those obstructing Somalia's path to peace.
""The attempted suspension of ... Roble is alarming and we support his efforts for rapid and credible elections,"" the bureau said. ""All parties must desist from escalatory actions and statements."" 
In suspending Roble, Mohamed accused the prime minister of stealing land owned by the Somali National Army (SNA) and of interfering with a defence ministry investigation.
In response, Roble said Mohamed's action was unconstitutional and aimed at derailing the election. He ordered security forces to start taking orders from him, rather than the president.
The months-long dispute between the prime minister and the president has distracted the government from fighting an insurgency against al Qaeda-linked group al Shabaab. 
In a statement on Tuesday, the Council of Presidential Candidates, a group of politicians who plan to contest the election including two former presidents, called on Mohamed to step down ""as soon as possible in order to end the crisis"".

Mohamed and Roble have accused each other of holding up the parliamentary elections, which began Nov. 1 and were supposed to be completed by Dec. 24. As of Saturday only 24 of 275 lower house representatives had been elected.
According to Somalia's indirect electoral process, regional councils are meant to choose a senate. Clan elders are then meant to pick members of the lower house, which would then choose a new president at a date yet to be fixed.

""The Vienna talks are headed in a good direction... We believe that if other parties continue the round of talks which just started with good faith, reaching a good agreement for all parties is possible,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian told reporters in Tehran.

ITABUNA, Brazil (Reuters) - The death toll from floods hammering northeast Brazil rose to 20 on Monday, as the governor of Bahia state declared it the worst disaster in the state's history and rescuers braced for more rain in the coming days.
Much of Bahia, home to about 15 million people, has suffered from intermittent flooding for weeks, after a long drought gave way to record rains. Flooding in some areas intensified late on Christmas Eve and early on Christmas Day after a pair of dams gave way, sending residents scrambling for higher ground.
Rescue workers patrolled in small dinghies around the city of Itabuna, in southern Bahia, plucking residents from their homes, including some who escaped through second-floor windows.
Bahia Governor Rui Costa said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that 72 municipalities were in a state of emergency.
""Unfortunately, we're living through the worst disaster that has ever occurred in the history of Bahia,"" he wrote.
Manfredo Santana, a lieutenant-colonel in Bahia's firefighting corps, told Reuters that emergency workers had rescued 200 people in just three nearby towns. The heavy currents of the swollen Cachoeira River complicated rescue efforts.
""It's difficult to maneuver even with jet skis,"" he said. ""Rescue teams had to retreat in certain moments.""
Bahia's civil defense agency said on Monday afternoon that 20 people had died in 11 separate municipalities.
Newspaper O Globo, citing a state firefighting official, said that authorities are monitoring an additional 10 dams for any signs they may collapse.

The scrutiny of public infrastructure and urban planning comes just a couple years after the collapse of a mining dam in neighboring Minas Gerais state killed some 270 people.
In televised remarks, Costa, the Bahia governor, attributed the chaotic scenes in part to ""errors that have been committed over the course of years.""

DENVER (Reuters) -A lone gunman shot four people to death and wounded three, including a police officer, on Monday in a Denver-area shooting spree that unfolded at several locations and ended with police killing the suspect, authorities said.
Investigators have yet to determine a motive for the rampage, which began around 5 p.m. when the gunman shot and killed two women and wounded a man near downtown Denver, Police Chief Paul Pazen said a news briefing.
The suspect then fled in a car and fatally shot a man in east Denver's Cheesman Park neighborhood, before opening fire again in a west Denver community where no one was hit, Pazen said. According to Pazen, the suspect twice exchanged gunfire from his vehicle with Denver officers pursuing him, disabling a police cruiser. 
From there, the gunman drove into the neighboring city of Lakewood, where he shot and killed a fourth person inside an unspecified business, according to Lakewood Police spokesman John Romero.
The gunman fled from Lakewood police when they attempted to pull him over and engaged in a running gun battle with officers before fleeing on foot and entering a hotel, where he shot and wounded a clerk, Romero said.
He then shot at police officers again, wounding one of them, before police shot him dead, Romero told reporters. Authorities did not publicly identify the suspect, and said circumstances leading to the shooting remained under investigation.
The conditions of the wounded officer and civilians were not immediately known, Romero said.

Anne Wilson, a shopper who was inside a cellular phone store in Lakewood when gunfire erupted nearby, told a Denver-based NBC-affiliate TV station she heard ""seven or eight gunshots, and then like another set of maybe five more.""
Wilson said she and other customers were quickly ushered by store employees into a back room behind security gates until the danger had passed. ""It is scary, scary times we live in,"" she said.

The satellites from Starlink Internet Services, a division of Musk's SpaceX aerospace company, had two ""close encounters"" with the Chinese space station on July 1 and Oct. 21, according to a document submitted by China earlier this month to the U.N.'s space agency.
""For safety reasons, the China Space Station implemented preventive collision avoidance control,"" China said in a document published on the website of the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs.
The complaints have not been independently verified. SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
In a post on China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) microblogging platform on Monday, one user said Starlink's satellites were ""just a pile of space junk"", while another described them as ""American space warfare weapons"".
With nearly 30,000 satellites and other debris believed to be orbiting the planet, scientists have urged governments to share data to reduce the risk of catastrophic space collisions.
SpaceX alone has deployed nearly 1,900 satellites to serve its Starlink broadband network, and is planning more.
""The risks of Starlink are being gradually exposed, the whole human race will pay for their business activities,"" a user posting under the name Chen Haiying said on Weibo. 
U.S. space agency NASA was forced to abruptly call off a spacewalk at the end of November, citing risks posed by space debris. Musk tweeted in response that some Starlink satellite orbits had been adjusted to reduce the possibility of collisions.

China began constructing the space station in April with the launch of Tianhe, the largest of its three modules. The station is expected to be completed by the end of 2022 after four crewed missions.
Musk has become a well-known figure in China, though Tesla's electric-vehicle business has come under growing scrutiny from regulators, especially after a customer climbed on top of a Tesla car at the Shanghai auto show in April to protest against poor customer service.

(Reuters) -NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, built to give the world its first glimpse of the universe as it existed when the earliest galaxies formed, was launched by rocket early Saturday from the northeastern coast of South America, opening a new era of astronomy.
The revolutionary $9 billion infrared telescope https://graphics.reuters.com/SPACE-EXPLORATION/TELESCOPE/klvyknwbrvg, described by NASA as the premiere space-science observatory of the next decade, was carried aloft inside the cargo bay of an Ariane 5 rocket that blasted off at about 7:20 a.m. EST (1220 GMT) from the European Space Agency's (ESA) launch base in French Guiana.
The flawless Christmas Day launch, with a countdown conducted in French, was carried live on a joint NASA-ESA webcast. The liftoff capped a project decades in the making, coming to fruition after years of repeated delays and cost over-runs.
""From a tropical rain forest to the edge of time itself, James Webb begins a voyage back to the birth of the universe,"" a NASA commentator said as the two-stage launch vehicle, fitted with double solid-rocket boosters, roared off its launch pad into cloudy skies.
After a 27-minute, hypersonic ride into space, the 14,000-pound instrument was released from the upper stage of the French-built rocket about 865 miles above the Earth, and should gradually unfurl to nearly the size of a tennis court over the next 13 days as it sails onward on its own.
Live video captured by a camera mounted on the rocket's upper stage showed the Webb gliding gently away after it was jettisoned, drawing cheers and applause from jubilant flight engineers in the mission control center. 
Flight controllers confirmed moments later, as the Webb's solar-energy array was deployed, that its power supply was working.
Coasting through space for two more weeks, the Webb telescope will reach its destination in solar orbit 1 million miles from Earth - about four times farther away than the moon. And Webb's special orbital path will keep it in constant alignment with the Earth as the planet and telescope circle the sun in tandem.
By comparison, Webb's 30-year-old predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope, orbits the Earth from 340 miles away, passing in and out of the planet's shadow every 90 minutes.
Named after the man who oversaw NASA through most of its formative decade of the 1960s, Webb is about 100 times more sensitive than Hubble and is expected to transform scientists' understanding of the universe and our place in it.
NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, striking a spiritual tone as he addressed the launch webcast by video link, quoted the Bible and hailed the new telescope as a ""time machine"" that will ""capture the light from the very beginning of the creation.""
COSMOLOGICAL HISTORY LESSON
Webb mainly will view the cosmos in the infrared spectrum, allowing it to peer through clouds of gas and dust where stars are being born, while Hubble has operated primarily at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths. 
The new telescope's primary mirror - consisting of 18 hexagonal segments of gold-coated beryllium metal - also has a much bigger light-collecting area, enabling it to observe objects at greater distances, thus farther back into time, than Hubble or any other telescope.
That, astronomers say, will bring into view a glimpse of the cosmos never previously seen - dating to just 100 million years after the Big Bang, the theoretical flashpoint that set in motion the expansion of the observable universe an estimated 13.8 billion years ago.
Hubble's view reached back to roughly 400 million years following the Big Bang, a period just after the very first galaxies - sprawling clusters of stars, gases and other interstellar matter - are believed to have taken shape. 
While Hubble caught glimmers of ""toddler"" galaxies, Webb will reveal those objects in greater detail while also capturing even fainter, earlier ""infant"" galaxies, astrophysicist Eric Smith, NASA's Webb program scientist, told Reuters hours before the launch.
Aside from examining the formation of the earliest stars and galaxies, astronomers are eager to study super-massive black holes believed to occupy the centers of distant galaxies.
Webb's instruments also make it ideal to search for evidence of potentially life-supporting atmospheres around scores of newly documented exoplanets - celestial bodies orbiting distant stars - and to observe worlds much closer to home, such as Mars and Saturn's icy moon Titan.
The telescope is an international collaboration led by NASA in partnership with the European and Canadian space agencies.  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC) was the primary contractor. The Arianespace launch vehicle is part of the European contribution. 
""The world gave us this telescope, and we handed it back to the world today,"" Gregory Robinson, Webb program director for NASA told reporters at a post-launch briefing.
Webb was developed at a cost of $8.8 billion, with operational expenses projected to bring its total price tag https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-nasa-telescope/northrop-ceo-grilled-by-u-s-lawmakers-over-space-telescope-idUSKBN1KG2US to about $9.66 billion, far higher than planned when NASA was previously aiming for a 2011 launch.

Astronomical operation of the telescope, to be managed from the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, is expected to begin in the summer of 2022, following about six months of alignment and calibration of Webb's mirrors and instruments.
It is then that NASA expects to release the initial batch of images captured by Webb. Webb is designed to last up to 10 years.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Next year will be a turning point for U.S. financial policy as Democratic President Joe Biden's new regulators ready a slew of rule changes that are set to create headaches for Wall Street and corporate America. 
A year into his administration, Biden's top financial regulatory team is finally taking shape. Over the next 12 months, his picks are set to reverse the former Trump administration's light touch, taking a tough stance on Wall Street and new players entering the financial sector. 
Top items on the Biden administration's ambitious agenda include creating a regulatory framework for digital assets and financial technology players, boosting competition and addressing climate change.
Next year will be critical for financial firms hoping to shape the outcome of regulations on these issues, analysts and Washington insiders say. 
""2022 is the year where the rhetoric turns into reality for some of the key financial services policy priorities,"" said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research for brokerage BTIG.
While progressives hoped for a swift financial policy overhaul in 2021, the slow pace https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bidens-treasury-hobbled-by-cruzs-nomination-blocks-over-nord-stream-2-officials-2021-10-11 at which the White House has filled https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-house-frustrated-by-slow-pace-senate-confirmations-nominees-2021-08-11 key roles at the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve, consumer watchdog and commodity markets regulator has delayed policy changes, said Aaron Klein, with the Brookings Institution.
With many of those roles now filled https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-votes-confirm-new-consumer-watchdog-chief-2021-09-30 or due to be filled https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/bidens-new-fed-regulation-chief-faces-dilemma-over-trump-rules-rewrite-2021-12-16 in coming months, the agencies can start to get down to business.
Cryptocurrencies are a key area to watch, executives say. Regulators have been exploring the risks of the digital assets and whether they can be regulated under existing federal rules. 
They have warned https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/presidents-working-group-report-calls-stablecoin-regulation-2021-12-02 that stablecoins, digital currencies pegged to a traditional currency, could become systemically risky if they grow in popularity and should be regulated like banks. 
""We'll see the federal financial regulators, who have been very clear that this activity needs to be regulated across the board, start to move forward on some of the specifics,"" said Zach Dexter, chief executive of crypto trading platform FTX US Derivatives.
Regulators are also likely to rein in other fintech players that are moving into the banking space with lending and payments products, amid growing worries these lightly supervised players may be hurting consumers. 
On that front, the regulators will have bank allies. 
""You'll continue to see a lot of activity there, and we'll be very, very active in that debate,"" said Rob Nichols, chief executive of the American Bankers Association. 
For example, Rohit Chopra, who became director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in October, recently demanded https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-cfpb-asks-buy-now-pay-later-companies-data-products-practices-2021-12-16 data from big tech https://www.reuters.com/business/us-consumer-watchdog-lays-out-ambitious-agenda-eye-big-tech-lending-competition-2021-10-27 companies and buy-now-pay-later https://www.reuters.com/technology/buy-now-pay-later-surges-third-us-users-fall-behind-payments-2021-09-09 fintechs on their businesses, suggesting both sectors will receive more scrutiny next year, said industry executives.
Chopra is also likely to move ahead next year with a rule to create so-called open banking, said Scott Talbott, a senior vice president at Washington trade group the Electronic Transactions Association.
That would require traditional financial institutions to give customers access to their own financial data, allowing them to switch more easily https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/what-is-open-banking-2021-07-09 between providers, boosting competition. 
Regulators are also expected to crack down https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/white-house-delay-fed-regulation-chief-bodes-badly-bank-ma-2021-12-02 on bank tie-ups after the Fed and Justice Department complete a review of merger policies next year. Both developments spell bad news for banks. 
""Although significant regulatory pressure has not yet been a decisive factor for the market, investor concern is rising for 2022 and beyond,"" Raymond James wrote in its 2022 banks outlook.
CLIMATE CHANGE
For corporate America more broadly, the Securities and Exchange Commission's draft rule https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-sec-gensler-climate/u-s-sec-chair-gensler-says-new-climate-risk-rules-will-require-companies-to-detail-measure-commitments-to-mitigating-climate-change-idINKBN2IM1UM?edition-redirect=in requiring public companies to disclose climate change-related risks could be a game-changer, exposing them to increased public and investor scrutiny. 
Corporations are likely to push back on the proposal, which is expected during the first quarter, setting them up for a potentially bruising battle with SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Washington insiders said. 
In addition, banks are likely to face strict new climate change lending rules from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which this month said https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-banks-occ-climate-idCAKBN2IV27Q it wanted banks to integrate climate risk into every aspect of their businesses. 

""We expect a notable uptick in activity on climate risk analysis and integration into examination processes,"" wrote Raymond James.
""In all, we see a unified financial regulatory agenda emerging for 2022, with important consequences for banks and the broader financial sector.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong prosecutors on Tuesday filed a ""seditious publications"" charge against jailed media tycoon Jimmy Lai who already faces charges under a tough national security law that critics say has stifled freedoms in the Asian financial hub.
Lai, 74, the founder of the pro-democracy Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily newspaper, appeared in court alongside six other former Apple Daily staff. The daily tabloid closed in June after authorities raided the newspaper, arrested staff on national security grounds and froze assets.
Lai already faces two charges under a national security law that Beijing imposed on the former British colony last June, including collusion with a foreign country. 
The additional sedition charge accuses Lai of conspiracy to print, publish, sell, distribute ""seditious publications"" between April 2019 and June 24, 2021.
Prosecutors allege that the publications could ""bring into hatred or contempt or to excite disaffection"" against the Hong Kong and Chinese governments, according to the charge sheet seen by Reuters.
Lai is among the most prominent people to be charged under the national security law that was enacted in June 2020 to punish terrorism, collusion with foreign forces, subversion and secession with possible life imprisonment. 
Lai's repeated arrests and prosecutions have drawn criticism from Western governments and international rights groups, who say the law has been used to jail scores of pro-democracy campaigners, crush dissent and freedoms including of the press.
Hong Kong and Chinese authorities say the law has restored stability after protracted pro-democracy protests in 2019. 
Lai has been convicted in several unauthorised assembly cases. He has been detained for over a year and is now in the maximum security Stanley Prison in solitary confinement, according to two sources familiar with the matter. 
The same conspiracy to produce seditious publications charge was filed against the six former Apple Daily staffers, including chief editor Ryan Law; deputy chief editor Chan Pui-man; Cheung Kim-hung, the CEO of Next Digital, Apple's parent media company; columnist Yeung Ching-kee; English edition editor Fung Wai-kong; and senior editor Lam Man-chung. 

The six have also been accused of ""conspiracy to commit collusion with a foreign country or with external elements"". 
Magistrate Peter Law adjourned the case until Feb. 24. All of the defendants will continue to be remanded in custody until then.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Indirect talks between Iran and the United States on salvaging the 2015 Iran nuclear deal resumed on Monday with Tehran focused on one side of the original bargain, lifting sanctions against it, despite scant progress on reining in its atomic activities.
The seventh round of talks, the first under Iran's new hardline President Ebrahim Raisi, ended 10 days ago after adding some new Iranian demands to a working text. Western powers said progress was too slow and negotiators had ""weeks not months"" left before the 2015 deal becomes meaningless.
Little remains of that deal, which lifted sanctions against Tehran in exchange for restrictions on its atomic activities. Then-President Donald Trump pulled Washington out of it in 2018, re-imposing U.S. sanctions, and Iran later breached many of the deal's nuclear restrictions and kept pushing well beyond them. 
""If we work hard in the days and weeks ahead we should have a positive result.... It's going to be very difficult, it's going to be very hard. Difficult political decisions have to be taken both in Tehran and in Washington,"" the talks' coordinator, European Union envoy Enrique Mora, told a news conference.
He was speaking shortly after a meeting of the remaining parties to the deal - Iran, Russia, China, France, Britain, Germany and the European Union - formally kicked off the round on Monday evening.
""There is a sense of urgency in all delegations that this negotiation has to be finished in a relatively reasonable period of time. Again, I wouldn't put limits but we are talking about weeks, not about months,"" Mora said.
Iran refuses to meet directly with U.S. officials, meaning that other parties must shuttle between the two sides. The United States has repeatedly expressed frustration at this format, saying it slows down the process, and Western officials still suspect Iran is simply playing for time.
The 2015 deal extended the time Iran would need to obtain enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb, if it chose to, to at least a year from around two to three months. Most experts say that time is now less than before the deal, though Iran says it only wants to master nuclear technology for civil uses.
END OF THE ROAD
""The most important issue for us is to reach a point where, firstly, Iranian oil can be sold easily and without hindrance,"" Iranian media quoted Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian as saying. 
Mora, however, said both the lifting of sanctions and Iran's nuclear restrictions would be discussed.
Iran insists all U.S. sanctions must be lifted before steps are taken on the nuclear side, while Western negotiators say nuclear and sanctions steps must be balanced.
U.S. sanctions have slashed Iran's oil exports, its main revenue source. Tehran does not disclose data, but assessments based on shipping and other sources suggest a fall from about 2.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018 to as low as 200,000 bpd. One survey put exports at 600,000 bpd in June.
Mora said he decided to reconvene the talks during many officials' holidays between Christmas and the New Year so as not to lose time, but he added that talks would stop for three days as of Friday ""because the facilities will not be available"", referring to the luxury hotel hosting most meetings. 

When the seventh round wrapped up, incorporating some Iranian demands, negotiators from France, Britain and Germany said in a statement: ""This only takes us back nearer to where the talks stood in June"", when the previous round ended. 
""We are rapidly reaching the end of the road for this negotiation,"" they added.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Body-camera video released on Monday showed the chaotic, violent moments leading to the fatal Los Angeles police shooting of an assault suspect in a clothing store, and of a 14-year-old girl caught in the line of fire while hiding inside a dressing room.
The stray bullet that pierced the fitting-room wall, killing the girl, is believed to have come from the gun of the police officer seen firing three rifle shots at the suspect, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) said in posting the video.
The girl who died in the Dec. 23 shooting has not been publicly named by police. But local media have identified her as Valentina Orellana-Peralta, who they said was shopping with her mother for a dress for her upcoming quinceanera, a 15th birthday celebration in Hispanic traditions.
The girl was born and raised in Santiago, Chile, and came to the United States six months ago with her mother to visit an older sister, the Los Angeles Times reported. 
LAPD officers dispatched to the store were responding to several radio calls of an assault and possible shooting in progress, police said.
Video released on Monday by police showed the bearded, burly suspect, identified as Daniel Elena-Lopez, 24, entering the store with his bicycle and behaving erratically as he proceeds to menace and accost several shoppers.
At one point the man is seen in store-security video knocking a woman to the ground and dragging her across the floor away from her shopping cart as he repeatedly bludgeons her with a bicycle cable lock. The beating continues as several police officers are seen approaching the suspect with their guns drawn.
In a separate audio-video recording from bodycam footage of the policeman closest to the suspect, the officer can be heard shouting, ""She's bleeding, she's bleeding,"" just before he rounds a corner and confronts Elena-Lopez while the victim tries to crawl away.
The suspect, holding a large object in his hands, is seen standing with his back to the outside of the fitting room, a few yards (meters) from the bleeding victim as the officer raises his rifle and shoots the suspect dead.
The bludgeoned woman was subsequently hospitalized for injuries to her head and arms, police said. 
In a statement accompanying the videos, LAPD spokesman Captain Stacy Spell said the 14-year-old girl, who had been in the dressing area with her mother, was found in the fitting room as police searched the store for additional victims.
The officer who fired the shots has been placed on administrative while an investigation is under way, an LAPD spokesman said. No firearm was recovered from the suspect, police said.

LAPD Chief Michel Moore issued a statement promising a ""thorough, complete and transparent"" investigation of what he called a ""devastating"" tragedy. The California attorney general's office also was to open an independent investigation. 
According to the Los Angeles Times, the slain girl died in the arms of her mother, who had been working on documentation to stay in the United States with her daughter permanently.

Russian authorities have in recent months cracked down on groups affiliated with Navalny, 45, who is known as President Vladimir Putin's most vocal critic. He is serving two-and-a-half years in prison for parole violations related to a fraud case he says was politically motivated.
In June, a Russian court ruled that Navalny's anti-corruption foundation was 'extremist'.
Then, after his allies regrouped around a new network of organisations set up for Russia's parliamentary election in September, authorities started investigating campaign staffers on the same extremism charges.
On Tuesday, state investigators detained the former heads of provincial election headquarters in the Siberian cities of Tomsk and Irkutsk for questioning, Leonid Volkov, a Navalny ally living in exile, wrote on messaging app Telegram.
Volkov said he had tried to persuade both activists, Kseniya Fadeyeva and Zakhar Sarapulov, to leave Russia, as he and a number of other dissidents have done, but they refused.
The Investigative Committee, the state body tasked with investigating crimes and pressing charges, could not immediately be reached for comment on the case.

Navalny was flown to Germany last year for medical treatment after being poisoned in Siberia with what Western experts concluded was the military nerve agent Novichok.
The Russian government has denied it was behind the poisoning and rejected the experts' findings - which prompted a fresh wave of sanctions against Russia - and accused the West of a smear campaign against it.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -The Indian government on Monday ""refused"" to renew a permission that is vital for Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity (MoC) to be able to secure foreign funds, cutting off a key source the charity has depended on to run its programs for the impoverished. 
Nobel-laureate Mother Teresa, a Roman Catholic nun who died in 1997, founded the MoC in 1950. The charity has more than 3,000 nuns worldwide who run hospices, community kitchens, schools, leper colonies and homes for abandoned children.
The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi refused permission to the charity under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) on Saturday after it received some ""adverse inputs"", a government statement said. 
""While considering the MoC's renewal application, some adverse inputs were noticed,"" the home ministry said, without providing details. 
The ministry also rejected an earlier allegation of the West Bengal state chief minister Mamata Banerjee that the bank accounts of the charity were frozen. 
Later, the MoC in a statement confirmed their FCRA application was not renewed and that it has asked its centres not to operate any foreign contributions accounts until the matter is resolved.
The move comes as hardline Hindu outfits affiliated to Modi's party have accused the MoC of leading religious conversion programmes under the guise of charity by offering poor Hindus and tribal communities food, medicine, money, free education and shelter. MoC has rejected these allegations.
Earlier, chief minister Banerjee of West Bengal, where MoC has its headquarters, wrote in a tweet that she was shocked to hear that at Christmas, the Union Ministry had frozen all the bank accounts of the MoC in India. 
""Their 22,000 patients & employees have been left without food & medicines. While the law is paramount, humanitarian efforts must not be compromised,"" said Banerjee, an opposition leader and vocal critic of the Modi government.
The federal government said the accounts of MoC were frozen by the bank based on the request of the charity itself. 
Vicar General Dominic Gomes of the Archdiocese of Calcutta said the freeze of the accounts was ""a cruel Christmas gift to the poorest of the poor"". 
The row comes days after hardline Hindu vigilante groups disrupted Christmas church services in parts of India, including in some states ruled by Modi's party ahead of local elections in the coming months.
ATTACKS ON MINORITIES
Since Modi came to power in 2014, right-wing Hindu groups have consolidated their position across states and launched attacks on minorities, claiming they are trying to prevent religious conversions.
Christians and other critics note Christians represent only 2.3% of India's 1.37 billion people, while Hindus are the overwhelming majority. They repudiate the excuse given by some Hindu groups of preventing conversions as a reason for violence against Christians.
The Hindu newspaper on Monday reported disruption of Christmas celebrations at the weekend and last week, including the vandalising of a life-size statue of Jesus Christ at Ambala in Haryana, a northern state governed by Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). 
It said activists burnt a model of Santa Claus and chanted anti-Christmas slogans outside a church in Varanasi, Modi's parliamentary constituency and Hinduism's holiest city. 
Elias Vaz, national vice-president of the All India Catholic Union, condemned the latest incidents.
""The strength of India is in its diversity and the people who have done this at Christmas are the real anti-nationals,"" Vaz said.

Contacted by telephone, the federal and state governments declined to comment on the protests. 
Several Indian states have passed or are considering anti-conversion laws that challenge the constitutionally protected right to freedom of belief in the country.

DENVER (Reuters) - A Colorado prosecutor went to court on Monday in a rare bid to seek a reduced prison term for a truck driver sentenced to 110 years behind bars for vehicular homicide stemming from a fiery 2019 crash along a mountain highway that killed four motorists.
Jefferson County District Attorney Alexis King is asking a judge to re-sentence Rogel Lazaro Aguilera-Mederos to a prison term in the 20-to-30-year range, arguing for greater leniency in a highly publicized case that prosecutors said lacked criminal intent.
Aguilera-Mederos was found guilty by a jury in October on four homicide charges and multiple counts of assault and reckless driving in the April 2019 crash.
District Court Judge Bruce Jones said when handing down the 110-year sentence on Dec. 13 that he would not have imposed such a lengthy term but for mandatory minimum penalties required under state law.
At trial, prosecutors presented evidence that Aguilera-Mederos, who was hauling a load of lumber, was improperly trained in driving on mountain roads.
He knew the brakes on his tractor-trailer were failing but descended the mountains anyway, prosecutors said, bypassing a runaway truck ramp and crashing into stopped traffic along Interstate 70 west of Denver when he lost control of the vehicle.
Prosecutors never alleged that Aguilera-Mederos, 26, a Cuban immigrant with no criminal record, was impaired or had any criminal intent.
At sentencing, Aguilera-Mederos wept as he asked for forgiveness and leniency. ""I never thought about hurting anyone in my entire life,"" he said.
The case garnered national attention with nearly 5 million people signing an online petition calling for clemency.
At a hearing on Monday, Jones said it was virtually without precedent for prosecutors, rather than defense attorneys, to seek a reduced sentence in such a case. Jones ordered both sides to file briefs and set another hearing for Jan. 13.
Defense lawyer James Colgan called King's move “disingenuous.”
“Two weeks ago, they (prosecutors) were perfectly fine with my client getting 110 years until there was a public outcry,” he told Reuters after Monday’s hearing. “It’s all political.”
At a post-hearing news conference in which she declined to take questions, King said she consulted with victims’ families and survivors before urging a lighter sentence.
King said she acted “so the court could consider an alternative sentence that was not bound by mandatory sentencing structures.”

Colgan said he was unsure of the ramifications for future appeals if he were to agree with prosecutors' motion, so he took no position at Monday's hearing.
“This is unprecedented. It's just never happened before,” he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A current spokesman for former U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said in a court filing that he has cooperated extensively with the congressional committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
The spokesman, Taylor Budowich, said in a lawsuit, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, that he has produced more than 1,700 pages of documents and provided about four hours of sworn testimony to the House of Representatives panel.
Budowich, at a recent deposition, answered questions about the financing and planning of a speech by Trump to supporters near the White House on Jan. 6 that preceded the violence at the Capitol that day.
Budowich's lawsuit sought a court order blocking the House committee from gaining access to his financial records at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)
""The subpoena seeks personal financial material that is irrelevant to any conceivable legislation and not pertinent to any purported purpose of the Select Committee,"" Budowich said in the lawsuit.
A spokesman for the Jan. 6 Select Committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Budowich's lawsuit is the latest in a flood of litigation by targets of the committee seeking to prevent it from enforcing its subpoenas for information, but it is the first lawsuit to focus on a subpoena for financial records.
This week, former Trump adviser Michael Flynn and right-wing radio host Alex Jones filed separate lawsuits alleging the Select Committee was not lawfully constituted and its subpoenas for their testimony are therefore unlawful.

An appeals court has rejected that argument, ruling on Dec. 9 that the committee was valid and entitled to see White House records Trump has tried to shield from public view. Trump on Thursday appealed that decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.
The committee has issued more than 50 subpoenas and heard from more than 300 witnesses in its investigation of the attack.

WARSAW (Reuters) -Poland's president vetoed a media bill that critics said was aimed at silencing a Discovery-owned news channel that is critical of the government, citing worries about the strain the law would put on relations with Washington.
The move allows NATO-member Poland to sidestep a potentially explosive row with the United States at a time of heightened tension in eastern Europe amid what some countries see as increased Russian assertiveness.
However, the decision means that a project voted through parliament by the ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) has been blocked by a president elected as their ally.
President Andrzej Duda said in a televised statement on Monday that if the law came into force it could violate a treaty signed with the United States on economic and trade relations.
""One of the arguments considered during the analyses of this law was the issue of an international agreement that was concluded in 1990 ... this treaty speaks about the protection of investments,"" he said. 
""There is a clause which says that media-related investments may be excluded, but it concerns future investments.""
The United States had urged Duda to use his veto. The U.S. charge d'affaires in Warsaw, Bix Aliu, thanked him on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) "" ... for leadership and commitment to common democratic values and for protecting the investment climate in Poland"".
MEDIA FREEDOM
Unexpectedly rushed through parliament this month, the legislation would have tightened rules around foreign ownership of media, specifically affecting the ability of news channel TVN24, owned by U.S. media company Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc, to operate.
TVN24's parent, TVN, is owned by Discovery via a firm registered in the Netherlands in order to get around a ban on non-European firms owning more than 49% of Polish media companies. The law, which drew nationwide protests, would have prevented this workaround.
""This is a victory for the Polish people,"" Discovery said in a statement. ""We commend the president for doing the right thing and standing up for the democratic values of a free press and the rule of law.""
Duda told private broadcaster Polsat News mass street protests in December had not influenced his decision as he had already stated his position on the issue in August.
Duda said at the time he believed any take over of media owned by foreign companies should be carried out on market terms instead of introducing compulsory solutions.
Asked whether he was disappointed that PiS lawmakers had tried to proceed with the legislation despite his previous comments he said he was ""amazed"".
PiS spokeswoman Anita Czerwinska told state-run news agency PAP the party was ""disappointed"" by his decision.
Parliament could vote to overturn the president's veto, but PiS does not have the required qualified majority of votes.
PiS has long argued that foreign media groups have too much power in Poland, distorting public debate. 

However, critics say that moves against them seek to limit media freedom and are part of an increasingly authoritarian agenda that has put Warsaw at loggerheads with the European Union.
Duda said during his televised statement announcing his decision that he generally believed limiting foreign ownership of media was sensible, but that any regulation should concern future investments in the sector, not current owners.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) -Iraq's Supreme Court on Monday ratified the results of an October parliamentary election and rejected appeals lodged by Iran-backed Shi'ite factions, derailing their attempt to overturn a vote in which they performed poorly.
The ruling allows the newly elected parliament to convene at last, and sets the stage for intensified negotiations to replace outgoing Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi and his cabinet.
Shi'ite Muslim cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, a foe of both Iranian and U.S. influence in Iraq, emerged as the biggest winner, with 73 of parliament's 329 seats. The Tehran-aligned bloc, which includes powerful armed groups, saw their representation slump to just 17 seats from 48 in 2018.
Hadi al-Amiri, the leader of the Iran-backed Shi'ite political coalition Fatah, issued a statement pledging to abide by the court ruling. Asaib Ahl Al Haq, an armed group that is part of the Fatah coalition, expressed disappointment at the ruling, without saying if it would seek to challenge it.
Reuters reported last week that Iran has been intervening in Iraq https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-seeks-cool-tensions-iraq-2021-12-22 to quell destabilising internal unrest stirred up by Iranian-backed militias.
Reading Monday's ruling, Chief judge Jassim Mohammed said that objections to the result, regardless of their basis, were undermining the value of the vote, weakening voters' confidence, and derailing the political process. The ruling was final and binding on all authorities, he said.
Under Iraq’s constitution, President Barham Salih should now call the new parliament into session within 15 days.
Since the U.S.-led invasion that toppled minority Sunni dictator Saddam Hussein, Iraqi governments have been dominated by parties from the Shi'ite majority, in coalitions that have included Kurdish parties.
Sadr has said he will ally himself with whoever puts Iraq’s national interests first. That is an indication, Iraqi officials and Western diplomats say, that he may exclude some Iran-backed Shi'ite groups in favour of parties with cross-sectarian support.

The elections were held earlier than scheduled in response to huge street demonstrations two years ago against corruption and foreign influence, put down violently by security forces backed by pro-Iran armed groups.
Tehran is seeking to preserve its deep influence in its neighbour while also navigating tense negotiations over its nuclear ambitions with the United States.

CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South Africans remembered anti-apartheid hero Archbishop Desmond Tutu with cathedral bells, flowers and warm words on Monday, a day after he died in a Cape Town nursing home aged 90.
Tutu, a Nobel laureate who had preached against the tyranny of the white minority, was revered by Black and white South Africans alike as the nation's moral conscience. 
His passing prompted an outpouring of tributes https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/south-africas-archbishop-desmond-tutu-dies-aged-90-2021-12-26 worldwide, including from U.S. President Joe Biden and his predecessors Barack Obama and Jimmy Carter, Britain's Queen Elizabeth, Pope Francis and the foundation of Nelson Mandela, South Africa's first Black president and friend of Tutu.
""Fighting for freedom from the trenches of South Africa required a courage that cannot be described. Yet he stood resolute and fearless, leading demonstrations cloaked in his flowing clerical robe...,"" said Mandela's widow, Graca Machel.
The bells of St George's Cathedral tolled for 10 minutes at noon local time on Monday, a homage set to be repeated every day until Friday. Tutu led numerous campaigns and marches against apartheid from St George's steps. 
The Archbishop of Cape Town, Thabo Makgoba, asked all who heard the bells ""to pause their busy schedules for a moment in tribute"" to Tutu.
Mourners laid flowers outside what is known as the ""People's Cathedral"" and a powerful symbol of democracy. Black and white portraits of Tutu were attached to a fence and five condolence books were available for mourners who braved the wet weather.
""You fought the good fight, you inspired us to continue the fight for peace in the world,"" read one message signed by Noel and Alfreda.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said in a national address late on Sunday that flags would be flown at half-mast nationwide and at South African diplomatic missions abroad until Tutu's funeral, which is set for Saturday.
LOVE AND LAUGHTER
Ramaphosa and others called at the Tutu residence in Cape Town to offer their condolences to his widow Leah and other family members. 
""His heart was big enough to hold the whole world in love,"" Tutu's daughter Mpho Tutu van Furth said of her father in an interview for the Trouw newspaper in the Netherlands, where she lives and works as an Anglican priest.
""He was in the company of the most powerful people on earth and he sat with the smallest, the weakest, the poorest and the neediest. He did it with the same love and laugh,"" she said of Tutu, who was known for his infectious giggle.
Cape Town's city hall and the Table Mountain which rises above the city will be illuminated every night this week in purple, the colour of Tutu's clerical robes.
Tutu won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 in recognition of his non-violent opposition to white minority rule. A decade later, he witnessed the end of that regime and chaired a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to unearth the atrocities committed under it.
He later called the Black political elite to account with as much feistiness as he had the Afrikaners, but his enduring spirit of reconciliation always shone through and he never stopped fighting for a ""Rainbow Nation"".
A memorial service is planned for Tutu in Pretoria, South Africa's capital, on Wednesday. That same evening Cape Town will host a special tribute at its city hall attended by members of Tutu's family, his foundation and various faiths and tribes.
On Friday Tutu will lie in state at St George's ahead of Saturday's funeral service, which will be led by Makgoba. 
Tutu's ashes will be interred in an ossuary behind the pulpit, in accordance with his wishes, the Dean of St George's Cathedral, Michael Weeder, told a news conference alongside Makgoba on Monday. 

Makgoba said a list of possible attendees ran to as many as 500 names, but added that COVID-19 regulations limiting funerals to a maximum of 100 people must be respected. 
""Only a fraction of those who want to be there can be accommodated,"" he said, urging others to pay their respects at services in churches and cathedrals around the country.

LONDON (Reuters) -England will not get any new COVID-19 restrictions before the end of 2021, British health minister Sajid Javid said on Monday, as the government awaits more evidence on whether the health service can cope with high infection rates.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson continues to resist new measures, which would be unpopular within his own party, despite Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all bringing in new rules. 
Although partial figures reported by the government on Monday showed 98,515 new cases of COVID-19 in England, Javid said ministers would not be taking any new steps to limit the spread of the coronavirus in the coming days.
Once data for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is added to the English figures, it is likely to show cases for Britain as a whole only slightly below a Dec. 24 peak of 122,186.
""There will be no further measures before the new year,"" Javid told reporters, adding: ""When we get into the new year, of course we will see then whether we do need to take any further measures.""
He said that the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the virus now accounted for around 90% of cases across England and urged people to celebrate New Year cautiously.
The government's attention is focused on the number of patients being hospitalised with Omicron after early data last week suggested the variant carried a lower risk of admission.
The latest data showed the number of patients in hospital in England with COVID-19 was its highest since March, at 8,474, but a long way off peaks above 34,000 in January.
A combination of factors, including Britain's vaccination programme, the lag between infections and hospitalisations and the potentially less harmful effects of the Omicron variant have all been put forward by health experts as possible explanations for lower numbers.
Nevertheless, Britain has reported a total of 148,003 deaths within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test, and 12.2 million positive tests during the pandemic so far.
Johnson met with his top scientific and medical advisers on Monday to discuss the latest data. 
With Britain's state-funded healthcare system already stretched, any sign the number of admissions threatens to overwhelm hospitals could lead to the reintroduction of rules limiting people's freedom to socialise. 
""We will watch carefully what is happening in the hospitals,"" Javid said. ""Should, in the future, we need to act, of course we won't hesitate to do so.""
Hospitals in Britain have warned that staff absences due to COVID-19 could risk patient safety. Many industries and transport networks are also struggling with worker shortages.

However, Johnson is under pressure from his own Conservative Party after a string of political scandals that have undermined his authority. Many Conservative lawmakers are sceptical that the benefits of new restrictions outweigh their economic costs.
Data released on Monday showed that numbers of shoppers and diners in London's West End on Dec. 26 - historically one of the busiest shopping days of the year - were down week on week, and only just above half their pre-pandemic levels.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) -Somalia's president said on Monday he had suspended the prime minister for suspected corruption, a move the prime minister described as a coup attempt, escalating a power struggle between the two leaders.
The raging, months-long dispute is widely seen as distracting the government of the Horn of Africa country from fighting an Islamist insurgency.
It will also raise concerns about the prospect of renewed clashes between factions in the security forces allied to each side.
President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed accused Prime Minister Mohammed Hussein Roble of stealing land owned by the Somali National Army (SNA) and of interfering with a defence ministry investigation.
In response, Roble said the move was unconstitutional and aimed at derailing an ongoing election. He also ordered the security forces to start taking orders from him, instead of the president. 
The steps taken by Mohamed ""were an open coup attempt against the government and the national constitution"", Roble said in a statement posted on the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page of Somalia state news agency SONNA. 
""The aim of the illegal, crooked steps ... is to derail the election and illegally remain in office.""
Somalia begun holding parliamentary elections on Nov. 1 which were supposed to be completed by Dec. 24 but only a few of the 275 representatives have been elected 
In separate tweets, the U.S. and U.K embassies urged both sides to de-escalate and to refrain from violence.
Monday's developments were the latest round in a long-running dispute between the two leaders.
Mohamed also said he had also removed the commander of marine forces, General Abdihamid Mohamed Dirir, from office while a similar investigation was being carried out. 
Dirir was not immediately available for comment.
Assistant Information Minister Abdirahman Yusuf Omar Adala said earlier on Monday the deployment of security forces around Roble's office would not prevent Roble from carrying out his duties.
Mohamed and Roble on Sunday each accused the other of holding up the parliamentary elections in Somalia, a country riven by militant attacks and clan rivalries. 
In September, Mohamed suspended Roble's power to hire and fire officials in a dispute nominally over a murder investigation that generated months of tension.
Somalia, which has had only limited central government since the civil war began in 1991, is trying to reconstruct itself with the help of the United Nations.
It had intended to hold its first direct elections in more than three decades this year amid chronic instability.
Mohamed and Roble first clashed in April, when the president unilaterally extended his four-year term by two years, prompting army factions loyal to each man to briefly seize rival positions in the capital, Mogadishu.

The confrontation was resolved when the president put Roble in charge of security and organising delayed legislative and presidential elections and parliament reversed the presidential term extension.
According to Somalia's indirect electoral process, regional councils are meant to choose a senate. Clan elders are then meant to pick members of the lower house, which then picks a new president at a date not yet fixed.

Prime Minister Naftali Bennett met his national security adviser and other experts to discuss efforts to contain the outbreak and prevent it passing into humans. So far no human transmission has been reported, Bennett's office said.
Israeli media said children who had visited the reserve may have touched a stricken crane and thus contributed to the spread of the flu.
""This is the worst blow to wildlife in the country's history,"" Environment Minister Tamar Zandberg tweeted as rangers in hazardous material suits collected carcasses of the cranes from the lake at the Hula Nature Reserve and outlying marshes. 

Hundreds of thousands of chickens had been culled, she said.
Authorities were looking to ease import quotas and bring in eggs from abroad to head off an egg shortage due to the cull.

CHENNAI (Reuters) - A Foxconn iPhone factory in India at the centre of a mass food-poisoning incident will extend a week-long closure by an extra three days, a senior official for the state of Tamil Nadu told Reuters.
The factory, which employs some 17,000 people, had been due to resume some operations on Monday but is now expected to restart production with 1,000 workers on Thursday, the official said, adding that the state government had conducted inspections of workers' hostels.
Last week, protests erupted after more than 250 women who work at the plant and live in one of the hostels had to be treated for food poisoning. Some of the protestors were rounded up by the police but later released. 
The incident has thrown a spotlight on living conditions for the workers - most of them women - who reside in hostels near the factory which is located in the southern city of Chennai.
The Taiwanese contract manufacturer for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other big tech names as well as 11 of its contractors including those who provide food and living facilities were summoned for a meeting, said the official. The official was not authorised to speak on the matter and declined to be identified. 
The state government asked Foxconn to review services provided to the workers including power backup at the hostels, food and water, and the Directorate Of Industrial Safety And Health also recommended providing recreational facilities such as a TV, a library and indoor games, the official added.
According to a separate government source, Foxconn has told state bureaucrats it had ""ramped up production too quickly"" and would gradually ensure that workers' facilities were upgraded before they go back to full capacity.
Representatives for Foxconn and Apple were not immediately available for comment.
The gates of the factory, which is on the outskirts of the southern city of Chennai, were open on Monday morning and some vehicles were moving in and out but the area was mostly deserted.
The impact on Apple from the closure of the plant, which makes iPhone 12 models and has started trial production of the iPhone 13, is expected to be minimal, analysts have said. But the factory is strategic in the long term as Apple tries to cut its reliance on China's supply chain amid trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.
The disruption comes as Apple is dealing with pandemic-related supply chain bottlenecks that have hit production. In October, the company warned that the impact of these supply chain problems would worsen during the holiday quarter.

The unrest at Foxconn is the second such involving an Apple supplier factory in India in a year. In December 2020, thousands of contract workers at a factory owned by Wistron Corp destroyed equipment and vehicles over the alleged non-payment of wages, causing damages estimated at $60 million.
Cupertino, California-headquartered Apple has bet big on India since it began iPhone assembly in the country in 2017. Foxconn, Wistron and another supplier, Pegatron, have together committed roughly $900 million over five years to make iPhones in India.

Xian reported 150 new local symptomatic coronavirus cases for Sunday, a slight drop from the previous day's 155, and officials warned that people flouting rules on travel or testing could face detention and fines. 
Case numbers in Xian remain tiny compared with many clusters in other countries but officials have imposed tough curbs on travel within the city and on leaving it, in line with a government drive to immediately contain outbreaks.
Authorities have not announced any infections with the Omicron variant among the 635 confirmed cases in Xian from Dec. 9 to Sunday. China has detected only a handful of Omicron infections among international travellers and in its south. 
Nationwide, China reported 162 domestic symptomatic cases for Sunday, up from 158 a day earlier. It marks the highest count since the official daily bulletin started to classify asymptomatic carriers separately at the end of March last year.
Since last week, Xian residents have not been allowed to leave the city without permission from their employer or authorities. 
From Monday, no vehicles are allowed on the roads unless they are for virus control or for people's livelihoods and violators could face up to 10 days in police detention and 500 yuan ($78.48) fines. 
The city told residents on Monday not to leave home unless they are giving samples in a new round of citywide testing. People in less risky areas would be allowed out to buy necessities if the testing is negative, the city government said. 
Anyone who refuses to follow the rules during testing, including keeping a metre away from each other in queues, could also face detention and a fine, police said.
Xian has also launched a city-wide disinfection campaign, with workers spraying pathogen-killing solutions onto roads and buildings.
Dongyan Jin, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong, said the mass disinfection of outdoor air and surfaces seemed unnecessary given the low risk of people catching COVID-19 from outdoor surfaces or the air with so few people outside.

""This is shooting mosquitoes with cannon,"" said Jin, though he said he believed disinfection of indoor surfaces, especially in places visit by infected people, was necessary.
Infections have also been found in two other cities in Shaanxi province - the same province as Xian - and in the Guangxi region and the provinces of Zhejiang, Guangdong and Sichuan.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia reported its first confirmed death from the new Omicron variant of COVID-19 on Monday amid its biggest daily surge in infections, but the authorities refrained from imposing new restrictions saying hospitalisation rates remained low.
The death, a man in his 80s with underlying health conditions, marked a grim milestone for the country which has had to reverse some parts of a staged reopening after nearly two years of stop-start lockdowns, due to the fresh outbreak.
Omicron, which health experts say appears more contagious but less virulent than previous strains, began to spread in the country just as it lifted restrictions on most domestic borders and allowed Australians to return from overseas without quarantine, driving case numbers to the highest of the pandemic.
The authorities gave no additional details about the Omicron death, except to say that the man caught the virus at an aged care facility and died in a Sydney hospital.
""This was the first known death in New South Wales (state) linked to the Omicron variant of concern,"" said NSW Health epidemiologist Christine Selvey in a video released by the government.
The man was among seven COVID-19 deaths reported in Australia the previous day. The country clocked 10,186 new cases nationwide, according to a Reuters calculation of state data, its first total over 10,000 since the start of the pandemic. Most new cases were in NSW and Victoria.
""Although we are seeing increased case numbers... we are not seeing the impacts on our hospital system,"" said Annastacia Palaszczuk, premier of Queensland which reported 784 new cases with four people in hospital.
With reports of six-hour wait times for COVID testing for people hoping to meet requirements for interstate holiday travel, Palaszczuk defended the tourism-friendly state for mandatory testing, saying ""everyone knew when they booked a ticket that if they wanted to come here they would have to do a PCR test"".
However, she added that Queensland was considering whether to relax testing requirements for domestic visitors. Tasmania, another tourist-popular state, also said it was considering changes to state border testing rules.
Around the country, the surge in infections meanwhile weighed on testing resources. Sydney testing clinic SydPath had confirmed a day earlier that it wrongly told 400 COVID-positive people they were negative in the days before Christmas; on Monday it now realised it sent wrong result messages to another 995 people.

Australian authorities have so far resisted a return to lockdown in the face of surging case numbers but have reinstated some restrictions. On Monday, NSW again made it compulsory to check into public venues with QR codes, while many states have brought back mandatory mask-wearing in indoor public places.
The country has also narrowed the window for vaccine booster shots from six months to four months, soon to be three months.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said on Sunday he will soon visit Iran to finalize new agreements on cooperation with the Middle Eastern country, which has become Venezuela's top ally in boosting oil output amid U.S. sanctions.
Venezuela and Iran have strengthened their ties since last year. 
Maduro's government has received vital equipment for its oil industry from Iran, which in return has received crude and other primary resources from the South American country. Iran has been crucial for Venezuela's rising oil production in 2021. 
""I am going to Teheran very soon, for a visit that President (Ebrahim) Raisi offered me, so that we meet in person, to hold conversations and sign new agreements ... and speed up processes of cooperation,"" Maduro said during an interview with satellite news broadcaster Al Mayadeen in Spanish, which was later broadcast on Venezuelan state television. 
Maduro said he has had two telephone conversations with Iran's president, adding that they have agreed to work on new plans, without providing details. He also did not give a date for the visit but described the two countries as ""fighters.""

In 2022, Venezuela will also look to reactivate means of cooperation with Arab countries, Maduro added, saying that ""they love us in the Arab world, I know that Arab governments and peoples love Venezuela.""
The tightening of U.S. sanctions since 2019 has affected Venezuela's ability to sell crude and import fuel, which has exacerbated gasoline shortages across the country.

ITABUNA, Brazil (Reuters) -Two dams gave way in the northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia after weeks of heavy rains, swamping already swollen local rivers as flooding hit towns across the region, authorities said on Sunday.
The Igua dam, on the Verruga river near the city of Vitoria da Conquista in southern Bahia, collapsed on Saturday night, forcing authorities to evacuate residents, mainly in the town of Itambe.
A second dam gave way to rising water levels in Jussiape, 100 kilometers to the north, on Sunday morning, bringing more alerts for residents to move to safer ground.
There were no reports of deaths or injuries caused by the dam failures, though bridges and roads were damaged.
Further towards the coast in Itabuna, a city of 200,000 inhabitants, fire brigade teams rescued residents trapped in their homes in the downtown area that was under water, Reuters reporters said.
""It's crazy by the bridge, there are waves almost 2 meters high,"" shopkeeper Luiz Constancia told Reuters.
Rescuers rowed dinghies along flooded streets to reach trapped families or take them supplies. One man paddled on an inflatable mattress to reach a home.
Residents said the level of the Cachoeira river that runs through the town located 30 kms from the coastal port city of Ilheus was the highest in 50 years.
In Vitoria da Conquista, Mayor Sheila Lemos, said all residents close to the collapsed Igua dam had been evacuated. 
In a posting on the city's website, Lemos said the flooding threatened to cut off the BR-116 highway, a major truck route between northeastern and southern Brazil.
Bahia Governor Rui Castro said at least 400,000 people have been impacted by the heavy rains and thousands evacuated from some 67 towns facing emergency situations due to floods caused by heavy rainfall for almost two months.
""Thousands of people have had to leave their homes because the water rose one or two meters, even three meters in some places,"" he told reporters on Saturday.

The rains have caused 18 deaths in Bahia since the beginning of November, including a 60-year-old ferry owner who drowned on the swollen Rio das Contas river, civil defense officials said.
In the state capital of Salvador, weather officials said December rainfall has been six times greater than the average.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) -Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and veteran of South Africa's struggle against apartheid who was revered as his nation's conscience by both Black and white, died on Sunday aged 90.
Tutu won the Nobel prize in 1984 Key dates in the life of South African cleric and activist Desmond Tutu in recognition of his non-violent opposition to white minority rule. A decade later, he witnessed the end of that regime and chaired a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, set up to unearth atrocities committed under it.
Ever outspoken, he preached against the tyranny of the white minority.
After apartheid ended, he called the Black political elite to account with as much feistiness as he had the Afrikaners, but his enduring spirit of reconciliation in a divided nation always shone through, and tributes https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/reaction-death-south-africas-desmond-tutu-2021-12-26 to him poured in from around the world on Sunday.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa described Tutu in a televised address as ""one of our nation's finest patriots"" adding, ""our nation's loss is indeed a global bereavement.""
U.S. President Joe Biden said Tutu followed his spiritual calling to create a better, freer, and more equal world. ""His legacy transcends borders and will echo throughout the ages.""
""Archbishop Desmond Tutu was a mentor, a friend and a moral compass for me and so many others,"" former President Barack Obama said. ""He never lost his impish sense of humour and willingness to find humanity in his adversaries.""
Bill Clinton called Tutu's life ""a gift.""
TWO NOBELS ON ONE STREET
Born near Johannesburg, Tutu spent most of his later life in Cape Town and led numerous marches and campaigns to end apartheid from St George's Cathedral's front steps. 
Tutu died ""peacefully"" on Sunday morning in a Cape Town nursing home, a representative of his Archbishop Desmond Tutu IP Trust said. He will lie in state at St George's on Friday before his funeral service there on Saturday, it said.
Looking frail and in a wheelchair, he was last seen in public in October at St George's Cathedral in Cape Town - a one-time safe haven for anti-apartheid activists - for a service marking his 90th birthday.
He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in the late 1990s and was later hospitalised several times to treat infections associated with treatment for it.
In his final years he also regretted that his dream of a ""Rainbow Nation"" https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/south-africas-tutu-anti-apartheid-hero-who-never-stopped-fighting-rainbow-nation-2021-12-26 had yet to come true, and often fell out with erstwhile allies at the ruling African National Congress party over their failures to address the poverty and inequalities that they promised to eradicate.
Just five feet five inches (1.68 metres) tall and with an infectious giggle, Tutu travelled tirelessly through the 1980s to become the face of the anti-apartheid movement abroad while many of the leaders of the then rebel ANC, including future President Nelson Mandela, were behind bars.
Long-time friends, Tutu and Mandela lived for a time on the same street in the South African township of Soweto, making Vilakazi Street the only one in the world to have been home to two Nobel Peace Prize winners. 
""His most characteristic quality is his readiness to take unpopular positions without fear,"" Mandela once said of Tutu. ""Such independence of mind is vital to a thriving democracy.""
'A PROPHET AND A PRIEST'
Having officially retired from public life on his 79th birthday Tutu - who once said of himself: ""I wish I could shut up, but I can't, and I won't"" - continued to speak out on a range of moral issues.
John Steenhuisen, leader of opposition party The Democratic Alliance, said Tutu's spirit would live on ""in our continued effort to build a united, successful, non-racial South Africa for all.""
In 2008, Tutu accused the West of complicity in Palestinian suffering by remaining silent.
In 2013, he declared his support for gay rights, saying he would never ""worship a God who is homophobic.""
Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby on Sunday hailed Tutu as ""a prophet and priest"" while Pope Francis offered heartfelt condolences to his family and loved ones.

In a letter to Tutu's daughter Reverend Mpho Tutu, Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, said the world had ""lost a great man, who lived a truly meaningful life."" 
""We are better because he was here,"" said Martin Luther King's daughter Bernice.

Parliamentary elections began on Nov. 1 and were supposed to be completed by Dec. 24, but one newly elected lawmaker said that as of Saturday only 24 of 275 representatives had been elected.
""The Prime Minister is posing a serious threat to the electoral process and overstepping his mandate,"" the office of President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed said in a statement on Sunday.
Prime Minister Mohamed Hussein Roble's office later put out its own statement saying the president had spent ""so much time, energy and finances in frustrating the national elections"" and was ""derailing the electoral process.""
The United States late on Sunday called for a credible and rapid conclusion to the elections.
""The United States is deeply concerned by the continuing delays and by the procedural irregularities that have undermined the credibility of the process"", the U.S. State Department said.
Newly elected parliamentarian Mohamed Sheikh Mursal said only 24 lawmakers had been confirmed as elected as of Saturday, one day after the process had been due to be completed.
Under Somalia's complex indirect electoral process, regional councils are meant to choose a senate. Clan elders are then meant to pick members of the lower house, which then picks a new president at a date not yet fixed.
In April, factions of the security forces allied to Mohamed and Roble seized areas of the capital, as the prime minister and opposition both opposed a move to extend the president's four-year term by another two years.
Clashes between the two groups forced https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/bowing-pressure-somalias-president-agrees-not-extend-presidential-term-2021-04-27 between 60,000 and 100,000 people to flee their homes.
The confrontation was resolved when the president put Roble in charge of security and of organising the delayed elections.
Roble's Sunday statement said he would hold meetings on Monday to find ways to speed up the election.

President Mohamed's office also said he would hold a separate meeting on the elections and ""agreeing on a capable leadership to spearhead timely, and transparent elections"" without offering more details on how long the process might take.
Somalia, which has had only limited central government since 1991, is trying to reconstruct itself with the help of the United Nations. It had intended to hold its first direct elections in more than three decades this year in a rare victory against chronic instability in the country.

Libya is a major transit point for migrants, many from African countries, who are seeking better opportunities in Europe.
Mohamed Abushaala, the head of the Red Crescent in Khums, a port in western Libya, said 15 bodies including that of an infant had been recovered from the shore at nearby Alous on Saturday. He said three survivors had said there were 35 people in total on their boat, which had sunk. 
He said a separate figure released on social media of 17 bodies, along with another 10 found on a different beach, was incorrect. 
""They were at sea for approximately one day,"" said Osama al-Saket, head of the Khums hospital that received the bodies following calls from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and police authorities.
""The bodies were still intact ... there were 14 of them, along with one small baby,"" added al-Saket.
The Interior Ministry later said 14 bodies had been recovered from a group of 60 people believed missing at sea. 
It was not clear from the statements if they were all referring to the same group and interior ministry officials were not immediately available for comment. 
Larger numbers of people have been trying to cross the Mediterranean this year after several years of reduced numbers since 2015. About 1,500 have drowned in 2021, the United Nations migration agency IOM said last week. 
The agency's Missing Migrants Project has designated the Central Mediterranean route as the deadliest known migration route in the world, with more than 17,000 recorded deaths and disappearances since 2014.

""The man was taken into custody and has undergone a mental health assessment - he has since been sectioned under the Mental Health Act and remains in the care of medical professionals,"" the police said. ""Following a search of the man, a crossbow was recovered.""

Iraq is no longer at war since the defeat of Islamic State in 2017. But a lack of opportunities and basic services, as well as a political system most Iraqis say is corrupt and nepotistic, mean many people see little chance of a decent life at home.

564,"<span>Dec 26, 2021 11:50AM ET</span>",,,,,,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's government set a goal on Sunday of doubling the number of Jewish settlers in the Golan Heights within five years, a move that could tighten its hold on the territory it occupied in fighting with Syria in 1967.
Prime Minister Naftali Bennett cited then-U.S. President Donald Trump's recognition in 2019 of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan and no sign that his successor, Joe Biden, intends to reverse the decision, as factors behind a multimillion-dollar housing and infrastructure plan for the area.
Under a blueprint approved by the cabinet, which held its weekly session on the Golan, some 7,300 housing units will be built in Katzrin, Israel's main settlement in the area, and in smaller Jewish communities.
""The aim of the decision is to double the number of (Israeli) residents in the Golan in the coming years, meaning an addition of 23,000 people in the area,"" a statement issued by Bennett's office said.
It said two new Golan settlements are also planned, and that 4,000 homes would be built there. Some 20,000 Druze, most of whom still identify as Syrian, also live in the Golan. 
Israel annexed the 1,200-square-kilometre (460-square-mile) Golan Heights in 1981, a move that was not recognised by the international community. Syria demands the return of the strategic plateau, which also overlooks Lebanon and borders Jordan.
""It goes without saying that the Golan Heights are Israeli,"" Bennett told his cabinet in broadcast remarks.
""The fact that the Trump administration recognised that, and the fact that the Biden administration made clear there is no change in that policy, is also important."" he said.
In February, shortly after Biden was sworn in as president, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on CNN that control over the Golan remains of ""real importance to Israel's security"". Blinken noted the presence in Syria of militia groups backed by Iran, a main ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
""Legal questions are something else and over time, if the situation were to change in Syria, that's something we look at, but we are nowhere near that,"" Blinken said.

Israeli settlement in the Golan has been on a much smaller scale than in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, areas also captured in a 1967 war and sought by the Palestinians for a future state.
Unlike the West Bank, where many settlers claim a biblical link to the land and thousands commute to jobs in nearby Israeli cities, the more remote Golan offers limited employment opportunities.

ZURICH (Reuters) - People in Switzerland will be able to legally change gender by a visit to the civil registry office from Jan. 1, putting the country at the forefront of Europe's gender self-identification movement.
Switzerland joins Ireland, Belgium, Portugal and Norway as one of the few countries on the continent that allow a person to legally change gender without hormone therapy, medical diagnosis or further evaluation or bureaucratic steps.
Under the new rules written into Switzerland's civil code, anyone aged 16 and above who is not under legal guardianship will be able to adjust their gender and legal name by self-declaration at the civil registry office. Younger people and those under adult protection will require guardian consent.
This marks a change from the current set of regionally prescribed standards in Switzerland, which often require a certificate from a medical professional confirming an individual's transgender identity.
Some cantons - semi-autonomous regions in federal Switzerland - also require a person to undergo hormone treatment or anatomical transition in order to legally change gender, while, for a name change, proof could be required that the new name has already been unofficially in use for several years.
Switzerland, long known as socially conservative in the main, voted in September to legalise civil marriage https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/swiss-vote-allowing-same-sex-marriage-referendum-2021-09-26 and the right to adopt children for same-sex couples, one of the last countries in Western Europe to do so.
With the new gender change rules, Switzerland joins just two dozen countries worldwide aiming to decouple gender choice from medical procedures.

While some other European nations including Denmark, Greece and France have removed the requirement of medical procedures, including sex reassignment surgery, sterilisation or psychiatric evaluation, their rules require further steps or conditions.
Spain in June approved a draft bill https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/spains-government-approves-first-draft-gender-self-identification-bill-2021-06-29 allowing anyone over the age of 14 to change gender legally without a medical diagnosis or hormone therapy.

The carrier is a Gaza resident who was infected within the coastal territory, ministry official Majdi Dhair told a news conference.
Dhair said this meant the variant, first identified in southern Africa and Hong Kong last month, existed in Gaza and was now spreading among the population. The discovery poses a new challenge to the enclave's under-developed health system.
""We are ahead of difficult days. It is expected that the Omicron variant will spread fast,"" he told reporters.
Gaza, with a population of 2.2 million people, has registered 189,837 COVID-19 infections and 1,691 deaths.

Dhair urged Gazans to get vaccinated, putting the percentage of those who had already received shots at around 40 percent.
In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, three cases of Omicron variant had been detected among Palestinians on Dec. 16 and the number had since risen to 23 among the 3.1 million population, Palestinian health authorities said.

Chen, in his post since 2016, will move to another role and Ma Xingrui, governor of the coastal economic powerhouse Guangdong province since 2017, has replaced him, the official Xinhua News Agency said on Saturday. It gave no other details.
United Nations researchers and human rights activists estimate more than one million Muslims have been detained in camps in western China's Xinjiang region. China rejects accusations of abuse, describing the camps as vocational centres designed to combat extremism, and in late 2019 said all people in the camps had ""graduated"".
Chen, 66, is a member of China's politburo and is widely considered to be the senior official responsible for the security crackdown in Xinjiang. He was sanctioned last year by the United States.

The Khartoum security committee's statement added that 114 people had been arrested and faced prosecution after Saturday's protests, the latest in a series of rallies against an Oct. 25 coup that upended a transition towards democratic elections.
Medics aligned with the protest movement said earlier that violence by security forces had caused 178 injuries among demonstrators, including eight with live bullet wounds. 
At least 48 people have been killed in crackdowns on protests against the coup, the medics say.

570,"<span>Dec 26, 2021 06:16AM ET</span>",,,,,,", (Reuters) -""Like falling in love"" is how Archbishop Desmond Tutu described voting in South Africa's first democratic election in 1994, a remark that captured both his puckish humour and his profound emotions after decades fighting apartheid.
Desmond Mpilo Tutu, the Nobel Peace laureate whose moral might permeated South African society during apartheid's darkest hours and into the unchartered territory of new democracy, died on Sunday. He was 90.
The outspoken Tutu was considered the nation's conscience by both Black and white, an enduring testament to his faith and spirit of reconciliation in a divided nation.
    He preached against the tyranny of white minority and even after its end, he never wavered in his fight for a fairer South Africa, calling the black political elite to account with as much feistiness as he had the white Afrikaners.
In his final years, he regretted that his dream of a ""Rainbow Nation"" had not yet come true.
On the global stage, the human rights activist spoke out across a range of topics, from Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories to gay rights, climate change and assisted death - issues that cemented Tutu's broad appeal.
Tutu ""was a prophet and priest, a man of words and action"", said the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the symbolic head of Tutu's Anglican Communion. British billionaire Richard Branson called him ""a brave leader, a mischievous delight, a profound thinker, and a dear friend.""
Just five feet five inches (1.7 metres) tall and with an infectious giggle, Tutu was a moral giant who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his non-violent struggle against apartheid.
He used his high-profile role in the Anglican Church to highlight the plight of black South Africans. 
Asked on his retirement as Archbishop of Cape Town in 1996 if he had any regrets, Tutu said: ""The struggle tended to make one abrasive and more than a touch self-righteous. I hope that people will forgive me any hurts I may have caused them."" 
Talking and travelling tirelessly throughout the 1980s, Tutu became the face of the anti-apartheid movement abroad while many of the leaders of the rebel African National Congress (ANC), such as Nelson Mandela, were behind bars.
""Our land is burning and bleeding and so I call on the international community to apply punitive sanctions against this government,"" he said in 1986.
Even as governments ignored the call, he helped rouse grassroots campaigns around the world that fought for an end to apartheid through economic and cultural boycotts.
Former hardline white president P.W. Botha asked Tutu in a letter in March 1988 whether he was working for the kingdom of God or for the kingdom promised by the then-outlawed and now ruling ANC.
GRAVESIDE ORATIONS
Among his most painful tasks was delivering graveside orations for Black people who had died violently during the struggle against white domination.
""We are tired of coming to funerals, of making speeches week after week. It is time to stop the waste of human lives,"" he once said.
Tutu said his stance on apartheid was moral rather than political.
""It's easier to be a Christian in South Africa than anywhere else, because the moral issues are so clear in this country,"" he once told Reuters.
In February 1990, Tutu led Nelson Mandela on to a balcony at Cape Town's City Hall overlooking a square where the ANC talisman made his first public address after 27 years in prison.
He was at Mandela's side four years later when he was sworn in as the country's first black president.
""Sometimes strident, often tender, never afraid and seldom without humour, Desmond Tutu's voice will always be the voice of the voiceless,"" is how Mandela, who died in December 2013, described his friend.
While Mandela introduced South Africa to democracy, Tutu headed the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that laid bare the terrible truths of the war against white rule.
Some of the heartrending testimony moved him publicly to tears.
PULLED NO PUNCHES 
But Tutu was as tough on the new democracy as he was on South Africa's apartheid rulers.
He castigated the new ruling elite for boarding the ""gravy train"" of privilege and chided Mandela for his long public affair with Graca Machel, whom he eventually married.
In his Truth Commission report, Tutu refused to treat the excesses of the ANC in the fight against white rule any more gently than those of the apartheid government.
Even in his twilight years, he never stopped speaking his mind, condemning President Jacob Zuma over allegations of corruption surrounding a $23 million security upgrade to his home.
In 2014, he admitted he did not vote for the ANC, citing moral grounds.
""As an old man, I am sad because I had hoped that my last days would be days of rejoicing, days of praising and commending the younger people doing the things that we hoped so very much would be the case,"" Tutu told Reuters in June 2014.
In December 2003, he rebuked his government for its support for Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, despite growing criticism over his human rights record.
Tutu drew a parallel between Zimbabwe's isolation and South Africa's battle against apartheid.
""We appealed for the world to intervene and interfere in South Africa's internal affairs. We could not have defeated apartheid on our own,"" Tutu said. ""What is sauce for the goose must be sauce for the gander too.""
He also criticised South African President Thabo Mbeki for his public questioning of the link between HIV and AIDS, saying Mbeki's international profile had been tarnished.
SCHOOL TEACHER'S SON
A schoolteacher's son, Tutu was born in Klerksdorp, a conservative town west of Johannesburg, on Oct. 7, 1931.
The family moved to Sophiatown in Johannesburg, one of the commercial capital's few mixed-race areas, subsequently demolished under apartheid laws to make way for the white suburb of Triomf - Triumph in Afrikaans.
Always a passionate student, Tutu first worked as a teacher. But he said he had become infuriated with the system of educating Blacks, once described by a South African prime minister as aimed at preparing them for their role in society as servants.
Tutu quit teaching in 1957 and decided to join the church, studying first at St. Peter's Theological College in Johannesburg. He was ordained a priest in 1961 and continued his education at King's College in London.
After four years abroad, he returned to South Africa, where his sharp intellect and charismatic preaching saw him rise through lecturing posts to become Anglican Dean of Johannesburg in 1975, which was when his activism started taking shape.
""I realised that I had been given a platform that was not readily available to many Blacks, and most of our leaders were either now in chains or in exile. And I said: 'Well, I'm going to use this to seek to try to articulate our aspirations and the anguishes of our people',"" he told a reporter in 2004.
By now too prominent and globally respected to be thrust aside by the apartheid government, Tutu used his appointment as Secretary-General of the South African Council of Churches in 1978 to call for sanctions against his country. 
He was named the first Black Archbishop of Cape Town in 1986, becoming the head of the Anglican Church, South Africa's fourth largest. He would retain that position until 1996.

In retirement he battled prostate cancer and largely withdrew from public life. In one of his last public appearances, he hosted Britain’s Prince Harry, his wife Meghan and their four-month-old son Archie at his charitable foundation in Cape Town in September 2019, calling them a ""genuinely caring"" couple. 
Tutu married Nomalizo Leah Shenxane in 1955. They had four children and several grandchildren, and homes in Cape Town and Soweto township near Johannesburg.

, (Reuters) - My earliest memories of Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu are from newspaper clippings and video recordings of foreign news bulletins smuggled into South Africa by dissenters to evade censorship.
As an activist allied to the African National Congress, the archbishop was banned from the heavily policed media of the white minority government.
In the smuggled tapes, I would see the archbishop looking regal in his mauve robes praying at the funerals of activists and protesters killed by apartheid police, or pleading with people to end the violence. 
As a young woman during this tumultuous time in my country, I saw him as a man of God fighting for our freedom, a man pleading with the world to end apartheid, an elder we hoped could one day help restore peace – even if we weren't always that confident it would ever happen.
Of course, I had no idea then that I would one day be making newspaper clippings of my own about ""the Arch"", as he is affectionately known here. As a photojournalist, I got to meet him regularly in the democracy he helped bring about.
Before all that, one memory stands out from 1985. I was nine years old, taking part in an anti-apartheid protest in our neighbourhood on the Cape Flats, an area designated as ""non-white"" under the segregationist Group Areas Act. 
As a family of mostly Indian descent, our movements were restricted under the act and our schools were closed by the government under a state of emergency. The police fired tear gas at us – yes, at a bunch of primary school kids and their teachers! – and my eyes stung with the pain. 
But the main protest was up the road at Alexander Sinton High School. My father was a teacher there; my sister a pupil. They staged a sit-in protest demanding schools be opened, and police fired tear gas and dragged students out of their classrooms. My dad and sister were arrested and released hours later.
The next day, Tutu visited the school to comfort the students. A black-and-white photo shows him in his tunic and glasses, a halo of white hair encircling his brow and both of his hands affectionately holding the cheeks of a student.
'THE HUMAN FAMILY' 
On Feb. 11, 1990, I sat on the Grand Parade opposite the City Hall in Cape Town with my family waiting for the arrival of Nelson Mandela, who was to be released from prison after 27 years. The sun had already begun to set when Mandela emerged on the balcony with Archbishop Tutu by his side. 
We were overjoyed. We knew the democracy my family had fought for was coming, but the joy was tainted with a sense of loss, of the sacrifices we had made and abuses we had suffered.
Nearly 20 years later, I had my first opportunity to photograph the archbishop at this house. Back then I was too painfully shy to interact with him much, but over the next decade I had the privilege of photographing him many times for Reuters and for his foundation, so I got to know him better. 
His courage in defending social justice, even at great cost to himself, always shone through - and not just during apartheid. He often fell out with his erstwhile allies at the ruling ANC over their failures to address the poverty and inequalities that they promised to eradicate. 
At St George's Cathedral in Cape Town on April 23, 2014, I photographed Tutu who was still angry and hurt four months after the ANC had tried to bar him from Mandela's funeral. The party had relented only after a public outcry. 
""I will not vote for them,"" he said of the ANC. 
""I say it with a very sore heart. We dreamt about a society that really made people feel they mattered. You can't do that in a society where you have people who go to bed hungry, where many of our children still attend classes under trees.""
I was always taken by the way Tutu greeted people equally whether they were heads of state or homeless on the street. He regularly visited a home for the elderly, taking cake and treats for the residents. I looked on as he shook hands with around 40 of them.
When I had to cancel an appointment with him because my son was ill with an appendicitis back in 2016, Tutu had a gift box sent to the hospital.
His wife Leah told me a story over tea about how, when he was young, he gave up his jersey to another child accompanying a blind man, shivering in the cold, knowing he risked a scolding for returning home without it. 
That was the Tutu we all knew and loved.
To me, all of these things show the Arch was sincere when he spoke of ""Ubuntu"", a Zulu word representing a belief that all human beings are connected by a universal bond that demands sharing and compassion.

""We have been intended to exist as members of one family, the human family,"" he once said, adding that when we fail to act accordingly, ""we do so at great risk to ourselves"". 
Archbishop Tutu took many risks during his life, but that was not one of them.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Protesters opposed to military rule reached near the presidential palace in the Sudanese capital on Saturday for the second time in a week, television images showed, despite heavy tear gas and a communications blackout.
A Reuters witness said security forces fired tear gas to disperse the crowds on a tenth day of major demonstrations since an Oct. 25 coup.
The Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors said 178 people were injured during Saturday's protest, with eight caused by live bullets. 
In separate statements, the committee said security forces entered Khartoum Hospital and Port Sudan Hospital. 
Protests against the coup have continued even after Abdallah Hamdok was reinstated as prime minister last month. The demonstrators have demanded that the military play no role in government during a transition to free elections.
A week ago, demonstrators begin a sit-in at the gates of the palace before being dispersed. But on Saturday they were met with by security forces and turned back.
Internet services were disrupted in the capital, and residents were unable to make or receive phone calls, the witnesses said, while soldiers and Rapid Support Forces blocked roads leading to bridges linking Khartoum with Omdurman, its sister city across the Nile.
Service began to return for at least some users late on Saturday.
Some people managed to post images on social media showing protests in several other cities, including Madani and Atbara.
In Omdurman, security forces fired tear gas at protesters near a bridge connecting the city to central Khartoum, another Reuters witness said.
'CHAOS AND ABUSES' 
""Departing from peacefulness, approaching and infringing on sovereign and strategic sites in central Khartoum is a violation of the laws,"" SUNA state news agency reported, citing a provincial security coordination committee.
""Chaos and abuses will be dealt with,"" it added.
Protesters in Khartoum chanted: ""Close the street! Close the bridge! Burhan we will come straight to you,"" referring to military leader and sovereign council head Abdel Fattah al-Burhan.
U.N. Special Representative to Sudan Volker Perthes urged Sudanese authorities not to stand in the way of Saturday's demonstrations. 
""Freedom of expression is a human right. This includes full access to the internet. According to international conventions, no one should be arrested for intent to protest peacefully,"" Perthes said. 
The military could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Sources told Reuters they heard gunshots in the vicinity of the offices of UNAMID peacekeepers in Darfur on Saturday morning. 

Last Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people marched to the presidential palace and security forces fired tear gas and stun grenades to disperse protesters.
Forty-eight people have been killed in crack-downs on protests against the coup, the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors said.

Authorities scrambled a search and rescue operation overnight northwest of Paros. Air and sea assets were deployed to the area, the coastguard said.
Greece is one of the main routes into the European Union for migrants and refugees from Africa, the Middle East and beyond, though the flow has tapered off since 2015-2016, when more than a million people traversed the country to other EU states.
The country's semi-official Athens News Agency said the bodies of 12 men, three women and an infant were recovered from the area. 
Eighty people were believed to have been on the vessel, which according to the coastguard was believed to have been headed for Italy from Turkey.
The circumstances under which the vessel capsized were unclear.
Giannis Plakiotakis, Greece's shipping minister, said trafficking gangs were responsible for the disasters. 
The gangs ""are indifferent to human life, stacking dozens of people, without lifejackets, in vessels which do not conform to the most basic of safety standards,"" he said in a written statement.
Earlier Friday, Greek authorities said they had recovered 11 bodies from the scene of another shipwreck, when a sailboat carrying migrants sank off an uninhabited islet in southern Greece on Thursday.
Another 90 people were rescued in that operation. The coastguard said initial information suggested those migrants had also been heading for Italy.
Overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday a boat thought to have been carrying up to 50 migrants sank off the island of Folegandros, with dozens feared missing.

The attack marks the latest violence in a region where Congolese and Ugandan forces have launched a campaign against suspected Islamists.
""The suicide bomber, prevented by security guards from entering a crowded bar, activated the bomb at the entrance of the bar,"" the regional governor's spokesman, Général Ekenge Sylvain, said in a statement.
Six people died in the blast and 14 were injured, including two local officials, he added.
Sylvain said that insurgents from the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a group aligned with Islamic State, had activated a ""sleeper cell"" in Beni to target citizens, but he did not provide evidence connecting them to the explosion.
The ADF did not immediately claim responsibility for the attack. 
Congo and neighbouring Uganda launched a military campaign in the area at the end of November against the ADF. Officials have previously blamed the group for bombings in the region.
Beni's mayor, Narcisse Muteba Kashale, earlier told local radio that a bomb had exploded in the city centre. ""For safety, I'm asking the population to stay home,"" the mayor said.
A Reuters journalist nearby said he heard an explosion around 7 p.m., just after the afternoon Catholic mass, near the city's main road, followed by gunshots.
Police spokesman Nasson Murara said that officers fired live rounds to disperse an angry crowd that attempted to bar investigators from accessing the scene of the explosion. No one was injured, he said.
Images shared on social media showed dozens of green chairs scattered across a road, some melted or smouldering. At least four bodies, including that of a small girl, could be seen among the wreckage. 
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the images. 

The joint Congolese and Ugandan campaign, launched on Nov. 30, had planned to target four ADF camps, including two in the Beni area, a Ugandan general said earlier this month.
Beni was rocked by two explosions in June at a Catholic church and at a busy intersection. No one was killed in either blast except the suspected bomber, who was killed by the second explosion.

MADRID (Reuters) - Scientists declared the eruption on Spain's La Palma officially over on Saturday, allowing islanders to breathe a sigh of relief nearly 100 days after the Cumbre Vieja volcano began to spew out lava, rock and ash and upended the lives of thousands. 
After bursting into action on Sept. 19, the volcano suddenly went quiet on Monday Dec. 13 but the authorities, wary of raising false hope, held off until Christmas Day to give the all-clear.
""What I want to say today can be said with just four words: The eruption is over,"" Canary Islands regional security chief Julio Perez told a news conference on Saturday.
During the eruption, lava had poured down the mountainside, swallowing up houses, churches and many of the banana plantations that account for nearly half the island's economy. Although property was destroyed, no one was killed.
Maria Jose Blanco, director of the National Geographic Institute on the Canaries, said all indicators suggested the eruption had run out of energy but she did not rule out a future reactivation. 
Some 3,000 properties were destroyed by lava that now covers 1,219 hectares - equivalent to roughly 1,500 soccer pitches - according to the final tally by the emergency services.
Of the 7,000 people evacuated, most have returned home but many houses that remain standing are uninhabitable due to ash damage. With many roads blocked, some plantations are now only accessible by sea.
German couple Jacqueline Rehm and Juergen Doelz were among those forced to evacuate, fleeing their rented house in the village of Todoque and moving to their small sail boat for seven weeks.
""We couldn't save anything, none of the furniture, none of my paintings, it's all under the lava now,"" said Rehm, 49, adding that they would move to nearby Tenerife after Christmas. 
""I'm not sure it's really over. I don't trust this beast at all,"" she said. 
The volcanic roar that served as a constant reminder of the eruption may have subsided and islanders no longer have to carry umbrellas and goggles to protect against ash, but a mammoth cleanup operation is only just getting underway. 

The government has pledged more than 400 million euros ($453 million) for reconstruction but some residents and businesses have complained that funds are slow to arrive.

Trudeau said China has been ""playing"" Western countries against one another as they compete for access to economic opportunities in the country.
""We've been competing and China has been, from time to time, very cleverly playing us off each other in an open market, competitive way,"" he said in an interview with Global television. 
""We need to do a better job of working together and standing strong so China can't play the angles and divide us one against the other.""
Relations between Canada and China have been chilly since the 2018 detention of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition warrant. China detained two Canadians shortly afterwards, denying Ottawa's accusations of hostage diplomacy. 
Meng reached a deal with U.S. prosecutors in September, ending the extradition fight, and the two Canadians were released within hours of the agreement. 

Even before Meng's arrest, Canada's repeated questioning of China's human rights positions had irked Beijing, and the two countries have failed to come closer.
Earlier this month, Canada said it will join allies in a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing in February to send China a message over its human rights record.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Queen Elizabeth spoke of the loss of her husband Prince Philip on Saturday, remembering the ""mischievous twinkle"" in his eyes in an unusually personal Christmas message to the nation.
The 95-year-old monarch said that while Christmas was a time of happiness for many, it could be hard for those who had lost loved ones, and this year especially she understood why, having lost Philip, 99, in April after 73 years of marriage. 
""His sense of service, intellectual curiosity and capacity to squeeze fun out of any situation were all irrepressible,"" she said in her traditional pre-recorded festive broadcast, paying tribute to ""my beloved Philip"".
""That mischievous enquiring twinkle was as bright at the end as when I first set eyes on him,"" she said.
The queen said she knew Philip would want his family to enjoy Christmas, and there would be joy for them despite the absence of his ""familiar laugh"".
She delivered her address seated at a desk on which stood a photograph of herself and Philip, standing arm-in-arm and smiling at each other. The photo was taken in 2007, when the couple were marking their Diamond Wedding Anniversary.
For her broadcast, the queen wore a sapphire brooch that she wore on her honeymoon in 1947 and for the Diamond Wedding portrait. Photos of her and Philip at various stages of their lives appeared on the screen while she spoke.
Elizabeth is spending Christmas at Windsor Castle, west of London, for the second year running, a break from royal tradition caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. A palace source said this reflected a precautionary approach when the Omicron variant is spreading fast.
Close family members were due to visit her, including her eldest son Prince Charles and his wife Camilla. She was not expected to make a public appearance.
Usually, all the Windsors gather for Christmas at another one of her homes, the Sandringham estate in eastern England. Their walk to a nearby church for a Christmas service is a staple of the royal calendar.
With Britain's daily COVID infection numbers hitting records, the queen last week cancelled a pre-Christmas lunch with her family, also as a precaution.

In her message, she also spoke of her upcoming Platinum Jubilee year, which starts in February and will mark her 70 years on the throne. She is the longest-reigning monarch in British history, having in 2015 overtaken her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria.
She said she hoped the jubilee would be a chance for people ""to give thanks for the enormous changes of the last 70 years, social, scientific and cultural, and also to look ahead with confidence"".

The 95-year-old monarch, who has spent much of the COVID-19 pandemic at Windsor Castle, was celebrating Christmas there with her son, Prince Charles, his wife, Camilla, and other close family.

There was no suggestion that any of the royal family's plans had been disrupted by the incident.
Security breaches at royal residences are rare. The most serious one in the queen's reign happened in 1982, when an intruder climbed a wall to enter Buckingham Palace, her London home, and wandered into a room where she was in bed.
In 2016 a man with a previous murder conviction pleaded guilty to trespass after scaling a perimeter wall at Buckingham Palace and asking if the monarch was at home.

The royal family normally spend Christmas at the queen's Sandringham estate in eastern England, but that tradition has been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. She spent Christmas of 2020 at Windsor, too.
The queen made no public appearance on Saturday. In a pre-recorded Christmas message to the nation, she spoke of the loss of her husband, Prince Philip, who died in April aged 99. The couple were married for 73 years.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) -Pope Francis in his Christmas message on Saturday decried increasing polarisation in personal and international relationships, saying only dialogue can resolve conflicts ranging from family feuds to threats of war.
In his ""Urbi et Orbi"" (to the city and the world) message, he called on individuals and world leaders to talk to each other rather than dig in their heels, a distancing he said has been worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Our capacity for social relationships is sorely tried; there is a growing tendency to withdraw, to do it all by ourselves, to stop making an effort to encounter others and do things together,"" he said from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica on a wet and windy Christmas in Rome.
""On the international level too, there is the risk of avoiding dialogue, the risk that this complex crisis will lead to taking shortcuts rather than setting out on the longer paths of dialogue. Yet only those paths can lead to the resolution of conflicts and to lasting benefits for all,"" he said.
Francis, who turned 85 last week, listed conflicts, tensions or crises in Syria, Yemen, Israel, The Palestinian Territories, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Ukraine, Sudan, South Sudan and elsewhere.
""We continue to witness a great number of conflicts, crises and disagreements,"" he said, speaking from the same balcony where he first appeared to the world as pope after his election on March 13, 2013.
""These never seem to end; by now we hardly even notice them. We have become so used to them that immense tragedies are now being passed over in silence; we risk not hearing the cry of pain and distress of so many of our brothers and sisters,"" he said, speaking to an unusually small crowd reduced by COVID-19 restrictions and the weather to only several thousand.
He asked God to ""give serenity and unity to families"", praising those who strive to keep them and communities together in such divisive times.
""Let us ask him for the strength to be open to dialogue. On this festive day, let us implore him to stir up in the hearts of everyone a yearning for reconciliation and fraternity,"" he said.
He used the word ""dialogue"" 11 times in a speech of little more than two pages as he spoke to people huddled under rain parkas and umbrellas.
Francis asked God to ""prevent fresh outbreaks of a long-festering conflict"" in Ukraine, which has accused Russia of massing tens of thousands of troops in preparation for a possible large-scale military offensive.
Russia denies planning any attack and accuses Ukraine and the United States of destabilising behaviour, saying it needs security guarantees for its own protection.

He asked people not to be indifferent to the plight of migrants, refugees, the displaced, political prisoners and women victims of violence and urged leaders to protect the environment for future generations.
In his Christmas Eve Mass on Friday night in St. Peter's Basilica, Francis said that people who are indifferent to the poor offend God, and urged all to ""look beyond all the lights and decorations"" and remember the neediest.

(Reuters) - A vulgar anti-Biden slogan made for an awkward moment on Friday during President Joe Biden's phone calls with children tracking Santa's flight when a father said, ""Let's Go Brandon.""
The refrain, a sanitized version of ""Fuck Joe Biden,"" has been an internet sensation since a television journalist told race car driver Brandon Brown that a NASCAR crowd shouting the vulgarity was actually saying, ""Let's go Brandon.""
Biden and his wife Jill Biden were taking calls into the North American Aerospace Defense Command Santa Tracker, which follows the progress of Santa’s reindeer-guided sleigh for millions of children.
At the end of one call, a parent who gave his name as Jared said, ""Merry Christmas and Let's go Brandon.""
""Let's go Brandon, I agree,"" a relaxed Biden responded, before asking Jared if he was in Oregon. By that point, the call was disconnected.
Much about the Christmas Eve exchange was not immediately clear, including what the caller intended, why Biden repeated the slogan and whether either knew the origin of the phrase.
The White House did not respond to requests seeking comment. Jared's full name and contact information were not immediately available. 
The slogan has become popular among supporters of former President Donald Trump, who caused a social media storm during his own Christmas Eve phone call with children in 2018. 
Trump asked seven-year-old Collman Lloyd from South Carolina if she still believed in Santa ""because at seven it's marginal, right?"" Lloyd later told the media that she did indeed believe in Santa and had no idea what marginal meant.

Brandon Brown himself has expressed displeasure at the appropriation of his name for an anti-Biden slogan.
""I don't want to be the substitute for a cuss word,"" he recently told The New York Times.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Senior German and Russian government officials have agreed to a rare in-person meeting next month in an effort to ease political tensions over Ukraine, a German government source said on Saturday.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's foreign policy adviser Jens Ploetner and Russia's Ukraine negotiator Dmitry Kozak agreed to meet after a lengthy phone conversation on Thursday, the source said on condition of anonymity.
The German government has not made any official comment. A spokesman for Kozak declined to comment. 
There have been a flurry of phone calls between western leaders and Russian President Vladimir Putin in recent months over Russia's military build-up on the Ukrainian border and resulting fears of an invasion.
In-person meetings between senior Western and Russian government officials have been few and far between, though U.S. President Joe Biden held talks with President Putin in Geneva last June.
Since taking office this month, Scholz has emphasised the need for dialogue with Russia over its military build-up on the Ukrainian border while joining western allies in backing sanctions should Moscow invade.
Berlin doubts more than Washington whether Russia actually wants to attack Ukraine and is keen to de-escalate tensions, two government sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Critics accuse Germany of being beholden to Putin because of its need for Russian gas, attacking construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between the countries, bypassing Ukraine. Berlin says Nordstream 2 is not political and would be only one of several pipelines transporting Russian gas to Europe.

""The German side's goal remains to achieve a swift reactivation of the Normandy format,"" the German government source said, referring to multilateral talks between Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany. 
SPD parliamentary leader Rolf Mutzenich told Reuters the party was not ""naive"" and knew who it was dealing with, adding that it still believes that engagement could help to de-escalate the Ukraine situation.

Karenni Human Rights Group said they found the burnt bodies of internally displaced people, including elders, women and children killed by the military that rules Myanmar, near Mo So village of Hpruso town on Saturday.
""We strongly denounce the inhumane and brutal killing which violates human rights,"" the group said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post.
The Myanmar military said it had shot and killed an unspecified number of ""terrorists with weapons"" from the opposition armed forces in the village, state media said. The people were in seven vehicles and did not stop for the military, it said.
The Myanmar military could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Photos shared by the human rights group and local media showed the charred remains of bodies on burnt-out truckbeds.
The Karenni National Defence Force, one of the largest of several civilian militias opposing the junta that led a Feb. 1 coup, said the dead were not their members but civilians seeking refuge from the conflict. 
""We were so shocked at seeing that all the dead bodies were different sizes, including children, women and old people,"" a commander from group told Reuters, asking not to be named.
A villager who asked not to be named for security reasons said he was aware of the fire on Friday night but could not go to the scene as there was shooting.
""I went to see this morning. I saw dead bodies that had been burnt, and also the clothes of children and women spread around,"" he told Reuters by phone.
Meanwhile fighting in another part of the country, near the Thai border where the Myanmar military continues to clash with a rebel group, resulted in a wayward rocket-propelled grenade damaging a house on the Thailand side of the border with no deaths or injuries, Thai authorities said on Saturday.
The Myanmar military carried out airstrikes https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-airstrikes-displace-more-people-along-thai-myanmar-border-2021-12-24 a day earlier on an area controlled by the Karen National Union (KNU) near the border in an escalation of fighting that flared up last week and has since sent thousands fleeing into Thailand.
Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military overthrew the elected government of Nobel Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi almost 11 months ago, claiming fraud in a November election that her party had won. International observers have said the ballot was fair.
Civilians enraged by the coup and subsequent crackdown on protesters have been taking up arms. Many local resistance forces have sprung up across the country.
The military has outlawed many opponents, labelling them traitors or terrorists, including a self-proclaimed National Unity Government that seeks to lobby the international community and prevent the junta from consolidating power.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A current spokesman for former U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said in a court filing that he has cooperated extensively with the congressional committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
The spokesman, Taylor Budowich, said in a lawsuit, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, that he has produced more than 1,700 pages of documents and provided about four hours of sworn testimony to the House of Representatives panel.
Budowich, at a recent deposition, answered questions about the financing and planning of a speech by Trump to supporters near the White House on Jan. 6 that preceded the violence at the Capitol that day.
Budowich's lawsuit sought a court order blocking the House committee from gaining access to his financial records at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)
""The subpoena seeks personal financial material that is irrelevant to any conceivable legislation and not pertinent to any purported purpose of the Select Committee,"" Budowich said in the lawsuit.
A spokesman for the Jan. 6 Select Committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Budowich's lawsuit is the latest in a flood of litigation by targets of the committee seeking to prevent it from enforcing its subpoenas for information, but it is the first lawsuit to focus on a subpoena for financial records.
This week, former Trump adviser Michael Flynn and right-wing radio host Alex Jones filed separate lawsuits alleging the Select Committee was not lawfully constituted and its subpoenas for their testimony are therefore unlawful.

An appeals court has rejected that argument, ruling on Dec. 9 that the committee was valid and entitled to see White House records Trump has tried to shield from public view. Trump on Thursday appealed that decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.
The committee has issued more than 50 subpoenas and heard from more than 300 witnesses in its investigation of the attack.

(Reuters) -The Biden administration will lift travel restrictions on eight southern African countries imposed last month over concerns about the fast-spreading COVID-19 Omicron variant, the White House said Friday.
Foreign nationals who are barred from the United States because they have been in one of the eight countries within the prior 14 days will again be allowed on U.S.-bound flights leaving after 12:01 a.m. ET on Dec. 31, a senior official said, confirming a Reuters report.
The United States on Nov. 29 barred nearly all non-U.S. citizens who had recently been in South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi in an ""abundance of caution"" over the variant detected in South Africa.
White House spokesman Kevin Munoz tweeted that Biden ""will lift the temporary travel restrictions on Southern Africa countries"" effective Dec. 31. 
He said the decision was recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ""The restrictions gave us time to understand Omicron and we know our existing vaccines work against Omicron, esp boosted,"" Munoz tweeted.
Reuters reported earlier U.S. public health agencies had recommended lifting the travel restrictions because retaining them would have not a significant impact on U.S. cases given the widespread current U.S. transmission, confidence that an Omicron-specific vaccine would not be necessary and that existing vaccines and booster shots are highly effective.
""This travel pause has served its purpose. It bought time to understand the science, it gave time to analyze the variant,"" the official, who did not want to be identified because the decision has not yet been made public, told Reuters.
""This was not meant to keep Omicron out. We knew we couldn't do that. The point was to reduce the number of cases coming in - in those early days and weeks.""
The restrictions have not prevented flights or Americans from returning from southern Africa.
Top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said on Monday that lifting the restrictions was likely ""because we have enough infection in our own country... We're letting in people from other countries that have as much or more infection than the southern African countries.""
The official emphasized the restrictions were meant to be temporary and lifting them after about a month ""sends a pretty clear signal that there's not going to be a significant penalty"" for coming forward to disclose new variant information.
The United States had only lifted travel restrictions on South Africa on Nov. 8 put in place since late January to address COVID-19 concerns.
In the wake of Omicron, the United States tightened testing rules for international travelers and extended a requirement to wear masks on airplanes and at airports through March 18.
On Dec. 6, CDC toughened testing rules for international air travelers arriving in the United States, requiring them to obtain a negative COVID-19 test within one day of travel.
Under prior rules, vaccinated international air travelers could present a negative test result obtained within three days of their day of departure.

CDC last week started distributing free COVID-19 home test kits to international travelers at several airports. The CDC encourages - but does not mandate - international air travelers to get a new COVID-19 test three to five days after arriving in the United States.
The CDC last month ordered airlines to disclose passenger names and other information about those who have recently been in the eight southern African countries.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain reported another day of record COVID-19 cases on Friday, with new estimates showing swathes of London's population are carrying the virus, underlining the relentless advance of the Omicron variant.
Omicron's rapid spread has driven a surge in cases over the last seven days, especially in the capital. 
Around 1 in 20 Londoners likely had COVID-19 on Dec. 16 and early estimates - which could yet be revised - suggest this may have risen to 1 in 10 on Sunday, models from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed on Friday. 
Many industries and transport networks are struggling with staff shortages as sick workers self-isolate, while hospitals in Britain have warned of the risk of an impact on patient safety.
However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has staked considerable political capital on the Christmas of 2021 being ""considerably better"" than the previous year, on Tuesday ruled out new restrictions before the day itself, saying that there was uncertainty about the severity of Omicron and hospitalisation rates.
Government data showed 122,186 new cases, up from 119,789 on Thursday and marking a third day of cases in excess of 100,000.
While recent research on Omicron suggests it has a lower rate of hospitalisation than previous variants of COVID-19, health officials have maintained a cautious note about the outlook.
""There is a glimmer of Christmas hope... but it definitely isn't yet at the point where we could downgrade that serious threat,"" Jenny Harries, head of the UK Health Security Agency, told the BBC.
""What we have got now is a really fine balance between something that looks like a lower risk of hospitalisation - which is great news - but equally a highly transmissible variant and one that we know evades some of our immune defences.""
On Friday the government reported 137 new deaths within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test, down from 147 on Thursday, and bringing the total during the pandemic to 147,857 - the highest in Europe.
The ONS said prevalence increased across all parts of the United Kingdom, with Scotland showing the lowest rate of infections at 1 in 65 people on Dec. 19.

The ONS estimates showed around 1 in 35 people in England - equivalent to 1.54 million people - were infected with COVID-19 during the six days to Dec. 19. 
The early modelling of the subsequent days suggested that could have risen to more than 2 million people on Sunday, or around 1 in 25.

DENVER (Reuters) - Undaunted by pandemics, supply-chain woes and labor shortages plaguing Earth-bound commerce, Santa Claus was set to launch his reindeer-powered sleigh on Friday to deliver Christmas gifts to good girls and boys worldwide, according to military officials tracking his flights.
""Santa's been doing this for centuries, he's a professional,"" said Canadian Army Captain Alexandra Hejduk, a spokesperson for the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).
The joint U.S.-Canadian military command based at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colorado, is charged with monitoring air defenses and issuing aerospace and maritime warnings.
NORAD'S Santa-tracking practice originated in 1955, when a Colorado Springs newspaper misprinted the number of a local department store for youngsters to call in and speak to Santa, mistakenly listing the number for what was then called the Continental Air Defense Command.
An on-duty officer took the calls and assured the children that Santa, also known as Kris Kringle or Saint Nicholas, knew of their wish lists and was on his way.
The annual tradition has continued for 66 years, becoming part of NORAD's mission.
Followers of the jolly old elf can obtain real-time updates at noradsanta.org or through social media platforms. Or, they can call a NORAD-sponsored Santa hotline to speak with a live operator.
Other U.S. government agencies were likewise gearing up.
The U.S. Secret Service, responsible for protecting the president, also provides security for Santa, the agency said in a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) statement, accompanied by a video of agents preparing for Santa-protection duties.
""The Big Red Protective Detail is selected, assembled and stands ready,"" the statement said. ""The American public can rest assured that Mr. S. Claus, here from the North Pole, will travel safely and securely throughout his U.S. tour.""

In Ottawa, federal Transport Minister Omar Alghabra said he had cleared Santa for travel in Canadian airspace. Santa had his proof of vaccination ready and tested negative, the ministry said in a statement.
""Although his nose shone red and bright, Rudolph (the reindeer) made sure he had no COVID-19 symptoms before taking off on this important mission,"" it added.

MOSCOW/KYIV (Reuters) -The European Union can only blame its own policies for record gas prices as some of its members resell cheap Russian gas at much higher prices within the bloc, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday.
Putin also called on the EU to approve a new Russian gas route, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, to ease the price crunch.
Europe's benchmark gas price climbed to a new record on Tuesday, up almost 800% since the start of the year. The price eased on Friday, but it was still up more than 400%.
Nord Stream 2 is opposed by the United States and particularly several east European states, which say the pipeline will make the EU even more reliant on Russian gas, which already supplies 35% of the bloc's gas needs. 
The pipeline from Russia to Germany, which was built in September, is still awaiting regulatory approval from Berlin and Brussels.
""The additional gas supplies on the European gas market would surely reduce the price on an exchange, on the spot (market),"" Putin was quoted as saying by news agency RIA at a joint meeting of the State Council and a council on science and education.
Adding to the squeeze, the Yamal-Europe pipeline that usually sends Russian gas to Western Europe was flowing in reverse for a fourth day on Friday, pumping fuel from Germany to Poland, data from German network operator Gascade showed.
Russian gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) has not booked gas transit capacity for exports via the Yamal-Europe pipeline for Dec. 25, auction results showed.
Gazprom usually books capacity via the route on a short-term basis, after Poland and Russia chose not to extend their long-term transit deal last year.
Putin said Poland had ""sidelined"" Russia from managing the Yamal-Europe pipeline, which has been working in reverse mode by sending gas eastward. The pipeline runs from Russia to Belarus and further to Poland and Germany.
""This does not increase the Russian gas volumes on the European market, so the price is rising,"" Putin said according to Interfax news agency, about the reverse flows.
Putin said on Thursday that Germany was reselling Russian gas to Poland and Ukraine rather than relieving an overheated market.
In Ukraine, another transit route for Russian gas to Europe, the head of state gas transmission operator said Gazprom had reduced daily gas transit across Ukrainian territory to 87.7 million cubic metres (mcm) from 109 mcm.
""The reduction in gas supplies to the European Union at a time when prices reached $2,000 suggests that these are not economic decisions but purely political ones, aimed at increasing pressure on the EU to launch Nord Stream 2 on terms of the Russian Federation,"" Sergiy Makogon wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
The benchmark European gas price soared above 2,200 euros ($2,495) per 1,000 cubic metres on Tuesday.
Makogon said Europe had set a record for extracting gas from storage because of supply shortages.
Russia has repeatedly dismissed charges it has played politics over gas and says it is meeting all the amounts it is contracted to supply. Companies with supply deals have also said their contracts have been met.
MISSING OUT
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak also said Europe was missing out on additional Russian supplies because of delays to Nord Stream 2.
""To my mind, European consumers are very interested in the project to start working, while the companies, which participate in it, they could have submitted additional requests as part of long-term relations on gas supplies via this new gas pipeline,"" Novak told Russian state TV channel Rossiya-24.
He also said European leaders had made mistakes in reducing the use of long-term supply deals in favour of the spot market, where prices are more volatile.
""The countries, which receive gas via the long-term deals, they receive it much cheaper,"" Novak said.
Europe's red-hot gas market could find some relief from redirected cargoes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Asia as European prices make this diversion attractive.
Gazprom, which has a monopoly on Russia gas exports by pipeline, has not booked gas transit capacity for exports via the Yamal-Europe pipeline for Dec. 24, auction results showed on Friday.
Gascade's data on the Yamal-Europe pipelines showed flows at the Mallnow metering point on the German-Polish border going east from Germany into Poland at an hourly volume of around 1,218,000 kilowatt hours (kWh/h) on Friday and were expected to stay at these levels during the day.
Data from Slovak pipeline operator Eustream showed capacity nominations for Friday's Russian gas flows from Ukraine to Slovakia via the Velke Kapusany border point were at 739,843 MWh, down from Thursday's 785,160 MWh.

That drop was being balanced by higher nominations for flows from the Czech Republic to Slovakia, meaning nominations for flows from Slovakia to the Austrian hub Baumgarten were roughly stable compared with the previous day.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Two more Hong Kong universities removed on Friday public monuments to the 1989 Tiananmen protests in Beijing, following the dismantling of a sculpture commemorating victims of the crackdown at another university this week.
The removals at Chinese University and Lingnan University in the global financial hub came as authorities have been clamping down under a national security law imposed by China.
Human rights activists say the law is being used to suppress civil society, jail democracy campaigners and curb basic freedoms, but authorities say the security laws have restored stability after mass protests in 2019.
Just before dawn, a 6.4-metre (20-foot) -tall bronze statue representing the ""Goddess of Democracy"" holding a flame aloft was removed from a public piazza at Chinese University.
In a statement, the university said the ""unauthorised statue"" had been taken away following an ""internal assessment"".
The sculpture, which had stood on the campus for more than a decade, was modelled on a 10-metre (30-foot) white plaster and foam statue erected by students in Tiananmen Square to symbolise their resolve to pursue liberty and democracy in China under Communist party rule.
A group of about two dozen students gathered to denounce the move by their university, handing out June 4 flyers as well as missing person posters of the democracy goddess with the words: ""Have you seen her?"" Another read, ""Bring her back"".
Others placed crystanthemums, a traditional Chinese symbol of mourning, lit candles on the site where the statue once stood, and played the song ""Bloodstained Glory"" to remember the hundreds, perhaps thousands killed in 1989. 
""I feel heartbroken and shocked,"" said Felix Chow, a former Chinese University student and district councillor.
""This statue represents the school environment is open. It's a symbol of academic freedom ... It makes people doubt whether the school can still ensure the space is free and people can speak freely,"" he told Reuters.
Unlike mainland China, where authorities ban any memorials or public commemoration of June 4, Hong Kong had previously been the only place on Chinese soil where such remembrances were permissible.
For the past two years, however, police, citing COVID-19 risks, have banned an annual June 4 candlelight vigil that had regularly drawn tens of thousands of people. 
Also before dawn on Christmas Eve, Hong Kong's Lingnan University took down a wall relief sculpture about the Tiananmen event that depicted the ""Goddess of Democracy"" and a row of tanks halting before a lone protester known as ""tank man""; as well as victims shot by Chinese troops.
When asked by Reuters whether Hong Kong or Chinese authorities had instructed all three universities to remove these Tiananmen monuments, the office of Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, said it had no comment. 
The sculptor of both works, Chen Weiming, told Reuters he would sue the universities if there was any damage to his works.
In the main hall of the student union at Lingnan University, a towering red drawing of the Goddess of Democracy had also been covered over in grey paint.
Students responded by pasting a sheet of paper with the word ""shameful"" on the effaced image, but it was quickly ripped off by security guards. 
In an email to Reuters, Lingnan University said that items that may pose ""legal and safety risks"" had been ""cleared, or removed and stored appropriately"".
When Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997, it was promised wide ranging autonomy and freedoms by China under a so-called ""one country, two systems"" arrangement. 
Earlier this week, the University of Hong Kong dismantled and removed an eight-metre (26-ft) -tall ""pillar of shame"" statue to victims of the Tiananmen crackdown.
The disappearances of these symbolic monuments from three universities in quick succession mean that hardly any Tiananmen monuments remain to public view in Hong Kong.

""Since the Chinese communists implemented the national security law in Hong Kong, they have eradicated the freedom of press, of assembly and the freedom of expression,"" Chen, the artist, told Reuters. 
""They want to remove the real history of the brutal crackdown ... they wouldn't allow any different viewpoints to continue to exist in Hong Kong.""

590,"<span>Dec 24, 2021 10:41AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - New satellite images captured by a private U.S. company show that Russia has continued to build up its forces in annexed Crimea and near Ukraine in recent weeks while pressing the United States for talks over security guarantees it is seeking.
Reuters could not independently verify the latest images from U.S.-based Maxar Technologies (NYSE:MAXR). The Kremlin reiterated on Friday that it reserves the right to move its own forces on Russian territory as it sees fit and that Western countries were carrying out provocative military manoeuvres near its borders.
U.S., European and Ukrainian leaders have accused Russia of building up troops again near Ukraine's border since October after an earlier brief buildup in April, when Maxar also released images. U.S. President Joe Biden and other leaders say Moscow appears to be weighing an attack on Ukraine as soon as next month, something Moscow has repeatedly denied.
The images released late on Thursday showed a base in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, packed with hundreds of armoured vehicles and tanks as of Dec. 13. A Maxar satellite image of the same base in October showed the base was half empty.
Maxar said a new brigade-level unit, comprised of several hundred armoured vehicles that include BMP-series infantry fighting vehicles, tanks, self-propelled artillery and air defence equipment, had arrived at the Russian garrison.
""Over the past month, our high-resolution satellite imagery has observed a number of new Russian deployments in Crimea as well as in several training areas in western Russia along the periphery of the Ukraine border,"" Maxar said in a statement.
It cited increased activity at three sites in Crimea and at five sites in western Russia.
President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia wanted to avoid conflict, but needed an ""immediate"" response from the United States and its allies to its demands for security guarantees. Moscow has said it expects talks with U.S. officials on the subject to start in January in Geneva.
On Friday, Putin said Russia had conducted a test launch of a hypersonic missile. The test follows earlier ones this month, in October, and in July as part of what he said was a new generation of unrivalled arms systems.
When asked on Friday about the build-up of Russian troops near Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was acting to defend its own security.
""Russia is moving its own troops around on its own territory against the backdrop of highly unfriendly actions by our opponents in NATO, the United States and various European countries who are carrying out highly unambiguous manoeuvres near our borders,"" said Peskov.
""This forces us to take certain measures to guarantee our own security.""
Russia also accused the United States and the European Union of using the planned Nord Stream 2 pipeline to take Russian gas to Europe as a bargaining chip. The West has threatened to block the pipeline, which is awaiting regulatory approval in Germany, if Russia invades Ukraine.
Biden has threatened strong economic and other measures https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-warns-putin-russia-will-pay-a-terrible-price-if-it-invades-ukraine-2021-12-11 in retaliation for any invasion, building on sanctions imposed over Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea and backing for an ongoing separatist rebellion by pro-Russian forces in eastern Ukraine. A U.S. official has said new retaliatory measures could include tough export controls.
Russia says its wants NATO to halt its eastwards expansion and is seeking guarantees that the Western military alliance will not deploy certain offensive weapons to Ukraine and other neighbouring countries. 

Other Maxar images showed a build-up at the Soloti staging ground in Russia close to the Ukrainian border, with photos shot at the start of December showing a larger concentration of military hardware than in September. 
Pictures also showed continuing build-ups at Yelnya, a Russian town around 160 miles (260 km) north of the Ukrainian border, and at the Pogonovo training ground near the southern Russian city of Voronezh.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan will not send a government delegation to February's Winter Olympics in Beijing, it said on Friday, a move likely to deepen tension with China.
The decision follows a U.S.-led diplomatic boycott of the Games over concerns about human rights in China, although Japan has avoided explicitly labelling its move as such.
Japan, while a partner of the United States, also has strong economic ties to China.
Tokyo will not send a government delegation to the 2022 Winter Games, but will instead send some officials with direct ties to the Olympics, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told a news briefing.
These officials include Seiko Hashimoto, head of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee, as well as the heads of the domestic Olympic and Paralympic committees.
""Japan believes that it's important for China to ensure freedom, respect for basic human rights and the rule of law, which are universal values of the international community,"" Matsuno said.
Japan was addressing such issues with China directly at various levels he added, saying that this year's Tokyo Games showed the Olympics and Paralympics were a celebration of peace and sports that give courage to the world.
""Japan's government decided on its response to the Beijing Winter Olympics by taking those points into consideration, and deciding on its own,"" he said.
The absence of Japanese officials was not taken under any ""specific term"" Matsuno said, indicating that the government was not calling the move a boycott.
In Beijing, a foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, told a regular news conference that China welcomed the Olympic officials and atheletes from Japan. 
China did not send a government delegation to the Tokyo Summer Olympics this year, but only a sports delegation, led by the sports bureau chief. 

Japan has typically taken a softer tone on the issue of human rights in China, reflecting its widespread dependence on China, not only as a manufacturing hub, but as a market for items from automobiles to construction equipment.
Still, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has faced rising pressure within his ruling Liberal Democratic Party to take a tougher stance on China, public broadcaster NHK said.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's President Moon Jae-in granted a pardon to former President Park Geun-hye, who was in prison after being convicted of corruption, the justice ministry said on Friday, amid a tight presidential race.
Park, 69, became South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be thrown out of office when the Constitutional Court upheld a parliament vote in 2017 to impeach her over a scandal https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-politics-park-idUSKCN1HD0MN that also landed the heads of two conglomerates, including Samsung (KS:005930), in jail. 
She was brought down after being found guilty of colluding with a friend to receive tens of billions of won from major conglomerates mostly to fund her friend's family and nonprofit foundations. 
In January, South Korea's top court upheld a 20-year prison sentence for Park on the graft charges that finalised her downfall, bringing an end to the legal process.
Park's lawyer Yoo Yeong-ha said Park had offered an apology for causing concern to the public and thanked Moon for making a difficult decision. 
Moon's office said pardoning Park was intended to ""overcome unfortunate past history, promote people's unity and join hands for the future."" 
""I hope this would provide a chance to go beyond differences in thoughts and pros and cons, and open a new era of integration and unity,"" his spokeswoman quoted him as saying. 
Moon had previously pledged not to pardon those who were convicted of corruption. But many supporters and politicians of the conservative main opposition People Power party have called for Park's pardon ahead of the March presidential election, citing her deteriorating health and deepening political strife. 
Opposition lawmakers have said that Park has experienced health problems while in prison, including undergoing shoulder surgery. 
Park's imprisonment had become a political hot potato that divided the country, with conservatives having weekly rallies in downtown Seoul urging her release and criticising Moon until the COVID-19 pandemic emerged. 
A poll by Gallup Korea in November showed 48% of respondents were opposed to pardoning Park and Lee, but the numbers have dropped from around 60% early this year. 
Kim Mi-jeong, 42, a resident of the southern city of Gwangyang, said Park's pardon was timely. Jang Yun-soo, from Hwaseong on South Korea's west coast near Seoul, said her release was politically motivated. 
The flag bearer of Moon's ruling Democratic Party, Lee Jae-myung, and People Power's candidate Yoon Suk-yeol are seen neck and neck in recent polls. 
Lee said he understood Moon's ""agony"" and respected his decision for national unity, but Park should offer a sincere apology for the scandal. 

Yoon said Park's pardon was welcome albeit late, but did not elaborate on reporters' questions over whether her potential resumption of political activity.
Park's predecessor, also conservative Lee Myung-bak https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-politics-corruption-idUSKCN1GI0HX, who is also imprisoned on corruption charges, was not pardoned.

The Karen National Union (KNU) said the military launched at least two airstrikes and fired some artillery rounds on an area under its control near the Thai-Myanmar border late on Thursday.
A Reuters reporter at Mae Sot, a Thai border town some 15 km (10 miles) from where the air strikes reportedly took place, heard several explosions on Thursday evening at around 11 p.m. local time.
A spokesman for the Myanmar's military junta did not answer calls seeking comment.
Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military ousted a civilian government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1, triggering protests and sporadic clashes in the countryside between anti-junta militia and the army.
Fresh fighting between the Myanmar military and the KNU broke out last week, and more than 4,200 people have crossed into Thailand since the violence began, Thailand's foreign ministry said. Civil society groups have said the number of displaced is as high as 10,000.
KNU spokesman Saw Taw Nee told Reuters that the airstrikes have further displaced more civilians living in the area and repeated his group's call for the international community to established a no-fly zone in the area.
Thailand's foreign ministry spokesman Tanee Sangrat said at a press conference on Friday that Thailand was concerned about the latest violence in Karen state that also impacted Thai people living along the border.

Several foreign envoys to Myanmar, including from the EU, Britain and the United States, issued a joint statement on Friday calling for an end to ""indiscriminate attacks"" in Karen state and elsewhere by the military.
""The recent attacks on civilians in Karen State, including the shelling of villages, are a violation of International Humanitarian Law and must stop,"" they said.

BOWLING GREEN, Ky. (Reuters) - After exhausting journeys that took them from Kabul to Qatar to European cities to U.S. military bases, Afghan families fleeing the Taliban alighted in Kentucky, in a small city well versed in receiving refugees.
Bowling Green has welcomed waves of refugees over four decades, beginning with the Cambodians in the 1980s and then Bosnians in the 1990s, plus Iraqis, Burmese, Rwandese and Congolese and others, who have helped make the city of 72,000 a diverse and economically thriving place. 
Wazir Khan Zadran was a tribal leader who fought 20 years ago against the Haqqani network, a powerful faction within the Taliban. Although he more recently worked with a non-governmental organization, he knew the Taliban would come for him. 
Zadran said the Americans saved him and his family by picking them up in a Chinook helicopter in August and taking them to the Kabul airport. After a spell at a New Mexico military base, they were sent to Bowling Green and quickly realized they had lucked out in their new American lives. 
(See https://reut.rs/3H4tNjZ for a picture package on Zadran and other refugees)
""We are so happy in Bowling Green,"" said the 41-year-old father, who has secured a comfortable house and sent his children to school with the assistance of the local resettlement agency, the International Center, founded in 1981. 
""Also, the local community is helping us and introducing the culture to us,"" Zadran added. 
His six children are learning songs in English, sending ""Dear Santa"" letters off, going to the library and lapping up ice cream at Baskin-Robbins. 
In the aftermath of rising anti-immigrant and refugee sentiment during the Trump administration, the United States government is now handling its biggest refugee evacuation since Vietnam. Of the nearly 75,000 expected to settle in America, Bowling Green will receive 350 Afghans in fiscal year 2022. 
There are plenty of jobs for new residents of Bowling Green, an agricultural and manufacturing hub, perhaps best known for the assembly plant that makes the coveted Corvette sports car. The Bosnians, who now number around 10,000 and own several companies, attest to the good job prospects when the Afghans' expedited work permits arrive in coming months. 
""In 2000 when I came here, I arrived with a couple of suitcases and two infant children and my wife,"" said Tahir Zukic, a Bosnian from Srebrenica who owns Taz Trucking, employing 100 people and 140 trucks. 
""It's absolutely an amazing place to be, with a lot of opportunity and you can just do what you like to do."" 
For those who did not work with the Americans in Afghanistan, learning the language could be the toughest part of adapting to their new home, Zukic said. But they also must learn how America works, how to drive, how to get a credit card. And what to do when tornadoes approach. 
The twisters that tore through Kentucky this month jolted the Afghans' sense of security. They were confounded by the 1 a.m. sirens that reminded them of Kabul and shocked by the uprooted trees, roofs ripped off houses and deaths in one neighborhood home to many immigrants.
""We never saw a storm like this before in our life in Afghanistan, so we felt maybe we were going to another war,"" Zadran said. ""But God saved us.""
'THIS IS MY PLACE'
Firas Majeed arrived in Bowling Green from Baghdad via Brooklyn, New York, in 2016. The Iraqi refugee came to visit a friend and decided ""this is my place."" He now co-owns a grocery store stocked with Middle Eastern and European foods after working as a welder. 
""The quality of life is higher than in the big cities,"" said Majeed, who appreciates the big skies and verdant farms around Bowling Green, strong job market, low rents and medical care. 
Majeed said the Afghans will get a lot of support because everyone saw the images of the chaotic evacuation from Kabul. The Iraqis can teach them things, like how to get a driver's license. 
Bowling Green is also a place that allows refugees to hold onto their identities while becoming Americans - offering a socially conservative environment to raise families and practice religions. 
At the Forest Park Baptist Church, Congolese refugees have breathed new life into the community. Worship services and Bible study are translated into Swahili and sometimes held in that language. 
""We love their gospel singing,"" said church leader Mike Givens, and the church translates their songs so everyone hears the message. 
""Our community has changed, so if we do not seek or go after the immigrant population, our church will not survive,"" added Givens.

Back at the Zadran house, the children make quick progress with their new culture. The eldest, Zuleikha, teaches her siblings a song in English with the lyrics ""What are you thankful for?"" 
As they applaud their own performance, Zuleikha declares ""Finished!"" and flashes a wide grin.

(Reuters) - A Minnesota jury on Thursday found former police officer Kimberly Potter guilty of manslaughter in the fatal shooting of Black motorist Daunte Wright during a traffic stop when she mistakenly fired her handgun instead of her Taser.
A 12-member jury declared Potter, 49, guilty of first-degree and second-degree manslaughter in the death of the 20-year-old Wright, whom she killed in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center on April 11 with a bullet to the chest.
Potter, who broke down last week on the stand as she testified to her remorse for the shooting, showed little emotion as Judge Regina Chu read the verdict and polled the jury. Potter was taken away in handcuffs after Chu rejected her attorney's plea for her to be allowed to spend Christmas with family.
""I am going to require that she be taken into custody and held without bail,"" Chu said. ""I cannot treat this case any differently than any other case."" 
Potter will be sentenced on Feb. 18. She faces a maximum sentence of 15 years on the first-degree manslaughter conviction. Under state law, defendants cannot be sentenced for multiple charges pertaining to the same act. 
The shooting sparked multiple nights of intense demonstrations in Brooklyn Center. It happened just a few miles north of where Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, was at the same time standing trial for killing George Floyd, a Black man whose 2020 death during an arrest had set off protests in U.S. cities over racism and police brutality.
Chauvin was convicted of murder. Both he and Potter are white.
Caught on Potter's body-worn camera, the basic facts of the incident were for the most part not in dispute. Both prosecutors and the defense attorneys agreed that Potter mistakenly drew the wrong weapon and never meant to kill Wright.
At issue was whether the jury would find her actions to be reckless in violation of the state's manslaughter statutes, or chalk up the incident to a tragic mistake that did not warrant criminal liability.
The jury, which agreed on the lesser charge on Tuesday and took two additional days to agree on first-degree manslaughter, went against the expectations of some legal experts who predicted an acquittal or deadlock resulting in mistrial.
Wright's mother, Katie Bryant, said she let out a yelp when she heard the verdict on the most serious count.
""Every single emotion that you could imagine, just running through your body at that moment,"" Bryant said. ""Today, Minnesota has shown that police officers are not going to continue to pull their gun instead of their Taser.""
POTTER EXPRESSES REGRET 
Potter and another police officer pulled Wright over because there was an air freshener illegally hanging from his rearview mirror and his vehicle's license tabs were expired. They then learned of a warrant for his arrest on a misdemeanor weapons charge and sought to detain him. Wright resisted, breaking free from the second officer. 
Potter then shouted, ""Taser, Taser, Taser"" and fired into Wright's car, video from her body-worn camera showed. Potter testified that she feared for the life of a third officer who had entered the car through the passenger side and was trying to keep the vehicle in park. 
Minnesota criminal defense attorney Jack Rice, who was not involved in the case, said he believed the video and anti-police sentiment influenced the jury.
""In the end, the video was brutal and it's really difficult to explain away the distinctions between a Taser and a firearm,"" he said. 
Throughout the trial, prosecutors stressed Potter's 26 years as a police officer, experience they said made her mistake indefensible. They said she disregarded her training, which included Taser-specific courses in the months before the shooting, and took a conscious and unreasonable risk in using any weapon against the unarmed Wright.
Potter's attorneys sought to blame Wright for resisting arrest, which they argued had created a dangerous situation and justified her use of force. While acknowledging her mistake, they said her actions were not criminal because she thought she was using her Taser and was unaware she had drawn her handgun.
The defense also leaned heavily on Dr. Laurence Miller, a psychologist who testified about ""action error,"" or when a person takes one action while intending to do another. Miller said such mistakes were common and can be triggered by stress.

Potter's attorneys took a chance by putting her on the stand. She testified that she was deeply sorry for killing Wright and outlined an otherwise clean record as a police officer. She said she had never discharged her gun before.
""Her remorse and regret for the incident is overwhelming,"" Paul Engh, one of her attorneys, told the judge in arguing for her to be allowed out on bail until sentencing.

(Reuters) -The U.S. on Thursday authorized Merck & Co's antiviral pill for COVID-19 for certain high-risk adult patients, a day after giving a broader go-ahead to a similar but more effective treatment https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-says-covid-19-pill-near-90-effective-final-analysis-2021-12-14 from  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Merck's drug could be used when other authorized treatments are not accessible or clinically appropriate.
The drug, molnupiravir https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-says-its-covid-19-drug-should-be-effective-against-any-variant-2021-11-30, was developed with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics and shown to reduce hospitalizations and deaths by around 30% in a clinical trial of high-risk individuals early in the course of the illness. 
The authorization allows use of the drug for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and along with the Pfizer pill https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-oral-covid-19-pill-gets-us-authorization-at-home-use-2021-12-22, could be an important tool against the fast-spreading Omicron variant, which is now dominant in the United States. 
Pfizer's drug, Paxlovid https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-govt-buy-10-mln-courses-pfizers-covid-19-pill-529-bln-2021-11-18, was authorized on Wednesday for people aged 12 and older and has shown to be nearly 90% effective in preventing hospitalizations and deaths in patients at high risk of severe illness, according to trial data. 
The FDA says some patients should avoid Pfizer's two-drug regimen because it includes an older antiviral called ritonavir that is known to have interactions with some other prescription medicines. It is also not recommended for people with severe kidney issues. 
Merck plans to ship hundreds of thousands of treatment courses in coming days and 1 million over the next few weeks. Pfizer plans to ship about 250,000 courses in the next month. 
Availability of other treatments is the first consideration for doctors thinking of prescribing Merck's treatment, according to Patrizia Cavazzoni, the director of FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.
The FDA has authorized intravenous treatments, mostly for hospital use, called monoclonal antibodies but availability is limited and efficacy against the Omicron variant is lower.
FDA official John Farley said during a press briefing that GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK)'s and Vir Biotech's antibody drug - which has been shown to work against Omicron - is expected to be in short supply this winter. 
Merck said that its treatment had advantages over the Pfizer pill.
""It doesn't require any second drug to boost its efficacy, and you can give it in a variety of special patient populations, including people who have significant issues with liver function or kidney function,"" Nick Kartsonis, Merck's senior vice president of clinical research for vaccines and infectious diseases, told Reuters. 
""This approval comes at the right time since more COVID-19 treatments are needed to supplement the vaccination effort, especially in light of variants of concern,"" said Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Louise Chen.
Nearly 62% of people in the United States are fully vaccinated, leaving many Americans unprotected against a wave of Omicron infections. Two doses of the highly successful vaccine from Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) are only somewhat protective against infection with the Omicron variant while a third dose improves the immune response.
Merck's and Pfizer's antiviral both work by preventing the virus from replicating. Merck's pill does so by introducing errors into the genetic code of the virus. 
Some of the FDA's experts have said that could lead to more troublesome variants. 
There have also been some safety concerns around the drug because it may affect bone cartilage and growth.
Due to that reason, Merck's drug is not authorized for use in patients younger than 18, the FDA said. The pill is not recommended for use during pregnancy, the agency added. 
The agency advised that men of reproductive potential use a reliable method of birth control during treatment with molnupiravir, and for at least three months after the final dose.
The drug is meant to be taken twice a day - four pills each time - for five days, making a full treatment course 40 pills. The treatment was priced at about $700 per course in a deal with the U.S. government for up to 5 million courses.

The U.S. government has ordered 10 million courses of the Pfizer drug at a price of $530 per course compares to the deal with Merck for as many as 5 million courses of molnupiravir at a price of $700 per course. 
Merck has said molnupiravir, which helps prevent the virus from replicating, should be effective against any variant, including the new Omicron variant.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former President Donald Trump asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday to block the release of White House records sought by the House of Representatives committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.
Trump's request came two weeks after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-appeals-court-rejects-trumps-bid-withhold-records-panel-probing-jan-6-attack-2021-12-09 that the former president had no basis to challenge Democratic President Joe Biden's decision to allow the documents to be handed over. That decision will remain on hold until the Supreme Court acts.
Biden had previously determined that the records, which belong to the executive branch, should not be subject to executive privilege, which protects the confidentially of some internal White House communications, and that turning them over to Congress was in the best interests of the nation.
Trump's lawyers said in their court filing that the House Select Committee's request is ""exceedingly broad"" and an ""unprecedented encroachment on executive privilege."" 
The appeals court ruling was another blow to the Republican former president and his allies, who have waged an ongoing legal battle with the committee over access to documents and witnesses.
The committee has asked the National Archives, the U.S. agency housing Trump's White House records, to produce visitor logs, phone records and written communications between his advisers.
The panel has said it needs the records to understand any role Trump may have played in fomenting the violence.
Later on Thursday, it responded to Trump's appeal with a request for an expedited review from the Supreme Court.
""Delay would inflict a serious injury on the Select Committee and the public,"" the committee's filing read.
""The Select Committee needs the requested documents now to help shape the direction of the investigation."" 
Trump has argued that he can invoke executive privilege based on the fact that he was president at the time even though he is no longer in office.
U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan rejected Trump's arguments on Nov. 9, saying he had not acknowledged the ""deference owed"" to Biden's determination that the committee could access the records, adding: ""Presidents are not kings, and plaintiff is not president.""

The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority that includes three justices appointed by Trump, but it has not always been receptive to his requests. 
In February, the court rejected https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-trump-taxes/u-s-supreme-court-sets-the-stage-for-release-of-trump-tax-returns-idUSKBN2AM1MN his request to block disclosure of his tax records as part of a criminal investigation in New York and in 2020 also turned away attempts by Trump and his allies to overturn https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump/u-s-supreme-court-swiftly-ends-trump-backed-texas-bid-to-upend-election-results-idUSKBN28L2YY that year's presidential election, which he lost to Biden.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday signed into law legislation that bans imports from China's Xinjiang region over concerns about forced labor, the White House said, provoking an angry Chinese condemnation.
The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act is part of the U.S. pushback against Beijing's treatment of the China's Uyghur Muslim minority, which Washington has labeled genocide.
The bill passed Congress this month after lawmakers reached a compromise between House and Senate versions.
Key to the legislation is a ""rebuttable presumption"" that assumes all goods from Xinjiang, where Beijing has established detention camps for Uyghurs and other Muslim groups, are made with forced labor. It bars imports unless it can be proven otherwise.
Some goods - such as cotton, tomatoes, and polysilicon used in solar-panel manufacturing - are designated ""high priority"" for enforcement action.
China denies abuses in Xinjiang, a major cotton producer that also supplies much of the world's materials for solar panels.
Its Washington embassy said the act ""ignores the truth and maliciously slanders the human rights situation in Xinjiang.""
""This is a severe violation of international law and norms of international relations, and a gross interference in China's internal affairs. China strongly condemns and firmly rejects it,"" embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said in an emailed statement.
He said China ""would respond further in light of the development of the situation,"" but did not elaborate. 
Nury Turkel, Uyghur-American vice chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, told Reuters this month the bill's effectiveness would depend on the willingness of Biden's administration to ensure it is effective, especially when companies seek waivers.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Biden's approval of the law  underscored  the ""United States' commitment to combatting forced labor, including in the context of the ongoing genocide in Xinjiang.""
""The State Department  is committed to working  with Congress  and our interagency partners to continue addressing forced labor in Xinjiang  and to strengthen international action against this egregious violation of human rights,"" he said in a statement.
One of the bill's co-authors, Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley, said it was necessary to ""send a resounding and unequivocal message against genocide and slave labor.""
""Now ... we can finally ensure that American consumers and businesses can buy goods without inadvertent complicity in China's horrific human rights abuses,"" he said in a statement.

In its final days in January, the Trump administration announced a ban on all Xinjiang cotton and tomato products.
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency estimated then that about $9 billion of cotton products and $10 million of tomato products were imported from China in the past year.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A New York musician on Thursday accused ""Sex and the City"" actor Chris Noth of groping her nearly 20 years ago and threatening to ruin her career if she told anyone about their encounter. 
Singer-songwriter Lisa Gentile made the accusation following a Dec. 16 Hollywood Reporter story that said two women, whose real names they did not disclose, had accused Noth of sexual assault in 2004 and 2015. 
Noth called those allegations ""categorically untrue."" 
The actor's representatives had no comment on Thursday about the accusations from Gentile, who spoke at a news conference on Zoom with attorney Gloria Allred. 
Gentile said she met Noth in 1998 at a New York City restaurant they frequented. One night in 2002, the actor offered her a ride home and asked to see her apartment.
She said Noth kissed her, ""forcibly pulled"" her against him and began squeezing her breasts. ""I grabbed his hands with my hands and tried to stop it,"" she said.
Gentile said Noth also pushed her hands toward his penis. ""I finally managed to push them away and get out of his grasp and yell, 'No, I don't want this.'""
She said Noth ""stormed"" out and called her the next day, saying he would ""ruin her career"" if she told anyone about what had happened.
Noth, 67, is known for playing Mr. Big, the on-again, off-again romantic partner of Sarah Jessica Parker's Carrie Bradshaw, in the HBO television series and new sequel ""And Just Like That.""

Noth had said the encounters detailed in The Hollywood Reporter were consensual and that ""no always means no - that is a line I did not cross.""
Parker and co-stars Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis said in a statement on Monday that they were ""deeply saddened"" to hear the allegations made against Noth.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia wants to avoid conflict with Ukraine and the West, President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday, but needs an ""immediate"" response from the United States and its allies to its demands for security guarantees.
Ukraine is at the centre of soaring East-West tensions after the United States and Kyiv accused Russia of weighing a new attack on its southern neighbour, an allegation Moscow denies.
Putin was plied with questions about the risk of conflict with Ukraine during his marathon annual news conference, which lasted over four hours.
""This is not our (preferred) choice, we do not want this,"" he told reporters.
Tensions over Ukraine have pushed Moscow's relations with the West to their lowest point since the collapse of the Soviet Union some 30 years ago. 
The United States, the European Union and the Group of Seven have all warned Putin he will face ""massive consequences"" including tough economic sanctions in the event of any new Russian aggression.
Putin said Russia had received a generally positive initial response to security proposals it handed to the United States this month designed to defuse the crisis and that he was hopeful about the prospect for negotiations, which he said would start early next year in Geneva.
But in a separate reply, Putin grew more heated when recalling how NATO had ""brazenly tricked"" Russia with successive waves of expansion since the Cold War, and said Moscow needed an answer urgently.
""You must give us guarantees, and immediately - now,"" he said.
A Biden administration official in a call with reporters said Washington has taken note of the concerns that Moscow has raised and was ready to engage with Russia as soon as early January but a specific date and location were yet to be set.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the administration official repeatedly said the United States would not negotiate publicly and that it would provide its full response to Russian proposals in January.
""I expect we will have our substantive response in those (January) talks.... clearly there are some things that have been proposed that we’ll never agree to. I think the Russians probably know that on some level. I think there are other areas where we may be able to explore what's possible,"" the official said.
Russia rejects Ukrainian and U.S. accusations that it may bepreparing an invasion of Ukraine as early as next month by tensof thousands of Russian troops deployed within reach of theborder of the country which like Russia is a former Soviet republic. It says it needs pledges from the West - including a promisenot to conduct NATO military activity in Eastern Europe -because its security is threatened by Ukraine's growing tieswith the Western alliance as well as the possibility of NATO missiles being deployed against it on Ukrainian territory.
""We just directly posed the question that there should be no further NATO movement to the east. The ball is in their court, they should answer us with something,"" Putin said.
NEW CEASEFIRE
Putin accused Ukraine of breaking its commitments under a 2015 deal meant to halt fighting in its eastern Donbass area between Ukrainian and pro-Russian forces, and refusing to talk to representatives of two breakaway regions there.
Ukraine's foreign ministry said Kyiv, on the contrary, had done ""titanic work"" to bring about a new ceasefire agreement in the east on Wednesday. The Ukrainian military reported, however, that the ""armed formations of the Russian Federation"" had violated the latest truce three times in the course of Thursday, including with mortars and heavy grenade launchers.
There were no casualties from those incidents, it said.
Four sources have told Reuters that Russian mercenaries have deployed to separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine in recent weeks to bolster defences against Ukrainian forces.
Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde (NYSE:LIN), chair of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) which has a monitoring mission in the conflict zone, called the ceasefire a ""small but important first step towards de-escalation along the contact line"".
The Biden administration official also welcomed the move, but called it a ""small step.""
Lithuania's defence chief, Lieutenant General Valdemaras Rupsys, warned that the crisis could spread to Belarus.
""It's possible that in case of escalation (in Ukraine), or, if we see that Belarus could be finally occupied (by Russia), extra NATO troops could be deployed in Lithuania."" he told
Lithuanian news website 15min.
Rupsys said Belarus armed forces were no longer operating independently, while the country's air defence system had been fully integrated with Russian one, and Belarus could be ""fully occupied"" in the near future.
Ukraine rejects Putin's stance that Moscow is just a mediator in the conflict, accusing it of providing direct backing to the separatist side. It has repeatedly offered direct talks with Russia, which Moscow has so far rejected.
Putin made clear he did not see President Volodymr Zelenskiy as a negotiating partner, accusing him of falling under the influence of what he called radical nationalist forces. 
""How can I build a relationship with the current leadership, given what they are doing? It's practically impossible,"" he said.

Many of Russia's security proposals, which would require the withdrawal of U.S. and allied forces from central and eastern European countries that joined NATO after 1997, are seen as non-starters in the West.
But the United States and NATO have said they will discuss the package with Russia early next year, aware that outright rejection could further inflame the crisis over Ukraine.

(Reuters) - Endo International (NASDAQ:ENDP) Plc has agreed to pay $63 million to resolve claims by the state of Texas and local governments that the drugmaker helped fuel the U.S. opioid epidemic, the state's attorney general said on Thursday.
The deal announced by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton marked the latest in a series of settlements that Endo has struck in recent months with state and local governments to resolve similar cases.
More than 3,400 lawsuits largely by state and local governments have been filed nationally accusing the Dublin-based company of contributing to the drug abuse crisis by deceptively marketing pain medications including Opana ER, which it no longer sells.
""This settlement is a necessary step in the right direction, and we will continue to fight to heal our state from this devastating crisis,"" Paxton said in a statement.
Endo did not admit wrongdoing. It said its goal remains to achieve a global opioid settlement but that it is also exploring ""strategic alternatives."" Texas' settlement includes clauses for a potential Endo bankruptcy.
Thousands of lawsuits have been filed seeking to hold drugmakers, drug distributors and pharmacy chains responsible for a drug abuse crisis the U.S. government says has led to hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths over two decades.
Drug distributors McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp and  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH) and the drugmaker Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are pushing to finalize proposed settlements of up to $26 billion to resolve the cases against them.

Endo is not part of the proposed $26 billion deal, but previously agreed to settle lawsuits by states or counties in Alabama, Louisiana, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma and Tennessee for more than $136 million.
In November, a California judge following a trial found Endo and three other drugmakers not liable in a lawsuit by several large counties that accused them of fueling the opioid epidemic, saying they failed to prove their $50 billion case.

U.S. authorities accuse Australian-born Assange, 50, of 18 counts relating to WikiLeaks’ release of vast troves of confidential U.S. military records and diplomatic cables which they said had put lives in danger.
On Dec. 10, Assange moved a step closer to facing criminal charges in the United States after Washington won an appeal over his extradition in London's High Court.
The court said it was satisfied with a package of assurances given by the U.S. about the conditions of Assange's detention, including a pledge not to hold him in a so-called ""ADX"" maximum security prison in Colorado and that he could be transferred to Australia to serve his sentence if convicted.
The Supreme Court is the United Kingdom's final court of appeal.
Assange's fiancée, Stella Moris, said the High Court's ruling raised three points of law of general public importance that have an impact on the procedural and human rights safeguards of a wide range of other types of cases.

""Under English law, in order for the application to have a chance to be considered by the Supreme Court, first the same High Court judges who ordered Julian Assange's extradition must certify that at least one of the Supreme Court appeal grounds is a point of law of general public importance,"" she said in a statement.
She said the application for leave to appeal is currently under consideration by the High Court judges. A decision is not expected before the third week of January.

ATLANTA (Reuters) - Weeks after the 2020 election, a Chicago publicist for hip-hop artist Kanye West traveled to the suburban home of Ruby Freeman, a frightened Georgia election worker who was facing death threats after being falsely accused by former President Donald Trump of manipulating votes. The publicist knocked on the door and offered to help.
The visitor, Trevian Kutti, gave her name but didn’t say she worked for West, a longtime billionaire friend of Trump. She said she was sent by a “high-profile individual,” whom she didn’t identify, to give Freeman an urgent message: confess to Trump’s voter-fraud allegations, or people would come to her home in 48 hours, and she’d go to jail.
Freeman refused. This story of how an associate of a music mogul pressured a 62-year-old temporary election worker at the center of a Trump conspiracy theory is based on previously unreported police recordings and reports, legal filings, and Freeman’s first media interview since she was dragged into Trump’s attempt to reverse his election loss.
Kutti did not respond to requests for comment. Her biography for her work at the Women’s Global Initiative, a business networking group, identifies her as a member of “the Young Black Leadership Council under President Donald Trump.” It notes that in September 2018, she “was secured as publicist to Kanye West” and “now serves as West’s Director of Operations.”
After this story was published, a representative for West said Kutti was not associated with the music star when she met Freeman. Pierre Rougier, a spokesperson for the rapper, said on Sunday: “Trevian Kutti was not associated with Kanye West or any of his enterprises at the times of the facts that are reported in these articles or since these facts occurred.”
Rougier did not answer additional questions about whether Kutti worked for West at other times, or whether West and Kutti knew one another. Before publishing this article, Reuters reached out to a different representative for West but did not get a response.
When Kutti knocked on Freeman's door on Jan. 4, Freeman called 911. By then, Freeman said, she was wary of strangers.
Starting on Dec. 3, Trump and his campaign repeatedly accused Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, of illegally counting phony mail-in ballots after pulling them from mysterious suitcases while working on Election Day at Atlanta’s State Farm Arena. In fact, the “suitcases” were standard ballot containers, and the votes were properly counted, county and state officials quickly confirmed, refuting the fraud claims.
But Trump and his allies continued to accuse Freeman and Moss of election-rigging. The allegations inspired hundreds of threats and harassing messages against them and their family members.
By the time Kutti arrived, Freeman needed help but was cautious and wouldn’t open the door because of the threats, according to Freeman and a police report.
So Freeman asked a neighbor to come over and talk with Kutti, who was with an unidentified male. Like Freeman, Kutti and the other visitor were Black. Kutti told the neighbor that Freeman was in danger and that she’d been sent to provide assistance. Freeman said she was open to meeting them. She asked Cobb County Police to send an officer to keep watch so she could step outside, according to a recording of her 911 call.
“They’re saying that I need help,” Freeman told the dispatcher, referring to the people at her door, “that it’s just a matter of time that they are going to come out for me and my family.” 
An officer arrived and spoke with Kutti, who described herself as a “crisis manager,” according to the police incident report.
Kutti repeated that Freeman “was in danger” and had “48 hours” before “unknown subjects” turned up at her home, the report said. At the officer’s suggestion, the women agreed to meet at a police station. The officer’s report did not identify the man accompanying Kutti.
'YOU’RE A LOOSE END'
Inside the station, Kutti and Freeman met in a corner, according to footage from a body camera worn by an officer present at the meeting. Reuters obtained the video through a public-records request.
“I cannot say what specifically will take place,” Kutti is heard telling Freeman in the recording. “I just know that it will disrupt your freedom,"" she said, ""and the freedom of one or more of your family members.”
“You are a loose end for a party that needs to tidy up,” Kutti continued. She added that “federal people” were involved, without offering specifics.
According to Freeman, Kutti told her that she was going to put a man named “Harrison Ford” on speakerphone. (Freeman said the man on the phone wasn’t the actor by the same name.) Kutti said the man had “authoritative powers to get you protection,” the bodycam footage shows.
At that point, Kutti can be heard asking the officer to give them privacy. The body camera did not capture a clear recording of the conversation that followed after the officer moved away from the two women.
Kutti and the man on the speakerphone, over the next hour, tried to get Freeman to implicate herself in committing voter fraud on Election Day, according to Freeman. Kutti offered legal assistance in exchange, Freeman said.
“If you don't tell everything,” Freeman recalled Kutti saying, “you're going to jail.” 
Growing suspicious, Freeman said she jumped up from her chair and told Kutti: “The devil is a liar,” before calling for an officer.
Later at home, Freeman said, she Googled Kutti’s name and discovered she was a Trump supporter.
Police say they did not investigate the incident further.
West, who changed his name in October to “Ye,” did not respond to requests for comment sent through another publicist who represents him.
Media reports have cited Kutti's association with the rapper since 2018, when she ceased working with R. Kelly, an R&B singer who was convicted in September of racketeering and sex-trafficking charges. Kutti's biography says she is the founder of Trevian Worldwide, a media and entertainment advisory firm with offices in four cities. Among her clients, she says, are boxer Terence Crawford and Queen Rania Al Abdullah of Jordan.
The meeting took place two months after West ended a failed bid for the White House that drew media attention when several publications revealed that allies and supporters of Trump were working on the ground to advance West’s campaign. Some Democrats said they regarded West’s presidential bid as a ruse to siphon off Black votes from Democrat Joe Biden. Groups assisting the rapper’s campaign denied that charge.

On Jan. 5, the day after Freeman's meeting with Kutti, an agent from the Federal Bureau of Investigation called Freeman and urged her to leave her home of 20 years because it wasn’t safe, Freeman said.
The following day, Jan. 6, Kutti’s prediction that people would descend on Freeman’s home in 48 hours proved correct, according to a defamation lawsuit Freeman and Moss filed last week against a far-right news site. Freeman, the lawsuit said, left hours before a mob of angry Trump supporters surrounded her home, shouting through bullhorns.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A former Boston College student pleaded guilty on Thursday to an involuntary manslaughter charge stemming from what prosecutors said was her role in encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through unrelenting verbal, physical and psychological abuse.
Inyoung You, 23, entered the plea in Suffolk County Superior Court in Boston after reaching a plea deal with prosecutors under outgoing District Attorney Rachael Rollins (NYSE:ROL) that could allow her to avoid serving any time in jail.
Judge Robert Ullmann sentenced her to a 2-1/2-year suspended jail sentence and 10 years of probation and barred her from profiting from her high-profile case, prosecutors said. If she complies with her probation terms, she could avoid incarceration.
Prosecutors said You sent 22-year-old Alexander Urtula in the last two months of their 18-month relationship 47,130 text messages, during which she waged a campaign of abuse and told him to kill himself and to ""go die.""
Urtula, of Cedar Grove, New Jersey, leaped to his death from a parking garage in May 2019 hours before his graduation.
The allegations bore similarities to the high-profile Massachusetts case of Michelle Carter https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-texting-idINKBN1ZC1ML, who was convicted in 2017 of involuntary manslaughter and accused of goading her teenage boyfriend into committing suicide with text messages and phone calls.
You had been fighting the charges, and the state's top court was scheduled in February to hear her appeal of a ruling that allowed the 2019 case to move forward. You decided to give that appeal up and accept responsibility instead, her lawyer said.

(Reuters) - 
Jose Castillo pulled his $60,000 worth of  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) shares from his brokerage last summer, even though he had no intention of selling them. 
The 26-year-old information technology worker, who lives in the greater Minneapolis area, is among a growing number of investors in ""meme"" stocks -- shares such as GameStop popular with day traders -- who are withdrawing them from brokerages out of concern the shares will be lent to hedge funds engaging in short-selling.
Castillo pulled the shares out of Fidelity Investments and transferred them to his name using Computershare Ltd, an Australian stock transfer company.
Brokerages have been trying to reassure investors that they only lend shares of customers who are trading on borrowed funds. If they use their own cash, the shares are not loaned. 
Castillo traded GameStop shares without using borrowed funds, but he still feared his shares would be lent. 
He said he read about the ""direct registration"" of shares on Reddit, the social media platform that day traders turned to this year after the meme stock trading frenzy took off. There, more and more investors have announced they have taken their shares out of brokerages through companies such as Computershare, arguing this will help shield them from short-selling. 
""There is so much going on with a stock being shorted, people started to think how can I make sure that I own it and that somebody else isn't doing anything that I don't want with it,"" Castillo said in an interview.
A Fidelity spokesperson declined to comment.
Paul Conn, president of Computershare's global capital markets group, said he saw a wave of direct registration business starting in September that was driven by meme stock investors.
""Retail investors have asked their broker or bank to remove their investments from the 'street name' system and into their own name, directly onto the company's share register,"" Conn said.
Hedge funds short shares by borrowing and selling them, hoping they will drop in value so they can buy them back for less and pocket the difference. Financial market experts said the push towards direct registration was unlikely to curtail this practice, because most hedge funds' collateral comes from prime brokers rather than retail brokerages. 
    ""The shares used to stock-loan from margined retail accounts are minimal compared to the stock-loan inventory from prime brokers and long lenders such as mutual funds and pension funds,"" said research firm S3 Partners managing director Ihor Dusaniwsky. 
Monthly average trading volumes of GameStop shares have dropped since July to their lowest levels for more than a year, according to Refinitiv data. That was about the time that Reddit users began to advocate for the direct registration of shares.
The more shares are transferred out of brokerages into direct registration providers such as Computershare, the fewer of them are available to trade. Joshua Mitts, a securities law professor at Columbia Law School, said removing shares from the market makes them more susceptible to wild price swings, which could end up hurting the retail investors.
""From a psychological point of view, I can see how that resonates. But from an economic point of view it does not make much sense, because with fewer shares available the trading is simply going to become more volatile,"" Mitts said.
A GameStop spokesperson declined to comment. Popular trading apps such as  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) and SoFi Technologies Inc, as well traditional brokerages such as  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp and Fidelity, would lose out if the direct registration trend intensified. They benefited from this year's surge in trading of meme stocks. 
Robinhood and Charles Schwab representatives reiterated that only shares of customers who have borrowed from the brokerages to invest are loaned to hedge funds.
""We have seen an uptick in recent months of clients requesting to hold certain securities outside of Charles Schwab as a means to prevent them from being lent out,"" the brokerage's managing director of trading and education, Jeff Chiappetta, said in a statement. 
Many requests were made by clients who bought shares without borrowing from Charles Schwab and would not have had their shares lent, Chiappetta added.
A SoFi spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
TRADING CURBS
Retail investors started to mistrust brokerages when Robinhood and its peers placed trading restrictions in late January on GameStop's shares. Thousands of investors claimed on social media that the trading curbs were introduced to protect hedge funds that had lost billions of dollars shorting the stock without anticipating a Reddit-fueled rally. 
Commission-free brokerages such as Robinhood rely on payment for order flow, under which they receive fees from market makers for routing trades to them. This business model has also made retail investors suspicious, especially since Citadel Securities, one of Robinhood's market makers, shares common ownership with hedge fund manager Citadel, which engages in short-selling.

Robinhood and Citadel have insisted that the trading restrictions were not put in place to protect hedge funds, but were needed because Robinhood did not have enough collateral to execute customers' trades.
A U.S. judge sided with Robinhood on the matter last month, dismissing an investor lawsuit accusing the trading app and other brokerages of wrongly preventing retail investors from buying fast-rising ""meme stocks"" and triggering a sell-off.

(Reuters) -The jury reached a verdict on Thursday in the manslaughter trial of Kimberly Potter, the former Minnesota police officer who mistook her handgun for her Taser and fatally shot Black motorist Daunte Wright during a traffic stop.
The jury of six men and six women have reached a consensus on whether to convict or acquit Potter and the decision will be read in court between 1:30 and 2:00 p.m. CST (1930 and 2000 GMT), according to a notice from the court.
Potter, 49, has pleaded not guilty to first- and second-degree manslaughter charges, which carry maximum sentences of 15 and 10 years, respectively. Potter said she thought she was drawing her Taser when she shot Wright in the chest with her 9 mm handgun during a traffic stop on April 11.
In their closing arguments on Monday morning, prosecutors said Potter acted recklessly and with ""culpable negligence"" in drawing the wrong weapon, while the defense argued that Wright caused his own death by resisting arrest and attempting to flee, and that Potter was justified in using force.

Potter is white and the shooting of Wright triggered several nights of protests outside the police station in Brooklyn Center, a suburb of Minneapolis, with critics calling it another example of police brutality against Black Americans.
The incident occurred just a few miles north of where Derek Chauvin, a white former Minneapolis police officer, was at the same time standing trial https://www.reuters.com/world/us/jurors-resume-deliberations-derek-chauvin-murder-trial-2021-04-20 in the case of George Floyd, a Black man whose 2020 death during an arrest set off racial justice protests in many U.S. cities.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian mercenaries have deployed to separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine in recent weeks to bolster defences against Ukrainian government forces as tensions between Moscow and the West rise, four sources have told Reuters.
In recent weeks, Russia has moved tens of thousands of regular troops to staging posts closer to Ukraine and followed up by demanding urgent security guarantees from the West designed, Moscow says, to prevent Ukraine and other neighbouring countries being used as a base to attack it.
The West and Ukraine have for their part accused Russia of weighing a fresh attack on its southern neighbour as soon as next month, something Moscow denies. 
Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 and backed pro-Russian separatists who seized a swathe of the industrial Donbass region of eastern Ukraine that same year, and continue to fight Ukrainian government forces there. 
Of four sources, three described their offers from mercenary recruiters to go to Donbass. They said the recruiters did not disclose who they represented. All four sources declined to be named, citing fears for their safety.
Two of the three sources said they had accepted; the third said he had refused.
""There is a full house. They are gathering everybody with combat experience,"" said one of the two who accepted.
He said he had previously fought in Ukraine and Syria for groups of Russian security contractors whose operations have been closely aligned with Russia's strategic interests. He declined to identify the contractors.
The fighter said he was planning to join up with fellow mercenaries on the Russian side of the border with the separatist-held Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine.
The Kremlin says it has nothing to do with private Russian military contractors whose operatives it describes as volunteers with no connection to the state.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: ""It's the first we've heard of this and we don't know how reliable these assertions are.""
Peskov said there were no Russian regular forces or military advisers in eastern Ukraine and never had been, and that Moscow was not considering sending any. Kyiv disputes that and says regular Russian army forces are present. 
SPECIAL TRAINING
Alexander Ivanov, head of the Community of Officers For International Security, a non-governmental group representing Russian contractors in the Central African Republic, said he had ""not a single confirmation"" that any Russian mercenary had been deployed to Ukraine.
Three of the sources said they were not aware of any plans for a new Russian attack on Ukraine or of preparations that would suggest one was coming.
One of the sources, a contractor who has taken part in Russian operations abroad and had already arrived in eastern Ukraine, said the deployment was for defensive purposes. The first mercenary said the same.
Another source said he was not directly involved in the deployment, but was in touch with people on the ground who were undergoing special training. He said the aim of the deployment was what he called sabotage activities to undermine stability in Ukraine. 
The Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) proclaimed its independence from Ukraine in 2014 after separatist fighters took control of a slice of eastern Ukraine. Backed by Russia, its self-proclaimed status has not been recognised internationally. Alexander Borodai, ex-prime minister of the DPR and head of the Union of Donbass Volunteers, said his organisation was not involved in the recruitment of any mercenaries for eastern Ukraine.
Members of his organisation have previously fought in Ukraine and Syria. 
""If and when it's needed, we'll call people - but there has been no call for now,"" said Borodai, who is also a lawmaker for Russia's ruling party, United Russia.

Separatist spokesperson Eduard Basurin said he knew nothing of any recent Russian deployments of security contractors to eastern Ukraine.
Ukraine's military intelligence service declined to comment, while the state security service did not reply to a request for comment.

Certain small businesses set up by couples with two or three children will also enjoy exemptions and cuts in value-added taxes, the Jilin government said in a statement on Thursday.
China's demographic issues are particularly prominent in the three northeastern rustbelt provinces of Jilin, Liaoning and Heilongjiang, as residents ventured to other provinces for work while couples deferred marriage or plans to have a family. 
The region's population fell 10.3% in 2020 compared with 2010. Jilin slumped 12.7%.
Provinces have been given more impetus to tackle demographic issues after China said in May that it would allow married couples to have up to three children instead of two. 
The decision came on the heels of a census findings showing China's population expanded at its weakest pace in the last decade since the 1950s, heightening anxieties that China would grow old before it gets wealthy, as well as drawing criticism authorities had waited too long to tackle a drop-off in births.
Recent official data also showed China had a fertility rate of 1.3 children per woman in 2020, on par with greying societies like Japan and Italy and short of the roughly 2 children needed to replace their parents. 
In October, Anhui in eastern China warned that the number of births in the province may tumble 17.8% this year from 2020, extending a ""cliff-like"" plunge in recent years. 

Jilin also said it will also extend the duration of paid maternity leave to 180 days from 98 days, and a man's nursing leave to 25 days from 15, joining provinces elsewhere in re-writing laws to allow more maternity and paternity leave.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's deployment of tens of thousands of troops to the north, east and south of Ukraine is fuelling fears in Kyiv and Western capitals that Moscow is planning a new attack. Russia denies any such plans.
Western military analysts have suggested that Russia cannot keep such troops deployed where they are indefinitely due to financial and logistical issues and would need to pull them back by the summer of next year.
Estimates of the numbers of new Russian troops moved closer to Ukraine vary from 60,000-90,000, with a U.S. intelligence document suggesting that number could be ramped up to 175,000. 
U.S. officials have warned Russia might launch a new attack against Ukraine as early as the second half of next month when the ground will be harder, making it easier for tanks and other armour to move swiftly.
President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russian and U.S. officials would in January begin discussing Moscow's proposals for security guarantees it wants from the West in order to defuse the current crisis and that he hoped for a positive outcome. 
But what might a Russian attack actually look like and what could it seek to achieve? 
""The current deployments are versatile. They keep Russia's options open and therefore keep the defender guessing,"" said Keir Giles, an Associate Fellow at Chatham House. 
Here are some possible scenarios. 
DONBASS ESCALATION
Heavily armed Russian-backed separatists have controlled a swath of eastern Ukraine since 2014 and continue to exchange fire with Ukrainian government forces on a regular basis despite a 2015 ceasefire that ended major hostilities. 
The conflict in Donbass has killed 15,000 people, Kyiv says. Ukraine has long accused Russia of having regular troops in the region, something Moscow denies. 
Russia in turn has accused Kyiv of harbouring plans to retake the region by force, something Ukraine denies. 
In such a febrile atmosphere the risk of a misunderstanding or unplanned escalation is greater, and Russia could use such an incident as a casus belli. 
One source familiar with the Russian Defence Ministry's thinking said this was the most likely scenario if Moscow decided to attack, but said he was unaware of any such decision. Kyiv could also be provoked into attacking by the separatists who could then ask Russia to officially send in troops to help, the same source said. 
Russian forces could expand the fighting in Donbass to draw Ukraine into a bloody, conventional conflict, said Neil Melvin, director of International Security Studies at RUSI. Moscow could try to seize new Ukrainian coastal areas on the Sea of Azov, creating a land bridge from the Russian city of Rostov through Donbass to Crimea, he said. ""That would put the Ukrainian government under a lot of pressure,"" he said. 
ASSAULT FROM CRIMEA
Russia has brought in new forces to Crimea, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014, and said this week paratroopers would be holding new drills there.
Moscow could launch a new attack on Ukraine from Crimea and seize territory up to the Dnieper River that could serve as a natural barrier against a potential Ukrainian counter-offensive, said Konrad Muzyka, director of the Poland-based Rochan consultancy. 
The operation could begin with massive artillery, missile and air strikes on Ukrainian units in the south. Spetsnaz units might seize bridges and railway junctions, allowing troops and tanks to advance, he said. There are only two roads from Crimea that could be blocked or destroyed, a potential weakness, he said. 
Forces would secure control of a Soviet-era canal that provided Crimea with fresh water supplies until Russia annexed the territory and Ukraine stopped the flow. 
MULTI-FRONT ATTACK
A U.S. intelligence document made public this month said Russia could stage an invasion as soon as January with up to 100 battalion tactical groups (BTGs) or some 175,000 troops. It said about 50 BTGs were already in place to the north and east of Ukraine and in Crimea to the south, creating the possibility of an attack from three sides.
Seizing southern Ukraine could make military sense for Moscow by cutting Kyiv off from the coast and NATO's presence in the Black Sea, Melvin said. Politically, it could play well with Russian nationalists who see the area as the historic ""Novorossiya"" lands or ""New Russia"". 
A multi-front assault might also involve a move into northeastern Ukraine, with Moscow encircling but perhaps not entering major cities where it could get bogged down in urban fighting. Equally, Russian troops could move into Belarus, opening up a northern front for Ukraine that would put Russian forces closer to Kyiv, Giles said. 
""This of course would be the most costly economically, politically and in terms of human lives and that's probably why it's least likely,"" Melvin said of an all-out invasion. 
Analysts said even if it overwhelmed Ukraine's army, which is half the size of its own, Russia could face guerrilla-type resistance that would make it hard to hold on to captured territory. 
MISSILE STRIKES OR CYBER-ATTACK

Giles said some scenarios could involve long-range missile attacks or cyber-attacks targeting critical infrastructure. Missile attacks would take advantage of Ukraine's weaker anti-missile defences. 
""The different scenarios for how exactly Russia might seek to persuade the West to meet its (security) demands by punishing Kyiv don't even necessarily include a land incursion,"" he said.

(Reuters) -Delaware state police have taken into custody five suspects after U.S. Representative Mary Gay Scanlon was robbed of her automobile at gunpoint in a Philadelphia park on Wednesday.
The suspects were located in Scanlon's vehicle and investigation is underway, the police said, adding that additional details will be released once available. 
Scanlon, a Democrat who represents Pennsylvania's 5th Congressional District, was unharmed in the mid-afternoon carjacking which occurred following a meeting of elected officials as she walked to her sport utility vehicle, city police said.
Two armed men believed to be 20 to 30 years of age approached Scanlon and demanded the keys to her vehicle. One man drove off in her car and the other got into a second SUV and followed as the pair made their getaway, according to police.
Several of Scanlon's personal and work-related items were taken in the stolen vehicle, police said.
The Philadelphia Police Department was working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which assumed the lead in the investigation because the victim is a member of Congress, police said.
In a brief statement posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Scanlon, 62, who has served in the House of Representatives since November 2018, thanked the police department for its ""swift response.""
Her spokesperson, Lauren Cox, said the congresswoman had just ended an outdoor meeting with other elected officials at FDR Park in south Philadelphia to discuss plans for future renovations to the area when the carjacking occurred.
""I am relieved that Congresswoman Scanlon was not physically injured, and my thoughts are with her during this difficult time,"" Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said in a statement.

Police declined to say whether Scanlon may have been singled out by the carjackers because she was recognized as a politician or public figure.
Scanlon serves on the House Judiciary and Rules committees, and is vice chair of the House Administration Committee.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A leading Hong Kong university has dismantled and removed a statue from its campus site that for more than two decades has commemorated pro-democracy protesters killed during China's Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989.
The artwork, of anguished human torsos, is one of the few remaining public memorials in the former British colony to remember the bloody crackdown that is a taboo topic in mainland China, where it cannot be publicly commemorated.
Known as the ""Pillar of Shame,"" the statue was a key symbol of the wide-ranging freedoms promised to Hong Kong at its 1997 return to Chinese rule, which differentiated the global financial hub from the rest of China. 
The city has traditionally held the largest annual vigils in the world to commemorate the Tiananmen Square crackdown.
The Council of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) said in an early Thursday statement it made the decision to remove the statue during a Wednesday meeting, ""based on external legal advice and risk assessment for the best interest of the University"". 
""The HKU Council has requested that the statue be put in storage, and that the University should continue to seek legal advice on any appropriate follow up action,"" it said.
Late on Wednesday night, security guards placed yellow barricades around the eight-metre (26-foot) high, two-tonne copper sculpture.
Two Reuters journalists saw scores of workmen in yellow hard hats enter the statue site, which had been draped on all sides by white plastic sheeting and was being guarded by dozens of security personnel. 
Loud noises from power tools and chains emanated from the closed off area for several hours before workmen were seen carrying out the top half of the statue and winching it up on a crane towards a waiting shipping container.
A truck later drove the container away early on Thursday. The site of the statue was covered in white plastic sheets and surrounded by yellow barricades. University staff later placed pots of Poinsettia flowers, a popular Christmas decoration in Hong Kong, around the barricades.
'MEMORIES WRITTEN WITH BLOOD'
Several months ago, the university had sent a legal letter to the custodians of the statue, a group which organised the annual June 4 vigils and has since disbanded amid a national security investigation, asking for its removal. 
A June 4 museum was raided by police during the investigation and shut, and its online version cannot be accessed in Hong Kong.
Danish sculptor Jens Galschiot, who created the statue, said in a statement he was ""totally shocked"" and that he would ""claim compensation for any damage"" to his private property.
Galschiot, who values the statue at around $1.4 million, had offered to take it back to Denmark, but said his presence in Hong Kong was necessary for the complex operation to go well and asked for reassurances he would not be prosecuted.
HKU said in its statement that no party had ever obtained approval to display the statue on its campus and that it had the right to take ""appropriate actions"" any time. It also called the statue ""fragile"" and said it posed ""potential safety issues.""
Tiananmen survivor Wang Dan, who now lives in the United States, condemned the removal in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post as ""an attempt to wipe off history and memories written with blood.""
The campus was quiet early on Thursday, with students on holiday. Some students dropped by the campus overnight after hearing the news.
""The university is a coward to do this at midnight,"" said 19-year-old student surnamed Chan. ""I feel very disappointed as it's a symbol of history.""
Another student surnamed Leung said he was ""heart-broken"" to see the statue ""being cut into pieces"". 
TIANANMEN ERASED
The removal of the statue is the latest step targeting people or organisations affiliated with the sensitive June 4, 1989, date and events to mark it.
Authorities have been clamping down in Hong Kong under a China-imposed national security law that human rights activists say is being used to suppress civil society, jail democracy campaigners and curb basic freedoms.
Authorities say the law has restored order and stability after massive street protests in 2019. They insist freedom of speech and other rights remain intact and that prosecutions are not political.
China has never provided a full account of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. Officials gave a death toll of about 300, but rights groups and witnesses say thousands may have been killed.

""What the Communist Party wants is for all of us to just forget about this (Tiananmen). It's very unfortunate,"" John Burns, a political scientist at the university for over 40 years who had called for the statue to remain, told Reuters.
""They would like it globally to be forgotten.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia reintroduced COVID-19 curbs such as mandated mask wearing indoors, capacity limits and QR code check-ins to cover most of the population on Thursday as daily infections hit a fresh record, fuelled by the highly infectious Omicron variant.
The changes for 17 million people two days before Christmas mark a reversal of the country's plans for a permanent reopening after nearly two years of stop-start lockdowns as the new variant rages through the community in spite of double-vaccination rates of more than 90%.
Hospitalisations and deaths remained low, but the explosion of infections had created a risk of healthcare workers being furloughed by testing positive, the authorities said. 
The country recorded more than 8,200 new cases, by far its biggest daily rise since the pandemic began, from a previous record of 5,600 a day earlier, mostly in the states of New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria.
NSW, home to Sydney and a third of Australia's 25 million population, said it was again making it mandatory to wear masks indoors in public places, while venues were told to limit visitors and re-activate customer check-in via QR code.
""Today's changes are modest, cautious and take a precautionary approach as we move through this holiday period to the end of January,"" New South Wales Premier Dominic Perrottet told reporters.
Until Thursday, Perrottet had urged the state to hold steady on a plan, agreed between state and federal leaders, to remove restrictions once the vaccination rate exceeded a certain level.
Perrottet had steadfastly refused to re-introduce mandated indoor mask wearing, a move called on by the country's doctors and health wrokers, saying it was now time to live with COVID-19.
Victoria, which has nearly the same population, also re-introduced a mask mandate, citing the need to reduce the stress on the health system.
Western Australia, which has had very few cases and is virtually cut off from the rest of the country, ordered the closure of nightclubs and large public events, a ban on dancing and compulsory mask wearing in Perth city, after a French backpacker tested positive, suspected with the Delta variant. The man had attended many clubs and other public indoor places, the authorities said. 
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has vowed never to return to lockdowns, saying Australians must now take personal responsibility for managing their health.
In another change of messaging on Thursday, Perrottet urged people to avoid going for COVID tests if they had received a notification of being a possible contact with an infected person but were not experiencing symptoms. 
With reports of hours-long wait times at testing centres, blamed on people planning to travel interstate before Christmas, Perrottet said that ""this is putting enormous pressure on the system ... but we need to make sure those people who need to get tested get tested in a timely way"".
Most states require travellers to have a negative test result 72 hours before departure in order to be allowed entry, even as Morrison has urged them to ease the testing requirement.
Despite the spike in cases, hospitalisations remain far lower than during the Delta wave, with about 800 people in hospital out of nearly 44,000 active cases.

But only 37 of those are Omicron cases, the health department said in an emailed response. Only one case is in intensive care and no deaths have been reported from the Omrican variant. 
Even amid the Omicron wave, Australia's tally of 273,000 infections and 2,173 deaths is far lower than many countries.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States formally exempted on Wednesday U.S. and U.N. officials doing permitted business with the Taliban from U.S. sanctions to try to maintain the flow of aid to Afghanistan as it sinks deeper into a humanitarian crisis.
It was unclear, however, whether the move would pave the way for proposed U.N. payments of some $6 million to the Islamists for security.
Reuters on Tuesday exclusively reported a U.N. plan to subsidize next year the monthly wages of Taliban-run Interior Ministry personnel who guard U.N. facilities and to pay them monthly food allowances, a proposal that raised questions about whether the payments would violate U.S. sanctions.
The Treasury Department declined to say whether the new license would exempt the proposed U.N. payments from U.S. sanctions on the Taliban.
Having designated the Taliban as a terrorist group for years, Washington has ordered its U.S. assets frozen and barred Americans from dealing with them.
The Treasury on Wednesday issued three general licenses aimed at easing humanitarian aid flows into Afghanistan.
Two of the licenses allow U.S. officials and those of certain international organizations, such as the United Nations, to engage in transactions involving the Taliban or Haqqani Network for official business.
A third license gives non-governmental organizations (NGOs) protection from U.S. sanctions on the Taliban and the Haqqani Network for work on certain activities, including humanitarian projects.
A senior U.S. administration official said the Taliban would have to take action to prevent Afghanistan's economy from contracting further.
""What we can attempt to do, what we're going to work to do, is to mitigate the humanitarian crisis by getting resources to the Afghan people, and these general licenses will allow us to allow organizations that are doing this work to do exactly that,"" the official told reporters.
The top Republican on the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee criticized the decision by Democratic President Joe Biden's administration.
The exemption ""could result in using American taxpayer funds to reward, legitimize and enable the same Taliban that took power by force and has shown no interest in abiding by international norms,"" Representative Michael McCaul said in a statement.
Afghanistan's economic crisis accelerated after the Taliban seized power in August, as the former Western-backed government collapsed and the last U.S. troops withdrew.
The United States and other donors cut financial assistance, and more than $9 billion in Afghanistan's hard currency assets were frozen.
The United Nations says nearly 23 million people – about 55% of the population – are facing extreme levels of hunger, with nearly 9 million at risk of famine as winter takes hold.
""We will continue to support efforts by our partners to scale up assistance and deliver necessary relief during this moment of particular need,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.

In a separate bid to address the crisis, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution exempting donors, aid groups and financial institutions involved in humanitarian assistance from U.N. asset freezes on leaders of the Taliban and associated entities.
The exemption is “solely for the provision of humanitarian assistance and other activities that support basic human needs in Afghanistan which the council will review in one year,” Jeffrey DeLaurentis, a senior adviser to the U.S. mission to the United Nations, said in urging approval of the measure.

620,"<span>Dec 23, 2021 01:19AM ET</span>",,,,,,"SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un praised outgoing Chinese Ambassador Li Jinjun for helping to improve relations between Pyongyang and Beijing, state media reported on Thursday, as the envoy left office after seven years in the post.
Kim's comments were conveyed to Li by Choe Ryong Hae, a top official in the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, state news agency KCNA said. Li also met with North Korean premier Kim Tok Hun, KCNA reported.
""Kim Jong Un highly praised the ambassador for successfully assisting several DPRK-China summit meetings over the past seven years, making much effort to develop the friendly relations between the two parties and the two countries and sharing bitters and sweets with the Korean people,"" Choe told Li, using the initials of North Korea's official name.
Kim is very satisfied that the North Korea-China relationship has entered a ""fresh heyday"" under the leadership of the ruling parties in each country, Choe said.
Li asked Choe to express his gratitude to Kim and congratulated the North Korean people on ""making progress in all fields of socialist construction,"" KCNA said.
China has been North Korea's only major ally since the two signed a treaty in 1961, and international sanctions imposed over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes have made it more dependent than ever on Beijing for trade and other support.
Since Li was appointed in 2015, relations between the two countries have seen major ups and downs.
Kim sent China-North Korea relations to a historical low by prioritising nuclear weapons and missiles development, then harshly criticising Beijing when it supported international sanctions

Starting in 2018, however, Kim managed to quickly repair ties and made his first known international trip as leader to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. Xi later visited Pyongyang, the first by a Chinese leader in 14 years.
Li was one of a diminishing number of foreign diplomats in Pyongyang, as many embassies closed during North Korea's strict anti-pandemic lockdown that blocked the rotation of new staff or ambassadors.

(Reuters) -At least one person was killed and scores were missing after a landslide of dirt and rubble ripped down the waste heap of a Myanmar jade mine, sweeping workers searching for fragments of the gems into a lake and burying them under the debris.
Throngs of their families stood on bare, muddy banks on the shores of the lake, as rescue workers in hard hats and hi-vis jackets searched the water in boats after Wednesday's accident, pictures posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) by the fire department showed.
One body had been recovered from the scene before rescue operations were called off as night fell, and around 50 people still unaccounted for had likely also died, a fire department official at the scene told Reuters.
""It is so difficult to estimate how many were missing, but we estimate at least 50 missing and they have very little chance of survival,"" said Pyae Nyein, captain of Hpakant Township's fire department. 
Kachin Network Development Foundation, a local civil society group involved in the rescue operation, earlier estimated the number missing at around 80 after the waste tore down the slag heap from some 200 feet (60 metres).
Two other rescue workers on the scene also said they feared the missing had likely perished in the latest tragedy to hit Myanmar's poorly regulated jade industry.
The accident took place in the remote Hpakant area of Kachin State at around 4 a.m. (2130 GMT on Tuesday), the fire department said.
Deadly landslides and other accidents are common in Hpakant, the centre of Myanmar's secretive jade industry which draws poor workers from across Myanmar in search of gems mostly for export to China.
In a landslide last weekend, media reported at least six people were killed. 
Economic pressures due to the COVID-19 pandemic have drawn more migrants to the jade mines even as conflict has flared since Myanmar's military seized power in a coup in February. 
The ousted government of Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi had pledged to clean up the industry when it took power in 2016, but activists say little has changed.

In July last year, more than 170 people, many of them migrants, died in one of the worst disasters in Hpakant after mining waste collapsed into a lake.
Myanmar produces 90% of the world's jade. Most comes from Hpakant, where rights groups say mining firms with links to military elites and ethnic armed groups make billions of dollars a year.

(Reuters) - Jurors ended their third day of deliberations on Wednesday without reaching a verdict in the trial of Kimberly Potter, the former Minnesota police officer who mistook her handgun for her Taser and killed Black motorist Daunte Wright.
The jury, which has now deliberated for about 24 hours, had submitted a question to the judge on Tuesday that suggested it was struggling to come to a consensus on whether to convict or acquit Potter on two manslaughter charges.
The panel of six men and six women did not ask any questions on Wednesday, offering no further hints on the contents of its discussions. Jurors will return to the Hennepin County Courthouse in Minneapolis on Thursday morning for a fourth day of deliberations. 
Potter, 49, has pleaded not guilty to first- and second-degree manslaughter charges, which carry maximum sentences of 15 and 10 years, respectively. Potter said she thought she was drawing her Taser when she shot Wright in the chest with her 9 mm handgun during a traffic stop on April 11.
In their closing arguments on Monday morning, prosecutors said Potter acted recklessly and with ""culpable negligence"" in drawing the wrong weapon, while the defense argued that Wright caused his own death by resisting arrest and attempting to flee, and that Potter was justified in using force.

Potter is white and the shooting of Wright triggered several nights of protests outside the police station in Brooklyn Center, a suburb of Minneapolis, with critics calling it another example of police brutality against Black Americans.
The incident occurred just a few miles north of where Derek Chauvin, a white former Minneapolis police officer, was at the same time standing trial in the case of George Floyd, a Black man whose 2020 death during an arrest set off racial justice protests in many U.S. cities. Chauvin was convicted of murder.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Several hundred migrants that left southern Mexico in a caravan two months ago began boarding buses to northern Mexico on Wednesday, after reaching a deal with the Mexican government that will bring them closer to their dream of reaching the United States. 
The caravan left the southern city of Tapachula near Mexico's border with Guatemala in late October with some 3,000 people, but hundreds gave up the tough journey as they trekked on foot for weeks.
A smaller group, including toddlers, slowly made its way to Mexico City, where activist Irineo Mujica pressed government officials to provide visas and buses to bring the migrants further north.
""A new chapter is beginning, in which this caravan today will split up and dissolve so that each person can follow his dreams individually,"" Mujica told cheering migrants at the shelter where they have camped out, in a video on social media.
A memo from the government's Interior Ministry and National Migration Institute said they will bring migrants on buses to the northern cities of Hermosillo, Monterrey and Chihuahua, as well as Ciudad Juarez, just opposite Texas.
Migration officials in recent weeks also offered migrants buses out of Tapachula after thousands of arrivals overwhelmed the migration processing system there, leaving them stranded for months without jobs or lodging.
Many of the migrants in Mexico City, including Central Americans, Cubans and Haitians, said they saw the caravan as their only way to cross Mexico without risking deportation.
Henry Portillo, 23, said he joined the caravan to escape poverty in Honduras, where he has worked in farming since he was six years old and only learned to read and write as a teenager.

His wife, who made the trek with him, is due to soon give birth to a baby boy.
""My mission is the United States,"" Portillo said. ""I want him to study, and not be like me.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The judge in British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell's sex abuse trial urged jurors on Wednesday to be cautious of a surge in COVID-19 cases as they broke for a long weekend, after deliberating for two full days without reaching a verdict.
Maxwell, 59, is accused of recruiting and grooming https://www.reuters.com/world/us/closing-arguments-ghislaine-maxwells-sex-abuse-trial-kick-off-2021-12-20 four teenage girls for the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, her ex-boyfriend and employer, between 1994 and 2004. She has pleaded not guilty to six counts of sex trafficking and other crimes. Epstein killed himself in 2019 in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges.
U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan dismissed jurors for the long weekend for Saturday's Christmas holiday - which is also Maxwell's 60th birthday. Maxwell is detained at Brooklyn's notorious Metropolitan Detention Center https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ghislaine-maxwell-sex-crimes-trial-highlights-conditions-brooklyn-jail-2021-11-18, where she has said her cell has been plagued by vermin and the scent of raw sewage.
Deliberations are set to resume on Monday.
""Please stay safe over the long weekend,"" Nathan told jurors. ""Obviously we've got the variant and I need all of you here and healthy on Monday.""
Along with the cases of movie producer Harvey Weinstein and singer R. Kelly, Maxwell's case is among the highest-profile trials to take place in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which encouraged women to speak out about sexual abuse by famous and powerful people. 
The Manhattan federal court jury requested transcripts of the testimony of four women who said Maxwell played a crucial role in their abuse by Epstein. That suggests they are scrutinizing their accounts carefully https://www.reuters.com/world/us/what-is-known-so-far-about-deliberations-ghislaine-maxwells-sex-abuse-trial-2021-12-22, after Maxwell's lawyers focused their defense on challenging the accusers' credibility.
To be sure, the requests do not indicate what jurors are thinking regarding Maxwell's guilt or innocence.
On Tuesday, they asked to review the testimony of three of the women: Jane, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer. Maxwell's lawyers had questioned the women aggressively about why their stories appeared to shift over the years. 
On Wednesday, the jury asked to read transcripts of the accounts of the fourth accuser, a woman testifying under the pseudonym Kate, and Juan Alessi, the former house manager at Epstein's Palm Beach, Florida, estate who said he saw Jane at the property. 
Kate said she was 17 in 1994 when Maxwell introduced her to Epstein in London. Kate testified that she then had several sexual encounters with Epstein. 

Nathan instructed the jury that Kate was above the age of consent at the time, so she was not the victim of any crime. But the judge said they could consider her testimony if they found it useful in evaluating the charges against Maxwell. 
Deliberations began late on Monday afternoon following a three-week trial.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A member of the far-right Proud Boys group pleaded guilty on Wednesday to conspiracy and obstructing Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's election on Jan. 6.
Matthew Greene, 34, of Syracuse, New York, could face up to five years in prison for the conspiracy charge and 20 years for obstructing an official proceeding. 
He is the first self-described member of the Proud Boys to plead guilty for his role during the attack, which disrupted a joint session of Congress meeting to formally certify the November 2020 presidential election victory of Democrat Biden over then-President Donald Trump, a Republican.
More than 700 people so far have been arrested for their role in attacking the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. 
As of Dec. 6, 145 defendants had pleaded guilty, although the vast majority of them involved much less serious misdemeanor charges.
About 40 defendants, many of whom belong to or are affiliated with far-right groups including the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers and the Three Percenters, have been charged with conspiring either to impede Congress or law enforcement officials protecting the Capitol.
Greene, who joined the Central New York chapter of the Proud Boys in December 2020, was indicted along with fellow Proud Boy members William Pepe, 32, of Beacon, New York, and Dominic Pezzola, 44, of Rochester, New York. His alleged co-conspirators have pleaded not guilty to charges. 
Greene and the other Proud Boys are accused of advancing into a restricted area at the Capitol after police barricades were torn down. 
He witnessed other rioters assault police but nevertheless continued to follow others where he helped to remove additional police barricades.
According to the superseding indictment, Greene and his co-defendants later celebrated the storming of the Capitol. 

""I'm good, we took the capital,"" he wrote to one associate on an encrypted messaging app.
He remains detained pending his sentencing on March 10, 2022.

Conservators in a laboratory at the state's Department of Historic Resources opened the lead box after hours of meticulous scraping and drilling to reveal the almanac, two other unidentified books and a cloth envelope with unknown contents. A coin was stuck to one of the books.
Historians had thought the box might be a time capsule containing about 60 objects that was placed in the statue pedestal on Oct. 27, 1887, according to a news release from Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's office. But Wednesday's discovery seemed to indicate it was a different capsule.
The memorial to Lee was erected on Monument Avenue in Richmond, the capital of the pro-slavery Confederacy, a group of breakaway Southern states that fought against Union forces in the 1861-65 Civil War.
The six-story-tall statue was removed from its base in September after a year-long legal battle. The monument, which activists say glorified the South's racist past, had been the focus of protests against racial injustice. Advocates of keeping Confederate monuments and symbols say they honor the Southern heritage and the sacrifices made by those who fought during the war. 
Northam, a Democrat, announced plans to remove the statue in June 2020, 10 days after a white Minneapolis policeman killed George Floyd, who was Black, sparking nationwide protests.

Crews discovered the time capsule on Friday while disassembling the pedestal that formerly held the statue. 
The lead box was found about 20 feet (6 m) above the ground, encased in a 1,500-pound (680-kg) block of granite, according to the Department of Historic Resources.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The congressional committee probing the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday requested an interview with ardent Donald Trump supporter Jim Jordan, the second sitting U.S. representative drawn into the probe.
The House of Representatives Select Committee on Jan. 6 asked Jordan, a Republican, to disclose conversations he had with the former president on the day that Trump's supporters attacked the Capitol, trying to stop Congress from formally certifying Democrat Joe Biden's presidential election victory.
Jordan's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Select Committee is trying to establish who communicated with Trump while thousands of his supporters attacked police, smashing windows and sending members of Congress and then-Vice President Mike Pence running for their lives.
""Despite the urgent requests that the President speak and instruct the rioters to leave, President Trump did not make such a statement for multiple hours,"" said Representative Bennie Thompson, the committee's chairman, in the letter making the request. 
The request comes two days after a similar one to Republican Representative Scott Perry.
Perry said on Tuesday he would not respond to the queries, and a committee spokesman suggested it would consider issuing a subpoena.
Multiple people close to Trump, including conservative media hosts, urged him during the riot to make a televised speech telling his supporters to stop the attack. Trump waited hours before releasing a prerecorded message.
House Republicans earlier this year nominated Jordan to sit on the committee probing the riot, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected the choice, citing his support of Trump's false claims of election fraud.

Two Republicans, Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, sit on the committee probing the riot.
The committee has issued more than 50 subpoenas and heard from more than 300 witnesses in its investigation of the attack.

""I was delighted that participants expressed their strong determination to fully adhere to the Measures to Strengthen the Ceasefire agreement of 22 July 2020,"" the Special Representative of the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office in Ukraine and in the Trilateral Contact Group (TCG), Ambassador Mikko Kinnunen said in a statement. 
Kyiv and Moscow have blamed each other in recent months for violation of a previous ceasefire, which had been agreed in July 2020 and helped significantly reduce the number of casualties last year.
""This (new agreement) is of utmost significance for the people living on both sides of the contact line,"" Kinnunen said. 

He said that according to the special monitoring mission reports the security situation along the contact line remained volatile, with about five times more ceasefire violations on average per day recorded in December 2021 compared with December 2020.
Major combat between Ukrainian troops and Russian-backed forces ended with an agreement reached in the Belarus capital Minsk in 2015 with the mediation of Germany and France, but sporadic clashes still regularly kill civilians and soldiers in a military conflict which has lasted since 2014.

""I think it's safe to say that the American people will hear from him on that day,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at a news briefing.
Details have not been finalized, she said.
Four people died on the day of the riot, and one Capitol police officer died the next day of injuries sustained while defending Congress. Hundreds of police were injured during the multi-hour onslaught by Trump supporters, and four officers have since taken their own lives.
Former Republican President Trump has been accused of fomenting the rioters, who marched to the Capitol after hearing him speak outside the White House. Trump told the crowd of supporters he would never concede the Nov. 3 election and urged them to ""fight like hell"" before they went to the Capitol, where lawmakers were preparing to certify Democrat Biden's victory.

More than 700 people have been arrested in connection with the assault on the Capitol. A congressional select committee is investigating the attack, including Trump's actions and his efforts to overturn the results of the election.
Trump said on Tuesday he would hold a news conference on Jan. 6 to discuss the events of that day.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) -The United States and its partners are discussing time frames for nuclear diplomacy with Iran, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Wednesday, adding that current talks with Tehran may be exhausted within weeks.
""We're not circling a date on the calendar in public, but I can tell you that behind closed doors we are talking about time frames and they are not long,"" he told reporters during a visit to Israel.
Asked to elaborate on the timeline, Sullivan said: ""Weeks.""
Israel has long hinted that if it thinks diplomacy, now focused on slow-moving talks between Iran and world powers in Vienna on reviving a 2015 nuclear deal, has hit a dead end, it could resort to pre-emptive strikes against its sworn enemy.
But there have been doubts among security experts whether Israel has the military capability to effectively halt Iran's programme on its own, or if Washington would back its moves.
Sullivan said the United States continues to believe that ""diplomacy, deterrence and pressure"" remain the best way to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.
Sullivan said that in his meeting with Israeli leaders in Jerusalem, ""we discussed means of ensuring that we are holding the international community together to maintain the pressure on Iran to live up to its obligations and to come back into compliance"" with the 2015 pact.
""And in terms of operational matters, I think those are best left for private diplomatic discussions between the United States and Israel,"" he added.
Earlier, Sullivan told Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett that the United States and Israel are at a ""critical juncture"" for forging a shared security strategy.
In public remarks after his own talks with Sullivan, Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz called on world powers not to allow Iran to play for time at the nuclear negotiations, in recess at Iran's request and expected to resume next week.
Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons, saying it only wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.
Washington has been spearheading efforts to revive the 2015 deal in which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of sanctions.
Israel bitterly opposed the deal and former U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States in 2018. 
Sullivan, sent by President Joe Biden on a 30-hour visit to Jerusalem and the occupied Palestinian territories, updated Israel on developments in the Vienna talks and the two sides exchanged views on the way forward, the White House said.

Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said he and Sullivan discussed ""the strategy for combating Iran's nuclear programme and the way in which the U.S. and Israel cooperate on this issue"".
Since Trump pulled out of the agreement, Iran has breached the pact with advances in sensitive areas such as uranium enrichment. Sullivan called the U.S. withdrawal ""catastrophic"".

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York City neighborhood is fully turned on for Christmas, drawing throngs to its annual light show, even as the Omicron variant puts a damper on celebrations.
Residents in Brooklyn's Dyker Heights vie to outdo each other with colorful displays of snowmen, nativity scenes, reindeer, nutcrackers, candy canes and light-studded trees and bushes.
For some visitors, the experience was just what the doctor ordered.
""It was important for me to see the Christmas spirit,"" said French tourist Virginie Issautier. ""And here is the best thing, in the best fashion to see it. And after all these months and years of disease, of COVID, it's a new hope to see all these lights.""
The lack of snow did not faze visitors from more tropical areas.

Dyker Heights' seasonal lights took off in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001 and stayed on even at the height of the pandemic in 2020, residents said. The light show has become a pit stop for tour buses along with the likes of Rockefeller Center and Times Square.
""It's weird watching it explode to the popularity that it is now,"" said Frank Wilders from the neighborhood, with his son Ryan by his side. ""Now that I am able to share it with my kids, especially my son, makes it even better.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jurors deliberating in the sexual abuse trial of British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell in New York have so far sent several notes to U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan. To be sure, the notes do not reveal what jurors are thinking, but they do provide a glimpse into some of the evidence they have been discussing since late Monday afternoon:
ACCUSER CAROLYN'S TALKS WITH THE FBI
Jurors on Tuesday asked Nathan for details about the testimony of Carolyn, the first name of a woman who said late financier Jeffrey Epstein, Maxwell's employer and ex-boyfriend, began abusing her when she was 14 in 2002. Carolyn testified that Maxwell once touched her nude body while Carolyn prepared to give Epstein an erotic massage.
Defense attorney Jeffrey Pagliuca sought to undermine Carolyn's credibility, pressing her about why she did not mention Maxwell in a 2007 conversation with the FBI. 
Jurors asked the judge to see the record of the FBI conversation. Nathan told the jury it was not in evidence, but they could review the trial transcript. 
""In this entire first discussion with the FBI in 2007, it's true that you never said the name Ghislaine Maxwell once, correct?"" Pagliuca asked Carolyn, according to the transcript.
""Yes, because it's not who we were talking about,"" Carolyn replied. 
Carolyn's case underlies the sex trafficking charge, the most serious count Maxwell faces with a prison sentence of up to 40 years. Maxwell, 59, pleaded not guilty to six counts of sex trafficking and other crimes.
WHAT RELEVANCE DOES ANNIE FARMER'S TESTIMONY HAVE?
Jurors also asked Nathan whether they could consider the testimony of accuser Annie Farmer in weighing whether Maxwell conspired to lure underage girls to travel for illegal sex acts or conspired to transport them for illegal sex acts, two of the six counts. 
Farmer, 42, testified that Maxwell touched her breasts while giving her a massage during a visit to Epstein's New Mexico ranch in 1996 when Farmer was 16. 
Nathan informed the jury that because Farmer was above the age of consent in New Mexico at that time, any encounters she described were not considered ""illegal sex acts."" 

That meant Farmer could not be considered a victim of being transported or lured to travel for sex by Maxwell - two of the other counts.
However, Nathan told the jury they could still consider Farmer's testimony in determining whether Maxwell conspired to violate those laws.

""We do have some data suggesting that rates of hospitalisation are lower,"" WHO's technical lead on COVID-19, Maria van Kerkhove, said in a briefing with media.
But she cautioned against drawing conclusions from the early data because ""we have not seen this variant circulate long enough in populations around the world, certainly in vulnerable populations"".
She said the data on the new variant, first identified in southern Africa and Hong Kong in November, was still ""messy"" as countries reported its arrival and spread.
""We have been asking people to be cautious, we have been asking countries to be cautious, and to really think, especially as these holidays are coming up.""
A South African study published on Wednesday suggested that those infected with Omicron were significantly less likely to end up in hospital than those with Delta, although the authors said some of that was probably due to high levels of immunity in the population.

The head of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, urged countries to learn from the past two years of the pandemic, calling again for greater vaccine equity, in the hope of next year ending a pandemic that has killed over 5.6 million people around the world.
""As we approach the new year, we must all learn the painful lessons this year has taught us. 2022 must be the end of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" he said.

ISTANBUL/ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - U.S. authorities have taken issue with Turkey over its sales of armed drones to Ethiopia, where two sources familiar with the matter said there was mounting evidence the government had used the weapons against rebel fighters.
Washington has ""profound humanitarian concerns"" over the sales, which could contravene U.S. restrictions on arms to Addis Ababa, a senior Western official said. 
The year-long war between Ethiopia's government and the leadership of the northern Tigray region, among Africa's bloodiest conflicts, has killed thousands of civilians and displaced millions. 
A State Department spokesman said U.S. Horn of Africa envoy Jeffrey Feltman ""raised reports of armed drone use in Ethiopia and the attendant risk of civilian harm"" during a visit to Turkey last week. 
A senior Turkish official said Washington conveyed its discomfort at a few meetings, while Ethiopia's military and government did not respond to detailed requests for comment. 
Turkey, which is selling drones to several countries in Europe, Africa and Asia, has dismissed criticism that it plays a destabilising role in Africa and has said it is in touch with all sides in Ethiopia to urge negotiations. 
Last week the United Nations agreed to set up an independent investigation into rights abuses in Ethiopia, a move strongly opposed by its government.
Tigrayan rebel forces said on Monday they were withdrawing from some northern regions after government advances and, in a letter to the U.N., called for a no-fly zone for drones and other hostile aircraft over Tigray.
The U.S. State Department clamped down in May on exports of defence products for Ethiopia's armed forces.
In September, the White House authorised sanctions on those engaged, even indirectly, in policies that threaten stability, expand the crisis or disrupt humanitarian assistance there, though there has been no indication of any such imminent action against Turkey.
The U.S. Treasury, which has broad economic sanctions authority under that executive order, declined to comment on whether sanctions could apply to Turkey.
The senior Turkish official said the foreign ministry examined how the drone sales might impact U.S. foreign policy as part of 2022 budget planning. 
""The United States has conveyed its discomfort with Turkey's drone sales ...but Turkey will continue to follow the policies it set in this area,"" the person told Reuters.
A second senior Turkish official, from the defence ministry, said Ankara had no intention of meddling in any country's domestic affairs. 
Turkish defence exports to Ethiopia surged to almost $95 million in the first 11 months of 2021, from virtually nothing last year, according to Exporters' Assembly data. 
DRONES IN ACTION
Ethiopian government soldiers interviewed by Reuters near Gashena, a hillside town close to the war's front, said a recent government offensive succeeded following an influx of reinforcements and the use of drones and airstrikes to target Tigrayan positions. 
A Reuters team spotted destroyed tanks and armoured anti-aircraft trucks there. 
A foreign military official based in Ethiopia said satellite imagery and other evidence gave ""clear indications"" that drones were being used, and estimated up to 20 were operating. It was unclear how many might be Turkish-made.
""Surveillance drones are having a greater impact ...and being very helpful,"" the person said, adding the guerrilla-warfare nature of the conflict made armed drones less useful.
Asked whether foreign countries had also supplied drone operators, the official said: ""I know Turkish personnel were here at one point.""
Turkish and Ethiopian officials have not publicly confirmed the drones sale, which Reuters first reported in October, and Turkey's foreign ministry did not respond to a request for further details.
It said last week that U.S. envoy Feltman and Deputy Foreign Minister Sedat Onal had discussed developments in Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan. 
Ethiopia has also bought drones from the United Arab Emirates, which did not respond to a request for comment about possible U.S. concerns. Feltman was also scheduled to visit the UAE earlier this month. 
TURKISH EXPANSION
Under President Tayyip Erdogan, Ankara has poured military equipment into Africa and the Middle East, including training of armed forces in Somalia, where it has a base. 
The Turkish military used its Bayraktar TB2 drones last year with success in Syria, Libya and Nagorno-Karabakh, prompting interest from buyers globally in a market led by U.S., Chinese and Israeli manufacturers. 
In October, a Turkish foreign ministry spokesman said Ethiopia was free to procure drones from anywhere. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said last week that engagement with Africa was based on mutual benefit. 
NATO allies Washington and Ankara have strained ties over several issues including the Turkish purchase of Russian missile defences, and U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in northern Syria.

The State Department spokesperson said Feltman had underscored that ""now is the time for all outside actors to press for negotiations and end the war"" in Ethiopia.
The Western official, who requested anonymity, said Ankara had responded to U.S. concerns by saying it attaches humanitarian provisions to the Ethiopia deal and requires signed undertakings outlining how drones will be used.

TRIPOLI/BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Libya's parliament said Friday's planned presidential election would not go ahead, leaving the internationally-backed peace process in chaos and the fate of the interim government in doubt. 
The electoral commission proposed pushing back the voting date by a month, confirming a delay that had been widely expected amid disputes over the rules, including the eligibility of several divisive candidates. 
Disagreements showed the limitations of a winner-takes-all presidential vote involving candidates viewed as unacceptable in large parts of the country, including the son of the late ruler Muammar Gaddafi and a military leader who assaulted Tripoli. 
At stake is a peace process that had been seen as the best hope in years of bringing an end to the decade of chaos and violence that has engulfed Libya since a NATO-backed uprising ousted Gaddafi in 2011. 
Large numbers of Libyans had already registered for voting cards for the election in what politicians on all sides in Libya have said is a sign of strong popular desire for a vote. The U.S. ambassador on Wednesday said work towards elections should remain a priority.
However, with mobilisations in Tripoli and other western areas by armed groups, the collapse of the electoral process risks aggravating local disputes and triggering a new round of fighting.
Disputes over the path forward could also undo the wider U.N.-backed peace process between Libya's main eastern and western camps that have maintained a ceasefire since last year. 
Renewed conflict could also lead to more frequent or extensive shutdowns in oil output by armed groups, hitting state finances. A group this week closed down three major fields. 
Some figures in the east have warned of a new breakaway government that would return Libya to the division between warring administrations that lasted from the last election in 2014 until the installation of the current interim government. 
Turkey and regional adversaries that backed opposing sides in Libya have improved relations recently, easing the risk they will drive a return to war through local proxies, analysts say. 
Factions, candidates and foreign powers have been talking behind the scenes about whether an election can still take place with a short delay or whether a longer postponement is necessary to reach agreement on the legal basis of the vote. 
Meanwhile, the status of the interim government that was installed in March as part of the same peace process is also at risk, with the eastern-based parliament having withdrawn confidence from it in September. 
DISPUTES
The electoral committee's statement on Wednesday added that the government's mandate would expire on Friday. However, other main factions and political institutions may stick with the government, which is also recognised by the United Nations.
The election was originally called through a U.N.-backed roadmap that envisaged simultaneous parliamentary and presidential elections on Dec. 24 - Libya's national day. 
However, there was no agreement on the constitutional basis for the election or on the rules among the fragmented political institutions. 
A law issued in September by parliament speaker Aguila Saleh that split the presidential and parliamentary votes to different dates was rejected by other leading factions but still formed the basis of the push towards elections. 
With little agreement on the rules, or on who would enforce them or adjudicate disputes, the entry of highly divisive candidates into the presidential race triggered the collapse of the process. 
Electoral commission head Emad Sayeh said in a statement that the process had run into trouble because the rules were not adequate to handle appeals and disputes over eligibility.
The three most prominent candidates, eastern commander Khalifa Haftar, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi and interim Prime Minister Abdulhamid al-Dbeibah, were also the three most divisive. 

Haftar was unacceptable to many in western Libya after his 2019-20 assault on Tripoli that smashed parts of the capital. Gaddafi was convicted of war crimes by a Tripoli court and is detested by many of those who fought in the 2011 revolt. 
Dbeibah had promised when he was installed as premier that he would not run in an election and his continued work as prime minister in the run-up to the vote led many of his rivals to say he had an unfair advantage.

NFTs, which are digitised ownership certificates, have gained in popularity globally this year, featuring as everything from an autographed tweet to paintings.
But China's relationship with the technology behind them, which also backs cryptocurrencies, is a complex one. 
The issuance by the state news agency would indicate official support for NFTs, but party mouthpiece People's Daily last month criticised them as a possible fraud.
Xinhua said in an official notice that it planned to issue the 11 photos, all taken by journalists during 2021, free of charge online at 8 p.m. (1200GMT) on Dec. 24, each in a limited edition of 10,000 copies.
The collection, including a photo commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party, would ""imprint digital memories into the metaverse"", it added.
The Securities Times, also an official media outlet, has previously called the metaverse, a shared space based on virtual reality technologies, ""a grand and illusionary concept.""
Chinese companies, notably unlisted Ant Group, are already exploring or applying NFT technologies. And most Chinese metaverse-related stocks rose on Wednesday following the Xinhua announcement.

Augmented reality firm Goertek jumped 6% while online gaming company Perfect World gained nearly 4%. Chinese social media giant Tencent Holdings said last month it expects Beijing to allow the metaverse to operate in China, provided it fall into line with Chinese rules. 
Cryptocurrencies including bitcoin are seen as the natural means of payment in the metaverse, but Beijing has clamped down on them as possible conduits for illegal capital flows and money laundering, and ordered a blanket ban of trading and mining of digital currencies in September.

(Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that Russia had no room to retreat in a standoff with the United States over Ukraine and would be forced into a tough response unless the West dropped its ""aggressive line"".
Putin addressed his remarks to military officials as Russia pressed for an urgent U.S. and NATO reply to proposals it made last week for a binding set of security guarantees from the West.
""What the U.S. is doing in Ukraine is at our doorstep... And they should understand that we have nowhere further to retreat to. Do they think we’ll just watch idly?"" Putin said.
""If the aggressive line of our Western colleagues continues, we will take adequate military-technical response measures and react harshly to unfriendly steps.""
Putin did not spell out the nature of these measures but his phrasing mirrored that used previously by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who has warned that Russia may redeploy intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe in response to what it regards as NATO plans to do the same.
Russia rejects Ukrainian and U.S. accusations that it may be preparing an invasion of Ukraine as early as next month by tens of thousands of Russian troops poised within reach of the border.
It says it needs pledges from the West - including a promise not to conduct NATO military activity in Eastern Europe - because its security is threatened by Ukraine's growing ties with the Western alliance and the possibility of NATO missiles being deployed against it on Ukrainian territory.
Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskiy said on Friday that he was ready to meet Russia for ""direct talks, tête-à-tête, we don't mind in what format"". But Moscow has said repeatedly it sees no point in such a meeting without clarity on what the agenda would be. 
A Kremlin statement said Putin stressed in a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron that reconvening the four-power Normandy group - which brings together the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany - would require concrete steps by Kyiv to implement existing peace agreements. Ukraine says it is Russia and its proxies who are refusing to engage.
With Western powers keen to show Russia they are solid in their support of Ukraine and NATO, Germany's new Chancellor Olaf Scholz also spoke by phone with Putin.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday ruled out an in-person meeting between Biden and Putin for now. ""I think we have to see if, in the first instance, there’s any progress diplomatically,"" Blinken said in a news briefing when asked if an in-person summit could happen to try to ease the tensions. 
U.S. SUPPLIES
Karen Donfried, the U.S. State Department's top diplomat for Europe, said in a briefing with reporters that Washington was prepared to engage with Moscow via three channels - bilaterally, through the NATO-Russia Council that last met in 2019, and at the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
In the meantime, she said, the United States would continue to send military equipment and supplies to Ukraine in the weeks and months ahead - something that has antagonised Moscow.
""As President (Joe) Biden has told President Putin, should Russia further invade Ukraine, we will provide additional defensive materials to the Ukrainians above and beyond that which we are already in the process of providing,"" she said.
Washington is considering tough export control measures to disrupt Russia's economy if Putin invades Ukraine, a Biden administration official told Reuters, and the measures would be discussed in a meeting of senior officials on Tuesday.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance would seek meaningful discussions with Moscow early next year.
Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu alleged that more than 120 U.S. private military contractors were active in eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian troops have been fighting Russian-backed separatists since 2014, and said they were preparing a ""provocation"" involving chemical substances.
He offered no evidence in support of the claim, which Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) described as ""completely false"".
Throughout the crisis, Russia has veered between harsh rhetoric, calls for dialogue and dire warnings, with Ryabkov repeatedly comparing the situation to the 1962 Cuban missile crisis when the world stood on the brink of nuclear war.

Many of Moscow's demands, including for a block on NATO membership for Ukraine and the withdrawal of U.S. and other allied troops from Eastern Europe, are seen as non-starters by Washington and its partners.
But rejecting them out of hand would risk closing off any space for dialogue and further fuelling the crisis.

MANILA (Reuters) -Philippine officials and residents of areas that bore the brunt of Typhoon Rai pleaded for food, water, and shelter on Tuesday as damaged roads, flooding, and severed power and communication lines hampered relief efforts.
Rai struck last Thursday, the strongest typhoon to hit the archipelago this year, killing nearly 400 people and affecting 1.8 million, displacing 630,000 of them, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. 
""Our food supply is running low. Maybe, in a few days, we will totally run out,"" said Fely Pedrablanca mayor of Tubajon town on Dinagat Island. 
The area, facing the Pacific Ocean, was devastated by the typhoon and she said only nine out of more than 2,000 homes in her town were left standing.
The coast guard has deployed vessels to help in relief work and in trying to reach areas still cut-off, while the Philippine Red Cross (PRC) planned to ferry people to safety, including foreign tourists stranded on the holiday island of Siargao.
""We're fighting a tremendous disaster. It's Haiyan all over again,"" PRC Chairman Richard Gordon told Reuters, referring to one of the most powerful tropical cyclones ever recorded, which killed 6,300 people in the Philippines in 2013..
In the province of Southern Leyte, evacuation centres were also destroyed, said Roger Mercado, acting chief of the public works agency, as he appealed for tents and construction material.
Damage to infrastructure in Southern Leyte, where residents were also in desperate need of food and water, could reach 3 billion pesos ($60.14 million), Mercado told DZMM radio.
At least 375 people were killed and 56 are missing. More than 500 were injured, police said on Tuesday. 
""The government prepositioned food and non-food items but they are not enough because many are in need,"" Danilo Atienza, Southern Leyte's disaster chief, told Reuters.
President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday ordered state agencies to restore power and communications as he promised 10 billion pesos ($200 million) for recovery efforts.

(Reuters) -The National Hockey League will not send its players to compete in the men's ice hockey tournament at the Beijing Winter Olympics due to COVID-19 concerns as the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the coronavirus spreads globally, ESPN reported on Tuesday. 
The NHL agreed last September to pause its regular season so the world's top players could compete in Beijing with the caveat it could withdraw if COVID-19 disruptions forced games to be rescheduled during the Olympics window.
That had begun looking increasingly likely in recent days with the NHL being forced to postpone 50 games in Canada and the United States after a growing number of players entered COVID-19 protocols while Omicron tore through professional sports leagues with fully vaccinated players testing positive. 
The NHL did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ESPN said a formal announcement on opting out of the Beijing Games was expected within the next 24 hours.
The NHL had until Jan. 10 to withdraw from the Feb. 4-20 Beijing Olympics without financial penalty.
Players had mostly been eager to return to the largest international stage. But concerns that a positive test in China could lead to a 21-day quarantine and delay returning to their families and NHL clubs had dampened that enthusiasm for some.
""Obviously, it's unsettling if that were to be the case when you go over there,"" Edmonton Oilers star Connor McDavid, who was expected to be a top player for Canada, said last week. 
NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said in early December that the decision on participating in Beijing would ultimately come down to the players, but added that the league's concerns had ""only been magnified"" by the COVID-19 outbreak.
The NHL, unhappy over the prospect of interrupting a regular season to send their most valuable assets overseas where they could get hurt, ended a run of participation in five consecutive Winter Olympics when it decided not to go to Pyeongchang in 2018.
The presence of NHL players at the Olympics made the men's ice hockey tournament one of the marquee events of the global sporting showcase.
Countries will now have to quickly put a Plan B in place.
For Canada and the United States, which would have sent teams stocked completely with NHL players, that will mean a top to bottom overhaul cobbling together a roster from other leagues.
Other countries, such as Sweden, Finland, Russia, Germany and Czech Republic, will also have big holes to fill with many of their best players also in the NHL. 
USA Hockey, when announcing Bill Guerin as general manager of the men's team last week, said they were preparing for the possibility of an NHL pullout.

""Plan B is we have to look at what our pool options are,"" said USA Hockey assistant executive director John Vanbiesbrouck. ""Last time through there were some American Hockey League players available, players playing in Europe and the NCAA.
""That would likely be our player pool.""

(Reuters) -The jury asked a question on Tuesday that suggested a possible deadlock in the trial of Kimberly Potter, the former Minnesota police officer who mistook her handgun for her Taser and fatally shot Black motorist Daunte Wright during a traffic stop.
""If the jury cannot reach consensus, what is the guidance around how long and what steps should be taken?"" the jury asked in its question, which was read in open court by Judge Regina Chu at about 4:30 p.m. CST.
Chu re-read an instruction encouraging the 12 jurors to discuss the case ""with a view toward reaching an agreement"" and told them to continue deliberations, which they did until just after 6 p.m. before retiring without a verdict for a second day.
""You should not hesitate to re-examine your views and change your opinion if you become convinced they are erroneous,"" Chu told the six men and six women, who have deliberated for 14 hours. ""But you should not surrender your honest opinion simply because other jurors disagree or merely to reach a verdict.""
The jury also asked for permission to remove the zip-ties securing Potter's 9 mm handgun, the weapon she fired at Wright, so that they could handle it. Chu granted the request while reassuring the jury that it was not loaded.
Potter, 49, has pleaded not guilty to first- and second-degree manslaughter charges, which carry maximum sentences of 15 and 10 years, respectively. Potter said she thought she was drawing her Taser when she shot Wright in the chest with her gun on April 11.
In their closing arguments on Monday morning, prosecutors said Potter acted recklessly and with ""culpable negligence"" in drawing the wrong weapon, while the defense argued that Wright caused his own death by resisting arrest and attempting to flee, and that Potter was justified in using force.

Potter is white and the shooting of Wright triggered several nights of protests outside the police station in Brooklyn Center, with critics calling it another example of police brutality against Black Americans. 
The incident occurred just a few miles north of where Derek Chauvin, a white former Minneapolis police officer, was at the same time standing trial https://www.reuters.com/world/us/jurors-resume-deliberations-derek-chauvin-murder-trial-2021-04-20 in the case of George Floyd, a Black man whose 2020 death during an arrest set off racial justice protests in many U.S. cities.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Michael Flynn, a longtime adviser to former President Donald Trump, on Tuesday sued the congressional committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in hopes of blocking it from obtaining his phone records.
Flynn alleged in a lawsuit, filed in federal court in Florida, that a subpoena issued to him by the House of Representatives Jan. 6 Select Committee was too broad in scope and punishes him for constitutionally protected speech he engaged in as a private citizen.
Flynn also alleged in the lawsuit that the congressional committee ""has no authority to conduct business because it is not a duly constituted Select Committee.""
An appeals court has rejected that argument, ruling on Dec. 9 that the committee was valid and entitled to see White House records Trump has tried to shield from public view.
The committee issued a subpoena to Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, in November, seeking testimony and documents about a ""command center"" at Washington's Willard Hotel set up to steer efforts to deny Democrat Joe Biden his November 2020 election victory. Trump falsely claims he lost the election because of widespread electoral fraud.
In the weeks after the election, Flynn urged Trump to deploy the military to overturn the results and gave speeches sowing doubts about the vote.
A spokesman for the Jan. 6 Select Committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Flynn's lawsuit is the latest in a flood of litigation by targets of the committee seeking to prevent it from enforcing its subpoenas for testimony or communications.
Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist and founder of the right-wing website Infowars, filed a similar case on Monday.
Trump has similarly sought to block the committee from obtaining his White House records from Jan. 6 and the preceding days, asserting they are protected by a legal doctrine called executive privilege. An appeals court rejected Trump's arguments last week. He is expected to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Flynn was charged as part of former U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian influence on the 2016 U.S. presidential election won by Trump.
Flynn, a retired Army general, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about interactions he had with Russia’s ambassador to the United States in January 2017. He later sought to withdraw the plea, arguing that prosecutors duped him into a plea agreement. Trump later pardoned him.

MAYFIELD, Ky. (Reuters) -As survivors of the tornado that tore through Mayfield, Kentucky, last week come to grips with their losses, the Humane Society is focused on other victims: cats and dogs still inside destroyed houses or hiding under porches and bushes. 
Early on Thursday, several four-wheel-drive vehicles of the Humane Society of the United States left a budget motel in nearby Calvert City and headed off in three directions, looking for strays and hoping to reunite them with their owners.
""Sadly, a lot of people have died in their homes here, and what they're going to end up doing is just bulldozing this place,"" said Kitty Block, the Humane Society's chief executive, who headed to Mayfield. 
""Cats are hiding in the eaves. They are under the porches. They are inside the houses. They are under the bush in the back, and we just want to get them before this happens."" 
The Mayfield Graves County Animal Shelter is currently housing nearly 70 animals and has room for more, the shelter's president, David Spalding, said. 
Block said the goal is to bring the pets to the shelter and treat them as necessary, and then ""get the message out that people can come, get their animals, find their animals, and be reunited with them."" 
Block spoke as she tried to woo a gray, white and red cat to the safety of a carrier. Other Humane Society workers and volunteers tried to coax out scared cats from bushes and undergrowth, affixing notices to destroyed houses of pets found.
Some pet owners have had happy reunions. 

Mayfield resident Bill Kenney, held his 8-month-old dog, Sid. 
""I missed my boy,"" Kenney said. ""He's like my sidekick here ... He goes everywhere I go, you know, he gets mad if I don't take him.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United Nations is proposing to pay nearly $6 million for protection in Afghanistan to Taliban-run Interior Ministry personnel, whose chief is under U.N. and U.S. sanctions and wanted by the FBI, according to a U.N. document and a source familiar with the matter.
The proposed funds would be paid next year mostly to subsidize the monthly wages of Taliban fighters guarding U.N. facilities and to provide them a monthly food allowance under an expansion of an accord with the former U.S.-backed Afghan government, the document reviewed by Reuters shows.
The plan underscores the persisting insecurity in Afghanistan following the Islamist Taliban’s takeover in August as the last U.S. troops left, as well as a dire shortage of funds hampering the new government because of a cutoff of international financial aid.
“The United Nations has a duty as an employer to reinforce and, where necessary, supplement the capacity of host states in circumstances where U.N. personnel work in areas of insecurity,” deputy U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq wrote in an email in response to Reuters’ questions about the proposed payments. He did not dispute the contents of the document.
Several experts said the proposed payments raise questions about whether they would violate U.S. and U.N. sanctions on the Taliban and their top leaders, and whether the United Nations could detect diversions of funds for other purposes.
“What it comes down to is there is no proper oversight,” said the source, who requested anonymity to discuss the matter.
Those under sanctions include deputy Taliban leader and Interior Ministry chief Sirajuddin Haqqani. He heads the Haqqani network, a faction blamed for some of the bloodiest attacks over 20 years of war. The United States, which says Haqqani is close to al Qaeda, is offering a $10 million reward for information leading to his arrest.
The U.N. Assistance Mission to Afghanistan (UNAMA) budget is “currently under review,” but the mission “maintains full compliance with all U.N. sanctions regimes,” Haq said.
He did not respond to a question about whether the proposed payments would breach U.S. sanctions.
A U.S. Treasury Department official said the Taliban and the Haqqani network remain designated under the U.S. government's counterterrorism sanctions program and that unauthorized people supporting them ""risk exposure to U.S. sanctions.""
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, declined to comment on the U.N. proposal.
FOOD SHORTAGES, ECONOMIC COLLAPSE
The proposed funds would bolster the cash-strapped Taliban’s ability to protect some 3,500 U.N. personnel in Kabul and 10 field offices. Many are striving to help the country of 39 million cope with food shortages amid a public services breakdown and an economic collapse accelerated by the evaporation of foreign financial aid.
The U.N. document says most of a proposed $4 million security budget for 2022 shared by the 20 U.N. agencies operating in Afghanistan “constitutes payments in respect of supplementing host nation resources for their primary responsibility to protect U.N. personnel (as foreseen in our SOMA).”
SOMA stands for a Status of Mission Agreement with the former government. Under the accord, the United Nations subsidized the costs to the Interior Ministry of police who protected U.N. facilities, the source said.
Most of the $4 million would boost the wages of individual Taliban members by $275-to-$319 per month and provide a monthly food allowance of $90 per person, “which was previously only paid in the regions but now also extended to Kabul,” the document said.
UNAMA would spend an additional nearly $2 million “for similar services” outside the security budget shared with other U.N. agencies, the document added.

“The U.N. system provided allowances to personnel who perform supplementary security services which are critical to the safety of personnel and compounds, as well as operations and movements in the country,” said Haq.
Such funds, he said, are paid directly to recipients ""and not through the de facto authorities.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jury deliberations in British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell's sex abuse trial came to a close without a verdict on Tuesday, as jurors reviewed testimony of women who said she set them up for abuse by financier Jeffrey Epstein when they were teenagers.
Maxwell, 59, is accused of recruiting and grooming four teenage girls for Epstein to abuse between 1994 and 2004. She has pleaded not guilty to six counts of sex trafficking and other crimes.
The jury in federal court in Manhattan began deliberations late Monday afternoon after three weeks of emotional testimony from the four accusers. Deliberations will resume on Wednesday.
Maxwell's attorneys have argued that she is being scapegoated for Epstein's crimes because the globetrotting investor - Maxwell's former boyfriend and employer - killed himself in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 at the age of 66 while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges.
Along with the trials of movie producer Harvey Weinstein and singer R. Kelly, Maxwell's case is among the highest-profile trials to take place in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which encouraged women to speak out about sexual abuse by famous and powerful people.
In a note sent to U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan on Tuesday, the jury asked to review a 2007 FBI deposition referenced during the testimony of Carolyn, the first name of a woman who said Maxwell set her up for abuse by Epstein when she was 14 years old.
Carolyn's case underlies the sex trafficking charge against Maxwell, since she said Maxwell sometimes handed her cash after she gave Epstein erotic massages and sent her gifts from out of state. The sex trafficking charge carries a maximum prison sentence of 40 years, the heaviest of the six counts. 
Federal law bars recruiting or transporting anyone under 18 to participate in a ""commercial sex act."" The trafficking charge does not require the child to be transported across state lines.
Maxwell defense attorney Jeffrey Pagliuca questioned Carolyn about the deposition on cross-examination, asking why her testimony in some instances differed from what she had earlier told law enforcement.
The deposition itself was never entered into evidence as part of the trial, so Nathan said she could not provide them with it. She said they can review the transcript of Carolyn's testimony about the deposition.
Maxwell's attorneys have focused their defense largely on undermining the credibility of the accusers, arguing that their memories have faded over time and they are motivated by money to cooperate with prosecutors. All four women received million-dollar payouts from a victims' compensation fund run by Epstein's estate. 

Jurors also asked whether they could consider the testimony of Annie Farmer, who said Maxwell touched her bare breasts at Epstein's New Mexico ranch when she was 16. Maxwell is charged with two counts of conspiring to help underage girls travel for the purpose of ""illegal sex acts."" The judge told jurors they could consider Farmer's testimony. 
Maxwell could be sentenced to up to 70 years in prison for the six counts she faces. She also faces two perjury counts that will be tried separately.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) -Sudan Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok has told a group of national political and intellectual figures that he intends to resign in the coming hours, two sources close to Hamdok told Reuters on Tuesday.
Hamdok was reinstated on Nov. 21 following a coup a month earlier that saw the military take power and end a transitional partnership with political parties.
While several political forces took part in drafting the agreement, according to the sources, it has faced widespread criticism from parties and the general public.
On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of people marched on the presidential palace rejecting both military rule and Hamdok's decision to return, which he had said he took to preserve gains made during the transition and to end bloodshed.
Some 47 people have died in crackdowns on protests against military rule, including two as a result of Saturday's protest. The United Nations said on Tuesday that it had received reports of rape or gang rape of 13 women and girls.
Sources close to Hamdok had said previously he would only remain in office if he had political support and if the agreement was enforced. It called on the military to release political detainees, protect freedom of expression and allow Hamdok to independently appoint a new cabinet.

In a statement over the weekend, Hamdok said Sudan was inching towards ""the abyss,"" blaming political intransigence and lack of consensus on a new political agreement.
The group Hamdok spoke to on Tuesday called on him to stay in his position but he insisted he would leave, the sources added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Scott Perry, an ally of former President Donald Trump, said on Tuesday he would not provide information requested by a congressional committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Perry, a Pennsylvania Republican, said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) he would not sit for an interview with the panel and would not provide electronic communications it had requested, including messages he exchanged with Trump's lawyers.
""I stand with immense respect for our Constitution, the rule of law, and the Americans I represent who know that this entity is illegitimate, and not duly constituted under the rules of the U.S. House of Representatives,"" Perry said.
An appeals court ruled earlier this month that the Jan. 6 Select Committee was legitimate and entitled to see White House records Trump has tried to shield from public view.
Perry and other Republican lawmakers met with Trump ahead of the attack on the Capitol and discussed how they could block the formal certification by Congress on Jan. 6 of Democrat Joe Biden's November 2020 election victory.
A spokesman for the committee said in a statement that Perry has information ""directly relevant"" to its investigation"" and suggested it would consider issuing a subpoena to the congressman.
""The Select Committee prefers to gather relevant evidence from members cooperatively, but if members with directly relevant information decline to cooperate and instead endeavor to cover up, the Select Committee will consider seeking such information using other tools,"" the spokesman said.
On Monday, the committee publicly released a letter to Perry that asked him to cooperate voluntarily.

The committee said it was seeking information about Trump's attempts to oust Jeffrey Rosen, the acting head of the U.S. Justice Department during the closing weeks of his presidency, and replace him with Jeffrey Clark, an official at the time who tried to help Trump overturn his election defeat.
The letter marked a new phase for the committee's lawmakers, who have so far not publicly demanded information from Republican colleagues who supported Trump's efforts to retain power after losing to Biden. Trump has falsely claimed his loss resulted from widespread voter fraud.

NAIROBI (Reuters) -The Ethiopian government said on Tuesday the army was clearing rebellious Tigrayan forces from the northern Amhara and Afar regions, dismissing Tigrayan statements that their forces were retreating voluntarily to create an ""opening for peace"".
Thousands of civilians have been killed as a result of the 13-month-old conflict while about 400,000 are facing famine conditions in Tigray and 9.4 million people need food aid across northern Ethiopia.
The TPLF, the party that controls the Tigray region in the far north of Ethiopia and is at war with the government, had announced its withdrawal from neighbouring Amhara and Afar on Monday.
""As we have seen in recent weeks, the national defence forces together with allied forces from the Afar region and the Amhara region have made considerable gains in reversing the occupation by TPLF of many Amhara and Afar towns,"" government spokeswoman Billene Seyoum told a news conference. 
""These gains have been made in very heavy battles that have been undertaken over the past weeks, the most recent being the full clearing of TPLF from North Wollo Zone and liberating its strategic capital Woldiya,"" Billene said.
She said the national armed forces were still in the process of clearing TPLF forces from pockets within the two regions.
TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael has written to the United Nations calling for a no-fly zone for hostile aircraft over Tigray, arms embargoes on Ethiopia and its ally Eritrea, and a U.N. mechanism to verify that external armed forces have left Tigray.
Asked about Debretsion's letter, Billene did not comment in detail on its contents.
""I don't even know if such an illegitimate entity can send such a letter to a United Nations body,"" she said. The Ethiopian government labels the TPLF a terrorist organisation.
TRADING BLAME
The federal government has in recent months detained thousands https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/ethiopia-conflict-marked-by-violations-all-sides-mass-arrests-un-2021-12-17 of people, many of whom are ethnic Tigrayans, on suspicion of supporting the TPLF.
On Tuesday, Abraha Desta, one of the highest-profile Tigrayans arrested, announced his release from prison in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post. 
Abraha, a former member of the federally-appointed Tigrayan administration and a critic of the TPLF, was arrested https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-conflict-idAFKBN2GS0FQ in October after publicly denouncing arrests of Tigrayans.
The two sides blame each other for the war. 
The TPLF accuses Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed of wanting to centralise power at the expense of the regions, which he denies. 
Abiy, whose appointment in 2018 brought nearly three decades of TPLF dominance over Ethiopia to an end, says the TPLF wanted to hang onto central power. The Tigrayan leadership denies this.
Asked about allegations by Tigrayan media and a TPLF spokesman of air strikes by the Ethiopian military on civilian targets within Tigray over the past two days, Billene said the government did not attack civilians. 
She said air strikes were conducted only to ""neutralise identified terrorist cells and terrorist hideouts"".
TPLF spokesman Getachew Reda had said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that 30 people had been killed in a drone attack on a public transport minibus in the town of Mlazat, and similar strikes had taken place in Maychew and Korem.
Tigrai TV, a media outlet run by the Tigray state government, broadcast videos and footage of what it said was the aftermath of the alleged air strikes. Several dead bodies could be seen lying in pools of blood and injured people were interviewed. Reuters could not independently verify the material.

Redwan Hussein, State Minister for Foreign Affairs, said the TPLF was presenting a ""misleading narrative"" and was on the back foot, according to a social media post by his ministry.
""However, the government does not have an intention to pursue an all-out military operation in Tigray, chasing the terrorist group in every village and town but it will make sure that the TPLF will not be able to wage an attack anymore,"" the post said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The leading Republican vying to unseat an Arizona Democrat in a crucial U.S. Senate race next year gets heated when he talks about Democratic President Joe Biden's ""failed border policies,"" occasionally throwing in expletives when decrying their alleged financial cost and what he says is the threat they pose to Americans.
The candidate, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, is betting the message will resonate with voters Republicans need to mobilize in the 2022 elections to change the balance of power in Congress.
""Immigration in and of itself is not a bad thing,"" Brnovich, himself the son of immigrants from Montenegro and Croatia, said in an interview with Reuters. ""But illegal immigration undermines the rule of law.""
Echoing some of the hard-line rhetoric of Republican former President Donald Trump, Brnovich supports the construction of a wall between the United States and Mexico and tougher immigration enforcement. 
His opponent, incumbent Democratic Senator Mark Kelly, is a well-known retired astronaut and husband to former U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords. His seat has been rated as vulnerable by election trackers after he won a close victory in a special election last year.
While the Arizona race is one of the most high-profile contests where immigration has emerged as an attack line for Republicans, the strategy is not limited to the Southwestern border state.
Republicans across the country are targeting the policy vulnerability for Biden, whose administration has struggled to curb record arrests of migrants on the U.S.-Mexico border. Some critics say he has failed to find a consistent approach on immigration, keeping some Trump policies in place while rolling back others, inviting attacks on both the right and left.
""We have gone heavily on offense,"" said Emma Vaughn, national press secretary for the Republican National Committee, which plays a central role in shaping the party's election strategy. ""Immigration doesn't just impact border towns; it impacts Americans everywhere."" 
Reuters polling backs up the idea that immigration is a prime motivator for likely Republican voters. A Reuters opinion survey in October of nearly 1,600 Republicans found immigration topped the list of issues that would make them ""very angry"" if the government acted in opposition to their views. 
Democrats, on the other hand, did not rank immigration in any of their top 12 anger-provoking issues. Researchers have found anger is more likely to encourage voting compared with other emotions. 
Heading into the November 2022 midterm elections, Democrats currently control both chambers of Congress by a narrow margin. The Senate has 48 Democrats and two independents who caucus with them to 50 Republicans, giving Vice President Kamala Harris a tie-breaking vote. In the House of Representatives, Democrats hold 221 seats to the Republicans' 213, with one seat vacant.
As attorney general, Brnovich filed four lawsuits this year challenging Biden's immigration actions, including a lawsuit that said Biden failed to assess the environmental effects of illegal immigration, such as pollution and stress on natural resources. 
Democrat Kelly has also criticized Biden's approach to the southern border at times, most recently sending a Dec. 16 letter to the president calling on him to close existing gaps in Arizona's border barriers. At the same time, Kelly urged Biden to restore areas damaged by Trump-era border wall construction.
""Your administration must make it a priority to address these issues,"" Kelly wrote. ""Arizona deserves better from Washington on the border.""
On Monday, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it would take steps to close ""small gaps"" remaining from previous border wall construction and perform other construction work, with a focus on a stretch of the border in Arizona.
Kelly's tougher border stance contrasts with most of his Democratic colleagues, who disdain Trump's immigration tactics, a reflection of the threat immigration-focused attacks on the incumbent could pose in the race.
INTERNAL TENSIONS
Biden took office in January promising to roll back almost all of Trump's restrictive immigration measures, but he has so far been stymied by internal tensions within his administration and ongoing court battles.
Some of the friction has been evident on the president's Domestic Policy Council. The council's director, Susan Rice, has tended to push for tougher enforcement at the border, clashing at times with her own more liberal staffers, according to a former U.S. official with knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Immigrant advocates who joined the Biden administration have been disappointed with his approach to the border, including the mass deportation of Haitians caught trying to cross from Mexico, a second official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.
Some Biden officials have acknowledged internally that large numbers of migrants arriving at the border could derail the president's broader immigration agenda, Reuters reported earlier this year.
Biden has left in place a sweeping Trump-era border expulsion policy implemented when the COVID-19 pandemic began, and was ordered by a court to resurrect another hard-line Trump program that forces migrants to wait in Mexico as their U.S. asylum cases proceed -- both moves that dismayed advocates.
A White House spokesperson said all Biden staffers were ""committed to implementing a fair and orderly immigration system,"" and denied any tensions between Susan Rice and Domestic Policy Council staffers.
The spokesperson, who spoke on condition of anonymity, added that Republicans also focused heavily on immigration before the 2018 midterm elections, only to lose the House to the Democrats.
PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS
Republicans and their allies are already airing some immigration-themed commercials, a likely preview of what Democrats can expect in the coming year.
The Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that favors lower levels of immigration, launched a six-figure digital ad campaign in Texas and Arizona last week that attacks Biden and other Democrats and depicts the border as lawless.
""President Biden sabotaged the nation's immigration controls,"" a man's voice says in the ad over video of migrants clashing with authorities in Mexico. The ad will air in Spanish and English in an attempt to reach Hispanic voters.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, both Republicans facing re-election in 2022, have emerged as leading critics of Biden's immigration policies. Abbott and DeSantis are viewed as possible Republican presidential candidates in 2024, and the White House is closely following their gubernatorial races, according to a third U.S. official. 
The Biden administration is working with allies outside of government to neutralize the criticism, said the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal plans. 
One strategy is to remind voters of Trump's ""zero tolerance"" border policy, which led to the separation of thousands of migrant children from their parents and drew international condemnation, the official said. 
The White House is also banking that its efforts to speed up asylum processing at the southern border - a much-touted plan that has yet to produce significant results - will gain steam next year.
But many pro-immigrant activists remain unconvinced, including Jennifer Quigley, senior director for government affairs with the pro-immigrant organization Human Rights First.

""They do not view humane and lawful entry for asylum seekers as a winning thing politically,"" Quigley said.

(Reuters) - A member of Donald Trump’s 2020 presidential campaign arranged and participated in a meeting at which a Georgia election worker says she was pressed by a Chicago publicist to falsely admit voting fraud.
The revelation directly ties a senior figure in the former president’s political operation to an extraordinary late-night Jan. 4 meeting in which a $16-an-hour election worker faced pressure to implicate herself in a baseless conspiracy theory, stoked by Trump himself, as he sought to overturn his Georgia election loss.
Harrison Floyd - who was executive director of a national campaign coalition called Black Voices for Trump in 2020 - told Reuters on Monday that he asked Chicago publicist Trevian Kutti to visit the Atlanta area to speak with 62-year-old temporary election worker Ruby Freeman. Floyd said he then participated by phone in a meeting Kutti held with Freeman at a police station in Georgia’s Cobb County.
Kutti was accompanied at the meeting by another Trump campaign figure: Garrison Douglas, who was a Georgia leader in Black Voices for Trump during the campaign and now works as a Republican Party spokesperson in the state. Douglas confirmed to Reuters that he was present at the meeting. Floyd said he recruited Douglas and Kutti because he was unable to attend himself.
In a statement to Reuters on Monday, Douglas said: ""On January 4th, I was unemployed and received a call to serve as a volunteer driver, as I had many times in the past. I had no involvement in the meeting beyond the task of driving.""
In a phone interview Monday, Floyd said he was asked if he’d be willing to set up the meeting by a man he described as a chaplain with “connections” in federal law enforcement. He declined to name the clergyman or to detail what those connections involved. Floyd said the chaplain, who is white, wanted him to approach Freeman, who is Black, to discuss an immunity deal for her, out of a belief that she would not trust a white stranger. Floyd, Douglas and Kutti are Black.
Floyd said that he had left his role in the Trump campaign before the Jan. 4 meeting. Trump himself “never asked me to go” to Georgia, he said, and board members of the Black Voices for Trump group “had no involvement in this.”
Floyd said he arranged the meeting in an effort to help Freeman. He said he himself believed she was seeking assistance, including immunity from prosecution over claims from the Trump camp that she had committed voting fraud.
Freeman, through a spokesperson, said she never reached out to anyone to seek immunity. Her lawyer, Von DuBose, declined to comment further.
A former Justice Department official in Georgia confirmed that state and federal investigators concluded in December 2020 that there was no evidence Freeman committed fraud. As a result, the department never considered offering her immunity, said the official, who had direct knowledge of a Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry into Trump’s Georgia election-fraud claims.
Floyd did not directly answer when asked whether Freeman requested immunity at the meeting. He said Freeman wasn’t willing to “put anything down on paper,” so he had nothing to “run up the flagpole,” referring to his more senior contacts in Trump’s political operation. 
Asked if he told Freeman that he was a Trump campaign official, Floyd said: “I’m pretty certain that I made it clear.” He referred to a comment by Kutti, captured on police bodycam video, telling Freeman that “federal people” were involved in offering her help. 
“Who was the current president at that time? President Trump,” said Floyd. “If she’s there saying, I’m here to connect you with federal people, well, that’s people in the Trump administration.”
Freeman told Reuters in a previous interview that she did not know Kutti was a Trump supporter until after the meeting at the police station, when Freeman researched the publicist online. 
Kutti and her lawyer, Robert Barker, did not respond to requests for comment. In an Instagram post last Monday, Kutti denied pressuring Freeman to falsely admit fraud.
A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to requests for comment for this story. The Republican National Committee, where Douglas is now employed, did not respond to a request for comment.
The involvement of Trump campaign figures in the meeting with Freeman highlights the aggressive and unusual steps taken by backers of the former president to help reverse his loss in the once-reliably Republican state.
Beginning on Dec. 3 last year, Trump and his allies falsely claimed that video of vote-counting at Atlanta’s State Farm Arena proved that Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, another Fulton County election worker, committed election fraud. They alleged the mother and daughter illegally tabulated mysterious ballots from a suitcase multiple times to create 18,000 fraudulent votes - enough to cause Trump to lose the Georgia election. State and county officials quickly disproved that allegation. The false claims sparked months of death threats and other harassment by Trump supporters toward Freeman and her daughter.
The district attorney in Fulton County, where Freeman worked on the ballot count, is conducting a criminal investigation into Trump’s alleged interference in Georgia’s election. The district attorney, Fani Willis, has said the probe would examine a now-famous call in which Trump pressed Georgia officials to “find” him enough votes to overturn his loss in the state. On the call, Trump singled out Freeman by name 18 times, calling her a “professional vote scammer,” a “hustler” and a “known political operative” who “stuffed the ballot boxes.”
That call came two days before Floyd dispatched Kutti and Douglas to visit Freeman.
BLACK VOICES FOR TRUMP
Floyd and Douglas were part of a small but active base of Black political support for Trump. Kutti has worked as a publicist in the music industry and managed the campaign for an unsuccessful Georgia Republican candidate for the U.S. House.
Floyd launched a bid for Georgia’s 7th District congressional seat in May 2019 but dropped out less than a month later. That July, he joined Black Voices for Trump as executive director, a position he says he held until Nov. 15, 2020.
Trump campaign records show that Black Voices for Trump was an official part of the campaign, much like other groups that target specific voters, such as Latinos for Trump and Evangelicals for Trump. The group’s archived website said the site was ""Paid for by Donald J. Trump for President, Inc.""
Floyd told Reuters that he had an office in the same building as the core campaign in Virginia, where he said he worked on the same floor as the most senior staffers of Trump’s political operation. 
Trump called out Floyd for applause while speaking before a crowd at a rally for the group at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta in November 2019. “We’re delighted to be joined by Harrison Floyd of our Black Voices coalition,” the president said. “Where’s Harrison? Where’s Harrison?”
Since April of this year, Floyd has worked as a managing partner at Commonwealth Holdings International, a Washington-based investment firm that specializes in helping clients invest in cryptocurrencies, according to the firm’s webpage and Floyd’s LinkedIn page.
Floyd served in the U.S. Marine Corps for nearly 11 years ending in 2014, including stints as a machine gunner, a martial arts trainer, and an information operations planner, his LinkedIn page shows.
As a spokesperson for the Republican National Committee (RNC), the party’s national organizing body, Douglas regularly posts blog items on the RNC website. He has used that platform to applaud a Republican-backed election law in Georgia that the Justice Department says is “discriminatory” against Black voters. Douglas countered in an RNC blog post that the law, passed this year, “makes it easier to vote and harder to cheat.”
During the 2020 campaign, Douglas was active in Georgia for Black Voices for Trump, according to a Reuters review of his social media posts between August and November of last year. At an event on Aug. 1, 2020, promoted by the Fayette County Republican Party, Douglas introduced himself as the “regional engagement coordinator for Trump victory” and said he was helping to lead Black Voices for Trump in Georgia.
Kutti, a Chicago publicist, has said her clients have included rap star Kanye West; a West spokesperson says Kutti wasn’t associated with the rapper at the time of the Freeman meeting.
Kutti was a supporter of Black Voices for Trump, her social media history shows. On Dec. 5, 2020, more than a month after Election Day, she posted a photo on Instagram showing her holding a “Black Voices for Trump” sign at a Trump rally in Valdosta, Georgia. At that rally, Trump played snippets of the State Farm Arena surveillance video of Freeman and her daughter on a giant screen. The footage, he said, revealed a “crime” committed by “Democrat workers.”
TIME RUNNING OUT BEFORE JAN. 6
The mission for which Floyd recruited Kutti and Douglas came on Jan. 4 - at the height of Trump’s efforts to overturn the November election, and two days before the U.S. Capitol riots on Jan. 6, the day that Congress met to certify Democrat Joe Biden’s election victory.
In an interview with Reuters, Floyd described a fevered atmosphere of allegations involving Freeman in December. At the time, Trump and his lawyers were continuing to press false claims that the election had been stolen.
Floyd said he received calls from “across the country” from people saying they could arrange immunity for Freeman if she were to confess to election fraud. “Some of those phone calls that I mentioned were from lawyers and attorneys who were saying, ‘Is this true? Does she really want immunity?’” He declined to identify those attorneys.
Asked how he knew Freeman wanted immunity, Floyd cited “a lot of chatter and discussion on the internet … People were saying, ‘We're hearing that this is what she wanted,’” he said. “But no one could confirm anything.”
When Floyd spoke with Freeman by speakerphone at the precinct late on Jan. 4, he told Reuters, he believed time was running out to arrange a deal because the election would soon be certified on Jan. 6. “If Ms. Freeman wanted to get a message to the president and wanted immunity,” Floyd said, “that’s really important to get to the right people before an election is certified.”
Floyd said he reached out to Kutti and Douglas to approach Freeman. 
“I had spoken to some people that I knew and made arrangements for and secured a place where Ms. Freeman could go,” he said, “a place where no one would know that she was there, and no one would harass her there.”
‘WERE THOSE HONEST BALLOTS?’
Kutti showed up uninvited at Freeman’s door at about 8:30 p.m. on Jan. 4, police records show.
As Reuters reported earlier this month, Freeman told police that during that night’s encounter, Kutti tried to get her to falsely implicate herself in voting fraud. A Cobb County Police report identified Kutti as an “alleged Trump supporter who attempted to get Ms. Freeman to make false claims about the ballot counting.”
Freeman, who’d been subjected to threats, was wary of strangers but wanted to hear out Kutti, so she asked the police to send an officer to watch over them.
According to the police report, Kutti told the responding officer that she had been sent by a “high-profile individual” and that Freeman was in unspecified danger, “due to the election.” Kutti told the officer that Freeman had just 48 hours to “get ahead of the issue” before unknown people were going to show up at her home.
The officer suggested that the two women meet at the police station, which they did.
At the precinct, Douglas sat with Kutti and Freeman as the two women talked in the corner of a room, police bodycam footage shows. After a few minutes, Kutti put Floyd on the speakerphone.
Freeman initially told Reuters she thought Floyd’s name was “Harrison Ford.” The news organization later determined that Kutti had introduced the man on the speakerphone as Harrison “Floyd.” That conclusion was backed by an analysis by an outside forensic expert, Focal Forensics, of that portion of their conversation, which was captured on a police officer’s body camera. After Reuters presented this finding to Floyd, he confirmed it was him.
As the meeting began, the footage shows, Kutti told Freeman: “You are a loose end for a party that needs to tidy up.”
Floyd came on via speakerphone, and the meeting continued for another hour. Large portions of the bodycam audio are not clearly audible, because the officer stepped further away from the conversation at Kutti’s request.
Some details can be heard, however. Floyd asked Freeman about what was in the ballot boxes she handled on election night. He asked her if she needed “to know what was already on those ballots inside those ballot boxes?”
Freeman responded: “No, we don’t look at them. I couldn’t tell you who had the most, who had the least.” 
“So let me ask you this,” Floyd said. “Were those honest ballots?”
Freeman responded: “Yeah,” and then went into a detailed explanation of the process for handling and counting the ballots. She said the ballots are in sealed envelopes, so it’s impossible to know which candidate was picked by the voter. “Democrat or Republican,” she said, “you don’t know that.”
‘MY NAME NEEDS TO BE CLEARED’
In his interview Monday, Floyd said the meeting was arranged in part to help Freeman cut an immunity deal. Freeman is heard on the recording saying she needs a lawyer, but for a different reason: to prove her innocence.
In the meeting, Freeman mentioned that Fulton County officials had publicly cleared her of any ballot fraud. But she expressed worry about another false accusation that she had done something untoward with USB drives used in the vote-counting.
Trump’s lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, had publicly accused Freeman and her daughter of manipulating vote totals while passing USB drives between them, “as if they’re vials of heroin and cocaine” - again, falsely asserting the State Farm Arena video showed a crime.
Freeman told Kutti and Floyd that the USB allegations had been circulated on YouTube, the bodycam footage shows.
“That’s why I want an attorney,” Freeman said, “because I know my name needs to be cleared.”

After striking out with Freeman that night, Floyd said, there was one more communication with her, which he declined to detail, and then the pursuit was dropped.
In hindsight, Floyd said, “that initial approach in the police station could have and should have been done better.”

CHENNAI, India (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn's plant near Chennai in southern India will remain shut this week following protests sparked by a food poisoning incident, three government sources told Reuters on Tuesday.
The factory looked deserted on Tuesday, with a few cars including a police vehicle parked outside. No workers were seen at the site, which was manned by two guards and a few other security officials.
Foxconn and Apple were not available for comment.
The disruption comes as Apple, like other consumer products companies, is dealing with supply chain bottlenecks that have hit production. In October, the company warned that the impact of these supply chain problems would worsen during the holiday quarter. 
""The factory has been shut since Saturday and will be shut till coming Sunday,"" said a senior official at the directorate of industrial safety and health in Tamil Nadu, of which Chennai is the capital. Two more senior state officials confirmed the suspension of activities at the factory.
All three declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak with the media.
Police in India on Monday released dozens of those detained for blocking a key highway after the food poisoning incident last week at the plant that led to 150 employees being admitted to hospital. 
The plant makes iPhone 12 models. Local media reported on Tuesday, citing sources, that Apple has started trial production of its flagship iPhone 13 at the factory recently.
The decision to suspend activities at the plant is the management's, a police officer from the office of the Superintendent of Police in Kancheepuram, a district in Tamil Nadu, told Reuters. 
Employees at the plant who complained of food poisoning and other problems in recent months have been asked to register their problems with the state labour ministry, the officer said.
PRODUCTION IMPACT
""The impact on Apple is expected to be low as it is a lean period ... until at least February,"" said Navkendar Singh, India research director at market research firm IDC.
""In (the first half of 2022) we expect sales to pick up from new product launches and much needed easing of supply chain issues.""
The factory also makes Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Fire TV sticks and some Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) devices.
The unrest at Foxconn is the second such involving an Apple supplier factory in India in a year.
In December 2020, thousands of contract workers at a factory owned by Wistron Corp destroyed equipment and vehicles over the alleged non-payment of wages, causing damages estimated at $60 million.
Cupertino, California-headquartered Apple has bet big on India since it began iPhone assembly in the country in 2017.
Foxconn, Wistron and another supplier, Pegatron, have together committed roughly $900 million over five years to make iPhones in India.
Apple is also planning to bring the assembly of its iPad tablets to India, which is among countries including Mexico and Vietnam that are becoming important to contract manufacturers supplying American brands as they try to reduce their reliance on China amid rising Sino-U.S. tensions.

Most of Foxconn's workers in India are women.

(Reuters) - Ukraine's armed forces are heavily outnumbered and outgunned by Russia's but could put up a level of resistance that would force Russian President Vladimir Putin to pay a price of many thousands of Russian lives for any new invasion.
Western military analysts say Ukraine's army is better trained and equipped than in 2014, when Russia captured the Crimean peninsula without a fight, and highly motivated to defend the country's heartland.
For those reasons, they see it as highly unlikely that Putin would contemplate an outright conquest of Ukraine.
""We won't see a big giant red arrow going across Ukraine. I don't believe the Russians have the capability to just completely overrun Ukraine and take over the whole country, nor do I think they want to,"" said Ben Hodges, a retired U.S. lieutenant general now with the Center for European Policy Analysis.
A plausible alternative, he and others said, was that Russia might push south and west from Ukraine's Donbass region - already controlled by pro-Russian forces - to link up with annexed Crimea and the Black Sea. But even that more limited objective would entail high Russian casualties.
Siemon Wezeman, an arms specialist at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, said the scale of resistance to any invasion would dwarf anything Russia had faced in previous military operations in Chechnya in the 1990s or in its short war with Georgia in 2008.
""Yes it can defeat, say, the high level of Ukrainian forces, but try to invade a country like Ukraine with a population that is clearly against you, which is armed to the teeth, where most males have at least rudimentary military training that they can still remember. You're going into an area which is Chechnya multiplied by 10, or Georgia multiplied by 30,"" he said.
""It's not going to be a walkover. And then you have to defend to your own population as Russian president that you just suffered 10,000 losses in the first few days because you were stupid enough to support the Donbass rebels. I don't think that's going to resonate very well in Russia.""
Ukraine says 92,000 Russian troops have gathered near its borders, and the United States has said a Russian invasion by a force as large as 175,000 could come as early as January.
Moscow denies menacing its neighbour and say it can move its troops around as it sees fit on its own territory. It says it perceives a threat from Ukraine's growing ties with NATO - which Kyiv seeks one day to join - and is demanding security guarantees from the West to defuse the crisis.
DAUNTING NUMBERS
In terms of manpower and weapons, the arithmetic looks grim for Ukraine.
Russia's army of 280,000 is about twice the size of Ukraine's and its total armed forces of 900,000 are more than four times greater. Its 2,840 battle tanks outnumber Ukraine's by more than three to one, according to the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).
While Ukraine trebled its defence budget in real terms from 2010 to 2020, its total defence expenditure last year amounted to only $4.3 billion, or one-tenth of Russia's.
""In terms of air defence and electronic warfare, there is a huge gap between these two forces. It's difficult to see how Ukraine could not be completely overwhelmed from the air,"" said IISS research analyst Yohann Michel.
Russia would seek to use its superiority in electronic warfare to paralyse its adversary's command and control and cut off communications with units in the field, he said.
But Ukraine's combat experience in Donbass and its short-range air defences and anti-tank weaponry - which includes U.S.-supplied Javelin missiles - would help to slow any Russian advance.
""It will not be a piece of cake because there is still a large number of (Ukrainian) troops. The majority of them are well motivated, so they will probably fight until the last moment,"" Michel said.
Even a defeated Ukraine could ""open their arms depot"", distribute weapons to the population and leave the Russians facing a kind of guerrilla warfare that would make it painful to hold onto any captured territory. ""I would not want to be in six months in any area the Russians would have seized,"" he said.
Putin would likely face qualms from his own public about waging war on a fellow Slav nation, as well as intense anti-Russian sentiment within Ukraine.

Former U.S. lieutenant general Hodges said that while the numbers were stacked against Ukraine, ""as you know from history, warfare is never just about math"".
""The Ukrainian population will be very hostile, the further west that Russian forces might go. This will be very, very costly for Russian forces,"" he said. ""The reward, the payoff, would have to be really worthwhile to keep (Putin's) own domestic population in support.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jury deliberations are expected to continue on Tuesday in the sex abuse trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite charged by U.S. prosecutors with recruiting and grooming underage girls for the late financier Jeffrey Epstein to abuse.
The following is a timeline of significant events leading up to the close of Maxwell's trial: 
November 2018
The Miami Herald publishes a report detailing a previously-secret deal that Epstein, a math teacher-turned-money manager, reached in 2007 with federal prosecutors probing allegations that he sexually abused minors at his Palm Beach, Florida, mansion. He pleaded guilty to lesser state prostitution charges.
The report brings widespread attention to the decades-old allegations against Epstein and Maxwell in the context of the #MeToo movement, which has encouraged women to speak out about abuse by powerful men. 
July 2019
Epstein is arrested on charges of luring dozens of girls as young as 14 to his homes in New York and Florida and paying them for sex acts. Epstein, who pleaded not guilty, is placed on suicide watch after being found unconscious in his jail cell in Manhattan with neck injuries. He claims he was attacked by his cell mate and is taken off suicide watch less than a week later. 
August 2019
Epstein's cell mate is transferred on Aug. 9. The following morning, Epstein is found hanged in his cell while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. Medical examiners on Aug. 16 rule his death a suicide. 
July 2020
Maxwell is arrested by the FBI in Bradford, New Hampshire, on July 2. Federal prosecutors in New York charge her with procuring and transporting three minor victims for illegal sex acts. She is also charged with perjury - prosecutors accused her of lying during a deposition for a now-settled civil defamation lawsuit brought by Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre.
Maxwell pleads not guilty and ""vigorously denies the charges."" U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan denies bail, saying Maxwell posed a flight risk. 
October 2020
The 2016 deposition Maxwell gave in Giuffre's lawsuit is made public. In the deposition, Maxwell denied seeing Epstein have sex with underage girls or helping him arrange illicit sexual encounters. 
March 29, 2021
Prosecutors expand their case against Maxwell, filing a new indictment that charges her with sex trafficking involving a fourth victim. Maxwell recruited the victim in 2001, when she was 14 years old, to engage in sex acts with Epstein, according to the indictment.
April 23, 2021
Maxwell pleads not guilty to the new charges.
August 13, 2021
The judge rejects Maxwell's bid to dismiss her indictment on the grounds that she was immune to prosecution under the 2007 agreement Epstein made with prosecutors. Maxwell had argued that the deal, which was later widely criticized as too lenient, also covered accused co-conspirators like herself. 
November 16, 2021
Nathan begins questioning more than 200 potential jurors for the case, asking about their own experiences with sexual abuse and their opinions about people with luxurious lifestyles.
November 29, 2021
In the trial's opening statements, prosecutor Lara Pomerantz called Maxwell a predator who recruited girls for Epstein in order to maintain her luxurious lifestyle. Defense attorney Bobbi Sternheim countered that Maxwell was being unfairly targeted for Epstein's bad behavior.
December 17, 2021
The defense rests its case after Maxwell declines to testify, telling Nathan the prosecution had not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt.
December 20, 2021

In closing arguments, prosecutor Alison Moe said Maxwell's presence assuaged teenagers who otherwise would have found middle-aged Epstein ""creepy"" to spend time with and to touch.
Defense lawyer Laura Menninger said Epstein kept many secrets from ex-girlfriend Maxwell, arguing prosecutors did not prove she knew about his activities with teenage girls.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jurors are weighing the fate of Ghislaine Maxwell after a three-week trial featuring testimony from women who said she recruited and groomed them for abuse by the late financier Jeffrey Epstein when they were teenagers. 
Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty. Her attorneys say prosecutors are using her as a scapegoat because Epstein, who killed himself while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges, cannot be charged.
Here are 10 key moments from the trial: 
- In her opening statement, prosecutor Lara Pomerantz called Maxwell a predator who manipulated girls and groomed them for abuse by Epstein, her employer and onetime boyfriend. Maxwell saw recruiting girls for Epstein to have sex with as a means to maintain a luxurious lifestyle, Pomerantz said. 
""They were exploiting kids,"" Pomerantz said. ""They were trafficking kids for sex.""
- Maxwell defense lawyer Bobbi Sternheim began her opening statement by citing the biblical story of Adam and Eve to argue that Maxwell, like many women before her, was being blamed for a man's bad behavior. Epstein killed himself in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell.
""Epstein's death left a gaping hole in the pursuit of justice for many of these women,"" Sternheim said. ""She's filling that hole, and filling that empty chair."" 
- A woman known by the pseudonym Jane testified that Epstein first abused her in 1994, when Jane was just 14. 
Maxwell sometimes took part in sexual encounters with Jane and Epstein, and acted as if it were normal, Jane testified. 
""It made me feel confused because that did not feel normal to me,"" she said. ""I'd never seen anything like this or felt anything like this."" 
- Under cross-examination by Maxwell attorney Laura Menninger, Jane acknowledged she did not initially tell the FBI everything about Maxwell's involvement. She said later under further questioning by prosecutors that she was not comfortable sharing all the details.
""I was sitting in a room full of strangers and telling them the most shameful, deepest secrets that I'd been carrying around with me my whole life,"" she said. 
- Prosecutors displayed for the jury a green massage table that was seized from Epstein's Palm Beach, Florida, estate in 2005. Three of the four accusers said they gave Epstein massages that escalated into sexual activity.
Pomerantz called the word massage a ""ruse designed to get young girls to touch Epstein."" 
- Prosecutors showed the jury images depicting Maxwell's and Epstein's intimate relationship during the 1990s. The never-before-seen digital photographs showed Maxwell kissing Epstein on the cheek or rubbing his bare foot.
- A woman known by her first name, Carolyn, testified that Maxwell once touched Carolyn's breasts and buttocks while Carolyn was nude and told her she had a ""great body for Mr. Epstein and his friends.""
""Money will not ever fix what that woman has done to me,"" Carolyn said, sobbing on the stand.
- Jeffrey Pagliuca, an attorney for Maxwell, asked Carolyn why she did not mention Maxwell in her initial discussions with law enforcement but implicated her later in a claim to a victim's compensation fund run by Epstein's estate. The questioning was part of Maxwell's efforts to paint the accusers' accounts as unreliable.
""You know that if any information you submitted is false, you can be in criminal trouble?"" Pagliuca said, referring to the fund.
- Elizabeth Loftus, a prominent psychologist, testified for the defense that people can confidently recount events that did not happen. Her testimony was part of the defense's effort to argue that the accusers' memories had been manipulated over time. 
""When you have post-event suggestion or intervention, people get very confident about their wrong answers,"" Loftus testified.

- Minutes before the defense rested its case, Maxwell stood up, and with Sternheim's arm around her lower back, told U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan that she was declining to testify in her own defense.
""Your honor, the government has not proven the case beyond a reasonable doubt, and so there is no need for me to testify,"" Maxwell said.

GENEVA (Reuters) -The Omicron variant of the coronavirus is spreading faster than the Delta variant and is causing infections in people already vaccinated or who have recovered from the COVID-19 disease, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday.
WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan added it would be ""unwise"" to conclude from early evidence that Omicron was a milder variant that previous ones.
""... with the numbers going up, all health systems are going to be under strain,"" Soumya Swaminathan told Geneva-based journalists.
The variant is successfully evading some immune responses, she said, meaning that the booster programmes being rolled out in many countries ought to be targeted towards people with weaker immune systems.
""There is now consistent evidence that Omicron is spreading significantly faster than the Delta variant,"" WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the briefing.
""And it is more likely people vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19 could be infected or re-infected,"" Tedros said.
Their comments echoed the finding of study by Imperial College London, which said last week the risk of reinfection was more than five times higher and it has shown no sign of being milder than Delta.
WHO officials said however that other forms of immunity vaccinations may prevent infection and disease. 
While the antibody defences from some actions have been undermined, there has been hope that T-cells, the second pillar of an immune response, can prevent severe disease by attacking infected human cells.
WHO expert Abdi Mahamud added: ""Although we are seeing a reduction in the neutralisation antibodies, almost all preliminary analysis shows T-cell mediated immunity remains intact, that is what we really require.""
However, highlighting how little is known about how to handle the new variant that was only detected last month, Swaminathan also said: ""Of course there is a challenge, many of the monoclonals will not work with Omicron."" 
She gave no details as she referred to the treatments that mimic natural antibodies in fighting off infections. Some drug makers have suggested the same.
ENDING THE PANDEMIC
In the short term, Tedros said that holiday festivities would in many places lead to ""increased cases, overwhelmed health systems and more deaths"" and urged people to postpone gatherings.
""An event cancelled is better than a life cancelled,"" he said.
But the WHO team also offered some hope to a weary world facing the new wave that 2022 would be the year that the pandemic, which already killed more than 5.6 million people worldwide, would end.
It pointed towards the development of second and third generation vaccines, and the further development of antimicrobial treatments and other innovations.
""(We) hope to consign this disease to a relatively mild disease that is easily prevented, that is easily treated,"" Mike Ryan, the WHO's top emergency expert, told the briefing.
""If we can keep virus transmission to minimum, then we can bring the pandemic to an end.""

However Tedros also said China, where the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was first detected at the end of 2019, must be forthcoming with data and information related to its origin to help the response going forward.
""We need to continue until we know the origins, we need to push harder because we should learn from what happened this time in order to (do) better in the future,"" Tedros said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The jury in Ghislaine Maxwell's sex abuse trial began deliberating on Monday over whether the British socialite set up teenage girls to have sexual encounters with Jeffrey Epstein or if she is a scapegoat for the late financier.
Maxwell, 59, is accused of recruiting and grooming four teenage girls for Epstein between 1994 and 2004. Those accusers, now women in their 30s or 40s, said in emotional and explicit testimony that Maxwell made touching Epstein feel normal to them - and said she sometimes touched their bodies herself.
On trial for three weeks in federal court in Manhattan, Maxwell has pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking and other crimes. Epstein killed himself in a jail cell in 2019 at the age of 66 while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges.
""Your function is to weigh the evidence in the case and to determine whether or not the government has proved that Ms. Maxwell is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,"" U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan instructed 12 jurors and five alternates before deliberations began. 
Jurors deliberated for just under an hour on Monday and will resume deliberations on Tuesday.
Earlier on Monday, prosecutor Alison Moe said in her closing argument that Maxwell was Epstein's ""partner in crime."" She said Maxwell, a onetime girlfriend and employee of Epstein's, saw helping Epstein abuse underage girls as a means to maintain her opulent lifestyle.
Moe argued that Maxwell's presence made young girls feel comfortable spending time with Epstein. Otherwise, receiving an invitation to be with a middle-aged man would have seemed ""creepy"" and ""set off alarm bells,"" Moe said.
""Epstein could not have done this alone,"" Moe said. ""When that man is accompanied by a posh, smiling, respectable, age-appropriate woman, that's when everything starts to seem legitimate. And when that woman ... acts like it's totally normal for that man to touch those girls, it lures them into a trap."" 
Maxwell defense attorney Laura Menninger countered that Maxwell was an ""innocent woman"" whom prosecutors had targeted because Epstein is no longer alive. 
She argued that the women's memories had been corrupted over the decades and said they were motivated by money to implicate Maxwell. All four women said they received millions of dollars from a victims' compensation fund established by Epstein's estate.

The defense repeatedly pressed the women during cross-examinations as to why they did not mention Maxwell during their initial conversations with law enforcement agents about Epstein.
""They all changed their stories when the Epstein victims' compensation fund was opened up,"" Menninger told the jury. ""That should make you hesitate.""

(Reuters) -Jurors retired for the evening on Monday after starting deliberations in the manslaughter trial of Kimberly Potter, the former Minnesota police officer who mistook her handgun for her Taser and shot Black motorist Daunte Wright during a traffic stop.
In final remarks to the jury, prosecutors said Potter acted recklessly and with ""culpable negligence"" in drawing the wrong weapon, while the defense argued the young Black man caused his own death by resisting arrest and attempting to flee.
The jury will resume deliberations on Tuesday morning.
Erin Eldridge, assistant Minnesota attorney general, walked the jury through Potter's extensive training during her 26-year career as a police officer in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center, arguing it made her actions indefensible.
""She was no rookie. It wasn't her first day on the job,"" Eldridge said in her one-hour closing argument. ""We are here because this was entirely preventable. It was a tragedy of her own making. And it’s not just a tragedy. It’s manslaughter.""
Potter, 49, has pleaded not guilty to first- and second-degree manslaughter charges, which carry maximum sentences of 15 and 10 years, respectively, saying she thought she was drawing her Taser when she shot Wright in the chest with her 9 mm handgun on April 11.
Potter is white and the shooting of Wright triggered several nights of intense protests outside the police station in Brooklyn Center, with critics calling it another example of police brutality against Black Americans. 
The incident occurred just a few miles (km) north of where Derek Chauvin, a white former Minneapolis police officer, was standing trial https://www.reuters.com/world/us/jurors-resume-deliberations-derek-chauvin-murder-trial-2021-04-20 at the same time in the case of George Floyd, a Black man whose 2020 death during an arrest set off racial justice protests in many U.S. cities. Chauvin was convicted of murder.
Earl Gray, one of Potter's attorneys, sought to cast blame for the shooting on Wright, arguing that Wright's decision to resist arrest and his attempt to drive away had put another officer on the scene at risk and required Potter to use force.
""The causation was Daunte Wright,"" Gray told the jury in his closing argument, which lasted about 50 minutes. ""Those are the cold, hard facts.""
Gray highlighted the testimony of Dr. Laurence Miller, a psychologist who told the jury last week about ""action error,"" or when a person takes one action while intending to do another. Miller testified about how such mistakes are common in daily life, such as inputting the wrong computer password or writing down the wrong date, and can be triggered by stress.
Prosecutors have conceded that Potter made a mistake and did not intend to kill Wright. To secure a conviction on the first- degree charge, they must prove she caused his death while committing the misdemeanor offense of recklessly using her firearm. For the second-degree charge, the jury must find Potter guilty of ""culpable negligence"" by creating an ""unreasonable risk and consciously"" taking a chance of causing him great harm.
""It’s a case about the defendant's reckless handling of her firearm and her culpable negligence,"" Eldridge said. ""This was a colossal screw-up. A blunder of epic proportions.""
Gray argued that Potter should not be found guilty because she did not know she was firing a gun when she shot Wright.
""She could not consciously take a chance of causing death or great bodily harm if she didn’t know she had a gun,"" Gray said. ""She made a mistake."" 
In emotional testimony on Friday, Potter said she was deeply sorry for killing Wright and that she had largely blacked out in the aftermath of the shooting.
Potter and another police officer pulled Wright over because there was an air freshener hanging from his rearview mirror and his vehicle's license tabs were expired. They then learned of a warrant for his arrest on a misdemeanor weapons charge and sought to detain him, which Wright resisted. 

Potter can be heard shouting: ""Taser, Taser, Taser,"" on her body-worn camera before firing into Wright's car after he broke free from a second officer. Potter testified that she feared for the life of a third officer who had entered through the passenger side and was trying to keep the car in park.
""Within seconds he all of a sudden breaks away. That’s what caused this whole incident,"" Gray said. ""They had to stop him.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist and founder of the right-wing website Infowars, said on Monday said he will invoke his right under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and decline to testify before the congressional panel probing the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
""Jones has notified the Select Committee that he intends to plead his right to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment,"" Jones's lawyers said in a lawsuit filed on Monday against the House of Representatives Select Committee on Jan. 6.
The Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects a person from being forced to disclose information to investigators that might subject them to criminal prosecution.
The committee has scheduled an interview with Jones for Jan. 10, 2022, according to Jones's lawsuit.
A spokesman for the Jan. 6 Select Committee declined to comment.
At least three other high-profile witnesses in the investigation have said they would invoke that protection: Roger Stone, a longtime political adviser to former President Donald Trump; John Eastman, a former Trump lawyer, and Jeffrey Clark, a former top Justice Department official during the Trump administration.
In the lawsuit, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, Jones raised constitutional objections to subpoenas the committee issued last month for his testimony and communications.
Trump has similarly sought to block the committee from obtaining his White House records from Jan. 6 and the preceding days, asserting they are protected by a legal doctrine called executive privilege.
An appeals court rejected Trump's arguments last week. He is expected to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Jones led supporters on a march to the Capitol on Jan. 6 but has not been charged with any criminal wrongdoing.
An InfoWars employee who accompanied Jones on Jan. 6, Owen Shroyer, has been charged with unlawfully breaching the Capitol grounds during the riot.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Pro-Beijing candidates swept to victory in an overhauled ""patriots""-only legislative election in Hong Kong that critics described as undemocratic, with turnout hitting a record low amid a crackdown on the city's freedoms by China. 
The 30.2% turnout, about half that of the previous poll in 2016, was seen by pro-democracy activists as a rebuke to China after it imposed a broad national security law and sweeping electoral changes to bring the city more firmly under its authoritarian grip.
Almost all seats were taken by pro-Beijing and pro-establishment candidates, some of whom cheered at the vote counting centre and chanted ""guaranteed win"".
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam told a news conference on Monday the turnout was indeed low but that she was not able to give specific reasons.
""But 1.35 million coming out to vote – it cannot be said that it was not an ... election that did not get a lot of support from citizens,"" Lam said.
Political analysts say the turnout is a barometer of legitimacy in an election where pro-democracy candidates were largely absent, and a crackdown under the security law and other legislation has jailed scores of democrats https://www.reuters.com/world/china/hong-kongs-jailed-exiled-democrats-lament-sunday-election-2021-12-16 who had originally wanted to run, and forced others into exile. 
Asked if the low turnout meant her party lacked a public mandate, Starry Lee, head of the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong that won half of the directly elected seats, said the patriots-only rules would improve governance.
""It needs some time for people to get adapted to this system,” she told reporters.
The election - in which only candidates vetted by the government as ""patriots"" could run - has been criticised as undemocratic by some foreign governments, rights groups, and mainstream Hong Kong pro-democracy parties, which did not participate in the polls.
Separate joint statements from the foreign ministers of the G7 grouping of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the United States, as well as the high representative of the European Union, and from Britain, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand expressed ""grave concern"" over the erosion of Hong Kong's democracy.
The G7 statement https://www.gov.uk/government/news/g7-foreign-ministers-issue-joint-statement-on-hong-kong-elections said the changes to Hong Kong's electoral system had undermined the high degree of autonomy promised to Hong Kong under the ""One Country, Two Systems"" principle when it returned to Chinese from British rule in 1997.
The United States also named five already-sanctioned Chinese officials it said had contributed to undermining Hong Kong's democracy and warned that foreign financial institutions https://www.reuters.com/world/us-warns-banks-it-names-five-more-chinese-officials-under-hong-kong-act-2021-12-20 that conduct business with them would be subject to sanctions.
Most of the dozen or so candidates who called themselves moderates, including former democratic lawmaker Frederick Fung, succumbed to pro-Beijing rivals.
""It's not easy to push people (to vote). I think they are feeling indifferent,"" Fung told Reuters.
Democrat Sunny Cheung, who moved to the United States to escape prosecution under the security law, said most of Hong Kong had ""consciously boycotted the election to express their discontent to the world"".
The previous record low turnout for a legislative election held after the city's 1997 return from British to Chinese rule was 43.6% in 2000. About 2% of the votes cast on Sunday were invalid, a record high, according to local media.
'DEMOCRACY WITH HONG KONG CHARACTERISTICS'
China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong described the election as a ""successful practice of democracy with Hong Kong characteristics"".
The Hong Kong branch of China's foreign ministry said the electoral system was an internal affair and urged ""foreign forces"" not to interfere.
In a 57-page white paper published on Monday, the Chinese government said it had provided constant support to Hong Kong in developing its ""democratic system"" and criticised the often-violent 2019 pro-democracy protests.
Lam, who visits Beijing this week for her annual report to state leaders, said the document was a timely rebuttal of criticism of the elections by foreign governments and media.
Under the electoral shake-up announced by China in March, the proportion of directly elected seats was reduced from around half to less than a quarter, or 20 seats.
Forty seats were selected by a committee stacked with Beijing loyalists, while the remaining 30 were filled by professional and business sectors such as finance and engineering, known as functional constituencies.

Turnout for these professional groups fell to 32.2% from 74% in 2016. Some sectors whose voters have traditionally leaned pro-democracy, including education, social welfare, and law, had the lowest rates.
In 2019, the last major citywide election for district council seats, the turnout was 71% with around 90% of the 452 seats won by democrats.

A six-monthly State Department report to Congress named the five as Chen Dong, He Jing, Lu Xinning, Tan Tienui and Yin Zonghua, all deputy directors at China's Hong Kong liaison office.
Naming the five bought to 39 the number of officials so designated under the terms of the U.S. Hong Kong Autonomy Act since October last year.
""Foreign financial institutions that knowingly conduct significant transactions with the individuals listed in today’s report are subject to sanctions,"" the State Department said, as it released an updated report to Congress required under the act.
It said the report underscored ""deep concerns about Beijing’s clear efforts to deprive Hong Kongers of a meaningful voice"" in Dec. 19 Legislative Council elections.
The United States has thus far not sanctioned any foreign financial institution for doing business with those named in accordance with the Hong Kong act, which became law last year.
Financial institutions found in violation of the act could be subject to so-called secondary sanctions, including restrictions on U.S. loans, foreign exchange, property transactions, exports and transfers, in addition to measures against executives.

Under the terms of the act, the U.S. Treasury is required to identify any such institution between 30 and 60 days of the submission of the report to Congress.
The five individuals named on Monday were among seven Chinese official sanctioned in July over China's crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday sued New York Attorney General Letitia James, seeking to stop her civil fraud investigation into his company.
He filed the lawsuit in federal court in Syracuse, New York, after it was reported that James' office would seek to question Trump as it probes whether his company, the Trump Organization, manipulated the valuations of its real estate properties.
Trump and the company, which is also a plaintiff in the case, claim that James has violated their rights under the U.S. Constitution by pursuing a politically motivated investigation.
""By filing this lawsuit, we intend to not only hold her accountable for her blatant constitutional violations, but to stop her bitter crusade to punish her political opponent in its tracks,"" Trump's attorney, Alina Habba, said in a statement.
In a statement, James replied: ""Our investigation will continue undeterred because no one is above the law, not even someone with the name Trump.""
The civil probe is related to, but separate from, a more-than-three-year-old criminal probe by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance of the Trump Organization's business practices, which James joined in May. It includes a focus on whether the Trump Organization overstated the value of some real estate assets to obtain loans and tax benefits.
In July, the company and longtime Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg pleaded not guilty to criminal charges in what a prosecutor in Vance's office called a ""sweeping and audacious"" 15-year tax fraud.

In Monday's lawsuit, Trump and the company claim that James, a Democrat, is motivated by partisan bias against Trump, a Republican, pointing to public statements she made against the former president before she was elected to her position.
They are seeking a court order barring the investigation from going forward.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Monday it urgently needed a response from the United States on its sweeping security demands and again warned of a possible Russian military response unless it saw political action to assuage its concerns. 
Moscow, which has unnerved the West with a troop buildup near Ukraine, last week unveiled a wish list of security proposals it wants to negotiate, including a promise NATO would give up any military activity in Eastern Europe and Ukraine.
Washington has said some of Russia's proposals are obviously unacceptable, but that the United States will respond some time this week with more concrete proposals on the format of any talks.
Emily Horne, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, said Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan spoke by phone with his Russian counterpart, Yuriy Ushakov, to stress the United States is prepared to communicate through multiple channels including bilateral engagement.
Sullivan ""made clear that any dialogue must be based on reciprocity and address our concerns about Russia’s actions, and take place in full coordination with our European allies and partners. He also noted that substantive progress can only occur in an environment of de-escalation rather than escalation,"" she said.
Konstantin Gavrilov, a Russian diplomat in Vienna, said that relations between Moscow and NATO had reached a ""moment of truth"". 
""The conversation needs to be serious and everyone in NATO understands perfectly well despite their strength and power that concrete political action needs to be taken, otherwise the alternative is a military-technical and military response from Russia,"" he was quoted as saying by RIA news agency. 
The U.S. response is likely to shape Moscow's calculus over Ukraine, which has become the main flashpoint in East-West relations.
The United States and Ukraine say Russia may be preparing an invasion of its ex-Soviet neighbour. Russia denies that and says it is Ukraine's growing relationship with NATO that has caused the standoff to escalate. It has compared it to the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, when the world came to the brink of nuclear war.
Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said that Moscow had so far received no response from the United States. 
""I think they'll try to turn this into a slow-moving process, but we need it to be urgent, because the situation is very difficult, it is acute, it tends to become more complicated,"" he was quoted by RIA as saying.
The Kremlin said it was still too early to assess the West's response, but that information from ""various sources"" about a readiness to discuss the ideas was positive.

Asked separately about a Belarusian proposal to host Russian nuclear weapons in the event of similar deployments in its vicinity by the West, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow had numerous options. 
""It's no secret the deployment of different types of armaments near our borders that could pose a danger would require corresponding steps to be taken to balance the situation. There are all sorts of options here,"" he said.

(Reuters) -Moderna Inc said on Monday that a booster dose of its COVID-19 vaccine appeared to be protective against the fast-spreading Omicron variant of the coronavirus in laboratory testing and that the current version of the shot would continue to be its ""first line of defense against Omicron.""
The company said its decision to focus on the current vaccine, mRNA-1273, was driven in part by how quickly the recently-discovered variant is spreading.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) said it still plans to develop a vaccine to protect against Omicron specifically and hopes to start clinical trials early next year.
""What we have available right now is 1273,"" Dr. Paul Burton, Moderna's chief medical officer, said in an interview. ""It's highly effective, and it's extremely safe. I think it will protect people through the coming holiday period and through these winter months, when we're going to see the most severe pressure of Omicron.""
Moderna's shares were down more than 4% at $282.26 in afternoon trading.
The company said a two-dose course of its vaccine generated low neutralizing antibodies against the Omicron variant, but a 50-microgram booster dose increased neutralizing antibodies against the variant 37 fold. A 100-microgram booster - the same strength as the original shots - drove neutralizing antibodies to more than 80 times pre-boost levels.
Moderna President Stephen Hoge on a conference call said the company currently does not plan to pursue approval for the higher booster dose.
The antibody levels generated by the lower dose shot ""are comfortably above"" what would signify a risk of breakthrough infections for other variants of concern, Hoge said.
Moderna did not specify whether it believes its two-dose regimen will reduce hospitalizations or deaths from the Omicron variant. Studies by other researchers have shown a ""reasonable and robust"" T cell response is maintained against the variant, Hoge said, which could suggest protection against severe disease. T cells in the immune system recognize and eliminate virus-infected cells.
The new data, which has not yet been peer reviewed, tested blood from people who had received Moderna's vaccine against a pseudovirus engineered to resemble the Omicron variant. It is similar to data discussed last week https://www.reuters.com/world/us/early-data-suggests-omicron-more-transmissible-than-delta-cdc-director-2021-12-15 by top U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci.
It may not be necessary to push antibody levels higher than those generated by the 50-microgram dose for many people, said Hoge. Governments could, however, choose a higher-dose version if they want to confer an enhanced level of protection. 
The company said the 100-microgram dose was generally safe and well tolerated, although there was a trend toward slightly more frequent adverse reactions. 
U.S. regulators authorized the 50-microgram booster of Moderna's vaccine in October. 

Both the Moderna and the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines have been linked to rare cases of heart inflammation, particularly in young men. Several studies have suggested that Moderna's vaccine is likely to cause the heart inflammation at a higher rate than  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s.
Omicron, a highly contagious variant first detected last month in southern Africa and Hong Kong, has raced around the globe and been reported in 89 countries, the World Health Organization said on Saturday.

(Reuters) - OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma could be years away from paying billions of dollars to address the U.S. opioid crisis after a judge blew up a deal that gave legal immunity to the Sackler family that owned the company, people close to the negotiations said.
In a surprise ruling on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan found that a bankruptcy judge overstepped his authority by approving the plan that gave the Sacklers immunity in return for $4.5 billion for those harmed by Purdue. 
The deal had been hammered out over two years by U.S. states, local governments and others who had filed thousands of lawsuits accusing Purdue and the Sacklers of aggressively marketing OxyContin while downplaying its addiction and overdose risks. 
The company and family members have denied the allegations.
Purdue said it will appeal McMahon's ruling, which it said would not impact its operations but will delay or even end the ability of states and others to receive billions of dollars. 
Representatives for the Sackler family did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Eight hold-out states and the U.S. Department of Justice's bankruptcy watchdog had challenged the plan in part because of the legal protections it granted the Sacklers. The appeal process won't end with McMahon, who encouraged the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to review her decision.
The family has come under scrutiny for withdrawing $10 billion from Purdue between 2008 and 2017. 
The Sacklers have said almost half the money went to paying taxes, but opponents of the plan allege the withdrawals strengthened the family's hand in bankruptcy negotiations and gave them leverage to demand legal immunity. 
Purdue has been estimated to be worth around $2 billion without the Sackler contribution, making their participation critical.
Those involved in the case doubt a new deal could be agreed before the appeals court weighs in, a process that could take up to 18 months given the importance of the issue of so-called nondebtor releases in corporate bankruptcy cases.
Ryan Hampton, who served through most of the bankruptcy as the co-chair of the unsecured creditors committee, a key player in the deal negotiations, said there were talks earlier this year on a plan that excluded a Sackler contribution. 
""It was almost dead on arrival,"" he said. ""It will very hard to negotiate something before the 2nd Circuit decides because I've seen it live and in-person trying to negotiate a deal without a Sackler contribution,"" he said.
If the plan had gone into effect, it would have started providing funds to state and local governments and others to address the damage caused to communities reeling from the opioid epidemic, which has claimed 500,000 lives since 1999.
The appeals might not end at the 2nd Circuit, as Washington's attorney general has vowed to take the issue to the U.S. Supreme Court, a process that could add another year.
Even then, resolving the question of Sackler immunity might require sending the entire deal negotiation back to the bankruptcy court to start over.
There is also the possibility the Sacklers kick in more money, something the family did during the bankruptcy process to win over about a dozen states.
""Maybe the Sacklers put up more money and maybe the objecting parties drop the objections and we reach unanimity,"" said Scott Bickford, who represented a committee of children born dependent on opioids, a plan supporter.
The bankruptcy court judge, Robert Drain, said he approved the plan including immunity for the family in part because it was unclear whether the Sacklers could be held liable and uncertain if judgments against them could be collected. 
The family has used trusts organized in the Bailiwick of Jersey, in the Channel Islands between England and France, among other jurisdictions, to hold their wealth, according to McMahon's opinion.

Bickford said any plan without Sackler funds leaves Purdue with less money and victims with difficult legal claims.
""Essentially everyone takes a haircut and then we pursue the Sacklers for 100 years,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Since announcing his candidacy for the Georgia governorship earlier this month, Republican David Perdue has wasted no time in releasing ads that revive former President Donald Trump's false voter fraud claims and filing a lawsuit seeking to inspect absentee ballots from the 2020 presidential election.
The former U.S. senator's focus on what Republicans assert is election integrity will provide an early litmus test in the 2022 midterm contests for how such messaging resonates with voters in the post-Trump era. Republicans across the country have enacted new curbs on voting access and sought to expand control over election administration in the wake of Trump's disproven stolen-election claims. 
But Republicans in Georgia are split over whether Perdue's rhetoric and attacks on the state's sitting Republican governor, Brian Kemp, will hurt the party's chances in what is expected to be a fierce general election fight against Democrat Stacey Abrams, a nationally-known voting rights activist.
""Perdue is signaling his loyalty to the Trump tribe,"" said Carl Cavalli, a political science professor at the University of North Georgia.
""If Kemp wins by a large margin, it may mean the whole voter fraud drama does not have the legs that it was thought to have,"" Cavalli said. ""On the other hand, if Perdue wins or it's a close battle, success breeds imitators."" 
After saying he would challenge Kemp in the party's May primary, Perdue took aim at the incumbent's certification of the 2020 results that showed President Joe Biden defeated Trump in Georgia.
Kemp's decision angered Trump, who publicly encouraged Republicans to run against him and quickly endorsed Perdue's candidacy. Perdue said he would not have certified the results.
""I have never called to overturn an election, but certainly we should have gotten to the bottom of the issues of alleged fraud and irregularities,"" he said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post.
The antagonistic, Trump-fueled battle in Georgia stands in contrast to last month's gubernatorial election in Virginia, where analysts say Republican Glenn Youngkin triumphed in part by distancing himself from the former president.
Embracing Trump's false voter fraud claims likely will play well with the Republican base, according to Reuters/Ipsos polls that showed around 55% of Republicans nationally think the 2020 election was stolen. 
The once reliably Republican state of Georgia has seen its political winds shift, however, as more Black, Asian and Latino voters move to the booming Atlanta area. Biden was the first Democrat to win Georgia in a presidential election since 1992, and voters in January ousted Perdue and Kelly Loeffler from the U.S. Senate in favor of two Democrats.
A few Republicans have warned that Trump's fixation on his 2020 defeat risks splitting the party ahead of the November midterms, which look favorable to them amid Biden's falling approval levels. 
""This fascination with trying to win the first half rather than the whole game will come back to haunt us,"" said Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan, a Kemp supporter who is urging Republicans to get over the ""short-term sugar high"" of Trump.
""We're going to send a Republican nominee out with zero dollars the day after the primary, and we're going to say: 'Go get Stacey!'""
Other Republicans counter that politicians who have crossed Trump don't stand a chance with a base that still adores him.
""I don't think Governor Kemp can win,"" said Randy Evans, a Georgia Republican and Trump's former ambassador to Luxembourg. ""Kemp is trying to hold the old party together. The problem is that the old party will not be enough."" 
TRUMP BUMP
The primary in Georgia also will measure Trump's sway over the Republican Party ahead of his own potential run in the 2024 presidential election. 
Trump has already endorsed dozens of candidates for the midterm elections, including six challengers to incumbent Republicans in Congress who supported impeaching him after the deadly Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters.
Public opinion polling conducted by the Kemp and Perdue campaigns and local media indicate Trump's endorsement has given Perdue a significant initial lift, with the two men neck-and-neck. 
Both have spent the early weeks of the campaign re-litigating past election decisions. 
Perdue accused the governor of handing Democrats ""control of our elections,"" an apparent reference to a 2020 settlement between state election officials and Democratic groups that agreed how Georgia should process absentee ballots.
""If Brian Kemp had not caved to Stacey Abrams before the election in 2020, we wouldn't be in this mess,"" a Perdue campaign spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters. 
Kemp's team countered that he has worked to secure elections, signing sweeping voting restrictions into law. In a statement to Reuters, they said Perdue was ""so concerned about election fraud that he waited a year to file a lawsuit that conveniently coincided with his disastrous campaign launch."" 
As the two candidates tear into each other, many prominent Republicans in the state have so far stayed on the sidelines or sought to keep the focus on Abrams, who narrowly lost to Kemp in 2018. Loeffler, for instance, said via a spokesperson for her Greater Georgia group that she is focused on ""preparing the ground game and voter mobilization."" 

Some Republicans fear that Abrams, often discussed as a possible future presidential candidate, will be the ultimate winner of any Republican feud in the state at a time when the party should be gearing up for victory in the midterms. 
""Abrams could ride this all the way to the White House if she wins in a Republican year,"" said Martha Zoller, a Republican radio host in Georgia.

MANILA (Reuters) - More than 300 people have been in killed by a powerful typhoon in the Philippines that destroyed homes, flooded towns, severed power and communications lines and displaced hundreds of thousands in its central and southern regions.
Military airplanes and naval vessels were dispatched on Monday to carry aid to areas devastated by Typhoon Rai, as the country grappled with the strongest of 15 such storms to hit the archipelago this year. 
""We are still assessing the damage, but it is huge,"" Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana told reporters on Monday. ""The first thing we are doing is address the food and water (supplies) and medical care of the injured.""
Lorenzana told the armed forces to deliver relief goods using all available assets, and send in more troops if necessary.
The number of storm-related deaths climbed throughout Monday as rescue efforts continued in hard-hit areas. 
As of 1000 GMT, the death toll from Rai has risen to 375, the police said in a report, making it one of the deadliest typhoons to have struck the Southeast Asian nation. The number of injured has climbed to 500, while 56 people were missing. 
The count, which according to the police was subject to validation, far outstripped the 58 deaths recorded by the national disaster agency, which said it was still checking reports from affected areas.
The majority of the deaths reported by police were in the central region of Visayas, home to dive spots in Bohol province, among some of the most popular tourist destinations, and the Caraga region in northeastern Mindanao.
Provincial governor Arthur Yap told broadcaster CNN Philippines he feared the death toll could rise further, as a lack of mobile telephone links made it hard to gather information. 
Rai, which made landfall as a category 5 typhoon on Thursday, revived memories of the devastation brought in 2013 by Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most powerful tropical cyclones ever recorded, which killed 6,300 people in the Philippines.
Rai displaced nearly 490,000 people in the Philippines before moving toward the South China Sea over the weekend.

It left a trail of destruction in the provinces of Cebu, Leyte, and Surigao del Norte, including Siargao, which is popular with surfers, and the Dinagat Islands.
President Rodrigo Duterte, who visited typhoon-stricken areas over the weekend, promised funds of about 2 billion pesos ($40 million) to help in recovery efforts.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean leftist Gabriel Boric won the country's presidential runoff election on Sunday, capping a major revival for the country's progressive left that has been on the rise since widespread protests roiled the Andean country two years ago.
In downtown Santiago, supporters cheered, embraced and waved flags with Boric's image, as well as rainbow flags of LGBT groups that have backed his socially inclusive policies as well as plans to overhaul Chile's market-orientated economic model.
""We did it!"" 39-year-old Paola Fernandez said tearfully as she hugged her daughter, adding she was happy because of Boric's progressive policies.
With over 99% of ballots counted, Boric, 35, who leads a broad leftist coalition, had 55.86% of the vote, compared with 44.14% for far-right rival Jose Antonio Kast, who conceded defeat.
""I just spoke to @gabrielboric and congratulated him on his great success,"" Kast said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""From today he is the elected President of Chile and he deserves all our respect and constructive collaboration. Chile is always first.""
The protests in 2019 shone a spotlight on economic inequality and triggered an official redraft of the constitution.
""I am going to be the president of all Chileans,"" Boric said in a call with center-right President Sebastian Pinera, who will step down in March.
'I WANT REAL CHANGE'
Lucrecia Cornejo, 72, a seamstress, backed Boric's pledge to fix inequalities in education, pensions and healthcare.
""I want equality, for us not to be as they call us, the 'broken ones,' more fairness in education, health and salaries,"" she said. ""I want real change."" 
The election was the nation's most divisive in decades, with the two candidates offering starkly different visions of the future. Kast https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/chiles-bolsonaro-hard-right-kast-rises-with-frank-talk-crime-focus-2021-11-16, 55, ran a law-and-order campaign and was a defender of former dictator Augusto Pinochet.
Often likened to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and a hero of Chile's ""unapologetic right,"" Kast has said that ""two models for the nation"" were going head-to-head.
Both candidates were from outside the centrist political mainstream that has ruled Chile since the return to democracy in 1990 after Pinochet's military dictatorship. Both moderated their positions in recent weeks to win over centrist voters.
Miguel Angel Lopez, a professor at the University of Chile, said Boric faced a complex period ahead and would have to negotiate with the opposition due to a split Congress where neither side has a majority.
""He now has to make a strong speech where he tries to end the uncertainty. Lots will depend on that and on his appointments and his decisions. International investors will be very attentive to this.""
Boric supporters say he will overhaul the country's economic model that dates back to Pinochet. It has been credited for driving economic growth, but attacked for creating sharp divides between rich and poor.
""We can close the chapter on the dark, damaging and abusive model that benefited a small minority,"" said businessman Jorge Valdivia, 54, a Boric supporter.
Boric, who rose to prominence leading a student protest in 2011 to demand better and more affordable education, wrote in an open letter on Saturday that his government would make the changes Chileans had demanded in the 2019 social uprisings.
Those protests, which lasted months and at times turned violent, sparked a formal process to redraft Chile's decades-old constitution, a text that will face a referendum next year.
""(That means) having a real social security system that doesn't leave people behind, ending the hateful gap between healthcare for the rich and healthcare for the poor, advancing without hesitation in freedoms and rights for women,"" Boric wrote.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Hard-pressed Malaysian emergency services, reinforced by civilian volunteers, on Sunday rescued 21,000 people displaced by flooding from torrential rain in seven states, officials and volunteers said.
More than 66,000 police, army and fire department personnel were mobilised to help pluck people from vehicles marooned in flood waters or from inundated streets outside their homes.
State news agency Bernama reported that a total of 21,000 people had been evacuated nationwide to relief centres.
As rescue operations continued, Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob earlier told reporters in Selangor, Malaysia's wealthiest and most populous state and one of the hardest hit, that 15,000 people there had been evacuated to more than 100 relief centres. 
He said rainfall over the past day was equivalent to the total for a month in normal conditions.
After reading pleas on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) from those trapped by floodwaters, rescue volunteer Mohamad Adib Hariz Fadzilah rushed to a camping supplies store to buy kayaks and life jackets while also sending out requests for help via social media.
""I learned that some of the (emergency services) people were also buying supplies from here. It was shocking to me that they too didn't have enough equipment,"" he said.
Mohamad Adib then headed with other volunteers to the Selangor city of Shah Alam to help rescue trapped residents but said government assistance was slow to arrive.
Rohkidah Yusof, 60, was delivering food to a customer in Shah Alam with two children and two grandchildren in tow when rising flood waters cut off their route home on Saturday.
""I've never experienced floods this bad. I want to go home but I’m not sure how we are going to get there,"" she said.
Another Selangor resident, Mohammad Shahrul Azmir Selamat, said his Hulu Langat neighbourhood was spared flooding as it stood on higher ground but access roads were inundated.

""For the time being (supplies are) still okay, 10 trucks have arrived. Floods have receded in some areas and the victims already went home,"" he told Reuters via text message.
On Sunday evening, Malaysia's Meteorological Department took down its warning of heavy rains nationwide.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai said on Sunday that she had never accused anyone of sexually assaulting her, and that a social media post she had made early last month had been misunderstood.
Peng's well-being became a matter of concern among the global tennis community and rights groups when she appeared to allege that a former Chinese vice premier, Zhang Gaoli, had sexually assaulted her in the past. After that post, she was absent from public view for nearly three weeks.
""First, I need to stress one point that is extremely important, I have never said or written that anyone has sexually assaulted me, I have to clearly stress this point,"" Peng said in the video posted by Lianhe Zaobao, a Singapore media outlet.
Peng's remarks on Sunday marked the first time she had addressed the matter on camera in public. She spoke on the sidelines of a cross-country skiing event in Shanghai.
She said that her post on Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), a Twitter-like social media site, which had been quickly removed, was a ""private matter"".
Peng, 35, said in the video that ""people have many misunderstandings"" about her Weibo post. She did not elaborate.
She also said she had been living at home in Beijing without supervision. In the video, she was not asked about Zhang and did not mention him.
Reuters has been unable to reach Peng since her Weibo post.
The Women's Tennis Association, which early this month said it would suspend tournaments in China immediately due to concerns over the treatment of Peng and the safety of other players, continued to call for an investigation.
""It was again good to see Peng Shuai in a public setting and we certainly hope she is doing well,"" the Florida-based WTA said in a statement.
""As we have consistently stated, these appearances do not alleviate or address the WTA’s significant concerns about her well-being and ability to communicate without censorship or coercion,"" the WTA said.
""We remain steadfast in our call for a full, fair and transparent investigation, without censorship, into her allegation of sexual assault, which is the issue that gave rise to our initial concern.""
China has not directly commented on Peng's initial post, but said after the WTA's move to suspend tournaments in China that it ""opposes the politicization of sports"".
Zhang has not commented on the matter.
PATRIOTIC ATTIRE
Discussion of the scandal, which emerged as Beijing prepares to stage the Winter Olympics in February, has been tightly censored in China.
On Sunday, Peng appeared on a fifth-floor viewing balcony with athletes in various sports, including former NBA basketball star Yao Ming, and watched for about 20 minutes, the Singapore paper said. 
The three-time Olympian wore a black jacket with a China flag and a red T-shirt bearing the characters for China. 
Previously, Peng had been seen in photos appearing at a tennis tournament in Beijing, and in a video having dinner at a restaurant that was posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) by a state media editor.
On Twitter, a China researcher at Human Rights Watch, Yaqiu Wang, commented sarcastically on the interview, ""Wow, so natural, very real, everyone now believes it. Congratulations, the CCP!"" The reference was to China's ruling Communist Party.

Peng said in the video posted on Sunday that she had personally written a letter last month to WTA head Steve Simon, in which she denied the allegation of assault, and that an English translation of it by Chinese state media was accurate.
Simon had said at the time that he ""had a hard time believing"" that Peng had actually written the email or believed what had been attributed to her.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -The turnout for an overhauled https://www.reuters.com/world/china/how-hong-kongs-new-election-law-will-reshape-legislature-2021-12-18 ""patriots""-only legislative election in Hong Kong on Sunday hit a record low, as government efforts and last-ditch campaigning failed to boost voter numbers amid a crackdown on the city's freedoms by China. 
After the close of polling, turnout was 30.2%. Turnout in the previous legislative poll five years ago was 58%. The previous record low for a legislative election held after the city's return from British to Chinese rule was 43.6% in 2000.
The election - in which only candidates screened by the government as ""patriots"" can run - has been criticised by some activists, foreign governments and rights groups while mainstream pro-democracy parties are not participating.
Turnout is a central issue, as observers consider it a barometer of legitimacy in an election where pro-democracy candidates are largely absent, more than a third of the seats will be selected by a committee stacked with Beijing loyalists, and a crackdown under a China-imposed national security law has jailed scores of democrats https://www.reuters.com/world/china/hong-kongs-jailed-exiled-democrats-lament-sunday-election-2021-12-16. Civil society groups have disbanded.
Only 20 of the 90 seats were filled by direct elections.
""Clearly, the government's objective is to secure a high turnout. Otherwise it may delegitimise this election,"" said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of political science at Hong Kong's Baptist University.
The government on Saturday sent blanket text messages to Hong Kong residents urging people to vote, and some critics called on people to stay away as a protest. It is a crime in Hong Kong to incite someone not to vote or to cast an invalid vote.
Hong Kong leaders say the poll is representative. They insist the overhaul, like the security law imposed last year, was needed to ensure stability after protracted protests that rocked the Asian financial hub in 2019. 
Security was tight around the city, with 10,000 police and some 40,000 government election workers deployed.
'SITUATION CRITICAL'
Shortly before casting her ballot, university language teacher Tam Po-chu, 79, said the vote would promote stability and she hoped the new council would be responsive to the public. ""There's no use if they do not think of the Hong Kong people,"" she said.
Chief Secretary John Lee, a former security chief, urged people to turn out, saying those excluded were ""traitors"" who wanted the vote to fail.
By mid-afternoon volunteers were still pressing flyers on passersby near quiet polling booths, lampposts festooned with flags.
""The situation is critical,"" Starry Lee, the head of the largest pro-Beijing party DAB, said in a recorded loop played on a loudspeaker in the working class Wong Tai Sin district. ""I urge everyone to vote."" 
Lee's appeal did not convince local fruit seller Jack Ng, who said he would not take part in an election that was neither fair nor democratic. ""I don't understand why she is campaigning. She will win for sure, it is absurd,"" said Ng, who is in his 20s.
Others who said they would not vote expressed anger at the changes that some said had turned the poll into a ""selection"" and the legislature into a ""puppet"".
""After the election system was radically changed by the government, we can no longer elect our representatives and our candidates have been locked up by the regime,"" said Peter, a 21-year-old student. 
""Under this serious suppression, refusing to vote is apparently the only way for us to express our grievances."" 
With transport operators offering free train, bus and tram rides, many stations were significantly busier than the polling booths.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam had told reporters at the start of voting that she was responsible for the election being conducted in a fair and open manner, ""but not on the voter turnout rate."" 
After polling closed she said in a statement that the 1.3 million or so ballots cast were a ""show of support for the improved electoral system.""
Beijing's Liaison Office in the city did not respond to Reuters requests for comment on voter turnout.
Before Lam spoke, several protesters from the League of Social Democrats opposition group chanted demands nearby for full universal suffrage and waved a banner reading ""forced to be silent ... spirit of freedom, vote with your conscience"". 
In the run-up to the election, 10 people were arrested for allegedly inciting people to cast blank ballots, including people who had reposted social media posts from others, according to government statements.

Since China's parliament in March announced the sweeping changes to Hong Kong's electoral system, including reducing the number of directly elected seats, many opposition figures have declined to run, left the city or been jailed. 
Of the 153 candidates contesting the 90 seats, around a dozen say they are not aligned with the pro-Beijing or pro-establishment camp.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) -Islamic countries pledged on Sunday to set up a humanitarian trust fund for Afghanistan as, with millions facing hunger and a harsh winter setting in, Pakistan's prime minister warned of chaos if the worsening emergency was not urgently addressed.
The crisis is causing mounting alarm but the international response has been muted, given Western reluctance to help the Taliban government, which seized power in August.
""Unless action is taken immediately, Afghanistan is heading for chaos,"" Prime Minister Imran Khan told a meeting of foreign ministers from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in Islamabad.
The trust fund, announced by Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, will be set up under the aegis of the Islamic Development Bank.
Allowing Afghanistan access to reserves frozen outside the country would be key to preventing economic collapse, participants in the meeting - which included representatives from the United Nations, United States, European Union and Japan - said in a statement.
But it was unclear how much the fund would contain and the meeting did not provide official recognition to the Taliban government.
Acting Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said the government had restored peace and security and done much to address demands for more inclusiveness with respect for human rights, including the rights of women.
""All must acknowledge that political isolation of Afghanistan is not beneficial for anyone, therefore it is imperative that all support the prevailing stability and back it both politically and economically,"" he said.
NEAR-COLLAPSE
Taliban officials have previously asked for help to rebuild Afghanistan's shattered economy and feed more than 20 million people threatened with hunger. 
Some countries and aid organisations have begun delivering aid, but a near-collapse of the country's banking system has complicated their work.
Qureshi said unlocking financial and banking channels was essential ""because the economy can't function and people can't be helped without a banking system."" 
The scale of the challenge has been underlined by crowds gathering outside the newly reopened passport office in Kabul, where hundreds have been lining up for passports that would enable them to leave the country.
Beyond immediate aid, Afghanistan needs help ensuring longer-term economic stability. Much will depend on whether Washington is willing to unfreeze billions of dollars in central bank reserves and lift sanctions that have caused many institutions and governments to shy away from direct dealings with the Taliban.

Muttaqi said the Taliban would not allow Afghanistan to be used as a base for attacks on other countries and he said no reprisals would be carried out against officials of the former government.
But the Taliban have faced heavy criticism for keeping women and girls out of employment and education and excluding broad sections of Afghan society from government. They have also been accused of trampling on human rights and, despite their promise of amnesty, targeting officials of the former administration.

ROME (Reuters) - Pope Francis has said that men who commit violence against women engage in something that is ""almost satanic"".
He made the comment, some of the strongest language he has used to condemn such violence, during a programme broadcast on Sunday night on Italy's TG5 network in which he conversed with three women and a man, all with difficult backgrounds. 
""The number of women who are beaten and abused in their homes, even by their husbands, is very, very high,"" Francis said in answer to a question by a woman named Giovanna, a victim of domestic violence.
""The problem is that, for me, it is almost satanic because it is taking advantage of a person who cannot defend herself, who can only (try to) block the blows,"" he said. ""It is humiliating. Very humiliating.""
Giovanna said that she had four children to care for after they escaped from a violent home. 
Since the COVID-19 pandemic began nearly two years ago, Francis has several times spoken out against domestic violence, which has increased in many countries since lockdowns left many women trapped with their abusers.
Police figures released last month showed that there are about 90 episodes of violence against women in Italy every day and that 62% were cases of domestic violence.
Francis said women who were beaten and abused had not lost their dignity. ""I see dignity in you because if you didn't have dignity, you wouldn't be here,"" he told Giovanna.
Turning to other examples of human misery, he listened to a homeless woman speak of life on the street and a man trying to get back on his feet after 25 years in jail.

Francis has set up services in the area around the Vatican to give Rome's homeless healthcare, bathing, and hair-cutting facilities. 
In 2020, when a palazzo just off St. Peter's Square that was once a convent became vacant he ordered it to be turned into a homeless shelter, overruling suggestions that it be converted into a luxury hotel.

Britain formally exited the bloc at the start of this year but the two sides have been in talks to resolve difficulties over trade between Britain and Northern Ireland, a British province that shares a land border with EU member Ireland.
Frost, a core architect of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's tumultuous Brexit strategy, quit https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-brexit-supremo-frost-resigns-blow-johnson-mail-sunday-2021-12-18 on Saturday over disillusionment with the direction of government. 
His resignation raised questions about the future tone of the EU divorce and the immediate course of talks on Northern Ireland.
""Liz Truss will take over Ministerial responsibility for the UK’s relationship with the European Union with immediate effect ... and will lead the ongoing negotiations to resolve the problems arising from the current operation of the Northern Ireland Protocol,"" Johnson's office said. 
Following the announcement, European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR): ""My team and I will continue to cooperate with the UK in the same constructive spirit on all important tasks ahead, including the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland."" 
Frost negotiated the protocol, part of Britain's Brexit deal with the EU, which was signed by Johnson's government before it had second thoughts about it. 
Truss, a former trade minister who took over as foreign minister in September, is popular among the ruling Conservative Party's grassroots.

An avid user of social media tipped as a potential successor to Johnson, she backed ""Remain"" at the 2016 referendum on Britain's EU membership but is now a supporter of Brexit.
The two sides are due to resume negotiations in January on issues ranging from customs checks and controls of agri-food products moving from Britain to its province, which is in the EU single market for goods and so subject to EU laws.

He said the government would support a bill proposed by ruling LREM party lawmaker Patrick Vignal to allow children, when they turn 18, to easily change their family name through a simple procedure at the local town hall.
French citizens will be free to keep their father's family name, take their mother's family name or take both in whichever order they wish. 
It is already possible for French citizens to change their family name, but it is a long and difficult procedure that requires them to prove to the justice ministry a legitimate reason for doing so. 
""Nobody should have to reveal their intimate reasons for changing their name to the state,"" Dupond-Moretti said on his Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account. 
The law will be voted on in coming weeks.
In an interview with Elle magazine, Dupond-Moretti said the new legislation will make it easier to change the family name of citizens raised by single mothers or by two fathers or two mothers.

""It will be a law that will favour equality between parents and freedom for all French people,"" Dupond-Moretti told Elle.
The legislation would also be a solution for people wishing to change their family name after traumatic situations such as incest, or violence by a father against the mother of his children, he said.

MANILA (Reuters) -At least 72 people died in the central Philippine province of Bohol in the wake of Typhoon Rai, the provincial governor said on Sunday, taking the total number of casualties across the country to above 100.
Authorities ramped up relief operations on Sunday after Typhoon Rai hit on Thursday and Friday, the strongest tropical storm to hit the Philippines this year. It displaced more than 400,000 people, damaged homes and toppled power and communication lines.
The national disaster agency had already reported 31 casualties following the storm, but those figures did not include casualties in Bohol. The agency said it was still awaiting official reports from Bohol and other regions.
In the southern province of Dinagat Islands, the local government on Sunday reported 10 deaths, but it was also unclear if those fatalities had already been included in the official tally from the disaster agency.
Most deaths were due to fallen trees and drowning, officials said.
The widespread destruction has made it difficult for authorities to immediately provide a clear picture about the extent of damage, as communication and power lines have yet to be fully restored in many areas.
Rai, which at one point was a category 5 storm, made nine landfalls, with a massive trail of destruction also reported in the provinces of Cebu, Leyte, Surigao del Norte, including the popular Siargao surfing destination, and Dinagat Islands.
It uprooted trees, toppled roofs, flattened houses, destroyed infrastructure and flooded many towns, hampering efforts to send much needed food and water to victims.
The directive from President Rodrigo Duterte was to ""use all government resources to ensure that all goods are delivered as soon as possible"" to calamity-stricken areas, presidential spokesperson Karlo Nograles told a radio station.
Rai had displaced nearly 490,000 people in the Philippines before it moved toward the South China Sea over the weekend. 
In Bohol, home to some of the country's popular tourist destinations, such as the Loboc River, which overflowed, Governor Arthur Yap said the number of deaths was based only on partial reports, suggesting the death toll could still rise.

""It is very clear that the damage sustained by Bohol is great and all-encompassing,"" he said in video posted on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) account. ""People have suffered greatly in terms of destroyed homes and agricultural losses.""
About 20 tropical storms hit the Philippines every year, usually causing floods and landslides.

Some of the refugees who reached northwest Thailand's Tak province told Reuters before they went back over the frontier on Sunday morning that they had volunteered to return. On Sunday afternoon, Reuters reporters on the Thai side of the frontier were hearing continuous gunfire.
Provincial Governor Somchai Kitcharoenrungroj had told Reuters in the afternoon: ""More people are willing to go back as they are worried about their property there."" 
Human Rights Watch's deputy Asia director, Phil Robertson, urged Thailand not to rush refugees back to Myanmar.
""Everyone knows the Myanmar's military deliberately targets civilians with deadly force when it goes into the field, so it's no exaggeration to say these refugees are literally fleeing for their lives,"" Robertson said.
A spokesman for Myanmar's military junta did not answer his phone on Sunday. The army denies targeting civilians.
The Aid Alliance Committee, a Thai-based Myanmar migrants group, said about 1,000 displaced people were camping along the Myanmar border at various points waiting to cross into Thailand.
On Sunday morning, Reuters reporters had seen dozens of refugees who had been sheltering at a local Thai school being put into three trucks to be sent back across the frontier.
""I fled from Mae Htaw Talay. There was artillery falling into my neighbourhood,"" a refugee who asked not to be named said while standing in a truck about to leave for the border. ""I walked across the water to this (Thailand) side."" 
Kitcharoenrungroj, the Tak province governor, said that 623 refugees had been sent back and 2,094 remained on the Thai side, adding that all would be returned if they were willing.
Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military ousted a civilian government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1, triggering protests and sporadic clashes in the countryside between anti-junta militia and the army.

Fresh fighting broke out last week between the Karen National Union (KNU), Myanmar's oldest rebel force, and the military, forcing thousands from Myanmar's Karen state to flee.
Some crossed the narrow river between Myanmar and Thailand in boats while others waded through chest-high waters while holding children.

Russia this year banned Navalny's political network deeming it extremist as part of a crackdown on the group. 
Zhdanov's son, Ivan, who is based abroad, has said the case against his father is an effort by the authorities to punish him for his own political work.

In an act of suspected arson, a man entered a fourth-floor clinic in the western city of Osaka carrying a bag of liquid that caught fire after he set it near a heater and kicked it, according to police.
""Based on the damage, it is thought that the fire broke out near the stairs, which was the only escape route,"" Internal Affairs Minister Yasushi Kaneko told reporters, citing an ongoing investigation.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean leftist Gabriel Boric has widened his lead in the final polls ahead of the Andean country's presidential election on Sunday, though the polarized race remains tight against ultra-conservative rival Jose Antonio Kast.
Ahead of the run-off ballot, two private polls seen by Reuters showed 35-year-old former student protest leader Boric edging ahead of Kast, 55, a far-right lawyer who has defended the legacy of military dictator Augusto Pinochet.
Chile, the world's top copper producer and long a role model of market-oriented economic policy in Latin America, is set for its most divisive presidential ballot in decades, with both candidates from outside the centrist mainstream parties.
A private poll from Cadem, which surveyed 1,007 people with a margin of error of 3.1%, showed Boric taking 55% of the vote versus 45% for Kast, widening his lead over the last week when a similar poll showed him with 52% versus 48% for Kast.
A second poll by consulting firm Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which had shown a draw earlier in the week, now put Boric ahead with 51% voting preferences versus 49% for Kast. The survey included 4,062 people with a margin of error of 1%.

The country is in a two-week blackout period where pollsters cannot openly publish surveys on the vote, but private polls are often commissioned.
The first opinion polls after the Nov. 21 first round vote had favored Boric, though that lead had appeared to be narrowing until the most recent surveys.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Adrian Lau is one of a very few independent candidates running in elections Sunday for Hong Kong's Legislative Council. The elections are the first since Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law and a shake-up of the city's electoral system. 
The new system puts in place what the government calls an improved electoral system under the principle of ""patriots ruling Hong Kong"". All candidates must be approved by a national security vetting committee.
The major pan-democratic parties in Hong Kong, traditionally seen as the opposition, have not fielded or endorsed any candidates. Many opposition legislators resigned from the legislature in November 2020 in protest against the government disqualifying elected legislators.
Lau, running for the legislature for the first time, describes himself as an independent democrat.
He says there are some benefits in running and hopes to prevent the legislature from fast-tracking the government's initiatives without proper scrutiny.
""The best thing for us is that there will still be one person (in the legislature) who belongs to the democratic side. Someone who can keep speaking out for the Hong Kong people,"" Lau told Reuters. ""I will make use of the tools and resources in the Legislative Council, and make sure to keep speaking the truth, to keep speaking common sense.""
The Hong Kong government has repeatedly said that rights and protections, including freedom of speech, are protected by a national security law that went into effect last year.
In Sunday's election, only 20 out of 90 seats will be directly elected by the public, from a choice of 35 candidates. There are 153 candidates in the elections, all of whom were vetted before being allowed to run. Of these, only around a dozen moderates with different backgrounds say they are not aligned with the pro-establishment camp, with the rest comprising pro-Beijing and pro-establishment figures.
A Hong Kong government spokesperson did not respond to Reuters questions on why the number of independent candidates running in the election is small.
In February, police charged 47 Hong Kong democracy campaigners and former legislators with conspiracy to commit subversion for their role in an unofficial ""primary election"" after Beijing imposed the national security law on the city last year.
Soon after the arrests, China's parliament announced sweeping changes to the electoral landscape, reducing the number of directly elected seats from half to around a quarter, while an electoral committee stacked with pro-Beijing figures will select 40 of the legislative seats.
A new vetting body was also set up at China's behest and headed by senior Hong Kong officials to screen potential candidates to ensure only ""patriots"" run, according to government statements.
Lau, who is running in the legislative election for the first time, told Reuters he spent two weeks seeking nominations from pro-Beijing figures and got 10, the minimum required, through a business contact he declined to name.
Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a Hong Kong based political scientist, said the new electoral reforms had put the traditional pro-democracy opposition in a bind.
""The pan-democrats are facing a real dilemma because on the one hand, if you accept the new rules of the game, you can be accused of legitimising a system which is basically unfair. And if you boycott the system, you don't have a chance of having a voice in the new political arrangement,"" he said.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has said the elections were now ""much more representative with more balanced participation"" and would elect those ""who are patriotic to govern the city"".
Ng Chau-pei, a member of the National People's Congress and the head of the pro-Beijing Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, is a staunch supporter of the electoral shake-up. The pro-establishment candidate told Reuters he was running to help resolve deep-rooted social problems related to areas including housing, an ageing society, and a gaping wealth gap in the city. 
While Hong Kong's new electoral system has been criticised by foreign governments and overseas activists, some of whom have called for boycotts, Ng described it as a key and necessary step to improve governance in the city.
""In the past, the Legislative Council had been paralysed due to the interference of foreign powers and collusion between internal and external forces,"" Ng said. ""The government's work has also been obstructed, resulting in many missed opportunities with regards to taking care of our livelihood and economic issues.

Ng described accusations of dwindling freedoms in the Asian financial capital as simply ""electioneering"".
""Our current Legislative Council has 90 representatives, unlike in the past, where there were 70. What that means is that there is even wider representation. The participation is more even and spread out and all sorts of stakeholders will now be able make their voices heard.""

A senior police officer said the blast at a branch of Habib Bank Limited, Pakistan's largest lender, could have been caused by a gas leak, Sarfaraz Nawaz also told reporters that the building appeared to have been constructed over a sewage drain. 
""Our explosives teams are at work trying to ascertain the nature of the blast, but apparently the structure was constructed on a drain and gas could be a probable cause,"" he said.
In statement on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Habib Bank said an explosion had damaged its branch and caused casualties and injuries.
""Our sympathies are with the bereaved families,"" it added. 
A petrol station located next to the bank within the Sindh Industrial Trading Estate and cars parked nearby were badly damaged. Television footage showed the bank's floor ripped apart, exposing twisted iron bars.

""So far 15 people have died and 16 were brought injured to hospital,"" Karachi's administrator Murtaza Wahab said in a tweet. 
Another senior police officer, Sharjeel Kharal, told reporters it was not immediately clear how many were dead or injured in the explosion as the bank had a skeleton staff on Saturday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The jury in Ghislaine Maxwell's sex abuse trial may weigh whether the British socialite ""consciously avoided"" knowledge of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged encounters with teenage girls, the judge in the case said on Saturday.
Maxwell, 59, faces eight counts of sex trafficking and other charges. 
Prosecutors say Maxwell recruited and groomed four teenagers to have sexual contact with the late financier between 1994 and 2004. Three of the accusers testified at the trial that Maxwell herself inappropriately touched them when they were teenagers.
Closing arguments in the case are set to begin on Monday. U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan would then give the jury instructions before deliberations begin.
Maxwell has pleaded not guilty, and her lawyers argue she is being scapegoated because Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges. They have sought to distance their client from Epstein, whom she dated and worked for decades ago. 
During a Saturday conference, Maxwell's defense objected to a proposed instruction that the jury may convict her if they conclude she deliberately ignored any criminal behavior by Epstein.
They argued that since prosecutors elicited testimony from women who said Maxwell was directly involved with Epstein's alleged acts, the jury cannot also be told that ""conscious avoidance"" was proof of guilt.

""This seems to be here as some sort of backup option,"" Maxwell attorney Christian Everdell said. ""The theory they're proceeding on is that she's an active participant. They can't have it both ways."" 
But Nathan said that since the defense had implied in its Nov. 29 opening statement that Maxwell, despite her closeness with Epstein, was unaware of his alleged behavior, it would be fair to include the instruction to the jury.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) -Torrential rains in Malaysia have caused flooding that has driven more than 11,000 people from their homes, closed dozens of roads and disrupted shipping, authorities said on Saturday.
More than 66,000 personnel from the police, army and fire department have been mobilised nationwide to help rescue people stranded by flood waters and take them to shelters, Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob told a news conference late on Saturday.
Floods in Malaysia are common during the annual monsoon season between October and March, particularly on the country's eastern coast. But the downpour that started on Friday morning and continued into Saturday hit worst in the western state of Selangor - Malaysia's wealthiest and most populous region surrounding the capital Kuala Lumpur.
""It's a bit chaotic in Selangor right now... in other states, preparations would be made earlier for the monsoon. But in Selangor, this happened almost suddenly,"" Ismail Sabri said, adding that nearly 4,000 people in the state had been evacuated from their homes. 
Authorities at Port Klang, the country's largest harbour, said shipping operations were severely disrupted by the floods. Dozens of highways and roads were also closed. 
Videos posted on social media showed overflowing rivers, landslides, and cars submerged on abandoned streets. 
Ashraf Noor Azam, a 26-year-old resident from the Selangor district of Shah Alam, said he had not expected the situation to be so serious and had been forced to leave his car on the side of a highway.
""After four hours stranded without help, and the flood isn't getting better, we decided to walk in the flood,"" he said in a tweet with a video showing three people walking.

Eight of the country's 16 states and federal territories saw water levels rising to dangerous levels on Saturday, according to a government website tracking flood developments.
The Meteorological Department warned that heavy rain in Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, and several states would continue until Sunday.

LISBON (Reuters) - Billionaire Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich has become a Portuguese citizen, adding the European Union member country's passport to his Russian and Israeli ones.
A spokesperson for Abramovich confirmed a report by Portuguese newspaper Publico on Saturday which cited justice ministry documents as saying the Russian-born businessman had been granted Portuguese citizenship on April 30.
Abramovich's case was based on a Portuguese law offering naturalisation to descendents of Sephardic Jews who were expelled from the Iberian peninsula during the medieval Inquisition, the newspaper said.
Thousands of Israeli Jews have been granted Portuguese citizenship since the law was passed in 2015. The number of such applications has risen in Portugal since a similar citizenship offer to Sephardic Jews by Spain ended in 2019.
Applicants' genealogies are vetted by experts who also look for evidence of interest in Sephardi culture.
Abramovich has donated money to projects honoring the legacy of Portuguese Sephardic Jews in the German city of Hamburg, according to the Jewish Community of Porto's information portal Mazal.
There is little known history of Sephardic Jews in Russia though Abramovich is a common surname of Ashkenazi Jewish origin.

Abramovich made his fortune, now estimated to be worth $14.3 billion according to Forbes, in Russia's oil industry in the 1990s and bought Chelsea Football Club in 2003. He served as a regional governor in Russia from 2000 to 2008 and took Israeli citizenship in 2018.
Around 300,000 Jews lived in Spain when, in 1492, monarchs Isabella and Ferdinand ordered them and the country’s Muslims to convert to Catholicism or leave. Tens of thousands fled to Portugal, only to be persecuted there or expelled in 1496.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) -The Vatican on Saturday warned conservative Roman Catholics who have balked at Pope Francis' decision to restrict the old traditionalist Latin Mass that they were sowing division and engaging in ""sterile polemics"".
The Vatican department overseeing sacraments and liturgy issued a directive in response to bishops' requests for clarification following a document in July in which Francis overturned decisions by his two predecessors and tightened access to the Mass. 
Since July some conservatives, including bishops, have openly defied the pope, resulting in the latest chapter of what some have dubbed the Church's ""liturgy wars"".
Religious conservatives in the United States in particular have used the Latin Mass debate to align with politically conservative media outlets to criticise the pope over a host of other issues such as climate change, immigration and social justice.
""As pastors we must not lend ourselves to sterile polemics, capable only of creating division, in which the ritual (the Mass) itself is often exploited by ideological viewpoints,"" Archbishop Arthur Roche, head of the department, wrote in an introductory letter to the responses to 11 questions.
Saturday's document said conservatives who favour the Latin Mass cannot use such a sacred part of Catholicism to deny the ""validity and legitimacy"" of the reforms of the 1962-1965 Second Vatican Council, which included an opening to the modern world and dialogue with other religions, particularly Judaism.
It also made clear that pre-Vatican II Latin rites should not be used for other sacraments, such as confirmation.
Joseph Shaw, chairman of the Latin Mass Society in Britain said in a tweet that the document ""will have serious negative consequences"" and drive Catholics who want to remain in unity with their bishop to join extremist groups. 
Before the Council, Catholic Mass was an elaborate ritual led in Latin by a priest facing east with his back to the congregation. Vatican II modernised the liturgy, including more active participation by the congregation, and had the priest face the faithful to pray in their local language.
Traditionalists, who are a small but very vocal minority in the 1.3 billion-member Church, have rejected the new Mass, which is known as the Novus Ordo and entered into general use in the early 1970s. Many missed the Latin rite’s sense of mystery and awe and the centuries-old sacred music that went with it.

Both former Pope Benedict and Pope John Paul II had relaxed restrictions on the Latin Mass in an olive branch to conservatives.
In re-introducing the restrictions in July, Francis said his predecessors' leniency, while well-intentioned, had been ""exploited"" for ideological reasons.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean voters are split on what they want from the future ahead of a landmark presidential election on Sunday between polarized candidates - one offering social change and the other pledging to get tough on law and order.
The election will see ultra-conservative Jose Antonio Kast https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/chiles-kast-channels-pinochets-ghost-against-communist-left-2021-12-15 and leftist Gabriel Boric https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/student-leader-president-chiles-boric-eyes-historic-election-win-2021-12-15 go head-to-head after closing their campaigns this week, where they looked to win over middle-ground voters who could make the difference in a tight race.
""What is at stake now in Chile is democracy itself,"" said housewife Julia Acevedo, 80, who attended 35-year-old Boric's closing campaign in the capital. ""The country needs change and he, who is young, can make a difference.""
Kast supporters, on the other hand, want stability. They say Boric - who has taken aim at Chile's market-oriented economic model for stoking inequality - will undo decades of growth and stability and criticize his alliance with the Communist Party.
""I will keep supporting freedom,"" said Margarita Noguera, waving a Chilean flag stamped with a picture of 55-year-old Kast. She said she had lived through the ""leftist dictatorship"" of democratically-elected socialist president Salvador Allende in the 1970s. 
""I suffered a lot, like so many other Chileans.""
Angela Marambio, 53, said she had backed a center-right candidate in the first round in November, but was switching her vote to Kast for the run-off.
""Chile needs stability, order and security,"" she said.
'POVERTY LINE'
Kast, a lawyer and religious father of nine, has defended the economic legacy of dictator Augusto Pinochet, whose bloody military rule from 1973-1990 overthrew Allende in a coup and established the country's economic model.
Huge protests erupted in 2019 against that model, which many see as the reason for issues ranging from meager private pensions to expensive healthcare and education.
Cristian Morales, 51, a public official from Punta Arenas in Chile's southern tip, Boric's home region, said the leftist candidate could finally change things. 
""I do not believe he will be able to make all the changes that are needed, but he will accelerate the process,"" said Morales, citing plans for spending on pensions and education.
""If I were to retire tomorrow I'd fall under the poverty line. I have two young children, education is expensive. If we want more solidarity in society, the state has to get involved.""
Boric, who made his name leading student demonstrations for better quality education, has sought to channel the energy and demand for change sparked by Chile's 2019 protests.
Kast has done the opposite, with a tough law and order message that has appealed to a significant segment of the country weary of protests.
Enrique Zuleta, 41, a businessman from the coastal city of La Serena, said for years he voted for the center-left coalition that governed much of the post-dictatorship period and gave Chile a reputation for stability. Now he is backing Kast.
""I did not grow up in a right-wing environment at all, but today my vote is pragmatic, for the national good,"" he said.
""Kast has many ideological issues with which I do not agree. But... he has said that he will respect the laws. And that is important to me.""
Boric supporters say he will defend issues such as women's rights to abortion - allowed only in certain circumstances - and will respect sexual diversity, in focus after the country this month approved https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/love-is-love-chile-legalizes-same-sex-marriage-historic-vote-2021-12-07 same-sex marriage.
Kast has criticized both abortion and gay marriage.

Polls indicate women, especially younger women, are more likely to vote for Boric.
""I am afraid of Kast,"" said Andrea Ramirez, a 26-year-old public administrator. ""He worries me about the environment, the role of the state, the pensions of Chileans. And what rights will women have?""

OSAKA (Reuters) - The doctor running the Japanese psychiatry clinic at the centre of a suspected arson attack that killed 24 was praised as a stalwart supporter of mental health by a stream of patients visiting the site of the fire on Saturday. 
The fate of doctor Kotaro Nishizawa has not been publicly disclosed. His clinic in downtown Osaka offered treatment for problems including depression and panic disorder with a focus on helping patients return to work. 
""I suffered from depression three years ago and found myself unable to go to work,"" Toshiya Tanaka, 56, told reporters gathered at the scene.
""The doctor told me, 'Mr. Tanaka, take a rest. You don't need to do anything. You have depression. Please just take a rest.' That still rings in my ears. I was saved by his comment.""
The blaze began https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/patient-says-cannot-forgive-suspected-arsonist-fatal-japan-clinic-blaze-2021-12-18 when a man entered the clinic on Friday carrying a bag of liquid which caught fire.
""The doctor is such a good-natured person,"" said a 51-year-old company worker. 
""When I managed to return to work, he was really happy for me and truly congratulated me and told me, 'Let's live slowly and steadily.'""

The clinic, which was ravaged by the fire, aims to ""create a calm atmosphere that relieves, even a little, the weariness of tired people going home from work,"" according to its website. 
""He is a tender-hearted doctor. This is so regrettable. I pray for his safety and hope for justice for whoever is responsible,"" said a college student from the nearby city of Kobe.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong holds a legislative assembly election on Sunday in which candidates have been vetted for ""patriotism"" and pro-democracy candidates are largely absent, having declined to run or been jailed or forced into exile.
    The reshaping of the Legislative Council is the first major restructuring of Hong Kong's political system since the territory's return to China from British rule in 1997.
WHY IS THE ELECTION SIGNIFICANT?
    This is the first citywide election to be held under a national security law imposed by China that took effect in June 2020.
    Critics say the law has been used to curb fundamental freedoms of speech and assembly, silence opposition, jail pro-democracy activists and disband civil rights groups, in contravention of the terms of the handover.
    Hong Kong and Chinese authorities say the law has restored stability and ended the disruption that mass protests had caused.
    Article 68 of the Basic Law, Hong-Kong's mini-constitution, states universal suffrage for the legislature as an ""ultimate aim"".
    But Beijing has said the changes to electoral law plug the ""loopholes and deficiencies"" that it said threatened national security after mass protests in 2019.
    Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, said some former pro-democracy lawmakers had been ""anti-China disruptors"" who had caused chaos.
    ""National security and political security are inseparable. To achieve genuine national security, governance must be firmly held in the hands of patriots,"" she said in April. 
    WHAT ARE THE KEY ELECTORAL CHANGES?
    The legislature has been enlarged to 90 from 70 seats, with the proportion of directly elected seats reduced from half to less than a quarter of seats - just 20.
    A 1,500-strong committee stacked with Beijing loyalists will directly select 40 legislators from a pool of around 50 candidates. Thirty seats are filled by ""functional constituencies"", voters in various business and professional sectors, such as law and education.
    The Candidate Eligibility Review Committee, a group of senior Hong Kong officials working with national security police to conduct background checks on candidates for ""patriotism"", has discretionary power to disqualify anyone.
    Critics say the changes make it next to impossible for democrats https://www.reuters.com/world/china/hong-kongs-jailed-exiled-democrats-lament-sunday-election-2021-12-16 to hold any substantial influence or act as a check on the executive.
    WHAT HAS BECOME OF PRO-DEMOCRACY POLITICIANS?  
    The main opposition parties, including the Democratic Party and Civic Party, have declined to run for election, characterising the poll as undemocratic.
All 153 candidates were vetted by a pro-Beijing committee. About a dozen are considered moderate or independent, saying they do not align with either side, while the rest are considered to be pro-Beijing and pro-establishment figures.
    The pro-democracy parties had initially planned to take part in the election, which was slated for September 2020 but postponed due to coronavirus restrictions. In preparation, they defied authorities by holding an unofficial primary election in July 2020 in a bid to choose the strongest candidates and maximise their chances.
    On Jan. 6, the Hong Kong police arrested over 50 pro-democracy politicians. The following month, 47 were charged with conspiracy to commit subversion by joining the primary poll. Thirty-three are in prison awaiting trial, and 14 are out on bail.
    HOW HAD DEMOCRATS FARED IN PREVIOUS POLLS?
    Since 1997, democratic politicians have consistently performed strongly in the four-yearly Legislative Council elections, especially in directly elected seats, and have been able to control more than a third of the assembly to form a veto bloc.

    In district council elections in 2019, a few months after millions agitated against Chinese control of the city, democrats won just under 90% of the seats.
    Despite attempts by Chinese and Hong Kong officials to drum up support for this election, many observers expect public discontent towards the electoral changes and the continuing crackdown under the national security law to keep turnout low. Authorities say the security law and electoral changes have brought stability and order to Hong Kong after protracted anti-government and pro-democracy protests in 2019.    The voter turnout in 2016 was 58%, while the post-handover low of 43.6% in 2000.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong officials are working to boost turnout in Sunday's legislative election, according to diplomats and people familiar with the effort.  
    As part of those actions, two Chinese state-owned banks have appealed to workers to vote, said two people familiar with the matter and an email seen by Reuters.
    After a major rewriting of electoral law in March, with the government saying that only ""patriots"" may administer the city, Hong Kong is holding its first Legislative Council election with the city's main democratic parties fielding no candidates.
    Hong Kong's leaders - and China's leadership in Beijing, which pledged to maintain the financial hub's autonomy when Britain returned control of its colony to China in 1997 - are keen to ensure that the vote does not appear to lack popular support and fear a low turnout, two diplomats told Reuters.
Senior officials have made high-profile appeals to voters, and public transport operators said they would provide free transportation on election day.
    Authorities also have issued warnings, including to international media, that inciting a person not to vote or to cast an invalid vote is illegal. Some democracy activists who fled Hong Kong to avoid arrest have called on voters to ignore the election to avoid giving the vote legitimacy.
   The office of Hong Kong’s leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, and Beijing’s Liaison Office in the city did not respond to Reuters requests for comment on efforts to mobilise voter turnout.
    Ahead of the election, the two state-owned lenders sent emails to staff encouraging them to vote, according two people with knowledge of the matter and an email reviewed by Reuters.
    Bank of China (Hong Kong) sent two emails to local staff in recent weeks urging them to vote, and conducted an informal survey asking them if they planned to do so, the person said.
    In a Monday email seen by Reuters, China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) International urged its Hong Kong staff to vote. ""Please cast your sacred ballots for Hong Kong, and for yourself,"" it said.
    That day the bank made a public call to vote on its official WeChat account, saying voting would help to improve the electoral system and ensure there were ""patriots administering Hong Kong"".
    Bank of China (Hong Kong) and China Construction Bank International did not respond to requests for comment.
    In February, police charged 47 Hong Kong democracy campaigners with conspiracy to commit subversion for their role in an unofficial primary election after Beijing imposed a national security law on the city last year.
    Soon after the arrests, China's parliament announced sweeping changes to the electoral landscape, reducing the number of directly elected seats from half to around a quarter, while an electoral committee stacked with pro-Beijing figures will select more than a third of the legislative seats.
    Many prominent democrats are either jailed and awaiting trial or have fled to avoid prosecution.
    Hong Kong officials have also appeared to attempt to lower expectations for voting levels or to talk down the significance of a low turnout if it happens.
    Chief Secretary John Lee, Hong Kong's second-ranked official, said on Dec. 11 that foreign agents were attempting to obstruct the election. He did not provide evidence.
    Lam, the city’s leader, last week told the Global Times, a nationalist paper published by the Chinese ruling Communist Party's People's Daily, that turnout was affected by many factors.
    ""There is a saying that when the government is doing well and its credibility is high, the voter turnout will decrease because the people do not have a strong demand to choose different lawmakers to supervise the government,"" Lam said.
    ""Therefore, I think the turnout rate does not mean anything.""

    She has said the elections were now ""much more representative with more balanced participation"" and would elect those ""who are patriotic to govern the city.”
    Turnout in the previous election in 2016 was 58% of eligible voters. The low since the 1997 handover was 43.6% in 2000.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Ghislaine Maxwell's defense rested its case in her sex abuse trial on Friday after the British socialite told the judge prosecutors had not proven their case beyond a reasonable doubt. 
In two days of testimony from former employees of Jeffrey Epstein, a psychologist specializing in memory, and an ex-girlfriend of the late financier, the defense sought to undercut the testimony of four women who said Maxwell set them up for sexual abuse by Epstein when they were teenagers. 
Maxwell, 59, pleaded not guilty to eight counts of sex trafficking and other crimes. Her attorneys argued she is being scapegoated for Epstein's conduct. Epstein killed himself in 2019 at the age of 66 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on sex crimes charges. 
Maxwell told U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan that she would not testify in her own defense on Friday.
""Your honor, the government has not proven the case beyond a reasonable doubt and so there is no need for me to testify,"" said Maxwell, standing up in the courtroom.
Maxwell's attorney Bobbi Sternheim wrapped her arm around her back as she spoke. Defendants in U.S. criminal trials are not required to testify, and often do not, since the burden of proof is on prosecutors.
Closing arguments in the trial are expected on Monday in federal court in Manhattan. The jury would then begin deliberations.
Nathan advised jurors to ""be cautious out there"" before sending them home for the weekend. COVID-19 cases are on the rise in New York, and Nathan earlier on Friday said she wanted to avoid ""unnecessary delays"" to the trial.
""I want to see everybody back here Monday,"" Nathan said.
During the trial, Maxwell's defense sought to portray her four accusers as not credible, arguing their memories had been corrupted since the events were said to have happened between 1994 and 2004 and that they were motivated by the prospect of a payout from a compensation fund for Epstein's victims. 
On Friday afternoon, Maxwell attorney Christian Everdell read a stipulation agreed upon by both sides indicating that an attorney for one of the women, known by the pseudonym Jane, had told her that cooperating with prosecutors could ""help her case,"" without providing details. 
The lawyer, Robert Glassman, also told her that cooperating was the ""morally right thing to do,"" the stipulation said.
Jane testified during the trial's first week that she was awarded $5 million from the fund but did not think participating in Maxwell's criminal case would help her claim.

Jurors earlier on Friday heard from an FBI agent who interviewed Jane multiple times before Maxwell's July 2020 arrest. The agent acknowledged that Jane had not initially told them she was ever in a room alone with Epstein and Maxwell. Jane testified that Maxwell sometimes participated in sex acts with her and Epstein.
Jane, who said she was 14 when Epstein began abusing her in 1994, testified that ""memory is not linear."" She also said she was not comfortable enough during her first few meetings with the FBI to share everything that happened to her.

SAN JOSE, Calif. (Reuters) -Jurors began weighing the fate of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes' on Friday, after the prosecution and defense painted very different pictures of the entrepreneur who once dazzled Silicon Valley and is now charged with fraud.
In the final hours of a trial that has spanned three months, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Bostic said Holmes embraced dishonesty in an attempt to save the blood testing startup. 
""She committed these crimes because she was desperate for the company to succeed,"" he said.
After receiving the case on Friday, the jury went home for the evening. They were due to return on Monday.
Holmes believed Theranos would change medicine with small machines that could run a wide range of blood tests on a few drops from a finger prick, her lawyers have said, arguing the company's failure was not a crime.
But prosecutors say Holmes lied to investors and retail customers, including by overstating what Theranos' machines were capable of and the accuracy of its tests. She faces nine counts of fraud and two counts of conspiracy.
The meteoric rise and spectacular fall of Theranos turned Holmes from a young billionaire into a defendant who could face years in prison if convicted.
Once valued at $9 billion, Theranos collapsed after the Wall Street Journal published a series of articles, starting in 2015, that suggested its devices were flawed and inaccurate.

Holmes' attorney Kevin Downey said the evidence did not show Holmes was motivated by a cash crunch at Theranos, but rather thought she was ""building a technology that would change the world.""
""You know that at the first sign of trouble, crooks cash out,"" but Holmes stayed, Downey said. ""She went down with that ship when it went down.""

(Reuters) -Kimberly Potter, the white former Minnesota police officer on trial for fatally shooting Black motorist Daunte Wright, broke down in tears on Friday as she testified to being deeply sorry for mistaking her handgun for her Taser during a traffic stop.
Potter, 49, has pleaded not guilty to first- and second-degree manslaughter charges, which carry maximum sentences of 15 and 10 years respectively. Potter has said she thought she was drawing her Taser when she shot Wright in the chest with her Glock 9mm handgun on April 11.
""I'm sorry it happened. I'm so sorry,"" Potter said as she sobbed and shook on the witness stand. ""I didn't want to hurt anybody.""
The defense rested its case and closing arguments were set for Monday.
Potter was a police officer in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center for 26 years prior to the shooting, which triggered several nights of protests, with critics calling it another example of police violence against Black Americans.
The incident occurred just a few miles north of where Derek Chauvin, a white former Minneapolis police officer, was at the same time standing trial https://www.reuters.com/world/us/jurors-resume-deliberations-derek-chauvin-murder-trial-2021-04-20 in the case of George Floyd, a Black man whose 2020 death during an arrest set off racial justice protests in many U.S. cities. Chauvin was convicted of murder.
Potter and another police officer she was training pulled Wright over because there was an air freshener hanging from his rearview mirror and his vehicle's license tabs were expired. They then learned of a warrant for his arrest on a misdemeanor weapons charge and sought to detain him, which Wright resisted. 
Potter can be heard shouting, ""Taser, Taser, Taser,"" on her body-worn camera before firing into Wright's vehicle after he broke free from a second officer and tried to drive away. A third officer, Sergeant Mychal Johnson, had entered through the passenger side and was trying to keep the car in park.
Under questioning from her lawyer, Potter said that it was the officer she was training who made the decision to pull Wright over, and that she likely would not have made the same call, given that drivers were generally having difficulty renewing their registrations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Potter said she saw Johnson struggling with Wright over the gear shift with ""a look of fear on his face,"" and that she feared for his safety.
""We were trying to keep him from driving away. It just went chaotic,"" Potter said. 
She testified that she did not remember saying ""I'm going to prison,"" an utterance caught on police video, and recalled little else until she was met by her husband later in the day.
The testimony underscored a core strategy of the defense. Throughout the trial, Potter's attorneys have sought to portray the situation as dangerous for the officers, with Johnson at risk of being dragged down the street. They have argued that Potter justifiably used force even if she drew the wrong weapon.
Potter said she had a duty to find out whether the female passenger in Wright's car was safe, given that the officers learned when making the stop that a woman had taken out a restraining order against him.
Prosecutors have argued that Potter was a veteran and well-trained officer - including Taser-specific courses in the months before the incident - making her criminally culpable for the shooting. They called 25 witnesses, compared with eight for the defense, with many testifying about training and procedures.
Erin Eldridge, a state assistant attorney general, challenged Potter's assertion that she shot Wright because she was concerned for Johnson's safety, noting that Potter did not act like the shooting was justified in the immediate aftermath.
""After you shot Daunte Wright, you didn't behave like someone who had just saved Sergeant Johnson’s life. Did you?"" Eldridge asked during cross-examination. 
""I was very distraught. I just shot somebody,"" Potter responded.
""You didn't run down the street and try to save Daunte Wright's life, did you?"" Eldridge asked.
""No,"" Potter said through tears.

Neither of the manslaughter charges require prosecutors to prove that Potter intended to cause Wright's death.
For first-degree manslaughter, prosecutors must show Potter killed Wright while recklessly handling a firearm. The second-degree charge requires that Potter be found to have killed Wright through ""culpable negligence.""

MAYFIELD, Kentucky (Reuters) - Jimmy Galbreath counted his blessings too soon. His home in Mayfield, Kentucky, was battered but not broken last week by a tornado, and the 62-year-old former scrap iron worker planned to keep living there.
Then on Thursday rain soaked the state, with another downpour forecast for Friday into Saturday afternoon. As Galbreath watched, water leaked steadily into his kitchen, finding paths opened by two trees that had smashed into his house during the tornado.
""I can't stay in here, it's impossible,"" said Galbreath, who collects social security. He said he was looking to buy a camper to live in.
""This is going to be a long haul, it's not going to be no easy fix,"" he said of his uninhabitable house.
Rebuilding hard-hit Kentucky cities like Mayfield and Dawson Springs will take years, with entire neighborhoods and numerous workplaces wiped out by the most severe U.S. tornadoes in a decade. At least 74 people in Kentucky and 14 elsewhere died in the storms. 
GAPING HOLES
Many homes, businesses and churches in Mayfield, population 10,000, already have blue tarps nailed over their gaping holes, but on other structures, roofs and glass-less windows remain open to the sky.
As the rain began, water quickly pooled in streets as debris from the tornado's destruction clogged storm drains.
Some residents opted to stay in their damaged homes after tornadoes struck last week instead of moving in with family, or into shelters, as others did. 
Nearly all hotel rooms within an hour's drive of Mayfield are full, forcing even some out of town emergency personnel to drive a long daily commute.
Mayfield expects a further half inch (12.7 mm) of rain on Friday, with potential for heavier amounts, and showers continuing on Saturday, according to The Weather Channel.
Once the rain passes, temperatures are forecast to dip below freezing on Sunday.
David Burke, chief program officer for non-governmental organization Team Rubicon, said the weather is likely to force more Kentucky residents out of their homes.
With rain on the way, he said, Team Rubicon volunteers have accelerated the pace of fixing tarps to homes across the state and helping residents move valuables to more secure areas.
""There are a lot of homes that are a total loss, but a lot of homes that can still be repaired if they can keep the water out,"" Burke said.
Some shelter beds are available. Fourteen emergency shelters are open in Kentucky, Tennessee and Arkansas, enough for 550 people, said American Red Cross spokesperson Jenelle Eli.
One, recently opened in a Mayfield church, was empty when the rain started on Thursday but is expected to fill once the weather turns cold, a worker on duty said.

Mark Bruce, 64, who works for farm machinery dealer John Deere (NYSE:DE) in Mayfield, salvaged sheet metal from tornado debris to patch holes in his roof. As rain fell, he looked up and said he hoped it would be enough.
""We think we're in the dry. We feel very fortunate.""

The Department of Justice said Robert Scott Palmer of Largo, Florida, was sentenced to 63 months for assaulting law enforcement with dangerous weapons during the assault, which took place as Vice President Mike Pence and members of Congress met to certify President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.
Palmer is the first Jan. 6 defendant to be sentenced on the charge of assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers using a dangerous or deadly weapon. It is the longest sentence imposed so far in the investigation of the events of Jan. 6.
According to court documents, Palmer, 54, was among rioters outside the Capitol. While there, he threw a plank at Capitol police and Washington police officers. Two minutes later, he sprayed the contents of a fire extinguisher at the officers and then threw it at them.

Palmer was arrested on March 17. He pleaded guilty on Oct. 4. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan also ordered Palmer to pay $2,000 in restitution, and he must serve three years of supervised release following his prison term.
More than 700 people have been arrested in connection with the assault on the Capitol by supporters of defeated Republican President Donald Trump.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) and NAACP reached a settlement to resolve a 2020 lawsuit over election mail that the Justice Department said would ensure prioritizing delivering ballots in future elections.
USPS agreed for the 2022 mid-term congressional election to take the same extraordinary measures used to deliver ballots in the November 2020 election. The Postal Service also agreed for elections through 2028 to post guidance documents publicly reflecting its ""good faith efforts to prioritize monitoring and timely delivery of Election Mail.""
USPS general counsel Thomas Marshall said USPS ""agreed to continue to prioritize monitoring and timely delivery of Election Mail for future elections. This will include outreach and coordination with election officials and election stakeholders, including the NAACP.""
Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta said, ""The right to vote and ability to access the ballot is the cornerstone of our democracy. The department is pleased we could facilitate a resolution that reflects the commitment of all of the parties to appropriately handling and prioritizing election mail.""
NAACP President Derrick Johnson said, ""No one, including the USPS, should ever stand in the way of our constitutional rights. With the NAACP's ability to now monitor the performance of the USPS during national elections, we will ensure that the right to vote is protected for of all citizens, including those often suppressed.""
The NAACP sued in the summer of 2020 to ensure timely delivery of mail-in ballots. Several courts ordered USPS to take extraordinary measures to ensure ballot deliveries, especially since a record number of Americans opted to vote by mail during the COVID-19 pandemic,

USPS reiterated that it ""continues to believe that none of the Election Mail lawsuits were justified by the facts or supported by the applicable law.""
USPS will provide weekly reports on service performance during the six weeks leading up to general elections.

(Reuters) -Social media company Tik Tok said on Friday it was unable to find evidence of actual threats to schools on its platform that caused U.S. administrators and law enforcement authorities to heighten security, warn parents and cancel some classes. 
One of the country's largest school districts, in Florida's Palm Beach County, said in its letter to parents on Friday that local police were aware of a ""video circulating on Tik Tok nationally, encouraging violence in schools.""
Tik Tok said on Friday that it had been unable to find any credible threats on its platform, only ""alarmist warnings"" which were being removed for violating Tik Tok's misinformation policy. Palm Beach County Schools did not respond to a request for details about the alleged video.
""We continue to aggressively search for any such content on our platform, but we are deeply concerned that the proliferation of local media reports on an alleged trend that has not been found on the platform could end up inspiring real world harm,"" Tik Tok said in a statement.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a Friday Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post that the White House and federal law enforcement were ""closely monitoring threats of violence in schools circulating on social media,"" but did not specify where the threats were posted.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement posted to Twitter on Friday that it did not have information indicating any specific, credible threats to schools either, but encouraged communities to ""remain alert.""
The warnings began circulating this week as the United States was reeling from the deadliest school shooting of 2021, a November shooting https://www.reuters.com/world/us/least-4-hurt-shooting-michigan-high-school-suspect-custody-report-2021-11-30 at a Michigan high school that left four students dead and seven people wounded. It was the latest in a decades-long string of lethal American school shootings.
Most schools and law enforcement officials noted in their messages to parents on Thursday and Friday that this week's warnings of attacks were not specifically directed at their school, nor were they credible.
Multiple schools around the country canceled classes on Friday, though it was unclear whether the cancellations were connected to the perceived Tik Tok threats.
The superintendent of the Gilroy, California, unified school district announced online that classes at Gilroy High School would be canceled on Friday because of threats of violence directed at the high school on ""several social media accounts."" 
Gilroy High School did not respond to questions about the threats.

Other schools did not cancel classes but heightened security. The Fitchburg, Massachusetts, public school system said in a Thursday news release that police would be present at each school in the district on Friday as an added precaution because of an alleged Tik Tok post threatening ""every school in the USA even elementary."" 
The Fitchburg public school system did not respond to questions about the post.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia said on Friday it wanted a legally binding guarantee that NATO would give up any military activity in Eastern Europe and Ukraine, part of a wish list of security guarantees it wants to negotiate with the West. 
Moscow for the first time laid out in detail demands that it says are essential for lowering tensions in Europe and defusing a crisis over Ukraine, which Western countries have accused Russia of sizing up for a potential invasion after building up troops near the border. Russia has denied planning an invasion.
The demands contain elements - such as an effective Russian veto on future NATO membership for Ukraine https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/why-is-russias-putin-so-focused-ukraine-2021-12-15 - that the West has already ruled out.
Others would imply the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Europe and the withdrawal of multinational NATO battalions from Poland and from the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania that were once in the Soviet Union. 
In Washington, a senior administration official said the United States was prepared to discuss the proposals but added: ""That said, there are some things in those documents that the Russians know are unacceptable.""
The official said Washington would respond some time next week with more concrete proposals on the format of any talks.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Washington would talk to its allies. ""We will not compromise the key principles on which European security is built, including that all countries have the right to decide their own future and foreign policy, free from outside interference,"" she said.
NATO diplomats told Reuters that Russia cannot have a veto on further expansion of the alliance and NATO has the right to decide its own military posture.
""Russia is not a member of NATO and doesn't decide on matters related to NATO,"" Polish Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lukasz Jasina said.
Ukraine's foreign ministry said Kyiv had an ""exclusive sovereign right"" to run its own foreign policy, and only it and NATO could determine the relationship between them, including the question of Ukrainian membership.
It urged Moscow to re-engage with a peace process in eastern Ukraine, where some 15,000 people have been killed in a seven-year conflict between Ukrainian government troops and Russian-backed separatists.
'SMOKESCREEN'
Some Western political analysts suggested Russia was knowingly presenting unrealistic demands which it knew would not be met to provide a diplomatic distraction while maintaining military pressure on Ukraine.
""Something is very wrong with this picture, the pol(itical) side appears to be a smokescreen,"" Michael Kofman, a Russia specialist at Virginia-based research organization CNA, wrote on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Sam Greene, professor of Russian politics at King's College London, said President Vladimir Putin was ""drawing a line around the post-Soviet space and planting a 'keep out' sign"".
""It's not meant to be a treaty: it's a declaration,"" he said. ""But that doesn’t necessarily mean this is a prelude to war. It’s a justification for keeping Moscow’s hair-trigger stance, in order to keep Washington and others off balance.""
Presenting Moscow's demands, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Russia and the West must start from a clean sheet in rebuilding relations.
""The line pursued by the United States and NATO over recent years to aggressively escalate the security situation is absolutely unacceptable and extremely dangerous,"" he told reporters.
Ryabkov said Russia was not willing to put up with the current situation any longer, and urged Washington to come up with a constructive response fast.
He said Russia was ready to start talks as soon as Saturday, with Geneva a possible venue, but Russian news agency TASS quoted him as saying later that Moscow was extremely disappointed by the signals coming from Washington and NATO.
TROOP BUILD-UP
Moscow handed over its proposals to the United States this week as tensions rose over the Russian troop build-up near Ukraine.
It says it is responding to what it sees as threats to its own security from Ukraine's increasingly close relations with NATO and aspirations to become an alliance member, even though there is no imminent prospect of Kyiv being allowed to join.
The Russian proposals were set out in two documents - a draft agreement with NATO countries and a draft treaty with the United States, both published by the foreign ministry.

The first, among other points, would require Russia and NATO not to deploy additional troops and weapons outside the countries where they were in May 1997 - before the accession to NATO of any of the former communist states in East Europe that for decades were dominated by Moscow. It would mean NATO abandoning any military activities in Ukraine, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia.
The treaty with the United States would prevent Moscow and Washington from deploying nuclear weapons outside their national territories. That would mean an end to NATO's so-called nuclear-sharing arrangements, where European NATO members provide aircraft capable of delivering U.S. nuclear weapons.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Longtime Donald Trump adviser Roger Stone appeared before a congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol on Friday but said he refused to answer questions. 
Speaking to reporters after his closed-door appearance, Stone said he invoked his constitutional protection against self-incrimination in response to a subpoena from the House of Representatives Select Committee.
The Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects a person from being forced to disclose information to investigators that might subject them to criminal prosecution.

Stone appeared at pro-Trump rallies in Washington on Jan. 5, the day before the attack, and was protected by members of the Oath Keepers, a far-right anti-government group, on that day and the day of the attack. Several members of that group face criminal charges related to the attack.
At least two other high-profile witnesses in the investigation have said they would invoke that protection: John Eastman, a former lawyer for then-President Trump, and Jeffrey Clark, a former top Justice Department official during the Trump administration.

(Reuters) - The risk of reinfection with the Omicron coronavirus variant is more than five times higher and it has shown no sign of being milder than Delta, a study showed, as cases soar across Europe and threaten year-end festivities.
The results of the study by Imperial College London were based on UK Health Security Agency and National Health Service data on people who tested positive for COVID-19 in a PCR test in England between Nov. 29 and Dec. 11.
""We find no evidence (for both risk of hospitalisation attendance and symptom status) of Omicron having different severity from Delta,"" the study said, although it added that data on hospitalisations remains very limited.
""Controlling for vaccine status, age, sex, ethnicity, asymptomatic status, region and specimen date, Omicron was associated with a 5.4-fold higher risk of reinfection compared with Delta,"" the study, which was dated Dec. 16, added.
The protection afforded by past infection against reinfection with Omicron may be as low as 19%, Imperial College (ICL) said in a statement, noting that the study had not yet been peer reviewed.
The researchers found a significantly increased risk of developing a symptomatic Omicron case compared to Delta for those who were two or more weeks past their second vaccine dose, and two or more weeks past their booster dose. 
The study involved AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) vaccines.
Depending on the estimates used for vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection from the Delta variant, this translates into vaccine effectiveness of between 0% and 20% after two doses, and between 55% and 80% after a booster dose.
""This study provides further evidence of the very substantial extent to which Omicron can evade prior immunity given by both infection or vaccination,"" study lead Professor Neil Ferguson said in ICL's statement.
""This level of immune evasion means that Omicron poses a major, imminent threat to public health.""
TOO EARLY?
But Dr Clive Dix, former Chair of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, said it was important not to overinterpret the data.
""The conclusions made are based on making assumptions about Omicron where we still don't have sufficient data,"" Dr Dix said. ""For example, we have no data on the cellular immune response which is now probably driving effectiveness of vaccines.""
""This is a crucial missing assumption in the modelling."" 
Some of the conclusions are different to the data emerging from South Africa, where vaccines are holding up well against severe disease and death at present, he said. 
""There is a huge amount of uncertainty in these modelled estimates and we can only be confident about the impact of boosters against Omicron when we have another month of real-world data on hospitalisation ICU numbers and deaths,"" he said.
An earlier study by Britain's SIREN looking at reinfection risk in health workers, which was carried out before Omicron emerged, found that a first coronavirus infection offered 85% protection from a second for the following six months.
The data analysed by Imperial College was based on 333,000 cases, including 122,062 of Delta and 1,846 which were confirmed as the Omicron coronavirus variant through genome sequencing.

Imperial College's Professor Azra Ghani, who co-led the study, described it as ""essential for modelling the likely future trajectory of the Omicron wave and the potential impact of vaccination and other public health interventions.""
The new findings could accelerate the imposition of tighter restrictions across a number of European countries in a bid to stem the new variant's spread.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) -South Africa's health minister said on Friday that the government believed that vaccines and high levels of prior COVID-19 infection were helping to keep disease milder in a wave driven by the Omicron variant.
There have been early anecdotal accounts suggesting that Omicron is causing less severe illness than previous variants in South Africa but scientists say it is too early to draw firm conclusions.
The country reported a record number of daily infections earlier this week.
""We believe that it might not necessarily just be that Omicron is less virulent, but ... coverage of vaccination (and) ... natural immunity of people who have already had contact with the virus is also adding to the protection,"" Health Minister Joe Phaahla told a news conference. ""That's why we are seeing mild illness.""
South Africa has given 44% of its adult population at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, more than many African countries but well short of the government's year-end target. But among the over-50s vaccination coverage levels are over 60%.
Addressing the same news conference, Michelle Groome from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) said there had been an uptick in COVID-19 hospital admissions and deaths. 
""Starting to see a slight increase in deaths nationally, but once again this level is very much lower even than the baseline period we were seeing between the second and third waves,"" said Groome, who heads the NICD's division of public health, surveillance and response.
Waasila Jassat, a public health specialist at the NICD, estimated that of the COVID-19 related deaths that had happened in hospitals since mid-November more than half of the people who had died had co-morbidities, or tended to be old, and ""a fair proportion of them were admitted for other reasons and died from other causes"". 
She said that vaccination data on those who had died were incomplete but it seemed from self-reported information that 93% of the deaths were among either unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated individuals. She added that a further 3.5% of those who had died had been vaccinated more than five or six months ago.
Phaahla said early indications were that infections might have peaked in the most populated Gauteng province, where cases initially surged. 
He added that in the coming week the health department would report back to the National Coronavirus Command Council on whether COVID-19 restrictions should be adjusted.

President Cyril Ramaphosa, who tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday, is making good progress with his recovery from COVID-19 while continuing to receive treatment for mild symptoms, the presidency said on Friday. 
Ramaphosa was given Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s one-dose vaccine in February.

MOSCOW/DUBAI (Reuters) -A booster shot of Russia's Sputnik Light vaccine provides a stronger antibody response against the Omicron variant of COVID-19 than the two-dose Sputnik V vaccine alone, the medicine's developer said on Friday. 
Moscow's Gamaleya Institute said a preliminary study showed a Sputnik Light booster applied six months after a second Sputnik dose gave better protection against Omicron, which is driving a wave of infections in Europe.
""All the serum samples from (revaccinated) people that were tested contained the required level of virus-neutralizing antibodies in relation to the Omicron variant,"" said Alexander Gintsburg, head of the Gamaleya Institute. 
Gintsburg did not say how many people took part in the study, which compared the antibody response in people at different stages of vaccination.
The Russian Direct Investment Fund, which markets Sputnik V internationally, said in a statement two shots of Sputnik V also provided a strong defence against serious symptoms and hospitalisations caused by Omicron, contradicting an international study that found Sputnik did not offer protection against the new variant.
The efficacy of Sputnik V in combination with its booster could stand at 83% or higher, the same as it showed against the Delta variant, Gintsburg said. He said the institute would publish its findings in a peer review publication.
Russia reported 25 cases of the Omicron variant as of Thursday. 
Before the emergence of Omicron, Russia's health ministry had already recommended Sputnik Light booster shots six months after receiving the second dose of Sputnik V. 
DIFFERENT CONCLUSION
A group of international researchers, mostly from the University of Washington and Vir Biotechnology (NASDAQ:VIR), came to a different conclusion in a paper published Dec. 14, which has yet to be peer-reviewed.
Analysing blood taken from 11 healthcare workers at a Buenos Aires hospital who had received the Sputnik V's two-shot course, the team found no neutralizing activity against Omicron when they exposed the samples to the variant.
They found that vaccines by BioNTech-Pfizer, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) retained some activity against Omicron, but the antibody response was greatly reduced when compared with the early version of the virus first detected in China.

The blood samples were taken 7-10 months after vaccination.
The Russian Direct Investment Fund said the international study had ""deliberately used serum samples that are not representative.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden renewed pledges to protect voting rights and reform law enforcement at a commencement speech at South Carolina State University, a historically Black college, while stressing the deeply divided nation's future was in their hands. 
Biden traveled to the South Carolina school as opinion polls show he is losing ground with young voters and the future of his legislative agenda hangs in the balance in Washington.
He recounted his presidential campaign’s dire straits in early 2020 and his childhood stutter, saying he knows what it's like when people have low expectations.
""No graduating class gets to choose the world in which they graduate,"" Biden said in a comment that could describe his own term in office, where he inherited a once-in-a-century pandemic and sharp political polarization.
But he expressed optimism for the future, saying that diverse graduates are taking up judicial and executive roles during his time in Washington and changing the world.
""Your time here has come during a tumultuous and consequential moment in American history. ... Few classes every once in a few generations enter at a point in American history where it actually has the chance to change the trajectory of the country,"" he said. 
""I'm counting on you, I really am,"" he told the graduates. 
Biden lost the first three Democratic nominating contests of the 2020 presidential campaign before a win in South Carolina boosted him to ultimately win the national primary. U.S. Representative Jim Clyburn gave a late endorsement that was regarded as crucial for Biden in the South Carolina election.
The White House has so far been unable to push new laws on key Biden campaign promises that won him Black voter support, including reforming U.S. law enforcement and shoring up voting rights.
""The fight's not over,"" Biden said on police brutality issues. 
""Maybe most important of all we have to protect that sacred right to vote,"" said Biden, who has been in talks with senators about how to pursue Democratic-backed electoral reforms over the unyielding opposition of Republicans. 
""Without the right to vote, there is no democracy,"" the president said.

He called Republican-led attempts to curtail voter enfranchisement ""sinister,"" ""undemocratic,"" and ""unprecedented since Reconstruction."" 
""It used to be called the Republican Party,"" he said in an uncharacteristic swipe at the opposition. ""We are going to keep up the fight until we get it done."" But he gave no details about what legislative strategy would be used to push through Democratic-backed bills Biden has endorsed for months.

ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the United States has seen proposals from Russia to start talks that could help defuse the crisis over Ukraine and is speaking with its European allies and partners.
Russia said on Thursday it was ready to send a government negotiator ""at any moment"" to start talks with the United States on the security guarantees it is seeking. 
""There will be no talks on European security without our European allies and partners,"" Psaki told reporters.
""We will not compromise the key principles on which European security is built, including that all countries have the right to decide their own future and foreign policy, free from outside interference,"" she added.
Ukraine and the United States say Russia has moved more than 90,000 troops within reach of the Ukrainian border and may be poised to invade, which Moscow denies.
Russia says it feels threatened by growing ties between NATO and Ukraine, which wants to join the alliance, and the possibility of NATO missiles being deployed against it on Ukrainian soil.

Psaki said the United States has engaged with Russia for decades and does not see why the United States cannot do that going forward to reduce instability, but reiterated that it will be done in partnership with European allies.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday presidents Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden, who held a two-hour video call on Dec. 7, could speak again before New Year, though nothing firm had been agreed.

A U.S. appeals court on Monday rejected a renewed attempt by the Biden administration to end the policy - often referred to as ""Remain in Mexico"", and officially called the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP).
President Joe Biden, a Democrat, scrapped his Republican predecessor's policy soon after taking office in January this year. But after Texas and Missouri sued over the rescission, a federal judge ruled it had to be reinstated.
""We are concerned about the re-implementation of the Migrant Protection Protocol and the risk that it poses on the already stretched humanitarian capacity of Mexico to receive migrants,"" UN Human Rights Office spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told reporters in Geneva.
""We are concerned that any kind of heightened security procedures to deal with migration will only drive migrants further into unsafe routes and we are afraid that we will see more resort to the dangerous routes and to smuggling networks.""
Under the 2019 policy, migrants seeking asylum must wait weeks and sometimes years in Mexico for a U.S. court date instead of being allowed to await their hearings in the United States. Biden decried the policy on the campaign trail and immigration advocates have said migrants stuck in dangerous border cities have faced kidnappings and other dangers.
Nancy Izzo Jackson, Senior Bureau Official for the U.S. Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, told reporters on Thursday: ""We are trying to make it a much more humane policy, even as we work to appeal (the) decision in the courts.""

The number of migrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border has soared to record highs this year, sparking criticism from Republicans.
Many migrants arrested at the border, however, are quickly expelled without being given a chance to even seek asylum under a different Trump policy put in place at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which Biden has kept in place.

OSAKA, Japan (Reuters) -At least 27 people were feared dead after a fire swept through a psychiatry clinic in the Japanese city of Osaka on Friday, and police were investigating possible arson after reports a man had spilled liquid that fuelled the blaze.
The fire broke out at the clinic on the fourth floor of an office building in a busy district of the western city at around 10 a.m. (0100 GMT), public broadcaster NHK said.
A man who looked to be in his 50s or 60s was seen carrying a bag filled with liquid into the building, where he set it down near a heater and knocked it over, spilling the liquid and starting the fire, Kyodo News reported. 
Other media said the man was believed to be a patient of the clinic and that he carried a bag leaking liquid into the reception area before the fire started.
The man believed to have set the fire was taken to hospital and is in critical condition, NHK said.
""Most of the people who lost their lives could be medical workers or patients at the clinic. This is unbearable,"" Yumiko Inoue, a doctor from a nearby hospital, told Reuters as she looked up at the building's charred windows from across the street.
Twenty-four people were confirmed dead, NHK said. An official at Osaka city's fire department earlier told Reuters that 27 people had suffered from cardiopulmonary arrest, the term used in Japan before a death is officially confirmed. 
The fire was largely extinguished within 30 minutes, according to NHK, after engulfing a narrow, 20-square metre (215 square foot) room. Footage showed smoke pouring out of the windows of the building's fourth floor and roof.
Police had set up a special team to investigate whether it was arson, NHK said.
SUFFERING AND CONDOLENCES
Located in a shopping and entertainment district not far from Osaka's main train station, the building also houses a beauty salon, a clothing shop and an English-language school, NHK said.
""People who are struggling with illness have suffered this out of the blue,"" said 37-year-old Yukari Tanaka, speaking to Reuters not far from the fire-stricken building. ""It makes me feel very sad to think about their situation and their families."" 
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida offered condolences and said authorities were working to determine the cause. 
""When I looked outside I saw orange flames in the fourth-floor window of the building. A woman was waving her hands for help from the sixth floor window,"" a 36-year-old woman who works in an office nearby told Kyodo News.
The father of a doctor who ran the clinic was unable to reach him by mobile phone, he told the Yomiuri newspaper.
""Around noon I heard there was news of a fire on television and was surprised. My wife went to the site but we still don't know what's going on. I can't get through to my son's phone,"" he said.

The clinic's website was not accessible but an internet archive showed it treated patients for issues from depression and panic to sleep apnoea and anaemia, as well as counselling to help people return to the workforce.
An arson attack at an animation studio in the city of Kyoto in 2019 killed 36 people and injured dozens. A 2001 fire at a building in Tokyo's Kabukicho entertainment district killed 44 people.

LONDON (Reuters) -Boris Johnson said on Friday he took personal responsibility for the loss of a Conservative stronghold in an election defeat that showed public dismay over a litany of scandals and stepped up pressure on the British prime minister from mutinous lawmakers.
The defeat was described as ""a kicking"" for his Conservative Party, substantiating fears among some that its reputation and electoral prospects are now suffering under Johnson.
The centrist Liberal Democrat candidate, Helen Morgan, won the North Shropshire seat by nearly 6,000 votes, overturning a 23,000-vote Conservative majority from 2019.
""Tonight, the people of North Shropshire have spoken on behalf of the British people. They have said loudly and clearly, 'Boris Johnson, the party is over',"" Morgan said in her victory speech.
""Your government, run on lies and bluster, will be held accountable. It will be scrutinised, it will be challenged and it can and will be defeated.""
Johnson, responding to the loss of a parliamentary seat his party had dominated for nearly 200 years, said he understood the frustration felt by voters over what he described as ""a constant litany of stuff about politics and politicians"".
He did not refer directly to the criticism he faces on several fronts, including over reports his staff held parties last Christmas when the country was in a COVID-19 lockdown, but said people were fed up with hearing about ""stuff that isn't about ... the things that we can do to make life better"".
""Clearly the vote in North Shropshire is a very disappointing result and I totally understand people's frustrations. I hear what the voters are saying in North Shropshire and in all humility I have got to accept that verdict,"" he told reporters.
""Of course I take personal responsibility.""
TRADITIONAL STRONGHOLD
The Conservatives had won every previous election for the mostly rural area of central England since the constituency was created in its current form in 1983. Conservative lawmakers have been dominant in the region for nearly 200 years.
Several lawmakers in the party had predicted the Conservative Party would lose the by-election, but many were surprised by the extent of the loss.
""Voters in North Shropshire were fed up and they gave us a kicking and I think they wanted to send us a message,"" Conservative chairman Oliver Dowden told Sky News. ""We've heard that loud and clear.""
However, Dowden said Johnson was still an asset and would lead the Conservatives at the next election, due in 2024.
Opinion polls show Conservatives, who still have a large majority in parliament, falling behind their main rivals, the Labour Party, following an outcry over lawmakers' second jobs, criticism of the way Johnson funded the lavish refurbishment of his flat, and a surge in COVID-19 cases.
""This has to be seen as a referendum on the prime minister's performance,"" Conservative lawmaker Roger Gale, a long-standing critic of Johnson, told the BBC. ""The Conservative Party has a reputation for not taking prisoners. If the prime minister fails, the prime minister goes.""
Another Conservative lawmaker, who asked not be named, said: ""Serious questions now need to be asked on how the PM is going to get his house in order before we do it for him.""
The North Shropshire vote was called because the incumbent Conservative resigned after he was found to have broken rules on paid lobbying.
The government tried to prevent that resignation by changing rules designed to stop corruption in parliament. It was forced to backtrack after a backlash over integrity and trust under Johnson's leadership. 
British voters often use such by-elections to punish the governing party, but the scale of the Liberal Democrat victory suggests deep public dissatisfaction with Johnson's government.
Opposition politicians accuse Johnson of being a serial liar and incompetent leader, and some have demanded that he resign.
But despite growing discontent in the party, Conservative insiders say there is not yet enough of a groundswell against Johnson to dislodge him now, although they hope the vote will be a ""wake-up call"" for the prime minister to reset his agenda.

Any leadership challenge would require 54 of the party's elected lawmakers to formally register their lack of confidence.
""He needs to change now,"" a senior Conservative lawmaker said on condition of anonymity. ""He needs to listen to the views of his party.""

CHICAGO (Reuters) - As the Omicron variant gains momentum in Europe and the United States, scientists are rewriting their expectations for the COVID-19 pandemic next year.
   Just weeks ago, disease experts were predicting that countries would begin to emerge from the pandemic in 2022 after enduring a series of surges driven by the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants. First among them would be populations with a significant amount of exposure to the coronavirus, through a combination of infections and vaccination. 
In those places, COVID was expected to ease into an endemic disease, hopefully with less-severe periodic or seasonal outbreaks. Vaccines, available for much of 2021 only in wealthy nations, could reach the majority of the global population by the end of the year ahead. 
But the rapid spread of the highly-mutated Omicron variant, identified in late November, and its apparent ability to reinfect people at a higher rate than its predecessors, is undermining that hope.
Already, countries are reverting to measures used earlier in the pandemic: restricting travel, reimposing mask requirements, advising against large gatherings for the winter holidays. While it is not quite back to square one, much more of the world will need to be vaccinated or exposed to COVID to get past the worst of the pandemic, disease experts told Reuters.
""People are sick of the pandemic and God knows I am, but unless we can get some urgency to compel our leaders to take action, I really see 2022 being a lot of more of the same that we saw in 2021,"" said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.
    Even after COVID becomes a more endemic disease, new variants will spawn outbreaks and seasonal surges for years to come.
    ""There's always going to be a baseline number of COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""A lot of people haven't come to terms with that.""
The hope is that the virus diminishes to the point where it is no longer disruptive. But living with COVID-19 does not mean the virus is no longer a threat. 
Instead, people will need to be ready to adjust when the next variant comes along, said Dr. Tom Frieden, chief executive of Resolve to Save Lives, a global public health initiative, and former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""You need to recognize that at certain times, it's going to be safer to do things than at other times.""
    PANDEMIC PHASE ENDING IN 2022? 
    Some scientists are not entirely ready to abandon hope that some parts of the world will emerge from the pandemic next year. More than 270 million people have been infected with COVID, according to the World Health Organization, while an estimated 57% of the global population has received at least one vaccine dose, representing potential protection that did not exist two years ago.
    ""Even if that immunity is not as good against Omicron, it doesn't mean that it's worthless. And that immunity is more effective against serious illness than it is against getting infected at all,"" said Dr. David Dowdy, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins. 
    So far, most of the studies looking at the effectiveness of vaccines against Omicron have focused on neutralizing antibodies, which latch on to the virus and prevent it from entering and infecting cells. Blood test results from fully vaccinated people show Omicron has learned to escape neutralization; a booster dose might restore that protection. 
    Immune system T cells, which destroy infected cells, also appear still to be able to recognize the variant. Many experts believe this second line of defense will prevent hospitalizations and deaths.
""You still have a lot of people who are susceptible"" because they are not yet vaccinated, said Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist at New York University. She said that was among the reasons she believes it will be some time before the world moves from pandemic to endemic COVID-19.
   In the meantime, living with COVID in 2022 will likely mean assessing local risks and protecting oneself through vaccination, masking and social distancing.

    ""When I go to the store this afternoon, what helps me is to know how much COVID is in my community,"" said Dr. Robert Wachter, chair of the Department of Medicine at University of California, San Francisco.
    ""There will not be one state of the pandemic. There will be different states for different people and for different regions,"" he said. ""And that's going to be the way it is for the foreseeable future.""

(Reuters) -Less than a week after a swarm of powerful tornadoes devastated Kentucky and four other states, a freakish wind storm brought ""Dust Bowl"" conditions and gusts of more than 100 mph (161 kph) to parts of the Great Plains and Upper Midwest, meteorologists said on Wednesday.
The low pressure wind system, driven by unseasonably high temperatures across Nebraska, Iowa and Minnesota, triggered power outages in four U.S. states, including more than 100,000 homes and businesses in Colorado by Wednesday evening.
The storm system could also pummel the region with thunderstorms and snow, the National Weather Service said in an advisory. 
""There have been historic 'Dust Bowl' conditions with no visibility in parts of New Mexico and Colorado,"" said Marc Chenard, a forecaster for the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland.
""This is highly unusual,"" Chenard said. ""It's shifting east and is unusual for this large of an area, it will be going through the Great Lakes area, Michigan and into Canada by Thursday morning,"" he said.
The Dust Bowl refers to a period during the 1930s when severe drought and destructive agricultural practices disrupted the ecology of parts of U.S. and Canadian prairies. During that time, immense clouds of loosened topsoil regularly blanketed the region, leading to an economic crisis for farmers and mass migration to California. 
The wind storm follows one of the deadliest tornado outbreaks in U.S. history. At least 74 people were killed in Kentucky and 14 died in other states when that storm system swept across the Great Plains and parts of the South last Friday night and early Saturday morning.
President Joe Biden toured some of the devastated communities on Wednesday.
The National Weather Service said in its forecast that the high winds from the current system would pick up overnight on Wednesday and race across the Upper Midwest into Canada by Thursday.

""As a result, blowing dust and power outages will likely be found throughout the region,"" the weather service said. ""Extremely Critical Fire Weather also exists into this evening from the northern Texas Panhandle to north-central Kansas.""
The NWS Storm Prediction Center issued a ""moderate risk"" warning for the region and said blowing snow could create driving hazards across Minnesota and the Dakotas.

LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Frank Hardy, 18, has been homeless for the past eight years, moving in and out of shelters with his mom, or staying with his sister's family while his mom has been in jail.
As part of an economic stimulus package to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Congress voted in March to fast-track $800 million and urged educators to move quickly to aid the estimated 1.5 million students like Hardy who are homeless across America.
But the cash has yet to reach the Los Angeles Unified School district, which oversees Hardy's high school. Some states and school districts rushed their millions to those in need. But California has only begun disbursing the first quarter of its allotment of $98.7 million. 
The federal government authorized sending out a first $200 million in April followed by the rest last summer. 
Other big states such as New York and Florida are even further behind, having yet to deliver a dime to the districts, because of bureaucratic logjams or because some districts are ill-equipped even to find students in need.
""In the early part of the pandemic, the most stable place in the lives of homeless students - school - disappeared,"" said Barbara Duffield, executive director of SchoolHouse Connection, a Washington-based non-profit that addresses student homelessness.
Even with the return to in-class learning that followed initial moves to remote tuition, Duffield said, ""We know we're missing tons of students."" 
SchoolHouse Connection and the University of Michigan conducted a survey in October of 700 school districts and found a 4% increase in student homelessness, compared to the same period the year before the pandemic.
A STORY OF PERSEVERANCE
Hardy is on track to graduate in June from the Ramon C. Cortines School of Visual and Performing Arts, even after losing most of his junior year to the pandemic, living in a motel without a proper internet connection and trying to work off a faulty laptop.
""I was never going to let being homeless stop me from achieving what I want to achieve,"" said Hardy, who dreams of becoming a professional singer. 
Only 68% of homeless students graduated high school in 2019, some 18 percentage points below the national average.
Hardy currently lives with his mother Cherie Hardy, 51, at a People Assisting the Homeless shelter in Los Angeles.
Cherie Hardy said she has a record for robbery, theft and other offenses, but has straightened her life out in part because ""I have a son that needs me."" 
Many other homeless students have slipped through the cracks.
At least 420,000 homeless students lost contact with their schools during the pandemic, according to Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who along with Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia championed the last-minute amendment that provided the $800 million.
Schools are using the funds to buy food, clothes and school supplies. In some cases they are paying for car repairs or car insurance to get kids get to school, or cell phones so counselors can check in with students. Cincinnati and Nashville schools have hired Spanish-speaking social workers.
Cherie Hardy said she would have welcomed help buying her son clothes or a laptop. 
The Los Angeles Unified School District's homeless liaison, Angela Chandler, said the district is exploring hiring staff to identify and reach out to homeless students, and she would like to help high school students continue their education by funding college tours that might inspire kids who otherwise would never visit a campus. 
""The possibilities are endless,"" Chandler said.
But the second largest district in the country has yet to receive any of the nearly $8 million it is due. Funds from the first tranche of $883,000 should be sent out ""shortly,"" a California Department of Education spokesperson said on Wednesday. A second tranche of $7.1 million will be received in January. The spokesperson did not address why the process has taken so long.
Florida school districts could only begin applying for their share of $43.8 million as of Dec. 2, a spokesperson for the state's Department of Education said.
New York state has yet to issue any of its $58.9 million from the new funds. The application period of the first tranche was opened on Dec. 1 and closes on Dec. 22, its Education Department said.
Even Murkowski's state Alaska ""is a little bit overwhelmed with all this money,"" said Dave Mayo-Kiely, a program coordinator for homeless students and families in Anchorage.
Elsewhere some states were applying time-consuming rules the federal government had said were unnecessary, while in others state legislative or local school board approvals were slow to come, according to the education news site Chalkbeat.
""There are a million things that go wrong, things you don't expect to happen,"" said Phyllis Jordan, associate director of the FutureEd independent think tank at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., describing schools failing to find tutors to hire.
Some states have moved more quickly. 

Lisa Phillips, North Carolina's coordinator for the education of homeless children and youth, said her state followed federal guidelines and set up an approval process before districts made requests. Districts are getting funding within 10 days of making a valid application, she said.
More than half of North Carolina school districts have received their share of funds in the second phase of the program, with another 25% being processed.

MAYFIELD, Ky. (Reuters) - As survivors of the tornado that tore through Mayfield, Kentucky, last week come to grips with their losses, the Humane Society is focused on other victims: cats and dogs still inside destroyed houses or hiding under porches and bushes. 
Early on Thursday, several four-wheel-drive vehicles of the Humane Society of the United States left a budget motel in nearby Calvert City and headed off in three directions, looking for strays and hoping to reunite them with their owners.
""Sadly, a lot of people have died in their homes here, and what they're going to end up doing is just bulldozing this place,"" said Kitty Block, the Humane Society's chief executive, who headed to Mayfield. 
""Cats are hiding in the eaves. They are under the porches. They are inside the houses. They are under the bush in the back, and we just want to get them before this happens."" 
The Mayfield Graves County Animal Shelter is currently housing nearly 70 animals and has room for more, the shelter's president, David Spalding, said. 
Block said the goal is to bring the pets to the shelter and treat them as necessary, and then ""get the message out that people can come, get their animals, find their animals, and be reunited with them."" 
Block spoke as she tried to woo a gray, white and red cat to the safety of a carrier. Other Humane Society workers and volunteers tried to coax out scared cats from bushes and undergrowth, affixing notices to destroyed houses of pets found.
Some pet owners have had happy reunions. 

Mayfield resident Bill Kenney, held his 8-month-old dog, Sid. 
""I missed my boy,"" Kenney said. ""He's like my sidekick here ... He goes everywhere I go, you know, he gets mad if I don't take him.""

MAYFIELD, Ky. (Reuters) - Six days after a monstrous tornado descended on Mayfield, the devastated Kentucky city is still without power, its streets dark and dangerous when the sun goes down.
The twister leveled entire blocks in the city, while leaving other parts almost untouched. Downed power lines snake across roads and yards. The buzz of chainsaws is incessant during daylight hours as crews clear the last of the trees felled by the storm.
“We can’t call this home. The only thing we can call this when we look at it - I’ll be honest - is a junkyard,"" said Vinisha Stubblefield, 38, a lifelong resident. 
As of Thursday, 22 people were confirmed dead in Graves County, whose seat is Mayfield, a city of 10,000 people. The total includes eight killed in a candle factory that was leveled by the tornado. 
Even so Stubblefield - like many of her neighbors interviewed by Reuters - hopes to stay and rebuild despite the wrecked local economy and the threat of more tornadoes in the future. It is a dilemma that many communities have faced after major disasters, whether the victims of wildfires in California or hurricanes in Louisiana. 
In Mayfield, at least in the immediate aftermath of Friday's tornado, the emotional attachment to home seems to have won out over the uncertainty of job prospects and the emotional trauma suffered by many. 
Government aid may help. President Joe Biden walked through Mayfield and nearby Dawson Springs on Wednesday, surveying the wreckage left by a storm system that killed at least 75 people in Kentucky and 14 elsewhere. He promised to rebuild the communities that have suffered billions of dollars in damage.
Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said on Thursday that 16 people still are missing in his state.
""I need help from the government. I need help from the president, from FEMA - whoever can help me,"" said Beatriz Valero, 42, as she picked through the rubble of the house where she has lived for 20 years. 
FEMA, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is receiving applications from residents for disaster relief to help pay costs of temporary housing and home repairs.
The tornado had sheared off the roof and toppled some walls but largely spared the bathroom where Valero, her husband and 8-year-old granddaughter took shelter when the twister struck. The family relies on income from her husband's construction work.
The city is under an order to boil water for drinking or cooking, and it accounts for more than one-third of Kentucky’s 14,000 electricity outages. It could take days before crews can resurrect utility poles and hook up transmission lines. 
The sheer magnitude of the rebuild - with entire neighborhoods of homes and workplaces destroyed - is daunting. It may take a long time before Mayfield is made whole again.Pastor Stephen Boyken of His House Ministries in Mayfield said the most urgent need was shelter. Volunteers from the church were rushing to tarp homes and businesses on Thursday before forecast rains began.
""There's so many houses wiped off the map and many of these apartments aren't livable right now,"" the pastor said. Volunteers were also delivering about 150 donated generators to homes, he said.
Boyken said he expected some residents to leave, but for those with deep roots in Mayfield and Dawson Springs to stay.
'CHEATED DEATH'
Anthony Moss, a 34-year old electrician, plans to fix the Mayfield house where he lives with his fiancee and her son, although he is not sure how he will get the money. The storm pushed a 50-year-old tree onto his house, smashing in the roof and wrecking an upstairs bedroom.
He has no insurance coverage on the 57-year-old home. He hopes government programs will help him rebuild. 
Still, Moss feels grateful. His family, including their four American Bulldogs, were able to move into the basement. They have a generator and kerosene heat. 
Many of the homes around his were flattened. ""Look around here, my house is the only one standing,"" he said. ""I'm not going anywhere.""
Devin Perry, 18, lives with his mother Denise Jones, 37, who is in poor health, and a brother Tae Perry, 19. Two other brothers live next door. His family survived - ""cheated death,"" as Devin Perry puts it - but both homes are destroyed. 

The family plans to rebuild - somehow.
“This is our home. This is where we were born,” he said. “We have nothing left. But you can’t give up, because if you give up, that means everything you worked for was for nothing.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ghislaine Maxwell's lawyers began making their case on Thursday at her trial on sex abuse charges, calling a psychologist to testify about false memories in a bid to undercut accounts of four women who say Maxwell set them up for abuse by financier Jeffrey Epstein.
The four women testified for the prosecution that Maxwell, a British socialite, had a central role in grooming them as teenagers for their sexual encounters with Epstein. He died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges. 
Maxwell's defense said they could finish their case by the end of this week. 
Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to eight counts of sex trafficking and other charges. Her attorneys argue that the memories of the four accusers have become corrupted over the years. The alleged abuse took place between 1994 and 2004, according to a 2021 indictment. 
On Thursday, Elizabeth Loftus, a psychology professor at the University of California, Irvine, testified that people can confidently recall events that never happened and told the jury about experiments in which she and colleagues had successfully planted false memories in study participants' minds.
""Even traumatic experiences can be subjected to post-event suggestion,"" Loftus said. ""False memories ... can be very vivid, detailed. People can be confident about them, people can be emotional about them, even though they're false.""
Loftus, who said she was being compensated $600 per hour for her time, has been a witness or consultant for hundreds of trials, including those of Harvey Weinstein and O.J. Simpson.
Maxwell's lawyers have said the accusers did not mention Maxwell during initial talks with law enforcement, and Loftus' testimony could help them argue that their memories of Maxwell's involvement was shaped by news reports or questions FBI agents asked them. They say prosecutors are using Maxwell as a stand-in for Epstein.
U.S. prosecutor Lara Pomerantz sought to portray Loftus' work as irrelevant to the Maxwell case. 
""Have you conducted a study where you arranged for girls to be sexually abused?"" Pomerantz asked. 
""No, absolutely not,"" Loftus replied, adding that she had never conducted a study in which she attempted to implant a false memory of sexual abuse either.
Jurors earlier on Thursday heard from Cimberly Espinosa, a former Maxwell executive assistant from 1996 to 2002 who testified that she never saw Maxwell or Epstein engage in inappropriate behavior with underage girls. 

Maxwell was an employee of Epstein's at the time, helping to manage his numerous personal properties. The two were initially a couple, though their romantic relationship later fizzled, said Espinosa, who recalled Maxwell as a demanding boss whom she nonetheless admired. 
""I highly respected Ghislaine,"" Espinosa said. ""I looked up to her very much.""

SAN JOSE, Calif. (Reuters) - A U.S. prosecutor told jurors on Thursday that Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes lied to investors to obtain critical funding for her blood-testing startup, while her lawyer argued that she never meant to deceive anyone.
Holmes, 37, is on trial in San Jose, California, in a case that has shed light on Theranos' failed endeavor to revolutionize lab testing with small machines that used only a few drops of blood. 
""She chose fraud over business failure. She chose to be dishonest,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeff Schenk said at the start of closing arguments. ""That choice was not only callous, it was criminal.""
Holmes' attorney Kevin Downey told jurors that the government's case was misleading and incomplete.
""The picture can change quite a good deal as a result of waiting for the full story,"" Downey said during his closing argument. He said prosecutors had not given them information about Theranos' successful projects with drug companies, which were included in Holmes' defense case.
Theranos was once valued at $9 billion and vaulted Holmes to Silicon Valley fame. Wealthy private investors including media mogul Rupert Murdoch invested millions in the company after meeting with the founder, who was known for her Steve Jobs-like black turtleneck.
Theranos collapsed after the Wall Street Journal published a series of articles starting in 2015 that suggested its devices were flawed and inaccurate. Holmes was indicted in 2018.
Schenk, the prosecutor, recapped testimony from more than two dozen witnesses, including patients who had received inaccurate results from Theranos tests for HIV and cancer.
He recalled testimony from six investors that Holmes gave them false impressions that Theranos devices could carry out a broad range of tests and that they were being used by the U.S. military in the field. 
Statements to investors and patients form the basis for nine counts of fraud. Holmes also faces two counts of conspiracy.
Before finishing his argument, Schenk called on jurors to scrutinize Holmes' testimony, during which they saw encouraging emails telling her the company's technology worked. Holmes had also received emails with negative information from employees, including on test accuracy. But investors heard only the positive information, he said.
""There's another word for that, and that's intent,"" he said.
Downey agreed that Holmes' intent was the ""critical issue"" in the case, and told jurors that Holmes relied on positive internal feedback about Theranos' technology when she talked about the company publicly.

He emphasized that Holmes had sought approval for Theranos' devices and said that when problems became apparent she brought in outsiders to fix them.
""Are those the actions of someone who had been engaged in a conspiracy to defraud people?"" he asked.

BOSTON (Reuters) - The chief executive of a liquor distribution company was sentenced on Thursday to six weeks in prison for paying $575,000 to rig her son's college entrance exam and secure his admission to the University of Southern California as a fake football recruit.
Marci Palatella, 66, was also ordered by U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton in Boston to serve an additional six months of home confinement after admitting she participated in the vast fraud scheme at the center of the U.S. college admissions scandal.
She had pleaded guilty in August to conspiring to commit honest services mail fraud. Gordon also ordered the Hillsborough, California, resident to pay a $250,000 fine and perform 500 hours of community service.
Her lawyer, Jack DiCanio, did not respond to a request for comment.
Fifty-seven people have been charged in the investigation, which centers on a scheme in which parents conspired with California college admissions consultant William “Rick” Singer to secure their children's college admissions fraudulently.
Singer pleaded guilty in 2019 to facilitating college entrance exam cheating and using bribery to secure the admission of students as fake athletic recruits.
Fifty-one people pleaded guilty, including actors Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman. Two parents were convicted in October in the scandal's first trial.
Prosecutors said Palatella in 2017 paid Singer $75,000 to arrange for an associate to proctor her son's SAT exam and secretly correct his answers at a test center in California that Singer controlled through bribery.

She also agreed with Singer to pay $500,000 to secure her son's admission to USC as a football recruit using falsified credentials.
About $100,000 of that money was directed to a USC official, Donna Heinel, who admitted in November she facilitated the admission of children in exchange for payments from Singer's clients to USC accounts from which she professionally benefited.

More than 61 gusts of above 75 miles per hour (121 km per hour) were recorded across a number of mostly Midwestern states from 6 a.m. CST to 6 a.m. CST on Thursday, according to the weather service's Storm Prediction Center. The Norman, Oklahoma-based center also recorded 19 tornadoes. 
""It's certainly an unprecedented event,"" said meteorologist Matt Elliot, who coordinates weather warnings for the center.
Previously, in data going back to 2004, the most hurricane-force gusts in a single day was 53 on Aug. 10, 2020, Elliot said. Colleagues were collating data from earlier than 2004, and expected the record to hold, he said.
Wednesday's severe weather caused multiple power outages and disruption at Kansas City International Airport in Missouri, as well as reports of wildfires. More than 450,000 homes and businesses were without power in the affected states as of Thursday afternoon, according to the tracking website PowerOutage.

At least 75 people were killed in Kentucky and 14 in nearby states when a storm system packing a swarm of tornadoes https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/kentucky-survivors-vow-rebuild-junkyard-left-by-tornado-2021-12-16 swept through the region last Friday.
In Northern California, a blizzard closed a major highway linking California and Oregon after vehicles were seen skidding or getting stuck on Interstate 5, the state's Department of Transportation said.

PARIS (Reuters) -French data privacy watchdog CNIL has ordered U.S.-based Clearview AI, a facial recognition company that has collected 10 billion images worldwide, to stop amassing and using data from people based in France.
In a formal demand disclosed on Thursday, the CNIL stressed that Clearview's collection of publicly-available facial images on social media and the Internet had no legal basis and breached European Union rules on data privacy, known as GDPR.
The company denied the breaches. 
""Clearview AI does not have a place of business in France or the EU, it does not have any customers in France or the EU, and does not undertake any activities that would otherwise mean it is subject to the GDPR"", said the company's CEO, Hoan Ton-That.
Under EU law, the regulatory framework of the GDPR can apply in some cases where data of EU-based users of internet services are tracked and processed, even if the provider has no physical presence inside the bloc. 
'SENSITIVE' DATA 
The French regulator said the software company, which is used as a search engine for faces to help law enforcement and intelligence agencies in their investigations, failed to ask for the prior consent of those whose images it collected online.
""These biometric data are particularly sensitive, notably because they are linked to our physical identity (what we are) and allow us to be identified in a unique way,"" the authority said in a statement. 
It said the New York-based firm failed to give those concerned proper access to their data, notably by limiting access to twice a year, without justification, and by limiting this right to data racked up during the 12 months before any request. 
In an e-mailed statement, Clearview's Ton-That said he had always liked France and had ""deep respect"" for its people. 
He said he was ""heartbroken"" by the way some in France had misinterpreted his company's activities, adding that its sole aim was ""to help communities and their people to live better, safer lives"".
EU law provides for citizens to seek the removal of their personal data from a privately-owned database. The CNIL said Clearview had two months to abide by its demands or it could face a sanction. 
The decision follows several complaints, among them one by advocacy group Privacy International. It follows a similar order by its Australian peer, which told Clearview to stop collecting images from websites and destroy data collected in the country.
The U.K. Information Commissioner's Office, which worked with the Australians on the Clearview investigation, also said last month it intended to fine Clearview 17 million pounds ($22.59 million) for alleged breaches of data protection law.

WASHINGTON ( Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Foundation) - U.S. vaccine mandates are giving workers greater negotiating power, experts say, as the threat of strikes and collective action wins concessions for workers pummeled by the pandemic.
They say that labor unions, already enjoying a resurgence of interest under a broader push for workers’ rights, can use the mandates to negotiate better working conditions for members as they prep for a post-pandemic economy. 
""I’ve been telling people that there’s nothing like a good pandemic to increase the power of labor, and I think that's what we've seen happen here,"" said Jon E. Anderson, a partner at the law firm Husch Blackwell who works on labor issues.
Even as courts have blocked several vaccine mandates, other COVID-19 jab requirements are giving unions an opportunity to negotiate under federal labor law. And it is one they are using.
""The pandemic is a scary situation, and we would hope that (employees) would run to their employer for concerns about safety,"" Anderson said. ""But they’re running to the union and that’s certainly in their right to make that choice.""
So it could be that in discussing jabs or workplace safety, Anderson said, that the focus can shift to pay as workers - noting the widespread staff shortages - push for more money.
""Everything’s negotiable,"" he said. ""There’s always the potential for bargaining to morph into something else.""
Other points of contention - and so negotiation - can include exemptions for pregnant women or leeway for workers who get vaccinated but still test positive, he said.
TREND IS DOWN 
Workers at big firms - from Kellogg’s to Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) - have also called strikes and tested the heft of collective action as unions look to reverse a long-running drop in membership.
For the United States, the percentage of wage and salary workers who were members of unions was 10.8% in 2020 – part of a decades-long downturn - but it had ticked up slightly from 10.3% in 2019. 
And more than two-thirds of Americans approve of unions, according to a Gallup poll released in September – the highest share since 1965. 
Americans ""want to have unions"" and understand they can check employer power and give workers a voice, said Randi Weingarten (NYSE:WRI), who heads the second-largest U.S. teachers union.
""Bargaining solves problems,"" the president of the American Federation of Teachers told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. 
""People who haven’t bargained and don’t have the muscle of bargaining don’t understand that it’s about problem solving.""
Under emergency pandemic rules, announced by the federal government in November, businesses with 100 or more employees had to develop plans to require employees be vaccinated, or be tested for COVID-19 regularly. 
Those rules have been put on hold by the courts, but similar mandates are in effect and moving forward.
    BUILDING TRUST
When  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) - a mega meat processor and exporter - announced its vaccine mandate, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union used it to strike what it called the ""first national U.S. agreement"" to give meatpacking workers paid sick leave.
    The agreement ""helps to ensure policies like paid leave...are also permanent improvements that strengthen these jobs and protect these workers for years to come,"" said UFCW International President Marc Perrone after September's deal.
    Tyson had separately offered $200 bonuses for frontline workers who get vaccinated. 
    ""The union said, 'you know, this is what unionization can get you because in a non-union slaughterhouse it ain’t nothing like this,'"" said Robert Bruno, a labor expert at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. 
GLOBAL PICTURE
Beyond the United States, vaccine mandates are generating significant pushback in some areas where vaccination rates have lagged and supplies of the jab are less plentiful.
A Kenyan court recently blocked moves to bar unvaccinated people from accessing certain government services amid criticism from advocacy groups it violated human rights.
From Italy to Canada, unions have fought vaccine requirements, saying they infringe on workers' rights.
Newly approved COVID-19 restrictions and requirements in Britain, including mandatory jabs for National Health Service (NHS) workers, have prompted one of the biggest revolts against Prime Minister Boris Johnson since he assumed office. 

Mandates may not be popular with either staff or employers, but they do provide an opportunity for both sides to talk. 
""The mandate is something that I don’t think employers necessarily wanted, I’m not sure unions wanted,"" Anderson said. ""But they’re dealing with it.""

Two boys and two girls in their final year of primary school died in the accident in Devonport, in the northwest of Tasmania state, about 10 a.m. (2300 GMT on Wednesday). Five more children were in hospital, four in critical condition, authorities said.
There was no immediate explanation for how the jumping castle became airborne, and no other details were released of the children's identities except that the incident took place at Hillcrest Primary School. Students in the last year of primary school, Year 6, are typically aged 10 or 11.
The accident would rank among Australia's deadliest involving an amusement ride, and brought on a wave of disbelief and mourning.
""On a day when these children were meant to be celebrating their last day of primary school, instead we're all mourning their loss,"" Tasmania Police Commissioner Darren Hine told reporters.
""Our hearts are breaking for the families and the loved ones, schoolmates, teachers of these young people who were taken too soon.
Tasmanian premier Peter Gutwein said ""it is simply inconceivable that this shocking tragedy has occurred"" and promised a thorough investigation.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison described the incident as ""shattering and heartbreaking"". 
""Young children on a fun day out, together with their families and it turns to such horrific tragedy at this time of year. It just breaks your heart,"" Morrison told reporters.
Hine, the police commissioner, said after an initial investigation the accident would be referred to a coroner for an inquest.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Divisions within the European Union have deepened over travel rules to curb the spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus, after Italy and Greece followed Portugal and Ireland in announcing additional curbs on travellers from other EU states.
The EU's 27 member states have been debating for weeks how to coordinate travel policy, with the aim of containing the virus without disproportionately disrupting travel within the border-free European Schengen area.
However, Italy said on Tuesday that from Dec. 16 until the end of January it would require all travellers from EU countries to show a negative test on arrival, even if they are vaccinated. The unvaccinated will face a five-day quarantine.
If applied strictly, the rules - which take effect on Thursday - would effectively restore frontier checks at Italy's land borders, echoing measures adopted by EU countries at the start of the pandemic. These triggered queues at the borders and caused shortages of food and medicines around the bloc.
""I have only seen that closing borders is in any case not the solution,"" Luxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel told reporters as he arrived for a summit of EU leaders in Brussels.
The summit conclusions say any restrictions should be coordinated, based on objective criteria, and should not ""disproportionately hamper free movement between Member States"". 
Latvian Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins said freedom of travel inside the EU must not end.
CERTIFICATE
An EU diplomat was more explicit: ""Adding tests to vaccine certificates means undermining the value of the COVID-19 certificate.""
The EU introduced its COVID-19 certificate in July. It allows holders to travel freely across EU borders if they have been vaccinated against the disease, have recovered or have had a recent negative test.
The European Commission proposed on November 25 a tweak to the COVID pass that would make proof of vaccination sufficient for unhindered movement across the EU for nine months after completion of the primary vaccination cycle.
The proposal has not yet been approved by member states.
Portugal introduced a requirement for additional negative tests on the very day the Commission made its proposal. Ireland mirrored that move a few days later.
Greece announced the same measure on Wednesday, to take effect on Dec. 19. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said it would apply only for the Christmas period and was meant to gain time against the spread of Omicron as Greece sped up its campaign to give a booster dose to all adults.
Preliminary data show vaccines are less effective against Omicron, but a booster increases protection.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said on Wednesday Omicron was more transmissible and likely to become the dominant variant in Europe within the first two months of 2022.
However, it did not propose travel restrictions because it said the variant was already present in many EU states and was often transmitted locally. 
Last week the Commission proposed that member states require a negative test only for people, including the vaccinated, arriving from outside the EU, officials said. That measure, still under discussion, faces opposition from some states.
If approved, it could pave the way for the lifting of an EU travel ban on southern African states that was imposed after the Omicron variant was detected there in November, officials said, but many governments remain cautious.

The expiry of the COVID-19 pass after nine months is less controversial but several states have asked to wait until more is known about Omicron.
A meeting of EU diplomats is scheduled for Dec. 21 to discuss the matter.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - For scores of Hong Kong democrats, this year's legislative elections were supposed to be a landmark moment for the movement in the face of what they saw as increasing encroachment on Hong Kong's way of life by China. 
Democrats had thought they would win a majority that would give them a strong say in the future of the former British colony. 
    But instead of holding rallies for the upcoming election, many are now detained and awaiting trial, living a daily prison routine of sleep, exercise, meals and study while rationed to two pens and six books a month. Others have fled the territory.
    ""Everything happened so fast,"" said Sunny Cheung, 25, an activist who is seeking asylum in the United States to avoid prosecution. ""One year later, there are hardly any real democrats left. They are either in jail or in exile."" 
""This is the reason we must stick to our principles and not forget our history, especially when many leading democrats sacrificed their freedom and are now behind bars.""
Reuters spoke to six democrats, some in prison, others in exile or on bail, ahead of Sunday's poll. The vote had been scheduled for September 2020 but was postponed on COVID-19 grounds. 
In February, police charged 47 Hong Kong democracy campaigners with conspiracy to commit subversion for their role in an unofficial ""primary election"" after Beijing imposed a national security law on the city last year. 
Soon after the arrests, China's parliament announced sweeping changes to the electoral landscape, reducing the number of directly elected seats from half to around a quarter, while an electoral committee stacked with pro-Beijing figures will select more than a third of the legislative seats.
A new vetting body was also set up at China's behest and headed by senior Hong Kong officials to screen potential candidates to ensure only ""patriots"" run, according to government statements. 
Since then, the government prosecution has repeatedly been granted more time by the courts to prepare its case, while most of those arrested remain in six prisons across Hong Kong pending the start of their trial. 
In late November, Magistrate Peter Law adjourned the case until March, partly to allow more time for the translation of nearly 10,000 pages of documentary evidence put forward by the prosecution.
Three lawyers for the democrats, speaking anonymously in an effort to protect their clients, told Reuters the prosecution has yet to provide a detailed summary of its allegations, making it difficult to provide legal advice, in a departure from standard criminal procedures. No reason has been publicly given for this delay. 
Hong Kong's Constitutional Affairs bureau and the Department of Justice did not respond to Reuters questions.
Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng said in a statement on Thursday the ""age, profession and background of the candidates are more diverse than those in previous elections"".
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has said the elections were now ""much more representative with more balanced participation"" and would elect those ""who are patriotic to govern the city.""
PRISON ROUTINE 
The 33 democrats now behind bars won't appear in court again until March, with no indication yet on when their trial will begin. 
Hong Kong's largest men's prison, Stanley, holds high profile democrats who played a role in the primary election including Benny Tai, 57, and Leung Kwok-hung, 65. Joshua Wong, 25, is serving time at a jail on another island. 
Some have opted for solitary confinement, others have been integrated into larger groups of prisoners. 
Female inmates such as Claudia Mo, 64, and Tiffany Yuen, 28, who also took part in the primary election are being held in a separate prison in the New Territories. Two people familiar with the situation said Yuen was placed in solitary confinement in September after what authorities described as unrest at the prison. 
Hong Kong democracy campaigners in prison https://graphics.reuters.com/HONGKONG-ELECTION/DEMOCRATS/byvrjqdrbve/HK-Prison_AB.jpg 
The Correctional Services Department told Reuters that while it wouldn't comment on an individual case, it is ""empowered to impose separate confinement as punishment on persons in custody who have committed offences against prison discipline.""
The jailed democrats describe a daily routine of sleep, exercise, meals and study. 
After reveille just after dawn, an hour is allowed for exercise and showers. Male inmates can run or play sports including football and basketball with communal brown shoes taken from a trolley, under guard from correctional officers. 
For those held in custody but not convicted of any charges, two visitors are allowed daily, as are deliveries of food. Some have taken to writing essays, books and plays with their ration of two pens, according to three people with direct knowledge, while others read or study, with six books allowed per month. 
'POINT OF RESISTANCE'
Britain detailed the arrests of the democrats in its six-monthly report on Hong Kong released on Tuesday, warning of the “curtailing of space for the free expression of alternative views continues to weaken checks and balances on executive power”.
The March electoral changes ""meant that parties not closely aligned with the mainland or that are not pro-establishment will be excluded almost entirely from the legislature,” it added.
Fourteen of the group, which includes former legislators and lawyers, have been granted bail. 
Despite legal risks, several of those who spoke to Reuters said Hong Kong people should ignore the election or cast blank ballots. The city's anti-corruption watchdog arrested 10 people in recent weeks for alleged incitement to cast blank votes. 
""There is little we can do now, but this is a point of resistance,"" said another of the democrats, referring to the casting of blank votes and shunning the election. ""Whether you're in exile, or in jail, or a part of Hong Kong society still, don't let the external environment corrode you.""
In the primary poll last July, democrats ran street booths and debated their platforms with citizens and rivals, in a bid to put forward their best candidates. 
Nearly 600,000 people cast ballots at pop-up stations - around 15% of the city's 4 million registered voters.
A district council election in late 2019 saw the democrats sweep 90% of the nearly 500 seats with a record turnout rate of 71%.
While democrats in prison can vote, those abroad are barred, though all mainstream opposition parties including the Democratic Party have decided not to contest the election on the grounds it is undemocratic. 
Authorities have been working to drum up support for the election, arranging free transport to polling stations and taking to social media to urge people to cast votes. 
""They want to see many people vote to show that there's no problem, everything is normal,"" said Cheung. ""But we must tell Beijing that we will not cooperate with the act."" 
Exiled activist Nathan Law, who was also a candidate in the primary election, told Reuters this month the Dec. 19 poll was no more than a ""selection by Beijing"".
Of the 153 candidates running for the 90 seats, an overwhelming majority are pro-Beijing and pro-establishment figures, with only a handful of so-called moderates. 

Senior Chinese official Xia Baolong said recently that ""destabilising forces"" would be barred from running and the poll would be ""positive"".
Lam, Hong Kong's leader, also said earlier that democrats, as long as they proved ""patriotic"", were welcome to run.

(Reuters) -Less than a week after a swarm of powerful tornadoes devastated Kentucky and four other states, a freakish wind storm brought ""Dust Bowl"" conditions and gusts of more than 100 mph (161 kph) to parts of the Great Plains and Upper Midwest, meteorologists said on Wednesday.
The low pressure wind system, driven by unseasonably high temperatures across Nebraska, Iowa and Minnesota, triggered power outages in four U.S. states, including more than 100,000 homes and businesses in Colorado by Wednesday evening.
The storm system could also pummel the region with thunderstorms and snow, the National Weather Service said in an advisory. 
""There have been historic 'Dust Bowl' conditions with no visibility in parts of New Mexico and Colorado,"" said Marc Chenard, a forecaster for the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland.
""This is highly unusual,"" Chenard said. ""It's shifting east and is unusual for this large of an area, it will be going through the Great Lakes area, Michigan and into Canada by Thursday morning,"" he said.
The Dust Bowl refers to a period during the 1930s when severe drought and destructive agricultural practices disrupted the ecology of parts of U.S. and Canadian prairies. During that time, immense clouds of loosened topsoil regularly blanketed the region, leading to an economic crisis for farmers and mass migration to California. 
The wind storm follows one of the deadliest tornado outbreaks in U.S. history. At least 74 people were killed in Kentucky and 14 died in other states when that storm system swept across the Great Plains and parts of the South last Friday night and early Saturday morning.
President Joe Biden toured some of the devastated communities on Wednesday.
The National Weather Service said in its forecast that the high winds from the current system would pick up overnight on Wednesday and race across the Upper Midwest into Canada by Thursday.

""As a result, blowing dust and power outages will likely be found throughout the region,"" the weather service said. ""Extremely Critical Fire Weather also exists into this evening from the northern Texas Panhandle to north-central Kansas.""
The NWS Storm Prediction Center issued a ""moderate risk"" warning for the region and said blowing snow could create driving hazards across Minnesota and the Dakotas.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Ten years after Kim Jong Un assumed power North Korea is better armed but deeply isolated and more dependent on China, despite actions by the young leader that raised - and dashed - hopes of economic transformation or international opening. 
Kim’s pursuit of nuclear weapons defined his first 10 years in power, but analysts say the path has left him isolated and facing perhaps the greatest challenges yet. 
Those weapons may stand in the way of political breakthroughs needed to improve a shattered economy and prevent millions from starving, as ongoing anti-pandemic lockdowns and sanctions that have left him over-reliant on China.
Kim embraced a different style than his idiosyncratic father, seeking to ""normalise"" North Korea by institutionalising and delegating more leadership; winning international respect through nuclear weapons and summits with foreign leaders; and displays of transparency and empathy toward improving the lives of everyday citizens.
At times that raised expectations of economic reform in the socialist state, or changes in its relationship with longstanding rivals such as the United States and South Korea.
But systemic change has failed to materialise as Kim continued many of his father's worst practices, from political prison camps and brutal executions to tight control over the economy and society.
""I think the experience of Kim's rule for ordinary North Koreans was a moment of hope in those early years followed by regression to the mean,"" said Christopher Green, a Korea specialist at Leiden University in the Netherlands.
Kim will have to make hard decisions over whether to trade any of his arsenal to win sanctions relief, or find other ways to boost the economy, such as through a distrustful but vital relationship with China or allowing more economic and social opening without losing political grip.
""(Sanctions) put an upper limit on what he can do with his economy but doesn’t mean he can’t get to a point that’s much more comfortable for people than where he is now,"" said Robert Carlin, a former CIA officer now with the Washington-based Stimson Center.
After the damage done by the pandemic, calls for controlled openness may again be heard from within the regime elite, but the challenges of turning the international situation in North Korea's favour are as big as ever, Green said.
""Without a big uptick in foreign capital, the cause of economic reform is almost certainly doomed,"" he added.
WEAPONS FOR SANCTIONS
Under Kim, North Korea conducted four of its six nuclear weapons' tests - including what appears to be its first hydrogen bomb - and developed a series of intercontinental ballistic missiles with the range to strike as far as the United States. 
For Kim that arsenal is the ""treasured sword"" that will protect North Korea - and his rule - from outside threats, while making the country an equal with other nuclear powers.
But it also brought North Korea to the brink of war with the United States in 2017, and prompted even the country's partners in China and Russia to approve strict U.N. sanctions.
Kim's attempts to win sanctions relief and a breakthrough in relations with the United States led to historic and unprecedented summits with U.S. President Donald Trump, but talks have since stalled with Washington demanding Pyongyang surrender some of its weapons before any sanctions are eased.
Kim will likely continue to ""play tough"" in nuclear diplomacy because further nuclear weapons development will increase his political leverage and bargaining power both in negotiations and during stalemates, said Duyeon Kim, with the U.S.-based Center for a New American Security.
""We can expect to see him continue to shape his personal and his country’s image as normal, modern, and advanced across all sectors particularly nuclear and economic, and even foreign affairs when the pandemic subsides,"" she added.
After sending the China-North Korea relationship to a historical low by prioritising nuclear weapons and missiles development then harshly criticising Beijing for supporting sanctions, Kim managed to quickly repair ties, said Zhao Tong, a strategic security expert in Beijing.
China now accounts for the vast majority of North Korea's limited international trade, and the current governments in both countries share the goals of promoting socialist ideology and countering Western influence, Zhao said.
""Despite Kim’s preference of diversifying North Korea’s international partnerships, he is likely to continue relying heavily on support from China and a small number of other like-minded countries,"" he said.
TIGHTENING CONTROL
In his early years, Kim Jong Un experimented with economic reform in order to generate the surpluses he needed to run the patronage networks that sustain autocratic rule, said Green.
""But it appears the risks of and opposition to this became too great in time, and he dialled it back,"" he said.
A United Nations rights investigator has warned that vulnerable populations in North Korea risk starvation if the economic and food situation is not reversed.
The pandemic has seen the government further strengthen its grip on the economy, casting doubt on the future of the black markets and as well as official businesses that many North Koreans had come to rely on.
Kim's rule has seen the proliferation of new technologies such as cellphones in North Korea, but activists say he has simultaneously adopted a more high-tech approach to surveillance and oppressive political control as he seeks to outlaw and stamp out foreign influence and any hint of domestic protest.

Still, it's not too late for Kim to make good on promises to improve lives in North Korea if he embraces diplomacy, said Ramon Pacheco Pardo, a Korea expert at King's College London. 
“Ultimately, Kim’s time in power could be defined by his ability to raise the living standards of ordinary North Koreans once the pandemic is over,"" he said.

DAWSON SPRINGS, Ky. (Reuters) -President Joe Biden walked through the battered remains of two Kentucky cities on Wednesday to get a first-hand view of the destruction wrought by one of the deadliest tornado outbreaks in recent U.S. history.
The disaster, which killed at least 74 people in Kentucky and 14 elsewhere, has thrown Biden into his familiar role as consoler-in-chief. He promised to bring the might of the federal government to rebuild devastated communities https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/a-town-destroyed-the-grim-aftermath-in-t-idUSRTS3RB7Y that suffered billions of dollars in damage. 
Wearing hiking boots, a ball cap and a black mask, Biden walked through hard-hit cities, Mayfield and Dawson Springs, Kentucky, hugging survivors as he went along.
""Don't hesitate to ask for anything,"" Biden said in Mayfield, while noting ""there’s no red tornadoes, there’s no blue tornadoes,"" referring to the colors associated with Democrats and Republicans.
As the day progressed, Biden walked past scene after scene of the tornado's rampage, including dozens of buildings that were reduced to rubble.
In Mayfield, he stopped to chat with a woman who was sitting on a pile of bricks. He and his entourage paused to pray in the middle of a street. He told faith-based groups helping out that ""You’re doing God's work.”
In Dawson Springs, Biden stood in front of a blown-out building and noted it was known as a place to go for its healing mineral waters.
""Now it's our turn to help the entire town to heal,"" he said.
The ""scope and scale of destruction is almost beyond belief,"" Biden said. He said he wanted to come back to Dawson Springs to get a meal cooked by a woman he met.
Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, who joined Biden for the day of touring, said federal authorities have been deeply engaged in on-the-ground efforts.
""We’ve gone from looking for our dead to hauling away the death and destruction around us,"" he said.
Beshear has said the dead included a dozen children https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-weather-tornadoes-idAFL1N2SZ28D and that he expected the death toll to rise in the coming days, with more than 100 still missing. 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has sent search-and-rescue and emergency response teams to Kentucky, along with teams to help survivors register for assistance.
FEMA has also sent dozens of generators into the state, along with 135,000 gallons (511,000 litres) of water, 74,000 meals and thousands of cots, blankets, infant toddler kits and pandemic shelter kits.
Mayfield was the hardest hit of several western Kentucky communities in the 200-mile (320-km) path of a twister that turned cities into piles of debris that are now being hauled away by work crews and National Guard troops.
The city of 10,000 is under a boil-water order and accounts for more than one-third of the state’s 14,000 power outages. City Council member Jana Adams said it would take seven to 10 days for crews to resurrect utility poles and hook up transmission lines.
“We have linemen from all over the country here going out in the field and setting poles and running lines for us,” Adams, who is also on the board of the local electric and water utility, told CNN.
Biden has approved federal disaster declarations for Kentucky and the neighboring states of Tennessee and Illinois, offering residents and local officials increased federal aid.
Credit ratings agency DBRS Morningstar said the tornadoes were likely the most severe in the United States since 2011. Insurers are sufficiently prepared to cover claims without significant capital impact, it said in a report.
The trip marks one of the few that Biden, a Democrat, has taken to areas that tilt heavily toward the Republican Party, many of whose voters and leaders have embraced https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/POLLING/byprjqmdjpe/republican Donald Trump's fraudulent claims that he won the 2020 election. 
The White House has been careful not to bring politics into the disaster relief efforts, including not focusing on what role, if any, climate change may have played in the tragic events.

Even as the president toured the destruction in Mayfield, there were small shouts of ""Let's go Brandon,"" an anti-Biden slogan.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of U.S. lawmakers is asking the Treasury Department and State Department to sanction Israeli spyware firm NSO Group and three other foreign surveillance companies they say helped authoritarian governments commit human rights abuses.
Their letter sent late Tuesday also asks for sanctions on top executives at NSO, the United Arab Emirates cybersecurity company DarkMatter, and European online bulk surveillance companies Nexa Technologies and Trovicor. 
The lawmakers asked for Global Magnitsky sanctions, which punishes those who are accused of enabling human rights abuses by freezing bank accounts and banning travel to the United States.
The letter was signed by the Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and 16 other Democratic lawmakers. Along with other reporting on the industry, they cite a recent Reuters article this month showing that NSO spyware was used against State Department employees in Uganda. 
The lawmakers said the spyware industry relies on U.S. investment and banks. ""To meaningfully punish them and send a clear signal to the surveillance technology industry, the U.S. government should deploy financial sanctions,"" they wrote. 
Trovicor wrote back to Wyden, denying that it engaged in bulk surveillance and suggesting that his office had confused its work with that of another company.
""Trovicor's products are not 'spyware' and are designed to be used for targeted investigations against identified individuals (as opposed to 'Bulk' surveillance),"" it wrote.
DarkMatter could not be reached for comment, while NSO and Nexa did not respond to questions. 
The letter says the companies facilitated the ""disappearance, torture and murder of human rights activists and journalists."" Surveillance firms have drawn increasing scrutiny from Washington as a barrage of media reports have tied them to human rights abuses. 
""These surveillance mercenaries sold their services to authoritarian regimes with long records of human rights abuses, giving vast spying powers to tyrants,"" Wyden told Reuters. ""Predictably, those nations used surveillance tools to lock up, torture and murder reporters and human rights advocates. The Biden administration has the chance to turn off the spigot of American dollars and help put them out of business for good.""
Spokespeople for State and Treasury did not immediately respond to questions about the request.
In November, the Commerce Department put NSO on the so-called Entity List, prohibiting U.S. suppliers from selling software or services to the Israeli spyware maker without getting special permission. 
A number of legal challenges also threaten the industry. Last week a prominent Saudi activist and the non-profit Electronic Frontier Foundation sued DarkMatter, alleging the group hacked into her phone. 

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) sued NSO Group in November, saying that it violated U.S. laws by breaking into the software installed on iPhones. 
A 2019 Reuters investigation, cited in the letter, also exposed a secret hacking unit within DarkMatter, known as Project Raven (NASDAQ:RAVN), that helped the UAE spy on its enemies. In a September settlement with the Justice Department, three members of that unit, all former U.S. intelligence operatives, admitted to breaking hacking laws.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The leaders of France and Germany sought on Wednesday to revive talks with Russia while keeping up pressure on Moscow to deter what the West says may be preparations for a new attack on Ukrainian territory.
French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy met on the sidelines of an EU summit in Brussels to find ways to restart negotiations in the ""Normandy format"" that also includes Russia, Macron's office said.
""The three leaders reaffirmed their commitment to this format of negotiations in order to find a lasting solution for the conflict and to preserve Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" his office added.
Zelenskiy said Ukraine was ready for any format of talks with Russia but would like to see a strong western sanctions policy against Moscow to avoid further escalation.
Some states and leaders were proposing to introduce tough sanctions after any escalation from Russia, he said, adding that in Ukraine's view, that was too late.
""We were able to explain to our European colleagues that the sanctions policy after (escalation) no longer interests anyone - our state is interested in a powerful sanctions policy before a possible escalation, and then there may not be a possible escalation.""
Ukraine is currently the main flashpoint between Russia and the West. The United States says Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops on Ukraine's borders, possibly in preparation for an invasion. Moscow says its actions are purely defensive.
""The message is very clear: Should Russia take further aggressive action against Ukraine, the costs will be severe and the consequences serious,"" European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said.
Russia's foreign ministry on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) urged the West and Ukraine to implement the peace deals of 2014 and 2015 that include prisoner exchanges, aid and the withdrawal of weapons.
Relations between Moscow and Berlin reached a new low on Wednesday when a German court found that Russia ordered the killing of a former Chechen militant in a Berlin park, and sentenced the agent who carried out the 2019 act of ""state terrorism"" to life imprisonment.
Germany summoned the Russian ambassador after the ruling, telling him that two of his embassy's diplomatic staff would be expelled, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said.
Zelenskiy said on Twitter he was hoping for France's support in countering Russia's ""hybrid aggression"" in Europe as Paris assumes the rotating EU presidency for six months in January.
He also invited Scholz to Ukraine and wished to deepen cooperation with Berlin in energy, security and defence - veiled criticism of the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany and of Berlin's opposition to weapons deliveries to Ukraine. 
FULL MEMBERSHIP GOAL
After the meeting, Ukraine joined Georgia and Moldova at the summit to lobby the EU to let them begin negotiations to join the bloc. But for now they will only win assurances of support against any possible Russian aggression.
The one-day ""Eastern Partnership"" summit in Brussels highlights the limited success of the EU's approach to the six ex-Soviet republics it embraces, all of them in what Russia considers its backyard where it has security interests.
Of the six, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine are all locked in territorial disputes with Moscow. The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan are attending the summit but are not seeking EU membership. Belarus's President Alexander Lukashenko, hit by Western sanctions over his human rights record, stayed away.

""Our goal is full membership in the European Union,"" Zelenskiy said after meeting EU summit chair Charles Michel. 
The EU will ""acknowledge the European aspirations and the European choice"" of the five countries concerned, the final summit statement noted.

734,"<span>Dec 15, 2021 02:32PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pleaded guilty on Wednesday in a federal court to charges he violated George Floyd's civil rights, likely extending his prison sentence by several years after his earlier conviction for the Black man's murder.
Chauvin, 45, appeared in the U.S. District Court in St. Paul, Minnesota in an orange jumpsuit to waive his right to a trial by changing his plea to guilty in an agreement with prosecutors, precluding the risk of a sentence of up to life in prison had he gone to trial.
A state judge had already sentenced Chauvin to 22-1/2 years in prison in June after a jury convicted him for the 2020 murder of Floyd, and he has since been held in solitary confinement in a maximum-security Minnesota prison. In Minnesota, prisoners are eligible for supervised release after completing two thirds of their sentence.
Chauvin, who is white, was seen in videos recorded by horrified onlookers kneeling on the handcuffed Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes in a brutal arrest on a Minneapolis street corner on May 25, 2020. 
The killing ignited one of the largest protest movements ever seen in the United States. 
Chauvin's April conviction in state court on charges of unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter was seen by many as a landmark rebuke of the disproportionate use of police force against Black Americans.
Chauvin admitted on Wednesday that in his role as a police officer he breached Floyd's constitutional right to be free from ""unreasonable seizure"" and to not face excessive force.
Federal prosecutors told the court that the sentencing guidelines call for Chauvin to spend 20-25 years in prison, though they noted that the court could rule for a harsher sentence, up to life in prison.
They said that under the plea agreement prosecutors would ask the court for a 25-year sentence to run concurrently with the state one, meaning Chauvin would extend his current prison term by several years. 
Federal prosecutors said he would be moved to a federal prison, which are often perceived to be safer than their state counterparts. 
District Judge Paul Magnuson said he would hold a sentencing hearing at a later date, where Chauvin and Floyd's relatives, some of whom were in court on Wednesday, will have a chance to address the court. 
CHAUVIN ALSO ADMITS BREACHING BLACK BOY'S RIGHTS
As part of the agreement, Chauvin admitted he also breached the civil rights of a boy he arrested in 2017 who was 14 at the time, beating the boy's head with a flashlight and kneeling on his neck, which drew charges in a separate federal indictment.
The boy, who is Black, attended Wednesday's hearing with a lawyer, and later exchanged elbow bumps with Floyd's brother Philonise in the hallway outside.
""It's a good day for justice,"" Philonise told the boy, according to the pool report.
Chauvin, who originally pleaded not guilty in September, signed the plea agreement in court, which also requires him to pay restitution, with the amount yet to be determined. He further agreed never again to be licensed as a law enforcement officer.
He was asked by prosecutors if he willfully deprived Floyd of a constitutional right and whether he had his knee on Floyd even after the man was unconscious. 
""Correct,"" Chauvin replied as Floyd's girlfriend, Courtney Ross, watched from the public gallery, dabbing tears from her eyes. 
Chauvin and three other officers - Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao - were arresting Floyd on suspicion of using a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes. 

Lane, Kueng and Thao were also fired from the Minneapolis Police Department and face charges in a state trial, due to begin in March, that they aided and abetted the killing of Floyd. The three face a federal trial in January as well on charges they deprived Floyd of his rights.
The indictment said Thao and Kueng violated Floyd's rights by not intervening to stop Chauvin from kneeling on his neck, and that all the officers involved showed deliberate indifference to Floyd's serious medical needs.

(Reuters) -The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the largest U.S. Muslim advocacy organization, has fired the head of its Ohio chapter after alleging that he shared confidential information with an anti-Muslim organization.
A news release from CAIR on Tuesday said its Ohio director, Romin Iqbal, had admitted to working with the Investigative Project on Terrorism (IPT), a self-described ""data center on radical Islamist terrorist groups,"" when confronted with the evidence of his misconduct. 
""This betrayal and violation of trust was planned and purposeful, taking place over a period of years,"" CAIR's leaders said in a separate news release on Wednesday.
Iqbal directed a request for comment from Reuters to his lawyer, who declined to comment.
The founder of the IPT, Steven Emerson (NYSE:EMR), has ""a history of promoting falsified information and conspiracy theories about Islam and Muslims,"" according to a Georgetown University research project on Islamophobia. Emerson is considered an anti-Muslim activist by the Southern Poverty Law Center. 
In an emailed statement, the IPT alleged that CAIR has ties to the Palestinian militant group Hamas, and said it would ""not hesitate to uncover and publicly expose radical Islamist activity on American soil by groups like CAIR, which threaten our national security."" 
CAIR denies that it has ties to Hamas.
CAIR's national office hired an outside forensic specialist to investigate evidence it received last year that the IPT had tried to infiltrate Muslim-American organizations such as CAIR using ""moles."" 
In November, the specialist reported to CAIR that Iqbal had been sharing information, ""including surreptitiously recorded conversations, strategic plans and private emails,"" with the IPT, according to the Tuesday press release.
The evidence CAIR received last year also showed that IPT was ""communicating with and providing assistance to Israeli intelligence with the office of then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,"" the news release said.
After Iqbal's termination, the CAIR-Ohio office in Columbus also discovered recent ""suspicious purchases"" from ammunition and gun retailers made on a credit card that was administered by Iqbal, according to Whitney Siddiqi, community affairs director for CAIR Ohio.

Siddiqi said CAIR could not confirm Iqbal made the purchases, but said the group was considering taking legal action against Iqbal for his alleged breaches of duty. 
On Tuesday, the office also received a package containing parts to an AR-15 rifle. Siddiqi said a local law enforcement agency was looking in to the weapon acquisitions, and that the FBI had also been notified.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A lawyer for a Harvard University professor charged with concealing his ties to a China-run recruitment program accused U.S. prosecutors on Wednesday of ""inventing something out of nothing"" as the closely watched trial got underway.
Jurors heard opening statements from prosecution and defense lawyers in the trial of Charles Lieber, a nanotechnology pioneer and former Harvard chemistry department chairman facing six criminal charges including making false statements, filing false tax returns and failing to report foreign bank accounts.
Lieber, 62, stood briefly to face the jury in federal court in Boston as defense lawyer Marc Mukasey said investigators ""mangled"" or ""made up"" evidence to try to show that the defendant lied to authorities.
""If there was a Nobel Prize for inventing something out of nothing, the government's case would win,"" Mukasey told jurors.
In the prosecution opening statement, Assistant U.S. Attorney James Drabick told jurors that Lieber was a participant in China's Thousand Talents Program, which prosecutors have said China uses to entice foreign researchers to share their knowledge with it.
The trial represents a test of the U.S. Justice Department's ""China Initiative"" launched in 2018 to combat Chinese economic espionage and trade secrets theft. Critics have said the initiative harms academic research and racially profiles Chinese researchers.
Drabick said Lieber participated in the Thousand Talents Program by affiliating from 2011 to 2015 with Wuhan University of Technology in China, which paid him tens of thousands of dollars in hopes of boosting its own reputation.
Lieber denied his involvement in response to inquiries from the U.S. Defense Department and the U.S. National Institutes of Health, which had awarded him $15 million in research grants, and concealed his income and a Chinese bank account, Drabick said.
Drabick said Lieber's emails prove that he participated in the program and that, after his 2020 arrest, he admitted in a recorded FBI interview that he ""shouldn't have had an agreement and accepted money.""

""You'll hear him explain he did so when he was younger and stupid,"" Drabick said.
Defense lawyer Mukasey said that investigators failed to write down exactly what Lieber told them prior to his arrest and that he had tried to respond truthfully during ""confused"" questioning by the FBI after his arrest.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia and China should stand firm in rejecting Western interference and defending each other's security interests, presidents Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping agreed in a video call on Wednesday.
Their conversation, eight days after Putin spoke to U.S. President Joe Biden in a similar format, underscored how shared hostility to the West is bringing Moscow and Beijing closer together.
""At present, certain international forces under the guise of 'democracy' and 'human rights' are interfering in the internal affairs of China and Russia, and brutally trampling on international law and recognized norms of international relations,"" China's state-run Xinhua news agency quoted Xi as saying. 
""China and Russia should increase their joint efforts to more effectively safeguard the security interests of both parties.""
Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters that Xi had offered support to Putin for his push to obtain binding security guarantees for Russia from the West, saying he understood Moscow's concerns.
He said the pair also expressed their ""negative view"" of the creation of new military alliances such as the AUKUS partnership between Australia, Britain and the United States and the Indo-Pacific ""Quad"" of Australia, India, Japan and the United States.
PRESSURE
The call highlighted the ways in which Russia and China are drawing on each other for mutual support at a time of high tension in their relations with the West. China is under pressure over human rights and Russia is accused of threatening behaviour towards Ukraine.
The Kremlin said Putin briefed Xi on his conversation with Biden, in which the U.S. president warned Russia against invading Ukraine - which Moscow denies it is planning - and Putin set out his demand for security pledges.
""A new model of cooperation has been formed between our countries, based, among other things, on such principles as non-interference in internal affairs and respect for each other's interests,"" Putin told Xi.
He said he looked forward to meeting Xi at the Winter Olympics in Beijing in February - an event that the White House last week said U.S. government officials would boycott because of China's human rights ""atrocities"" against Muslims in its western region of Xinjiang.
""I would like to note that we invariably support each other on issues of international sports cooperation, including rejection of any attempts to politicize sports and the Olympic movement,"" Putin said.
Putin has used Russia's partnership with China as a way of balancing U.S. influence while striking lucrative deals, especially on energy. He and Xi this year agreed to extend a 20-year friendship and cooperation treaty.

The Russian leader said bilateral trade was up 31% in the first 11 months of this year to $123 billion, and the two countries aimed to exceed $200 billion in the near future.
He said China was becoming an international centre for production of Russia's Sputnik and Sputnik Light vaccines against COVID-19, with contracts signed with six manufacturers to make more than 150 million doses.

BERLIN (Reuters) -German police have foiled a plot by anti-vaccination activists to murder the state premier of Saxony in eastern Germany, they said on Wednesday, as concerns grow over an increasingly violent pushback against COVID-19 vaccination plans.
The plot to kill Michael Kretschmer is the latest in a series of incidents that underscore the anger of some Germans over restrictions on the unvaccinated and plans to make vaccinations compulsory for the general population.
Saxony has one of Germany's highest levels of COVID-19 infection but also its lowest vaccination rate. It is a stronghold of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which harbours many vaccine sceptics and anti-lockdown protesters.
Members of a group called ""Dresden Offlinevernetzung"", or 'Dresden offline network', had suggested in a chat on messaging platform Telegram that they might be in possession of firearms and crossbows, Saxony police said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
The investigation targeted six suspects - five men and a woman - aged between 32 and 64, Dresden Public Prosecutor's Office said, adding that several pieces of evidence had been found, including crossbows.
'A LINE HAS BEEN CROSSED'
Kretschmer, 46, a member of Germany's opposition conservatives, has been calling for a hard lockdown to break a fourth wave of infections in his state.
He said the right to free speech should be respected but not used as a cover for violence, adding that the Saxony state government would mobilise additional staff to combat radicalism.
""Of course you can say what you don't like. But when violence comes into play, it's over. A line has been crossed which we will not tolerate,"" Kretschmer told reporters.
Saxony has the second highest seven-day incidence of COVID-19 among Germany's 16 federal states, at 824 per 100,000 people compared with a national incidence of 353.
In Saxony, in the former Communist East Germany, some 62% of the population has had two vaccinations, compared with around 70% nationwide. 
Protests against COVID-19 restrictions in Germany have become more violent, with increased attacks on doctors, politicians and journalists.
""Such attacks were unthinkable just a few years ago,"" said Klaus Reinhardt, head of the German Medical Association.
In September, a vaccination centre in Saxony was the target of an arson attack. Earlier this month, a group of protesters gathered outside the home of Saxony's health minister holding lit torches, in what was seen as an implicit threat of violence. 
German broadcaster ARD reported on Tuesday that more than a dozen politicians, media outlets and public institutions had received letters that threatened ""bloody resistance"" against the measures and included a wrapped chunk of meat.
Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office has classified vaccination opponents and coronavirus deniers as a ""relevant risk"".

In his first major address to parliament since taking office last week, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Wednesday his government would not tolerate violent protests against the coronavirus restrictions.
""We will not put up with a tiny minority of uninhibited extremists trying to force their will on our entire society,"" Scholz said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ghislaine Maxwell's attorneys will likely focus on portraying the British socialite's accusers as untrustworthy and motivated by money when they start presenting their case in her sex abuse trial on Thursday, according to legal experts and court filings.
Prosecutors rested their case on Friday after two weeks of emotional, often explicit testimony from four women who said Maxwell recruited and groomed them for abuse by the late financier Jeffrey Epstein when the women were teenagers.
The women portrayed Maxwell as central to their abuse by Epstein, a globetrotting financier who died by suicide in 2019 in jail while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges. 
Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to eight counts of sex trafficking and other crimes in federal court in New York. During cross-examinations, her lawyers tried to undermine the women's credibility by asking about inconsistencies in their accounts and about awards they received from a fund for Epstein's victims. 
""This case is about memory, manipulation and money,"" Maxwell attorney Bobbi Sternheim said in her Nov. 29 opening statement. 
One of Maxwell's expected expert witnesses is Elizabeth Loftus, a psychologist who studies how people can be manipulated into having ""false memories."" She has testified in or consulted for hundreds of trials, including those of O.J. Simpson and Harvey Weinstein.
But undermining the accusers' credibility remains an uphill battle, said Duncan Levin, managing partner at Tucker Levin PLLC. 
""It's straight out of the playbook,"" Levin said. ""But ... it's a heavy lift to ask jurors to discount what (the accusers)may be saying because they got money."" 
The defense has said its case will last between two and four days. 
CALLING MAXWELL
Given the women's compelling testimony, the defense's best bet may be calling Maxwell herself to testify, said Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma, principal attorney at ZMO Law PLLC. 
The jury is ""going to believe the gist of what the witnesses are saying,"" Margulis-Ohnuma said. ""The only real counter to that is (Maxwell's) coming back and saying no, I didn't intend that.""
Maxwell's attorneys have not indicated whether or not they plan to call her to the stand.
Maxwell's team also intends to call attorneys for ""Jane"" and ""Carolyn,"" two of the women who testified that they were 14 when Epstein first abused them. Jane testified under a pseudonym and Carolyn testified using only her first name.
At issue is whether Jane's attorney, Robert Glassman, told her that cooperating with prosecutors would assist her claim with the fund, which the defense says could taint her testimony. Jane testified that she was awarded $5 million from the compensation fund established by Epstein's estate.
Similarly, Maxwell's attorneys said they want to question Carolyn's attorney, Jack Scarola, about why Carolyn was ""uncooperative until there was the prospect of a payout."" 
In a Wednesday letter, prosecutors asked U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan to bar the lawyers from being called to the stand, arguing that much of their testimony would violate attorney-client privilege and would not be relevant even in instances where it did not. 
Jane testified that she did not believe helping prosecutors would boost her claim. Carolyn testified that ""money will not ever fix what [Maxwell] has done to me.""

The fund considered whether a claimant's assertions matched up with any law enforcement findings, but it is a ""stretch"" to say that cooperating enhanced the women's claims, said Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School.
""There is no requirement that a victim cooperate or testify for the prosecution,"" said Levenson, who reviewed the fund's protocol at Reuters' request.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court's decision to leave in place a Texas law banning most abortions has opened the door for states to seek to restrict other rights including guns by copying the measure's novel enforcement mechanism, though it remains to be seen how many will actually do it.
The Republican-backed Texas law takes enforcement away from state officials, instead empowering private citizens to sue anyone who performs or assists a woman in obtaining an abortion after embryo cardiac activity is detected - at about six weeks of pregnancy - with awards of at least $10,000 for successful lawsuits. The Supreme Court issued its ruling on Friday.
California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said the next day that he directed his staff to work with legislators and the state's attorney general on a bill that would similarly enable private citizens to sue anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault weapons or self-assembled ""ghost guns,"" also with at least $10,000 in damages.
New York Attorney General Letitia James, another Democrat, said in an appearance on Tuesday on ABC's program ""The View"" that she would support a similar effort in her state.
""We need to follow his lead,"" James said, referring to Newsom.
President Joe Biden has urged the U.S. Congress to pass national gun restrictions, but Democratic-backed legislation over the years has been stymied by Republican opposition.
Legislators in five other Republican-led states have introduced abortion bills modeled on the Texas law, similarly structured to avoid judicial review, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights, a legal advocacy group favoring abortion rights. None have yet been enacted.
The Texas law, known formally as S.B. 8, was designed to be difficult for courts to block because it removed state officials from enforcement, making it is hard for challengers to figure out who to sue and obtain a ruling that would halt it statewide. The Supreme Court largely accepted that construct while allowing abortion providers to proceed with a legal challenge aimed at some medical licensing officials.
'A BIT OF AN INVITATION'
Critics have said that ruling would allow states to enact laws that circumvent other recognized rights such as LGBT and religious rights as well as guns.
""The court is not pushing back on the use of S.B. 8-style laws to infringe constitutionally protected rights. I do think this is a bit of an invitation to other states,"" said David Noll, a professor at Rutgers Law School in New Jersey.
States seeking to roll back abortion rights may in the near future not need to resort to novel mechanisms like the Texas law to avoid running afoul of Supreme Court precedent on abortion. The conservative justices who hold a 6-3 majority on the court indicated during oral arguments on Dec. 1 in a case from Mississippi that they are willing to undercut or even overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.
In Illinois, one Democratic legislator has proposed targeting gun dealers with a measure similar to the one California is discussing. National gun control activists sound noncommittal.
Stacey Radnor, a spokesperson for the gun-control group Everytown for Gun Safety, said in a statement that Newsom's proposal is ""an interesting approach that we're going to examine further as we get more details.""
Groups favoring gun rights have called Newsom's announcement a stunt, pointing out that California already has a law banning military-style assault weapons.
""If they really wanted to be the full-blown aggressive so-and-sos that Texas has been, they would ban handguns,"" said Erik Jaffe, a lawyer who filed a brief at the Supreme Court on behalf of the Firearms Policy Coalition gun rights group that has been critical of the Texas law, said of California. 
Jaffe said Newsom, who in September survived a recall election, ""might not survive the political fallout"" of such a measure.
James White, a Republican member of the Texas House of Representatives who supports the state's abortion law, questioned in a letter to the state's attorney general whether private individuals are bound by the Supreme Court's 2015 ruling legalizing gay marriage nationwide. But White said in an interview he does not anticipate a state law similar to the abortion law targeting the rights of same-sex couples.
""The Supreme Court has ruled that who people decide to get married to is left to their discretion. I don't know how you would get into civil litigation,"" White said.

Advocacy groups for LGBT people said they have not heard of any such proposals.
""I have not, and I hope I never do,"" said Shannon Minter, legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, adding that any such measures could run into other legal problems because they would be unlawfully discriminatory.

VIENNA (Reuters) -The U.N. nuclear watchdog reached an agreement with Iran on Wednesday on replacing its surveillance cameras at a centrifuge-parts workshop that were removed after an apparent attack, easing a standoff that could have scuppered wider nuclear talks.
Those wider, indirect talks between Iran and the United States on salvaging the 2015 Iran nuclear deal are deadlocked, but Washington had threatened https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-threatens-escalation-with-iran-iaea-next-month-2021-11-25 to confront Tehran at the International Atomic Energy Agency's 35-nation Board of Governors if it did not relent on Karaj this month.
Any such confrontation could have caused the collapse of the talks altogether, diplomats said.
""The agreement with Iran on replacing surveillance cameras at the Karaj facility is an important development for the IAEA's verification and monitoring activities in Iran,"" the IAEA said in a statement after diplomats told Reuters an agreement had been reached. 
""It will enable us to resume necessary continuity of knowledge at this facility,"" the IAEA said, adding the new cameras would be installed ""in coming days"". 
CONCERN
One of the IAEA's four cameras at the workshop in the TESA Karaj complex was destroyed in an apparent sabotage attack in June that Iran blamed on Israel. Iran then removed the cameras and has not let the IAEA return to replace them, angering https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-threatens-escalation-with-iran-iaea-next-month-2021-11-25 the United States and its allies. 
Iran has shown the IAEA the cameras and ""data storage media"" containing their footage, except for the one containing the destroyed camera's footage. The IAEA and Western powers have called https://vienna.usmission.gov/verification-and-monitoring-in-iran-u-s-iaea-bog-nov-2021 on Iran to explain where it is.
Wednesday's agreement did not address the issue of the missing footage. 
The bigger the gap in knowledge of what happened at Karaj, the greater the concern among Western states will be that Iran has secretly siphoned off key parts for centrifuges, machines that enrich uranium.
A senior diplomat said last month the IAEA does not know https://www.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-iaea-karaj-idAFV9N2NP00B whether Karaj is operational.
""I sincerely hope that we can continue our constructive discussions to also address and resolve all outstanding safeguards issues in Iran,"" IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said in the statement.

Any impact on the wider talks on the Iran nuclear deal, apart from removing a potential spoiler, was unclear.
""This was a tactical move to avert a near-term diplomatic crisis, but the broader nuclear deal impasse remains,"" Eurasia Group analyst Henry Rome said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -A fire broke out on Wednesday in Hong Kong's World Trade Centre, trapping about 150 people on its roof, and 13 people were injured before firefighters put out the blaze, police and the fire department said.
The 39-floor World Trade Centre is home to restaurants, offices and shops in the bustling Causeway Bay commercial and shopping district.
The fire broke out in a utility room on a lower level of the building's mall at noon, media said, before it spread to bamboo scaffolding cladding the exterior.
City authorities said firefighters had battled the blaze with two high-powered hoses, using ladders and breathing apparatus in their effort to rescue those trapped.
Police told Reuters 13 people were taken to hospital, one of them semi-conscious. 
""The fire was extinguished at 1630 hours (0830 GMT),"" the fire department told Reuters.
Earlier, shoppers and office workers streamed out of the building as smoke billowed from it and police blocked off traffic on major adjacent roads.

About 100 people moved from a restaurant to the top 39th floor when the fire broke out and smoke filled the dining area, broadcaster RTHK quoted police as saying.
The cause of the fire was not immediately clear.

Gouin was hospitalized when the tornadoes struck on Friday. A day later when she was released from the hospital, she found shelter at the Way Community Center in Wingo, about 10 miles (16 km) south of Mayfield, which has sheltered a steady stream of tornado survivors.
The deadly string of twisters killed at least 74 people in Kentucky and at least 14 elsewhere.
Gouin said she feared she would awake to ""hearing people screaming and babies crying and dogs barking.""
Instead, she said on Tuesday that she woke up to a man yelling - about ""the word of God ... about how much he has this in his hands.
""That's a wonderful thing to wake up to, and I'm right here in front of it. I got the front-row seat. I got lucky,"" Gouin said.
Like many others, she is struggling with not just the loss of her home but the loss of the town she calls home.
""You know, in like three minutes you walk outside, your town doesn't even look like a town anymore,"" she said of hard-hit Mayfield, a western Kentucky community of about 10,000 people.
""As stupid as that might sound, some of those buildings, they ... they carry your story, they carry your memories, and they're on the ground. You know, there's nothing left of them. It's heartbreaking to see that.""
The Way Community Center, where rows of cots and mattresses on the floor lined a room and children played on the floor of the church shelter, is just one site housing tornado survivors. More than 300 people in Kentucky, as well as in Arkansas and Tennessee, were being housed in Red Cross shelters, and hundreds more have been placed temporarily in resorts at area state parks, according to the Kentucky Red Cross.
Some tornado survivors are grateful for any help - including from others who suffered great losses.
Tommy Lynn Jackson, another Mayfield resident at the Way Community Center, said: ""I didn't have anything, and they gave us clothes, a new blanket, and the nice lady over there, her husband had passed, but he was a blessing because he left me a blessing because his pants are my size.""
Linda Erickson, who lived in the Eloise Fuller Apartments for Seniors in downtown Mayfield, which were destroyed, said she is grateful to God.
""And if it wasn't for the Lord God, I would be dead,"" Erickson said. ""He gets me through like waking up all angry this morning, saying: 'Where am I again?' And I don't know. But he gets me through all that, you know?""

Another resident of the Eloise Fuller Apartments, Ray McReynolds, sitting in his wheelchair, spoke simply of what he lost and what he needs.
""The worst thing we need right now is, we need money,"" McReynolds said. ""We don't have no place to live, and we don't have the money to rent another place. So, what we need right now is ... is ... is money to help us.""

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) -The United States is prepared to move forward with the sale of F-35 fighter jets and drones to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday, after reports the UAE intended to suspend discussion of the deal.
A UAE official on Tuesday told Reuters that it had informed the United States that it would suspend discussions to acquire F-35 fighter jets, part of a $23 billion deal that includes drones and other advanced munitions.
The official cited ""technical requirements, sovereign operational restrictions, and cost/benefit analysis"" as reasons that have prompted a re-assessment of the deal by the UAE government.
The UAE had signed an agreement to purchase 50 F-35 jets and up to 18 armed drones, people familiar with the situation told Reuters in January.
Speaking at a news conference in Kuala Lumpur, Blinken said Washington had to conduct some reviews.
""We've wanted to make sure, for example, that our commitment to Israel's qualitative military edge is assured, so we wanted to make sure that we could do a thorough review of any technologies that are sold or transferred to other partners in the region, including the UAE,"" Blinken said.
""But I think we continue to be prepared to move forward if the UAE continues to want to pursue both of these,"" he said.
The sale of 50 F-35 warplanes made by  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT.N) to the UAE had slowed amid concerns in Washington over Abu Dhabi's relationship with China, including its use of 5G technology made by China's tech giant Huawei.

A person briefed on the negotiations said for several months sticking points between the United States and the UAE revolved around how the stealthy jets could be deployed and how much of the sophisticated F-35 technology the UAE would be allowed to take advantage of. The person asked not to be identified by name or by association with either country.
The UAE, one of Washington’s closest Middle East allies, had long expressed interest in acquiring the F-35 jets and was promised a chance to buy them in a side deal when it agreed to normalize relations with Israel in August 2020.

HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - Britain has scolded China for its broadening use of a national security law in Hong Kong, detailing attacks on the city's vaunted judiciary, civil society groups and foreign diplomats.
""The erosion of liberty in Hong Kong is an affront to freedom and democracy,"" Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in the publication on Tuesday of her government's latest six-monthly report on Hong Kong. 
""Just over a year since the introduction of the national security law, the mainland Chinese and Hong Kong authorities have used the law and related institutions against all opposition, free press and civil society in Hong Kong,"" Truss said in a foreword to the report.
""This curtailing of space for the free expression of alternative views continues to weaken checks and balances on executive power.""
The report, which covers events up to June 30, appears to be stronger than earlier ones targeting the impact of the national security law.
Both the Chinese and Hong Kong governments issued statements condemning the report, with a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in London warning that British ""attempts to create trouble in Hong Kong or use Hong Kong to contain China will not succeed.
Beijing imposed the law on the Asian financial hub in June 2020 after months of sometimes violent anti-government protests rocked the city in 2019.
Noting use of the law against some media and journalists, the report charts pressure by pro-Beijing media that has forced trade unions and other groups to disband.
Outlining criticism from some mainland officials, it states that ""judicial independence is increasingly finely balanced"".
Truss said, however, she believed British judges could still ""play a positive role in supporting this judicial independence.""
British judges have long served among the foreign jurists appointed to Hong Kong's highest court, an arrangement designed to maintain confidence in the city's legal system that is seen as the bedrock of its broader social and commercial freedoms.
Britain handed its former colony back to Chinese rule in 1997 amid guarantees that its way of life would be protected under a ""one country, two systems"" model.
Truss said Britain was committed to continuing to monitor the situation in Hong Kong, including speaking to a broad range of politicians.
She expressed concern at the ""growing pattern of the mainland Chinese and Hong Kong authorities misrepresenting such normal diplomatic contact as foreign collusion"".

The Hong Kong government said it ""strongly opposed the unfounded allegations"", urging Britain to ""stop interfering into the internal affairs of China through Hong Kong affairs"".
It also said it opposed the report's criticism of the government's overhaul of the electoral system. Hong Kong is due to vote for a new Legislative Council this weekend, with many opposition figures in jail or exile and only those classed as ""patriots"" allowed to run.

MAYFIELD, Ky. (Reuters) -Clean-up crews in western Kentucky's devastated communities on Tuesday ramped up their Herculean task of carting away mountains of debris left by last week's killer tornadoes as survivors huddled together for warmth and support.
In the hard-hit city of Mayfield, five families bunked together at the home of Reina Guerra Perez, swaddled in donated blankets and cooking on a fire built with scavenged wood. 
""We're cooking out back using the wood from fallen trees and keeping food warm as best we can,"" she said. Her house survived, but the 26 people seeking shelter there on Tuesday had no access to running water or electricity.
The search for bodies beyond the 74 known fatalities came up empty on Tuesday. The tornadoes' victims included more than a dozen children, Beshear said, among them a 2-month-old infant. The oldest to die was 98 years old, he said. 
""I still expect that we will find some more bodies. There is just so much destruction,"" Governor Andy Beshear said at a briefing, adding that more than 100 people were missing and eight victims were unidentified.
Another 14 people died in four other states: six at an Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) warehouse in Illinois, four in Tennessee, two in Missouri and two in Arkansas. 
More than 100 people were working at a candle factory in Mayfield, Kentucky, when the storm, which Beshear said ""will probably be one of the most devastating tornado events in U.S. history,"" reduced the plant to rubble. Eight people were killed, far less than initially feared. 
""If you saw it in person, you would believe that's a miracle,"" Beshear said of the fact that more people were not killed.
Hundreds National Guard service members were searching for victims and survivors, clearing roads and providing police services, Beshear said.
As work crews removed the remains of leveled cities and towns one truckload at a time, the governor said the cleanup would help communities begin to heal. 
""There is something therapeutic about taking that chaos and destruction and death and getting it out of some of those areas,"" said Beshear. 
President Joe Biden plans to visit on Wednesday. He declared a major federal disaster in Kentucky on Sunday.
Many of the victims' relatives started the emotionally trying ordeal of making funeral arrangements.
Carla Cope, whose 29-year-old son Clayton, a U.S. Navy veteran, was among the six Amazon workers, said the company has offered to pay for the arrangements. 
An Amazon spokesman declined to confirm that the company was picking up the funeral expenses but said it was sending workers an array of supplies and services, including food and water.
U.S. workplace safety regulators are investigating the circumstances around the Amazon warehouse collapse https://www.reuters.com/world/us/investigation-into-amazoncom-illinois-building-collapse-opened-labor-official-2021-12-13.
'HE HAD A HUGE HEART'
Clayton Cope loved his dog, video games and hunting and fishing with his father, his mother said.
""He was a really quirky kid with a great sense of humor and he had a lot of friends,"" she said. ""He drew people to him and he had a huge heart."" 
The disaster has also produced an outpouring of volunteers https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/help-arrives-kentucky-with-stew-chain-saws-place-stay-2021-12-14.
At lunchtime on Tuesday, hundreds of people converged on Mayfield-Graves County Fairgrounds, where a loosely organized group of volunteers with food trucks came from hundreds of miles away to provide free meals. The area has become a magnet for a range of relief efforts.
Coordinating the lunch rush was Daniel Oxnard, 42, a student, who started things off on Saturday when he drove his van packed with food and cooking gear more than 200 miles (320 km) and served 1,000 meals. Since then, others joined in, including Amish volunteers from Tennessee, he said. 
“They come here every day with a trailer-load of food and two full griddles and they just cook their hearts out,” he said.

By Tuesday afternoon, 18,000 Kentucky homes and businesses still lacked power, according to PowerOutages.us, more than four days after the tornadoes surprised people by striking unusually late in the year. Insured losses from the swarm of tornadoes could total up to $5 billion https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/deadly-us-tornadoes-cost-insurers-about-3-bln-kcc-2021-12-14, industry experts said on Tuesday.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A new wave of migrants is arriving at the Mexican border due south of the United States after U.S. judges ordered the resumption of a policy that requires migrants to wait in Mexico for the resolution of their asylum cases.
Denouncing the lack of shelter space, activists told Reuters on Tuesday that the ""Remain in Mexico"" program, formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) launched by former U.S. President Donald Trump, is partly responsible for hundreds of new arrivals.
""This is just the beginning,"" said Tomas Diosdado, director of the Alfa y Omega migrant shelter in Mexicali, a city just across the border from Calexico, California. 
Diosdado said some 750 Haitian migrants have arrived in Mexicali over the past couple weeks, attracted by the MPP resumption. Many wrongly think they will now be allowed to enter the United States, he added.
On Monday, a U.S. court rejected the latest attempt by the administration of President Joe Biden to end his predecessor's controversial policy.
Biden, nearly one year into his presidential term, campaigned on a pledge to reverse many of Trump's hard-line immigration policies.
Hundreds of mostly Haitian migrants have also been arriving to the Mexican border city of Tijuana, just south of the U.S. city of San Diego, as well as Ciudad Juarez, across from El Paso, Texas, according to the activists.
Last week, U.S. authorities returned the first migrants under the resumed program to Ciudad Juarez, and by Tuesday the number sent there reached 113, according to data from the United Nations' International Organization for Migration.
If the Mexican government does not provide more shelter for the returned migrants, the influx will expose more to violence and other hardships like hunger and illness, said Jose Garcia, head of the Juventud 2000 migrant shelter in Tijuana.
He said he will work to set up a migrant camp on the border for Haitians, who he said are currently forced to wander the city and sleep on the street.

Under the original 2019 program, some 70,000 migrants seeking asylum were forced to wait weeks and sometimes years in Mexico for a U.S. court date instead of being allowed to await their hearings in the United States.
Neither the U.S. nor Mexican governments has clarified how long the latest iteration of the program will last.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Monday rejected a renewed attempt by the Biden administration to end a policy put in place by former President Donald Trump that forced tens of thousands of migrants to wait in Mexico for the resolution of their U.S. asylum cases.
President Joe Biden, a Democrat, scrapped his Republican predecessor's policy - often referred to as ""Remain in Mexico"" - soon after taking office in January this year. But after Texas and Missouri sued over the rescission, a federal judge ruled it had to be reinstated. 
Under the 2019 policy, officially called the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), migrants seeking asylum must wait weeks and sometimes years in Mexico for a U.S. court date instead of being allowed to await their hearings in the United States. Biden decried the policy on the campaign trail and immigration advocates have said migrants stuck in dangerous border cities have faced kidnappings and other dangers.
The Biden administration re-issued a memo terminating MPP in the hopes it would overcome the legal challenges. But the conservative-leaning 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was not convinced by the new memo.
In a Monday night ruling, the court said the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) ""claims the power to implement a massive policy reversal — affecting billions of dollars and countless people — simply by typing out a new Word document and posting it on the internet. No input from Congress, no ordinary rulemaking procedures, and no judicial review.""
""DHS has come nowhere close to shouldering its heavy burden to show that it can make law in a vacuum,"" the judges wrote in a 117-page opinion. 
The White House and the U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In compliance with the court's order, the administration began sending the first asylum seekers back to Mexico again last week. 

The number of migrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border has soared to record highs this year, sparking criticism from Republicans. 
Many migrants arrested at the border, however, are quickly expelled without being given a chance to even seek asylum under a different Trump policy put in place at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which Biden has kept in place.

749,"<span>Dec 14, 2021 05:21PM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - An ethics panel in New York on Tuesday ordered former Governor Andrew Cuomo to return $5.1 million he received for his memoir after finding he failed to follow state ethics regulations, a spokesperson with the commission said. 
The Joint Commission on Public Ethics voted 12-1 to approve the order, the spokesperson said. Reuters has not seen the commission's full resolution.
Cuomo has 30 days to surrender the money he made for writing the book ""American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic"" to the state. The state attorney general’s office will have the authority to decide how the funds are dispersed, the New York Times reported. 
In a statement, Cuomo lawyer Jim McGuire vowed to fight the order.
""JCOPE’s actions today are unconstitutional, exceed its own authority and appear to be driven by political interests rather than the facts and the law,"" McGuire said. ""Should they seek to enforce this action, we’ll see them in court.""
In November, the commission found Cuomo failed to meet state regulations that dictate the outside activities of public officials, such as writing a book in exchange for royalties or other compensation. The commission said Cuomo violated a requirement not to use state resources to complete the book and misrepresented how long it would take to complete. 
Cuomo, a Democrat, stepped down as governor in August after multiple allegations of sexual misconduct. He has denied any wrongdoing.
He was initially lauded for his handling of a crippling coronavirus outbreak in New York. But praise turned to blame when media reported allegations of misconduct, including the under-reporting of nursing home deaths.

Cuomo's book was published in October 2020 by The Crown Publishing Group, a subsidiary of Penguin Random House.
Cuomo has donated $500,000 of the proceeds to charity and placed another $1 million in a trust for his daughters, the Times reported.

He added that a meeting between U.S. and UAE officials at the Pentagon later this week was set to be about broad topics but anticipated that the weapons sale would come up. 
Kirby referred questions about details of specific arms sales to the State Department.
A State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the Biden administration was committed to the proposed sales of the F-35 aircraft along with the MQ-9B and munitions.

RIYADH (Reuters) - A Gulf Arab summit in Saudi Arabia urged Iran on Tuesday to take concrete steps to ease tension while reiterating a call to include the region in talks between global powers and Tehran aimed at salvaging their nuclear agreement.
Saudi Arabia's crown prince had told the annual gathering of Gulf leaders before the final communique was issued that the nuclear and missile programmes of longstanding adversary Iran should be handled ""seriously and effectively"".
Indirect talks between Iran and the United States to revive the 2015 nuclear pact started in April, but stopped in June after the election of hardline President Ebrahim Raisi. After a five-month hiatus, Iran's negotiating team returned to Vienna with an uncompromising stance.
""So far the reports show there is some stalling by Iran and we hope this will turn to progress in the near future,"" Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan al-Saud told a press conference after the Gulf summit. 
He said that while Gulf states prefer to be part of the talks they would be ""open to any mechanism"" that addresses their concerns, which also include Iran's regional proxies.
Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Iran are vying for influence in a rivalry that has played out across the region in events such as Yemen's war and in Lebanon, where Iran-backed Hezbollah's rising power has frayed Beirut's Gulf ties. 
Riyadh and the United Arab Emirates are both engaging with Iran in a bid to contain tensions at a time of deepening Gulf uncertainty over the U.S. role in the region, and as the oil producing states focus on economic growth.
Prince Faisal said the talks had seen no ""real change on the ground"" but that ""we are open, we are willing"".
Iran's president has said his foreign policy priority would be improving ties with Gulf neighbours.
SOLIDARITY
The Saudi crown prince toured the Gulf in a show of solidarity ahead of the summit, which took place nearly a year after Riyadh put an end to a 3-1/2-year Arab boycott of Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and non-Gulf Egypt have restored diplomatic ties with Doha but the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have yet to do so, though Abu Dhabi has moved to mend fences.
The four boycotting states had accused Qatar of supporting Islamist militants, a charge Doha denied. 

Saudi Arabia and the UAE have shifted away from hawkish foreign policies to a more conciliatory approach as they vie to lure foreign investment, and win over U.S. President Joe Biden.
The UAE has acted faster to improve ties with Iran and Turkey, while also re-engaging with Syria after forging relations with Israel last year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on Tuesday on whether to seek criminal contempt of Congress charges against Mark Meadows, Donald Trump's chief of staff, for refusing to cooperate with a congressional probe of the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol attack.
The seven Democrats and two Republicans on the Select Committee investigating the attack voted unanimously on Monday evening to recommend that the full House approve its report making the case for a contempt of Congress charge against Meadows, who served in the House before joining the Republican president's administration.
Republican Representative Liz Cheney, the panel's vice chair, read out panicked texts from Republicans and others pleading with Meadows on Jan. 6 to urge Trump to appear publicly and call off his followers. The texts surfaced during the Select Committee's investigation.
""He's got to condemn this shit ASAP. We need an Oval Office address,"" Trump's son Donald Jr. said in one text. In other texts, conservative media hosts made similar private pleas to Meadows - before playing down the violence of the attack on the air.
""The American people deserve to know all of the steps that Donald Trump and those around him and that his campaign were taking in an effort to change the results of the election,"" Cheney said.
Trump, at a rally on Jan. 6, repeated his false claim that his loss to Democratic President Joe Biden in the November 2020 election was the result of widespread fraud, and urged his supporters to march on the Capitol as Congress gathered to certify Biden's victory. Biden took office on Jan. 20.
Four people died on the day of the riot, and one Capitol police officer died the next day of injuries sustained while defending Congress. Hundreds of police were injured during the multi-hour onslaught by Trump supporters, and four officers have since taken their own lives.
Separately, the city of Washington on Tuesday sued two right-wing groups for the financial costs associated with the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol.
The House Rules Committee advanced the contempt resolution by 8-4 on Tuesday, voting along party lines with Republicans voting no. That paved the way for its consideration by the full Democratic-led House later in the day. If the House approves the resolution, as expected, it would send the matter for the Department of Justice to decide whether to pursue charges.
The charge carries up to a year in prison.
'EVERYBODY'S LIFE WAS ENDANGERED'
Representative Tom Cole, the Rules panel's top Republican, argued that it was too early for a contempt recommendation, given lawsuits filed by Trump and Meadows himself arguing that the former president's communications should be protected by executive privilege and that committee subpoenas are too broad.
""Today's action is wildly premature,"" Cole said.
The Rules Committee's chairman, Democrat Jim McGovern, said, ""Everybody's life was endangered on the Capitol campus"" in the worst assault on the seat of the U.S. government since the War of 1812.
Meadows' attorney, George Terwilliger, said in a statement on Tuesday that his client had not stopped cooperating.
""He has maintained consistently that as a former chief of staff he cannot be compelled to appear for questioning and that he as a witness is not licensed to waive executive privilege claimed by the former president,"" Terwilliger said.
A federal appeals court last week rejected Trump's request to withhold documents because of executive privilege, noting that Biden, as president, has already authorized their release.
""Both branches agree that there is a unique legislative need for these documents and that they are directly relevant to the Committee’s inquiry into an attack on the legislative branch and its constitutional role in the peaceful transfer of power,"" the court said.

Meadows could become the third Trump associate to face a criminal contempt charge. The Justice Department, at the House's request, has brought similar charges against Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon. The House is considering similar action against former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark.
Cheney said at the Rules Committee meeting that Trump had wanted to appoint Clark as U.S. attorney general.

Ethan Crumbley, 15, blinked occasionally behind glasses and over a white face mask during the Oakland County criminal court procedural hearing as his lawyers said his mental, physical and emotional health was not best served by holding him in the county's adult jail, although he is isolated from other inmates.
His lawyers also argued he was not a threat to other young people and should be held at a youth facility.
Oakland County assistant prosecutor Marc Keast told Judge Nancy Carniak that video evidence showed Crumbley was responsible for the Nov. 30 shooting that killed four students and seriously wounded six others and a teacher at Oxford High School in suburban Oakland County, 30 miles (48 km) northwest of Detroit. Crumbley has pleaded not guilty.
Keast said he could not imagine putting Crumbley, who has been charged as an adult and is being held without bond, in a juvenile facility.
The judge said she would not move Crumbley. Keast assured her he would contact jail officials to ""make sure the defendant is not within sight or sound of adults at the Oakland County Jail."" 
His lawyers had said Crumbley could hear adults from where he was being held in the jail's clinic.
Crumbley spoke only briefly during the hearing, giving his name and telling the judge he understood the proceedings.

Also charged in the Nov. 30 killings are his parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, who prosecutors say gave him a semi-automatic handgun as an early Christmas present and then ignored signs that he was planning a shooting at the school.
The parents, who have pleaded not guilty, are being held in the same county jail as their son in lieu of $500,000 bail each on charges of involuntary manslaughter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The state of Arizona on Tuesday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to allow a Republican-backed law that bans abortions performed due to fetal genetic abnormalities such as Down syndrome to go into effect.
The emergency request to the justices, made by Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, seeks to block part of a September ruling by a federal judge in the state that put the newly enacted measure on hold.
The Arizona Medical Association physicians' group and abortion rights advocates were among those filing suit after Arizona Governor Doug Ducey in April signed into law the measure banning abortions performed strictly on the basis of genetic disorders detected in the fetus, such as Down syndrome or cystic fibrosis, unless the condition is considered lethal.
It is one of a series of Republican-backed abortion restrictions pursued at the state level in recent years.
Brnovich has asked the high court to allow the provision to go into effect while litigation continues on the appeal.
His request reaches the conservative-majority court as the justices weigh another major abortion case from Mississippi that could lead to the overturning of the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized the procedure nationwide. Such a move would make it easier for states to impose restrictions on abortion or possibly ban it entirely.

Mississippi's law, blocked by lower courts, bans abortions at 15 weeks of pregnancy. The conservative justices during arguments on Dec. 1 indicated sympathy toward Mississippi's law and potential support for overturning Roe. 
In another case, the Supreme Court last Friday left in place a Texas ban on abortions starting at about six weeks of pregnancy but allowed a legal challenge to proceed, with the fate of the Republican-backed measure that allows private citizens to enforce it still hanging in the balance.

""He was my friend and he didn't make it,"" said coworker Brian Erdmann, who was on his way to make a delivery to the warehouse. ""If I would have got back 45 minutes earlier, I probably would have been at the same place. I would have been right there with him.""
The other Amazon workers identified as dead by a coroner were Deandre S. Morrow, 28, of St. Louis, Missouri; Kevin D. Dickey, 62, of Carlyle, Illinois; Clayton Lynn Cope, 29, of Alton, Illinois; Etheria S. Hebb, 24, of St. Louis, Missouri; and Larry E. Virden, 46, of Collinsville, Illinois.
Several employees told Reuters that they had been directed to shelter in bathrooms by Amazon managers after receiving emergency alerts on mobile phones from authorities. 
Amazon said employees were directed to shelter in place at a designated assembly area at the front of the building, which was near a restroom. 
The site received tornado warnings between 8:06 p.m. and 8:16 p.m. before the tornado struck the building at 8:27 p.m., the company said. 
""Our team worked quickly to ensure as many employees and partners could get to the designated Shelter in Place,"" the company said in a statement. ""We thank them for everything they were able to do.""
Some of those workers said they had kept their phones despite what they believed was a violation of an Amazon policy that prevents them from having cellphones at work. 
The company responded by saying that there was no Amazon policy that prevents employees or contractors from having a cell phone at work. 
""I was at the end of my route. I was just getting in the building and they started screaming, 'Shelter in place!'"" said David Kosiak, 26, who has worked at the facility for three months. ""We were in the bathrooms. That's where they sent us.""
""It sounded like a train came through the building. The ceiling tiles came flying down. It very loud. They made us shelter in place til we left - it was at least two and a half hours in there.""
The National Weather Service said the tornado hit the area between 8:28 and 8:32 p.m. central time, intensifying rapidly as it struck the Amazon warehouse. With estimated peak winds of 150 miles per hour (241 km-per-hour) winds, the force was so severe that the roof was ripped off and 11-inch (28-cm) thick concrete walls longer than football fields fell in on themselves.
At least 45 Amazon employees made it out safely. Authorities had given up hope of finding more survivors as they shifted from rescue to recovery efforts that were expected to last days. 
The company has three facilities in Edwardsville: the delivery station hit by the storm as well as a fulfillment center and a sorting station. The delivery station opened in July 2020 to prepare orders for last-mile delivery to customers.
Amazon said it was donating $1 million to the Edwardsville Community Foundation. The company said it is providing relief supplies as well as transport, food and water.

On Sunday, Amazon workers arrived at the warehouse across the street, heavily guarded by security, to start shifts.
""It's a reminder of the trauma that I just endured but I will be returning to work at Amazon,"" said McEwen's friend and coworker Emily Epperson. ""This is my livelihood.”

BOSTON (Reuters) - A federal jury was selected on Tuesday in the trial of a Harvard University nanotechnology professor accused of lying to U.S. authorities about his ties to a China-run recruitment program and concealing funding he received from the Chinese government.
The Boston jury will return on Wednesday to hear lawyers deliver opening statements in the trial of Charles Lieber, an ex-chair of Harvard's chemistry department charged in the highest-profile case to result from a U.S. crackdown on Chinese influence within universities.
Lieber, 62, has pleaded not guilty to six false statement and tax charges. His lawyer, Marc Mukasey, has said Lieber ""didn't hide anything, and he didn't get paid as the government alleges.""
Prosecutors charged Lieber in January 2020 as part of the U.S. Department of Justice's ""China Initiative"" it started during former President Donald Trump's administration to combat Chinese economic espionage and research theft.
President Joe Biden's administration has not backed away from the initiative, despite critics who say it went too far in pursuing academics and that it overly targeted Chinese nationals.
The first trial of an academic - a Tennessee professor - ended in a mistrial and later an acquittal by a judge. Prosecutors this year dropped charges against six other researchers.
A Justice Department review of how it approaches countering threats posed by China is expected to be completed in the coming weeks, agency spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle said.
Prosecutors said Lieber in 2011 became a ""strategic scientist"" at Wuhan University of Technology and through it participated in a Chinese recruitment drive called the Thousand Talents Program.
U.S. authorities say China uses the program to entice foreign researchers to share their knowledge with China in exchange for perks including research funding.

As part of the program, the Wuhan university gave Lieber more than $1.5 million to establish a Chinese lab and agreed to pay him $50,000 per month plus $150,000 in annual living expenses.
Prosecutors said Lieber lied to investigators about his involvement in the program and also misled Harvard, which in 2019 told the National Institutes of Health that he was not involved with it.

NAIROBI (Reuters) -Veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga launched his fifth bid for Kenya's presidency on Friday, this time with the support of his former foe President Uhuru Kenyatta.
Voters are due to go to the polls next August but Kenyatta will not be on the ballot due to a constitutional term limit of two, five-year terms.
Odinga praised Kenyatta for initiating the dialogue that united them four years ago after a bitter dispute following the 2017 vote.
""It takes a seasoned statesman to shake the hand of his rival,"" he told tens of thousands of supporters gathered at Nairobi's main sports stadium.
Dressed in the orange and blue colors of Odinga's Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party, the supporters sang and danced at the rally. Some waved party and national flags.
In Odinga's last three runs for office in 2007, 2013, he led his supporters to protest at the outcomes or challenge them in court, saying his victories were stolen. Deadly clashes followed the 2007 and 2017 votes.
But he made peace with Kenyatta in early 2018, effectively sidelining Kenyatta's deputy William Ruto, who has been vocal about his own presidential ambitions.
Several ministers and other senior officials attended the campaign launch. The vice chair of Kenyatta's Jubilee party also addressed the crowd, underscoring the president's support.
Odinga outlined a plan for improving socioeconomic welfare and said he would fight poverty.
Ruto, who quit Jubilee and is running on a new party called United Democratic Alliance (UDA), belongs to a different ethnic group in the Rift Valley.
Odinga and Ruto have already been battling it out on the campaign trail, especially in central Kenya, where Kenyatta's ethnic Kikuyu votes are up for grabs.
Ruto fought alongside Odinga in 2007, when police crackdowns on protesters and clashes that turned into ethnic attacks killed more than 1,000 people in post-election violence, eventually prompting a new constitution to devolve power. Ruto teamed up with Kenyatta in 2013. 
Odinga has secured the support of many of the central region's business tycoons and ministers. Ruto has the backing of most of the region's elected representatives.
Odinga has been touting his long experience in national leadership, including a stint as prime minister. He has also promised to stamp out widespread graft, give a monthly stipend of 6,000 shillings ($53) to the unemployed, and unite Kenya's ethnic groups. 

Ruto has also pledged to focus on the poor if elected.

(Reuters) - Kim Kardashian has cleared a key hurdle in her unconventional quest to become an attorney.
The reality television star and entrepreneur said Monday on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) that she passed California's First-Year Law Students’ Examination—a daylong test required of aspiring lawyers in the state who are not taking the traditional path of attending an accredited law school.
""OMFGGGG I PASSED THE BABY BAR EXAM!!!!” she wrote to her 70.7 million followers, posting photos of herself posing in a bright blue jumpsuit. “For anyone who doesn’t know my law school journey, know this wasn’t easy or handed to me.”
Passing the test—better known as the baby bar—means Kardashian can continue her legal studies and will be able to take the full bar exam. She said in 2019 that she was studying to become a lawyer through what is known as the Law Office Study Program, in which would-be attorneys train under the supervision of an experienced lawyer or judge. 
California is among the handful of states that has such a program and is the only one with a baby bar. 
Pass rate information was not yet available for the Oct. 26 exam that Kardashian took, but only 21% of those who took the exam in June passed--less than half the rate for the state's most recent regular bar exam.
The State Bar of California on Monday said baby bar results are confidential and it could not confirm Kardashian passed. 
Kardashian, whose father Robert Kardashian was on O.J. Simpson’s defense team during his 1995 murder trial, has previously said that she wants to become a lawyer to work on criminal justice reform. 
She is studying under the supervision of attorneys Erin Haney and Jessica Jackson, whom Kardashian thanked on Twitter, saying they had brought her along to observe their court appearances.

Kardashian also noted she had failed the exam three times before passing. That made this her final opportunity: California typically allows people to take the First-Year Law Students’ Examination just three times but gave anyone who failed the June 2020 exam one extra try due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""I am so happy for her,"" said University of Washington law professor, Steve Calandrillo, who tutored Kardashian on contracts via Zoom to prepare for the test. ""She has worked so hard for two years now. It is not an easy exam.""

COPENHAGEN/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Two crew members on a British cargo vessel were found to be over the legal limit for alcohol after a collision with a Danish barge in the Baltic Sea that killed at least one person, a Swedish prosecutor and the owner of the British ship said.
The 55-metre Karin Hoj barge capsized when it crashed with the 90-metre Scot Carrier off the island of Bornholm in fog and darkness early on Monday.
One of the two Danish crew members from the capsized barge was found dead in the hull. The other crew member was still missing and rescue efforts were abandoned after ships and helicopters scoured the waters to no avail on Monday.
The Swedish Prosecution Authority is investigating several suspected crimes - negligence in maritime traffic, causing death through negligence, and marine intoxication. 
Two of the Scot Carrier's crew, a Briton and a Croatian, remained in custody on Tuesday as part of the preliminary investigation. The prosecutor has until Thursday to decide whether to hold the suspects longer.
""The suspects that are in custody have both tested positive for alcohol,"" Public Prosecutor Tomas Olvmyr told Reuters. ""One person is suspected of gross marine intoxication based on actions in connection with the accident.""
The lawyer representing the Croatian suspect had not yet spoken to his client, with interviews scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. 
The Briton in custody was suspected on multiple counts, including causing death through negligence, and had been on watch at the time of the collision, after which the smaller Danish ship capsized.
The Briton's lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment. 
""As things look at present, the two ships have moved in parallel and then one of the ships has swerved and run into the other one,"" Olvmyr said. 
Scotline, which owns the Scot Carrier, said in a statement it has a strict drug and alcohol policy in place and zero tolerance of any breaches.

The overturned Karin Hoj was towed into shallow water on Monday to allow divers to gain access without the risk of being pulled down if it sinks. The Swedish Coastguard plans to move it again to a place where it can be turned upright.
""It's not likely the second (missing) person is there,"" Swedish Coastguard spokesperson Valdemar Lindekrantz said. ""But we can't be absolutely sure until we've righted the ship and examined every single space.""

RAVANUSA, Italy (Reuters) -Rescuers have pulled four more bodies out of the rubble of houses destroyed by a suspected gas explosion in the Sicilian town of Ravanusa, bringing the total death toll to seven, the fire brigade said on Monday. 
Two people are still missing following Saturday's blast, which demolished four houses and badly damaged another three. 
Sniffer dogs located the four bodies, including a nurse who was nine-months pregnant, in the early hours and emergency services worked through the night to clear away the debris in order to reach them safely.
""The rubble has to be removed carefully piece by piece to avoid other possible collapses, which could hit both the fire-fighters ... but also the people we are looking for,"" fire service spokesman Luca Cari told Reuters.
Authorities said the deadly explosion was likely triggered by a gas leak, although an investigation was underway to ascertain the cause.
""There has been no maintenance for a 100 years ... Sicily has been forgotten,"" Maria Rallo, a friend of one of the victims, told Reuters.
Gas grid operator Italgas expressed its sorrow and offered condolences to people in Ravanusa. It said its emergency service had received no reports of gas leaks last week.
Ravanusa is a town of about 11,000 people near the southwestern Sicilian city of Agrigento, which is famous for its Greek temples.

Mayor Carmelo D'Angelo said he would spare no effort to rebuild the wrecked homes as soon as possible.
""There are families who have unfortunately lost everything ... in addition to losing their relatives, they have lost their homes, their memories, their photos, even their belongings,"" he said.

Jet-setting banking executives stuck in Hong Kong's weeks-long quarantine programme have received confectionery from senior regulators as a morale-booster during their isolation.
""From their own pockets, Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) senior executives sent confectioneries to a handful of executives under quarantine as a token of personal regard,"" an HKMA spokesperson said on Wednesday.
The gesture was earlier reported by local Hong Kong media. The banking regulator denied that the HKMA had a “confectionery programme”.
Reuters could not determine if the sweet treats helped lift the bankers' spirits.
Hong Kong's tough quarantine regime has helped it escape the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic but it has been a burden for residents of Asia's top financial hub and the international banks based there.
Last month an industry group warned that the restrictions could undermine Hong Kong's status as a financial centre.
Currently, residents travelling back to Hong Kong from most places outside mainland China must undergo three weeks of quarantine at a government-approved hotel which they must pay for themselves.
Non-Hong Kong residents from many countries cannot enter.
The territory's government says their priority is allowing quarantine free travel between Hong Kong and mainland China - which also has a zero-Covid policy - and they hope to open this border gradually in the coming months. 
Several investment banks in Hong Kong including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and UBS have offered staff cash payments to cover quarantine costs on returning from a visit home.

In a circular published late Tuesday, Hong Kong's markets watchdog the Securities and Futures Commission set out eligibility criteria and pre-registration procedures for executives of the asset managers and brokers it regulates to travel to neighbouring Guangdong province without undergoing quarantine.
Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan, got an exemption from quarantine when he visited Hong Kong last month.

(Reuters) - Prosecutors rested their case in Ghislaine Maxwell's sex abuse trial on Friday after two weeks of emotional testimony from four women who say Maxwell set them up for sexual encounters with Jeffrey Epstein when the women were teenagers.
Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and other charges, and her lawyers have said she is being scapegoated for Epstein's conduct since he is dead. 
As Maxwell's lawyers prepare to mount a defense, here are five takeaways from the prosecution's case: 
Accusers' testimony placed Maxwell at the center of the alleged abuse by Epstein
All four accusers gave emotional testimony. Three of the four said Maxwell touched their breasts.
A woman identified as Carolyn said Maxwell once touched her at the age of 14 while she was preparing to massage Epstein. 
""I was fully nude and she came in and she felt my boobs and my hips and my buttocks and said that ... I had a great body for Mr. Epstein and his friends,"" Carolyn said.
Jurors also heard from a woman known by the pseudonym Jane, who testified that Epstein sexually abused her when she was 14. Jane said Maxwell sometimes participated in their encounters, which often began as massages before escalating.
Prosecutors showed Maxwell and Epstein had a close, intimate relationship
A former house manager who worked at Epstein's Palm Beach, Florida, estate from 1991 to 2002 testified that Maxwell was ""lady of the house"" and was with Epstein ""95% of the time."" 
Prosecutors later showed jurors more than a dozen photographs to demonstrate the intimacy of the relationship between Maxwell and Epstein in the 1990s. Two of them showed Maxwell rubbing Epstein's bare foot while it pressed against her chest.
Accusers said Epstein and Maxwell promised they would help them financially 
Three of the four accusers said they were told as teenagers that Epstein and Maxwell could help them financially. Jane, a singer, said her family was struggling after her father's death. She said Epstein and Maxwell told her when she was 14 that they were benefactors of her summer camp and awarded many student scholarships. 
Another accuser, Annie Farmer, said she believed Epstein would help pay for her college education.
The accusers often grew agitated under cross-examination
Maxwell's lawyers aggressively questioned the four women in an effort to undercut their testimony, questioning the accuracy of their memories and arguing they were motivated by money.
During cross-examination of Carolyn, an attorney for Maxwell pressed her about $3.25 million she received from a compensation fund set up for Epstein victims and whether she had an incentive to ""stick to her story."" 
""Why is that being mentioned more than once?"" asked Carolyn. She later sobbed on the stand.
The prosecution lost some battles to the defense.
In a victory for Maxwell's defense team, U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan ruled that two of the accusers - Farmer and Kate - were old enough to consent during their alleged encounters with Epstein and that their contact with him could not be considered ""illegal,"" as prosecutors had alleged in the indictment.
Prosecutors, however, did not have to drop any charges against Maxwell as a result since neither Farmer nor Kate was the sole alleged victim underlying any of the six counts she faces. 

Nathan also criticized prosecutors after they revealed Jane had called her brother after her testimony. Prosecutors had expected to call Jane's brother as a witness to corroborate her account.
Prosecutors withdrew their plans to call Jane's brother after Nathan told them that ""best practice"" would dictate they should have clearly told Jane not to discuss her testimony with other potential witnesses.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - It was finished years late at a cost far higher than planned, but NASA's James Webb Space Telescope due for launch next week may usher in a new era in astronomy as it gathers information on the universe's earliest stages, star formation, and whether planets beyond our solar system may be suitable for life.
The orbiting infrared observatory, designed to be about 100 times more sensitive than its Hubble Space Telescope predecessor, is due to blast off on Dec. 22 on an Ariane 5 rocket from a site in French Guiana on South America's northeastern coast. 
""We're about to go on this amazing journey of discovery,"" said astronomer Klaus Pontoppidan, a Webb project scientist the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. ""We really mean discovery because Webb has the raw power to reveal the unexpected. We can plan what we think we're gong to see. But at the end of the day we know that nature will surprise us more often than not.""
The telescope, boasting four scientific instruments, is an international collaboration led by NASA in partnership with the European and Canadian space agencies.  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC) is the primary contractor. The launch vehicle is part of the European contribution.
It was developed at a cost of $8.8 billion, with operational expenses projected to bring its total price tag to about $9.66 billion. The U.S. Government Accountability Office said the price has nearly doubled since NASA established a cost baseline in 2009 after earlier cost overruns. NASA had hoped to launch it in 2011, but the date was repeatedly delayed.
Scientists plan to use the telescope to learn about all phases of the universe's history dating back to just after the Big Bang event about 13.8 billion years ago, while also studying exoplanets - planets beyond our solar system - as well as worlds closer to home such as our planetary neighbor Mars and Saturn's moon Titan. 
Webb mainly will look at the universe in the infrared, while Hubble has examined it since its 1990 launch primarily at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths. Webb has a much bigger light-collecting area, letting it look at greater distances, thus farther back into time, than Hubble. 
""We're looking forward to this and we're getting very, very close,"" said Greg Robinson, Webb's program director at the U.S. space agency's Washington headquarters.
The telescope arrived in French Guiana in October after a 16-day sea journey from California through the Panama Canal to Port de Pariacabo on the Kourou River. After launch, it will deploy on a month-long million-mile (1.6 million km) journey to a more distant orbit than Hubble, beyond the moon.
""We're going to look at everything there is in the universe that we can see. We want to know: how did we get here from the Big Bang, how did that work? So, we'll look,"" said John Mather, Webb senior project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.
Its mission goals include searching for the first galaxies or luminous objects formed after the Big Bang and learning how galaxies evolved from their initial birth to the present day. 
""We want to look at those first galaxies growing,"" Mather said.
The goals also include observing the formation of stars and the planets around them. Mather said Webb can peer into the clouds of gas and dust where stars are being born. Until now, the dust in those clouds obscured the view.

""Infrared light will go around the dust grains instead of bouncing off, so we can see that with the Webb telescope. And that's one of our top goals - to see how stars grow, with their young planets,"" Mather said.
An instrument called a spectrometer can study the atmospheres of exoplanets. Mather said finding one with lots of water - thought to be one of the key ingredients for life - would be ""really interesting."" As he put it: ""a wet little planet out there that might be a little bit like home.""

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Secretary of State Antony Blinken touted on Tuesday a U.S. strategy to deepen its Asian treaty alliances, offering to boost defence and intelligence work with partners in an Indo-Pacific region increasingly concerned over China's ""aggressive actions"". 
On a visit to Indonesia, Blinken called the Indo-Pacific the world's most dynamic region, where everyone had a stake in ensuring a status quo that was without coercion and intimidation, making a barely veiled reference to China.
He said the United States, its allies and some South China Sea claimants would push back against any unlawful action.
""We'll work with our allies and partners to defend the rules-based order that we've built together over decades to ensure the region remains open and accessible,"" Blinken said in a speech at a university. 
""Let me be clear: the goal of defending the rules-based order is not to keep any country down. Rather, it's to protect the right of all countries to choose their own path, free from coercion and intimidation."" 
China claims almost the entire South China Sea as its own, despite some overlapping claims with other coastal states and a ruling by an international tribunal that its vast claim had no legal basis. 
Beijing has rejected the U.S. stance as interference from an outside power that could threaten Asia's stability. 
In response to Blinken's remarks, China's foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a daily briefing in the Chinese capital that the United States should promote cooperation in the region, instead of ""drawing ideological lines"".
Blinken is making his first visit to Southeast Asia since President Joe Biden took office in January, a trip aimed at shoring up relations after a period of uncertainty about U.S. commitment to Asia under the administration of Donald Trump.
'A BETTER KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE'
Despite tension in the South China Sea, Beijing's influence has grown in recent years as it pushes more infrastructure investment and integrated trade ties in the Asia-Pacific, in the perceived absence of a U.S. economic strategy for the region. 
Blinken said the United States would strengthen ties with treaty allies such as Japan, South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines and boost defence and intelligence capabilities with Indo-Pacific partners, as well as defending an open and secure internet.
He stressed, however, that it was not a contest between a U.S.-centric or China-centric region.
He also said Washington was committed to pressing the military junta in Myanmar to end violence, free detainees and return to an inclusive democracy. 
The United States was also committed to a new comprehensive regional economic framework, which would include more U.S. foreign direct investment and U.S. companies identifying new opportunities in the region, he said, without providing details. 
The administration has yet to spell out what exactly Biden's envisaged economic framework will entail. In 2017, the Trump administration walked away from a U.S.-inspired multinational Pacific trade deal.
Blinken, who will also visit Malaysia and Thailand this week, said the United States would work to strengthen supply chains and close the region's infrastructure gaps, from ports and roads to power grids and the internet. 
In another swipe at China, he said the United States was hearing increasing concerns in the Indo-Pacific about opaque, corrupt processes of foreign companies that imported their own labour, drained natural resources and polluted the environment. 

""Countries in the Indo-Pacific want a better kind of infrastructure,"" he said. 
""But many feel it's too expensive – or they feel pressured to take bad deals on terms set by others, rather than no deals at all.""

TAOS, N.M. (Reuters) - (This December 10 story corrects to read ""Thomas"" in paragraph 17 instead of ""Sanders"")
Nearly a year after COVID-19 vaccines were first administered in the United States, the country is returning to many of the hallmarks that defined earlier pandemic life: mask mandates, mass vaccination sites, crowded hospitals and a rising death toll. 
Amid hope that humanity would soon get the upper hand on the coronavirus, New York City intensive care unit (ICU) nurse Sandra Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) received a dose of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s just-approved vaccine last Dec. 14, becoming the first inoculated U.S. resident.
Since then, more than 200 million others - more than 60% of the U.S. population - have gotten at least two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech or  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) vaccines or one Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s single-shot inoculation, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Despite that triumph of modern science, the country's death toll continues to mount. Since the first dose was administered, nearly 500,000 more people have died of COVID-19, with the country expected to cross the 800,000 mark next week, according to a Reuters tally.
Both infections - approaching 50 million since the start of the pandemic - and deaths have been rising in recent weeks, especially as colder weather in northern states pushes activities indoors, allowing for easier virus transmission.
Resurging infections on Friday prompted New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, to temporarily reimpose a requirement for face coverings inside businesses and venues that do not require proof of vaccination.
""We shouldn't have reached the point where we are confronted with a winter surge, especially with the vaccine at our disposal, and I share many New Yorkers' frustration that we are not past this pandemic yet,"" Hochul said in a statement.
Mask mandates, which Republican governors mostly eschewed as government overreach, were a common infection-prevention tool for many Democratic governors during the pandemic's worst surge, which began during the year-end holiday season of 2020.
Combating the virus has been complicated by its more aggressive mutations, including the currently dominant Delta variant and fast-spreading Omicron, which was first identified last month and has already been detected in nearly half of the 50 states.
The politicization of vaccines and hesitancy of many Americans to get the shots has also helped keep the pandemic going, usually with more deadly results, experts said.
In New Mexico, hospitals are reaching record capacity levels as unvaccinated patients fill ICUs. 
In one of the Southwestern state's hardest-hit hospitals in San Juan County, critical care beds filled up as fast as patients were discharged or died. Dr. Erin Philpott said eight of her patients had died in the last week, most of them unvaccinated.
""It's sometimes hard to even feel because it's so much and it's constant,"" Philpott said.
""You can see the rooms fill up right after, and you don’t have a second to pause and just process all this loss."" Philpott added that many of those dying from COVID-19 at San Juan Regional Medical Center were in their 30s and 40s.
Around 94% of COVID-19 deaths at the hospital are among the unvaccinated. ""It feels like it's impossible to keep seeing this and dealing with it,"" said Philpott. ""I think that's why half the staff have gone.""
Nurse Patricia Thomas stood by a dead patient she had treated, a white sheet over his body, a picture of his family at his feet. His relatives made the decision to take him off life support. He was vaccinated. He had five children and 12 grandchildren.
Choking back tears, Thomas said: ""We took the tubes out and let them hold his hand while he passed comfortably. Today was pretty hard because it’s my third one this week.""
'FUEL FOR THIS FIRE'
As with other states with early high vaccination rates like Vermont, Rhode Island and New Hampshire, immunity has waned in New Mexico, pushing these states toward the top of rankings for new cases.
The state's Democratic governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, pushed vaccinations early in 2021 to try to limit hospitalizations.
""The fuel for this fire, our case counts, is unvaccinated individuals,” New Mexico Acting Health Secretary David Scrase told reporters. ""Our hospitals are in a really grave situation.""
Three out of four COVID patients in the state are unvaccinated, officials said. The same was true for Michigan, dealing with one of the nation's worst outbreaks.
In Connecticut, health officials this week said unvaccinated people are five times more likely to get infected with COVID-19, 12 times more likely to be hospitalized and 16 times more likely to die.
Shortly after the Omicron variant was detected in New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy this week reopened one of the state's previously shuttered mass vaccination sites in an effort to encourage residents to get booster shots.
Most of the large vaccination sites that states opened early this year to speed inoculations have closed.
The CDC estimates that about one-fourth of Americans have gotten additional booster shots so far. They have now been authorized for everyone age 16 and up.
Another symbol of the early pandemic, the contaminated cruise ship, also re-emerged this week. 

On Monday, Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings said a South African crew member suspected of having the Omicron variant was among 17 cases of the virus detected on a ship that disembarked in New Orleans over the weekend.
In March 2020 when relatively few cases had been reported in the United States, the cruise ship Grand Princess was held at sea for days before being allowed dock in Oakland, California. Its 2,400 passengers were sent into quarantine at military bases after tests revealed 21 positive cases of the coronavirus.

LONDON (Reuters) - UK Remainers may take a crumb of comfort as Prime Minister Boris Johnson, elected on a promise to ""Get Brexit Done"", sees his poll support dive after a string of scandals.
But a year after Britain left the European Union, even the most ardent of pro-EU backers accept the divorce was so complete that it could take years to win back anything like the relationship with Europe they would find acceptable.
""It'll have to come in stages, over years,"" said activist Steve Bray, whose one-man street protests outside the Houses of Parliament since the 2016 referendum provided the noisy backdrop to hundreds of TV broadcasts as the saga unfolded.
Barely two years ago, British Remainers could plausibly claim to have created the most proactive pro-EU grassroots movement in Europe, mobilising hundreds of thousands to join street demos and millions more to sign anti-Brexit petitions.
That was not enough to prevent a narrow 52-48% majority for Leave resulting in a ""hard Brexit"" that took Britain out of the customs union and single market.
But while polls show Remainers still overwhelmingly reject the logic of Brexit, the post-mortem reckoning they expected to happen this year has been drowned out by other events - chiefly the pandemic - and Britain's turbulent domestic politics.
UK exports took a clear hit from the removal of frictionless trade last year but that has been masked by the more dramatic impact of the pandemic.
Even the initial bounce Brexit gave to public support for independence in heavily pro-Remain Scotland has faded as voters there started to question whether splitting from England would really mean a quick re-entry into the EU.
Then there is the fracturing of the Remain front itself, a fragile construct plagued by factionalism. The main opposition Labour Party - which Remainers always accused of offering lukewarm support - now says Brexit must be made to work.
While Bray said he was ""totally miffed by anyone saying make Brexit work"" others simply shrug and say they too have moved on. 
""Labour has accepted Brexit and to be honest, I understand why. It's happened - face reality,"" said Luke Sandford, 26, who in 2016 joined a London anti-Brexit group, attended marches and helped at Remain HQ before leaving for Sweden two years ago.
VOTE REFORM
Indeed, surveys show the collapse in Johnson's ratings owes less to Brexit than to doubts over his trustworthiness and leadership, including allegations his office partied during a 2020 lockdown when festivities were banned.
While some analysts now bet his government cannot last until general elections slated for 2024, many on the Remain side caution against hopes this might trigger a sequence of events that could one day restore ties with Europe.
Naomi Smith, head of the Best for Britain group which this year shifted from being an anti-Brexit campaign to an advocate for ""internationalist values"", said the EU had made clear it would not rush to welcome Britain back.
Moreover, she argued, Johnson's nationalist vision had now secured an electoral advantage as its other backers - notably UKIP and its Brexit Party successor - have shown in the last two elections they will stand down in some seats to ensure victory for the Conservative candidate.
""Meanwhile the left, the progressives, the Remainers, the internationalists – whatever word you want to use to describe the other end of the spectrum - are fragmented across three, four, sometimes more parties,"" she said.
That split is amplified by Britain's first-past-the-post voting system, which in the 2019 election left the pro-EU Liberal Democrats and Greens with just 1.9% of parliament seats despite a combined 14.3% of the popular vote.
Not surprisingly, both the Lib Dems and Greens have long sought electoral reform that would include some version of proportional representation and would want Labour to commit to that before they entered any voting pacts.
While grassroots Labour supporters backed such a move at this year's conference, a motion to that effect failed amid resistance from trade unions and after failing to win clear backing from the party leadership. 
Unless that changes before the next general election, Smith said Best for Britain would, as in 2019, offer supporters seat-level polling data so they can vote tactically for the candidate most likely to defeat the Conservative.
Analysts say whether that has more success this time depends on variables ranging from the timing of the election, the status of the pandemic, the Conservative leadership question and, possibly, the public judgment of Brexit.

Paula Surridge, deputy director at the UK in a Changing Europe think tank, said that while 10-15% of voters on either side of the Brexit divide still saw that as key to their political identity, for others it was now intermingled with traditional left-versus-right or social class considerations.
""The electorate is much more fragmented than in these two Leave-Remain blocs,"" she said. ""It has left a very volatile electorate that we don't quite understand at the moment.""

JAKARTA (Reuters) - A powerful 7.4-magnitude earthquake struck eastern Indonesia on Tuesday triggering a tsunami warning and sending residents fleeing from their homes but causing only minor damage and injuring one person, authorities said.
The tsunami warning was lifted about two hours after the quake struck at 0320 GMT in the Flores Sea, about 112 km (70 miles) northwest of the town of Larantuka, in the eastern part of Flores island.
""Everyone ran out into the street,"" Agustinus Florianus, a resident of Maumere town on Flores, told Reuters. Maumere was badly damaged by a quake of a similar magnitude in 1992.
Tsunami warnings were issued for the areas of Maluku, East Nusa Tenggara, West Nusa Tenggara and Southeast and South Sulawesi. 
The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake, had a magnitude of 7.3. It struck at the shallow depth of 12 km.

""It felt like a wave, up and down,"" Zacharias Gentana Keranz, a resident of Larantuka told Reuters.
The disaster mitigation agency said one person was injured in Manggarai, on Flores, and a school building and several homes were damaged on Selayar island, in South Sulawesi.
The quake, from an active fault in the Flores Sea, was followed by at least 15 aftershocks with the biggest registering magnitude 5.6, the meteorological agency said. 
But the quake caused no significant increase in sea levels.
Indonesian earthquakes have triggered many deadly tsunamis, most notably in 2004 when a 9.1 magnitude quake off Sumatra island in the north produced tsunami waves that killed more than 230,000 people in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand and nine other countries.

The U.S-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had earlier warned that based on preliminary earthquake parameters, hazardous tsunami waves were possible for coasts located within 1,000 km (621.37 miles) of the earthquake's epicentre.
Indonesia straddles the “Pacific Ring of Fire”, an area of high seismic activity that rests atop multiple tectonic plates.

MAYFIELD, Ky. (Reuters) - The barrage of tornadoes that tore through six states killed at least 74 people in Kentucky, officials said on Monday, as those fortunate enough to survive unscathed opened their doors to victims whose homes were destroyed, and hundreds of the suddenly homeless took refuge in shelters.
The death toll was likely to rise as 109 people remained missing, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said.
But no more dead were expected to come from a destroyed candle factory as a company spokesperson said later that a final accounting showed only eight dead. At one time, dozens were feared buried there beneath the rubble.
Some 28,000 Kentucky homes and businesses still lacked power, and 1,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, officials said, after the tornadoes surprised people by striking unusually late in the year during cold weather on Friday.
The dead, including at least six children, ranged in age from 5 months to 86 years old.
""You go from grief to shock to being resolute for a span of 10 minutes and then you go back,"" Beshear said, choking up at times.
Amid the roller coaster of emotions, it has proven difficult for authorities to pin down the exact death toll. Piles of wreckage, interruptions to cell service and the number of people sheltering with friends and relatives have complicated efforts to identify fatalities. 
The final death toll from Mayfield's candle factory will stand at eight, as the remaining 102 workers who were on duty when the tornado struck are alive and have been accounted for, a process that took three days given the chaos brought by the disaster, company spokesperson Bob Ferguson said.
""Tremendous relief,"" Ferguson told Reuters. ""And now there is a real urgency to help those who lost their loved ones.""
While Kentucky bore the brunt of the tornadoes, including one that tore across tore across 227 miles (365 km) of terrain, six people died in an Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) warehouse in Illinois, four were killed in Tennessee and two in Missouri, while a nursing home was struck in Arkansas, causing one of that state's two deaths. 
The U.S workplace safety watchdog is investigating the circumstances around the collapse of the Amazon facility, and the company said it would cooperate.
Across Kentucky, neighbors and volunteers worked to house, feed and offer any other assistance to those whose homes were damaged, destroyed or stripped of electricity.
In the neighboring town of Wingo, about 90 people, from babies to the elderly, are sleeping on green cots that fill a warehouse-like room with low ceilings and a large standing cross at a community center affiliated with a Presbyterian church.
Stephen Jennittie, 52, was staying there with his wife, Christie Bonds, their Chihuahua puppy, Mr. Jingles, and about 90 other Mayfield residents, since the power and heat were knocked out of their home. 
Their survival felt like such a miracle that it renewed his religious faith, Jennittie said, recalling how his house shook amid the rumbling noise. 
""I was talking to God and I told my lady, when we get out of here, we're going to start going to church,"" said Jennittie, a seventh-generation resident of Mayfield who said he may leave a devastated hometown that he no longer recognizes.
""It ain't the Mayfield I grew up in.""
'KIND OF IN DISBELIEF'
Homes across the town had collapsed walls, missing roofs and uprooted trees scattered across lawns.
With so many homeless, the Wingo shelter was short on mattresses on Saturday. But after one phone call, a local furniture store owner brought in more than two dozen mattresses, said Meagan Ralph, 37, a middle-school teacher who found herself appointed the community outreach director when she showed up to volunteer over the weekend.
""Some of them are really shocked and just kind of in disbelief, almost denial. For some, the emotion is unbearable,"" Ralph said.
President Joe Biden will attempt to raise spirits with a planned visit on Wednesday to hard-hit areas including Mayfield, the White House said, after the president declared a major federal disaster in Kentucky on Sunday. 
Late on Monday, the president also declared an emergency in Tennessee and Illinois and approved federal assistance for the two states. 
More than 300 people in Kentucky, as well as in Arkansas and Tennessee, are being housed in Red Cross shelters, and that number is expected to grow. Hundreds more have been placed temporarily in resorts at area state parks, Kentucky Red Cross Chief Executive Steve Cunanan said.
Still others stayed with friends and relatives whose houses were spared. 
David Hargrove, 62, surveyed the rubble that was once his private law office in downtown Mayfield. Amid the debris, a vault that was built into the 23-year-old building stood as the only part to remain upright.

He plans to rebuild.
""You either sit down and cry or you get moving,"" Hargrove said. ""I'm not much one to cry if I can avoid it.""

DENVER (Reuters) - A Colorado judge on Monday reluctantly sentenced a Texas truck driver to 110 years in prison following his conviction for vehicular homicide when his semi-trailer crashed into stopped traffic and killed four motorists along a mountain interstate.
Rogel Lazaro Aguilera-Mederos, 26, was found guilty in October by a jury in Jefferson County, Colorado, of four homicide charges along with multiple counts of assault and reckless driving stemming from the April 2019 fiery crash.
Jefferson County District Judge Bruce Jones said Colorado law required he impose the mandatory minimum sentences to all the counts Aguilera-Mederos was convicted of, but that he had ""no desire"" to send him to prison for life.
""If I had the discretion, it would not be my sentence,"" Jones said.
Prosecutors argued at trial that Aguilera-Mederos knew his brakes were failing but drove past at least one runaway truck ramp as he descended the mountains along Interstate 70 west of Denver.
He then recklessly weaved in and out of traffic before his trailer, which was hauling lumber, crashed into stopped traffic and burst into flames, triggering a 28-vehicle pile-up that killed four people and injured six, prosecutors said.
Aguilera-Mederos told investigators his brakes failed and he tried to avoid hitting other vehicles after losing control.
At Monday's hearing, Megan Harrison, the daughter of one of the people killed, Doyle Harrison, told the judge ""my dad was taken away from me.""
""A huge person in my life never came home,"" she said.
When he addressed the court, Aguilera-Mederos wept as he begged the victims' families for forgiveness and asked the judge for leniency.
""I am not a criminal,"" he said. ""I never thought about hurting anyone in my entire life.""

PETERSON SPACE FORCE BASE, Colo. (Reuters) - The United States is testing satellite resiliency to threats from China and Russia miles above the earth's surface, just weeks after Russia shot down an aging communications satellite. 
The computer-aided simulations included potential shooting down of U.S. missile-tracking satellites, satellite jamming, and other electronic warfare ""effects"" that are possible tactics in space warfare. Actual satellites are not used.
During a visit to Schriever Space Force Base in Colorado, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks saw the 'Space Flag' simulated space training exercise hosted by U.S. forces. It was the 13th such exercise, and the third to involve partners such as Britain, Canada and Australia.
""It happens in rooms like that ... people at a relatively junior level in many cases. Collaborating and thinking through challenges and trying to figure out concepts that seem to make sense and discarding ideas that go astray,"" Hicks told reporters en route to Hawaii. 
Pentagon leaders are touring U.S. bases this week while the Biden administration's draft 2023 budget takes shape. The Department of Defense hopes to move budget dollars toward a military that can deter China and Russia. 
After Russia successfully conducted an anti-satellite missile test last month, U.S. officials believe there is an increasing need to make the U.S. satellite network resilient to attack and to use opportunities like 'Space Flag' to train.
Satellites are vital to military communications, global positioning navigation, and timing systems that are needed in the event of war. 
The 10-day-long space war game attempts to simulate the cutting edge of the U.S. capability in space. The training exercise involved an adversarial group working to simulate an aggressor nation with space capabilities like Russia or China. 

Russia is not the first country to conduct anti-satellite tests in space. The United States performed the first in 1959, when satellites were rare and new.
In Hawaii, Hicks will meet with Pacific military commanders and visit Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam where she will hear about water contamination issues.

MAYFIELD, Ky. (Reuters) - Neighbors across Kentucky offered shelter to friends who lost their homes to deadly tornadoes, strangers showed up with chain saws to clear downed trees and restaurants handed out gift cards for hot meals to those without water or power.
As the state dug out from a devastating string of twisters that killed at least 74 people and destroyed or damaged 1,000 homes, the acts of kindness arrived on Monday in ways both big and small.
Many people rushed to the aid of hard-hit Mayfield, a working-class farming and manufacturing community of 10,000 people in western Kentucky where residents said everybody knows one another and families often stay for generations. 
Terra Utley's co-workers from SRM Concrete sprang into action after the tornadoes destroyed her home there. On Sunday, they delivered firewood and a big pot of beef stew to Utley, a concrete truck driver at the company since June. 
On Monday, nine co-workers helped her sift through the debris to save what was left of her possessions. They lifted Christmas gifts and family mementos from beneath the collapsed roof and walls, and pried open the doors to her car that was partially buried under her house.
“For them to be out here, taking time out of their day to come help me, it means the world to me,"" Utley, 32, said over the whir of a chain saw.
Ricky Murphy, 41, said he barely recognized his hometown when he arrived from Louisville, Kentucky, immediately after the storm to check on his mother and siblings and pitch in on cleanup efforts.
The city's water tower, long part of its flat landscape, had been leveled. Many of the historic buildings of its small downtown, some dating back to the 19th century, were reduced to piles of bricks.
By Monday, Murphy was helping hand out clothes, food and supplies outside Fairview Baptist Church, the Black church he grew up attending, where a makeshift donation center had sprung up.
""People are giving shoes, people give the clothes that they have, people give the money that they have, the resources, the homes or whatever,” he said of the generosity he had witnessed.
DONATIONS POUR IN
Similar scenes played out across Kentucky, where officials said it could take a week or longer to tally the toll of death and destruction from the tornadoes that tore through the state and several others late on Friday. 
Governor Andy Beshear's plea for volunteers to help wash dishes and clothes for displaced residents living at state park resorts prompted a flood of calls from around the country, said Andy Kasitz, assistant director of resort parks for Kentucky State Parks.
About 30,000 donations totaling more than $4 million have poured into a state tornado relief fund. The governor said the first tranche of money would be used to help cover funeral costs, adding each family would receive $5,000 and the state would ask funeral homes to cap the cost at that amount. 
In Bowling Green, about 135 miles (217 km) east of Mayfield, restaurants had collected more than $50,000 in gift cards for free meals for tornado victims by Monday afternoon, said Josh Poling, owner of the Hickory & Oak steakhouse.
Lawyer Katina Miner, 40, said four black walnut and maple trees that toppled during the storms crushed half of her house near downtown Bowling Green.
After staying with friends for two nights, she arrived at her house on Monday to find about 15 people, some with chain saws and others toting fallen limbs, clearing her family's property.
""Some neighbors, some from church and others we don't even know,"" Miner said. ""We are truly blessed through all this. Things can be replaced. We are safe.""
Back in Mayfield, Tammie Bugg, 59, stood on a busy street corner on Monday with members of her church, First Baptist, pouring cups of coffee and bringing them to the window of every car and emergency vehicle that drove by.

Many of the recipients were exhausted emergency responders who had worked all weekend. The coffee was a small gesture that made them smile.
“And that’s what we need,"" Bugg said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) said Monday that security personnel had confiscated more than 5,700 firearms at airport security checkpoints in 2021, the highest ever in a single year.
TSA Administrator David Pekoske told reporters at a briefing the prior yearly record was about 4,400 in 2019 and the current rate of gun detections in carry-on luggage at checkpoints per million passengers is twice the prior high.
He said he thinks the increase reflects an increase in firearms being carried by Americans. 
Airline passengers can transport an unloaded firearm on an airplane but only in checked baggage.
""It's a pretty costly mistake to make,"" Pekoske said, saying TSA will ""always proceed with a civil penalty action that will cost thousands of dollars after we complete an investigation."" TSA also refers the issue to law enforcement if it is a violation of local or state laws.
In November, an accidental shooting at a security checkpoint at Atlanta International Airport prompted chaos.
A TSA officer saw a gun during screening and the passenger lunged into the bag and grabbed it, at which point it discharged, the agency said. The incident briefly prompted a halt to air traffic while Atlanta Police investigated. 
Separately, TSA said it is not clear when a federal mandate requiring masks in transit may end.

Earlier this month, TSA extended the federal mask mandate on airplanes, trains, airports and other transit modes through March 18.
Pekoske said the agency relies on what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends on the mask mandate, saying it's ""very, very hard to predict when the mask mandate will end."" The mask mandate has been in place since February.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Victims of Larry Nassar, the former doctor for the U.S. women's gymnastics team, reached a $380 million settlement on Monday with the USA Gymnastics governing body, U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee and their insurers after a five-year legal battle.
The settlement will cover claims brought among others by Olympic gold medalists Simone Biles, Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney, who were among Nassar's most high-profile sexual abuse victims. According to court filings, more than 500 victims have sought compensation.
""USA Gymnastics is deeply sorry for the trauma and pain that Survivors have endured as a result of this organization's actions and inactions,"" USAG President and CEO Li Li Leung said in a statement.
As part of the settlement, USA Gymnastics (USAG) and the Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) also agreed to designate some of their board seats to survivors and to implement other new policies aimed at protecting athletes from future abuse. To get those reforms in place, the Olympic Committee committed to allocating $5 million, a lawyer for some of the plaintiffs said.
""This settlement is about the brave survivors who came forward, forced these organizations to listen, and demanded change,"" Michelle Simpson Tuegel, who represents more than two dozen Nassar survivors, said in a joint statement with Tasha Schwikert Moser, co-chair of the Survivors Creditors Committee.
""Through this agreement, these survivors are finally being acknowledged and USAG and USOPC are being forced to change so that this sport can begin a new chapter,"" they said.
Biles, Raisman and Maroney testified about the abuse during a Senate hearing in September at which they blasted USA Gymnastics and Olympic officials for failing to stop Nassar. They also took the FBI to task over its botched investigation into Nassar's actions. 
The Justice Department in October launched a fresh inquiry into the FBI's handling of the Nassar investigation after previously declining to prosecute the agents involved.
Nassar, the main doctor for Olympic gymnasts for 18 years, was sentenced in federal court in 2017 to 60 years in prison on charges of possessing child sex abuse material. The following year, Nassar was sentenced to up to 175 years and up to 125 years, respectively, in two separate Michigan courts for molesting female gymnasts under his care.
The settlement announced on Monday was reached after TIG Insurance agreed to pay a large portion of the money, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier.

USA Gymnastics voluntarily filed for bankruptcy in 2018 after Olympic bronze medalist Jamie Dantzscher filed a lawsuit and additional claims were filed on behalf of a growing number of Nassar's victims.
The terms of Monday's settlement deal, which were confirmed after a U.S. bankruptcy court hearing in Indiana, will also enable USA Gymnastics to exit bankruptcy.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected challenges brought by a group of Christian doctors and nurses and an organization that promotes vaccine skepticism to New York's refusal to allow religious exemptions to the state's mandate that healthcare workers be vaccinated against COVID-19.
Acting in two cases, the justices denied emergency requests for an injunction requiring the state to permit religious exemptions while litigation over the mandate's legality continues in lower courts. Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch said they would have granted the injunction.
The Supreme Court previously rejected other challenges to vaccine mandates including one focusing upon Maine's lack of a religious exemption for healthcare workers.
The New York challengers said the mandate violates the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment prohibition on religious discrimination by the government, or a federal civil rights law requiring employers to reasonably accommodate employees' religious beliefs. A lower court rejected their bid for an injunction. 
New York's Department of Health on Aug. 26 ordered healthcare professionals who come in contact with patients or other employees to be vaccinated by Sept. 27. That deadline was delayed to Nov. 22. 
The state has said that under the policy employers can consider religious accommodation requests and employees can be reassigned to jobs such as remote work.
The state said it allows a narrow medical exemption for the small number of people with a serious allergic reaction to the COVID-19 vaccines. It said longstanding healthcare worker vaccine mandates for measles and rubella also have no religious exemptions. 
One lawsuit was brought by a group of 17 doctors, nurses and other healthcare providers, most of whom are Catholic, who sued under pseudonyms, denouncing ""medical dictatorship."" Sixteen said they were fired or suspended under the policy, while one nurse agreed to be vaccinated to keep her job. 
In a dissent in that case, Gorsuch said the mandate seemed based ""on nothing more than fear and anger at those who harbor unpopular religious beliefs."" Joined by Alito, Gorsuch chastised the court for not protecting the challengers, saying that it ""is always the failure to defend the Constitution's promises that leads to this court's greatest regrets.""
The other case involved a challenge by three Christian nurses, who are members of We the Patriots USA, a Connecticut-based group that is also a plaintiff. The group opposes vaccine mandates and advocates for various causes including what it called ""medical freedom.""
In a video on the group's website, co-founder Brian Festa said, ""We were fighting against vaccine mandates. We were fighting to reveal the truth about what's in these shots, long before COVID was even a thing."" 
These plaintiffs are represented by Norman Pattis, a lawyer known for defending conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, founder of the right-wing website Infowars, against defamation lawsuits after he falsely called a 2012 Connecticut school mass shooting a ""hoax.""
According to government data, about 84% of U.S. adults have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and 72% are fully vaccinated. A minority of Americans has declined to get the shots.
In legal filings, the New York challengers said that they believe abortion is ""evil"" and object to any COVID-19 vaccine whose development relied on cell lines from aborted fetuses. 

The three COVID-19 vaccines authorized for U.S. use do not contain aborted fetal cells. Laboratory-grown cells that descended from the cells of an aborted fetus obtained decades ago were employed in testing during the vaccine development process. Drug efficacy and safety testing using such cell lines is routine. 
The Vatican issued guidance to Roman Catholics last year that it is morally acceptable to use COVID-19 vaccines.

An earlier investigation by the Air Force inspector general said the Aug. 29 strike was caused by execution errors, interpreting information that supported certain viewpoints, and communication breakdowns. The military previously called the strike a ""tragic mistake.""
Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) told reporters that senior commanders had made a number of recommendations to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin about the incident, none of which included any accountability measures for specific personnel. 
Austin accepted the recommendations, Kirby said. 
""I do not anticipate there being issues of personal accountability to be had,"" he added. 
Kirby noted the high level of the threat facing U.S. forces following a deadly bombing outside the Kabul airport that killed 13 troops, context that he said was important.

""In this case, in the context of this particular strike ... there was not a strong enough case to be made for personal accountability.""
While the Pentagon has said it is working to offer condolence payments and relocation to the family of Afghans killed in the strike, it is still in talks with an aid organization that employed one of the victims.

STOCKHOLM/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) -One of two Danish crew members missing from a capsized barge has been found dead in the hull after an overnight collision on Monday with a British cargo vessel in a busy Baltic Sea route off Sweden.
The 55-metre Karin Hoj barge and 90-metre Scot Carrier were sailing in the same direction off the island of Bornholm when they crashed in fog and darkness at 3.30 a.m. (0230 GMT), maritime agencies in Denmark and Sweden said.
At least nine boats and a helicopter combed waters near the wreckage-strewn site, while the overturned Karin Hoj was towed away to shallower waters so Swedish divers could investigate the hull without risk of being dragged down.
It is impossible to survive for long without protective gear in the sea temperatures of around 4 Celsius, but there had been hope the pair might be alive inside an air pocket within the hull.
However, the Swedish Maritime Administration (SMA) and police said one person was found dead on the boat, while the other was still missing.
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION
Though there was fog at the time of the accident, the Danish Meteorological Institute said it was not dense and conditions were not unusual for the time of year.
The Swedish Prosecution Authority said in a statement a preliminary investigation was underway into several suspected crimes: gross negligence in maritime traffic, causing death through negligence, and marine intoxication.
It said two suspects, one British and one Croatian, had been take into custody and it could provide no further details due to the preliminary nature of the probe. 
With events seeming to have unfolded fast, the Danish Defence's Joint Operations Centre (JOC) said there was no sign lifeboats or other emergency equipment were used by the Karin Hoj's two-person crew. 
""I can confirm an accident has happened but I do not know the circumstances,"" Soren Hoj, managing director of Rederiet Hoj which owns the Karin Hoj, told Reuters.
The barge was sailing from Sodertalje in Sweden to Nykobing Falster in southern Denmark, while the Scot Carrier was sailing to Montrose on Scotland's east coast.
The British ship's owner Scotline said it could not comment on details but was assisting local authorities.

The SMA said the Danish vessel was empty of cargo and it was unclear what if anything the British ship was carrying. 
The waters between Sweden and Denmark see large amounts of maritime traffic. Collisions are rare though in 2006 a small Danish vessel sank after a crash with a Swedish boat, with all the crew rescued alive after bailing overboard.

Israel's ambassador to Abu Dhabi, speaking ahead of the meeting, said the issue of Iran would ""certainly come up"". The meeting follows the formalisation of Israel-UAE relations last year under a U.S.-led regional initiative.
While shared concern about Iranian activity was among reasons for the diplomatic moves, the UAE has also been trying to improve relations with Tehran.
Releasing photographs of Bennett and Sheikh Mohammed smiling and shaking hands, the Israeli leader's office described the meeting as ""historic"".
Before he flew home later in the day, Bennett's office said in a statement that Sheikh Mohammed had accepted an invitation to visit Israel. There was no immediate confirmation from UAE officials.
A statement on state news agency WAM said Sheikh Mohammed voiced hope for ""stability in the Middle East"" and that Bennett's visit would ""advance the relationship of cooperation towards more positive steps in the interests of the people of the two nations and of the region"".
The Palestinians, whose diplomacy with Israel has been stalled since 2014, have deplored the Israeli-Emirati rapprochement.
Israeli Ambassador Amir Hayek declined to elaborate on any discussion of Iran but he told Israel's Army Radio: ""The prime minister did not only come here solely to address the Iranian issue.""
With world powers now trying to renew the Iran nuclear deal, Abu Dhabi last week sent an envoy to Tehran. A U.S. delegation is due in the UAE this week to warn Emirati banks against non-compliance with sanctions on Iran.
Iran is Israel's arch-foe, but it has not been mentioned publicly by Bennett since he set off on Sunday to the UAE with pledges to promote bilateral commerce and other forms of civilian cooperation.
Iran's Foreign Ministry said the visit was ""disruptive to the region's security and (going) against the interests of the Islamic nation and the people of the region and Arab countries"".
The Israel Hayom newspaper, quoting unidentified officials, said Bennett was expected to brief Sheikh Mohammed on intelligence regarding Iranian-supplied militias and drones in the region.
Israel last month broached setting up joint defences against Iran with Gulf Arab states. Defence sales to the UAE are in the works, though Israeli industry sources say advanced anti-missile systems have yet to be offered.
""Israel is in cooperation with a new friend, with a partner for the long-term, and the considerations will be both considerations of defence and also considerations of how you work with a country which is very, very, very friendly to Israel,"" said Hayek, the ambassador.

Bennett said he told his government to step up efforts to reach a free trade agreement with the UAE by the first quarter of 2022.
Israel-UAE bilateral trade in goods alone reached nearly $500 million so far in 2021 - up from $125 million in 2020 - and is expected to continue growing rapidly.

(Reuters) -Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was expected to plead guilty in a civil rights case tied to the death of George Floyd at a U.S. District Court hearing in Minnesota set for Wednesday.
The federal court on Monday set the change-of-plea hearing, an indication Chauvin would change his plea to guilty.
Chauvin, along with three other former Minneapolis police officers, pleaded not guilty in September to the federal charges that they violated Floyd's civil rights during the deadly arrest on May 25, 2020. 
Chauvin's lawyer Eric Nelson was not immediately available for comment. 
In state court in June, Chauvin, who is white, was sentenced to 22-1/2 years in prison for the murder of Floyd, a Black man on whose neck Chauvin knelt for nearly nine minutes while a bystander captured it on her cellphone.

The verdict was widely seen as a landmark rebuke of the disproportionate use of police force against Black Americans.
Chauvin was charged separately in federal court with depriving Floyd of his rights by failing to provide him with medical attention. Chauvin also is federally charged with violating Floyd's right to be free from unreasonable seizure and unreasonable force by a police officer.

The United States has directly assisted 479 American citizens and 450 lawful permanent residents, in addition to their immediate families, depart Afghanistan and relocate to the United States since the end of August, the State Department said in a statement.
The agency is in touch with fewer than a dozen U.S. citizens who want to leave the country, are prepared to depart and have the necessary travel documents, according to the statement.

""There is no deadline for this work,"" the department said.
The United States' two decade-long occupation of Afghanistan culminated in a hastily organized airlift in August in which more than 124,000 civilians - including Americans, Afghans and others - evacuated as the Taliban took over. But thousands of other U.S.-allied Afghans at risk of Taliban persecution were left behind.

The American forces landed in the town of Busayra, east of Deir al-Zor, and ""kidnapped a number of civilians"", it said.
There was no independent confirmation of the report.
In Washington, the Pentagon said U.S-led coalition forces had carried out an operation with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in Busayra that killed four Islamic State fighters, including one wearing a suicide vest, but there had been no detentions. 
It added that there was a separate unilateral operation by the SDF but did not say whether anyone was detained by them. 
The province of Deir al-Zor, along the Iraqi border, is a strategic supply route for Iranian-backed militias who regularly send reinforcements into Syria to support President Bashar al-Assad against insurgents seeking to topple his family rule.
U.S. forces are deployed at a base in the al-Tanf region, south of Deir al-Zor, as part of a combat mission against Islamic State militants who continue to wage a low-level insurgency in Iraq and Syria.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia said on Monday it may be forced to deploy intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe in response to what it sees as NATO's plans to do the same.
The warning from Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov raised the risk of a new arms build-up on the continent, with East-West tensions at their worst since the Cold War ended three decades ago.
Ryabkov said Russia would be forced to act if the West declined to join it in a moratorium on intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) in Europe - part of a package of security guarantees it is seeking as the price for defusing the crisis over Ukraine.
Lack of progress towards a political and diplomatic solution would lead Russia to respond in a military way, with military technology, Ryabkov told Russia's RIA news agency.
""That is, it will be a confrontation, this will be the next round,"" he said, referring to the potential deployment of the missiles by Russia.
Intermediate-range nuclear weapons - those with a range of 500 to 5,500 km (310 to 3,400 miles) - were banned in Europe under a 1987 treaty between then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and U.S. President Ronald Reagan in what was hailed at the time as a major easing of Cold War tensions. By 1991, the two sides had destroyed nearly 2,700 of them.
Washington withdrew from the pact in 2019 after complaining for years of alleged violations revolving around Russia's development of a ground-launched cruise missile that Moscow calls the 9M729 and NATO refers to as the ""Screwdriver"".
If NATO is right that Russia has already deployed this system in the European part of the country, west of the Ural Mountains, then Ryabkov's threat is an empty one, according to Gerhard Mangott, an expert on Russian foreign policy and arms control at the University of Innsbruck in Austria.
But if Russia's denials are true, he said, then Moscow's warning is ""the final signal to NATO that it should enter into talks with Russia about a freeze-freeze agreement.""
He added: ""If NATO sticks with the position not to negotiate about a deal, then we will certainly see Russia deploy the Screwdriver missile at its very western border.""
POINT MAN
Ryabkov has emerged in recent days as one of Moscow's key messengers as President Vladimir Putin presses for Western security guarantees while facing warnings from the United States and its allies to back away from a possible invasion of Ukraine - something the minister again denied was Russia's intention.
He repeated a comparison he made last week between the current tensions and the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, which brought the United States and Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear war.
Ryabkov said there were ""indirect indications"" that NATO was moving closer to re-deploying intermediate-range missiles, including its restoration last month of the 56th Artillery Command which operated nuclear-capable Pershing missiles during the Cold War.
NATO says there will be no new U.S. missiles in Europe and it is ready to deter new Russian missiles with a ""measured"" response that would only involve conventional weapons.

But Ryabkov said Russia had a ""complete lack of trust"" in the alliance.
""They don't permit themselves to do anything that could somehow increase our security - they believe they can act as they need, to their advantage, and we simply have to swallow all this and deal with it. This is not going to continue.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union foreign ministers agreed on Monday that any Russia aggression against Ukraine would trigger economic sanctions on Moscow, trying to keep up the pressure after similar statements by NATO and the Group of Seven nations.
""The European Union stands united in support of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told a news conference after the meeting.
""The ministers, all of them, have been very clear today that any aggression against Ukraine will come with political consequences and with a high economic cost for Russia."" 
The EU and the United States imposed economic sanctions on Russia in July 2014, targeting its energy, banking and defence sectors, and is considering further measures if Russia tries to invade Ukraine after a troop buildup on its borders.
Borrell, who chaired the meeting, earlier said: ""We are studying together with the U.S. and the UK what (sanctions )could be, when and how, in a coordinated manner."" 
Western leaders fear an attack on Ukraine by Russia, which annexed Crimea in 2014 and backs separatists who control parts of eastern Ukraine and are fighting Ukrainian government forces.
Russia says it has no intention to invade Ukraine and accuses Kyiv of deploying half its army to confront the separatists.
""We are convinced that Russia is actually preparing for all-out war against Ukraine. It's an unprecedented event probably since the Second World War,"" Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said. 
""If it's an unprecedented attack ... that means that the answer has to be unprecedented from the Western countries as well.""
EU diplomats told Reuters discussions were focused on a potential gradual increase of any sanctions, ranging from possible travel bans and asset freezes on Russian politicians to banning financial and banking links with Russia.
Sanctioning the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany to prevent it becoming operational was also an option, as well as targeting more Russian state-owned defence and energy companies or cancelling natural gas contracts.

Envoys said such steps were likely to be considered only if the Russian military attempted a full invasion of Ukraine. 
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has warned Russia that the Western military alliance is standing by Ukraine. Foreign ministers of the Group of Seven rich democracies warned Russia on Sunday of ""massive consequences"" if it attacks Ukraine.

(Reuters) - More than half a billion people globally were pushed or sent further into extreme poverty last year as they paid for health costs out of their own pockets, with the COVID-19 pandemic expected to make things worse, the World Health Organization and the World Bank said on Sunday.
The pandemic disrupted health services globally and triggered the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it even more difficult for people to pay for healthcare, according to a joint statement from both the organizations.
""All governments must immediately resume and accelerate efforts to ensure every one of their citizens can access health services without fear of the financial consequences,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
Tedros urged governments to increase their focus on health care systems and stay on course towards universal health coverage, which the WHO defines as everyone getting access to health services they need without financial hardship.
Healthcare is a major political issue in the United States, one of the few industrialised countries that does not have universal cover for its citizens.

Globally, the pandemic made things worse and immunisation coverage dropped for the first time in ten years, with deaths from tuberculosis and malaria increasing.
""Within a constrained fiscal space, governments will have to make tough choices to protect and increase health budgets,"" Juan Pablo Uribe, global director for health, nutrition and population at World Bank, said.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken made a strong commitment to Indonesia on Monday, a senior official said, as he kicked off a Southeast Asia trip aimed at strengthening ties with a region that has become a strategic arena for Washington and Beijing. 
In his first trip to the region since U.S. President Joe Biden took office in January, Blinken met with Indonesian President Joko Widodo, the first of several top officials he will see on a four-day tour that includes Malaysia and Thailand. 
Summarising the meeting with Jokowi, as the president is known, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said Blinken showed a keen interest in partnering with their country, especially in infrastructure. 
""The U.S. commitment was very noticeable,"" Retno told reporters. 
Southeast Asia is a key stage for a rivalry between the United States and China, with a heated struggle for influence as the Biden administration seeks to reconnect with a region to which U.S. commitment was questioned under President Donald Trump.
Blinken congratulated Jokowi on Indonesia's G20 presidency and expressed support for its Indo-Pacific leadership role, as a ""strong proponent of the rules-based international order,"" State Department spokesperson Ned Price said, adding human rights, the pandemic and the climate crisis were also discussed. 
Indonesia is Southeast Asia's biggest economy and its most populous nation. It is the third-largest democracy in the world, and also home to a third of its rainforests. 
Blinken will deliver a speech on U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy on Tuesday in the capital Jakarta, among other events, before meetings in Malaysia and Thailand on Wednesday and Thursday respectively. 
Blinken will pursue Biden's aim of elevating engagement with the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) bloc and discuss the president's vision for an Indo-Pacific economic framework, a top U.S. diplomat for Asia said ahead of the trip. 
The United States has also been pushing back against Beijing's assertiveness in the South China Sea, a conduit for $3 trillion of annual trade, and accuses its vast coastguard fleet of bullying countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia by disrupting energy and fishing activities. 
China claims almost the entire sea as its own, and has rejected U.S. actions as interference by an outside power. 

The Biden administration sees closer engagement in Southeast Asia as vital to its efforts to push back against China's growing power, but Trump's withdrawal from a regional trade deal in 2017 has limited its ability to exert economic influence, while Beijing has sought to bolster its trade ties.
The administration has yet to spell out what exactly Biden's envisaged economic framework will entail.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Lithuania's foreign minister said on Monday he would not attend the 2022 Olympic Games in China as France and the Netherlands sought a common position on a European Union response to highlight Chinese human rights abuses.
The bloc is torn over whether to join the United States, Canada, Australia and Britain in deciding not to send their government officials to the Beijing Winter Games in February, fearful of Chinese retaliation that would hurt trade.
""I'm not going,"" Lithuania's Gabrielius Landsbergis told reporters, ahead of discussions among EU foreign ministers. 
Lithuania, which says it is facing a Chinese trade blockade for developing closer ties with Taiwan, is among the strongest proponents of a common stand. I'm for a European approach but sometimes it is difficult to achieve,"" he said. 
Luxembourg's Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said any EU position would not be reached quickly.
""You know as well as I do that we will not find a solution regarding the Olympic Games today or this week,"" he said.
EU leaders are also set to debate the issue on Thursday. Paris and The Hague put it on the agenda, diplomats said.
EU diplomats say Hungary, China's closest ally in the bloc, would never support a diplomatic boycott but there could be a consensus among the remaining 26 members. 
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said last week Paris should take a common stand with other European Union capitals and his new German counterpart Annalena Baerbock has supported that view. However, reflecting the ambiguity of European China policy, France's education minister said on Dec. 9 that France would not take part in any boycott.
Austria's Alexander Schallenberg said he was ""very much in favour of a joint EU position"" but appeared to move away from any diplomatic boycott.
""We have a clear position on the human rights situation in China but I don't think it is useful to let the Olympic Games artificially become a political event,"" he said.
The hesitation reflects the EU's bid to find a middle path between U.S.-Chinese rivalry. The bloc is divided over China, with Hungary benefiting from its largesse. China is also the EU's second-largest trade partner and many large German businesses are loathe to see investments put at risk. 
However, the EU joined the United States and Britain in imposing human rights sanctions on Chinese officials in April, jeopardising a new EU-China investment pact after Beijing retaliated with sanctions of its own.

Luxembourg's Asselborn called for European politicians to speak out instead on human rights issues in China.
""I think if we speak up there on the ground, this brings more benefit than if we politicians go into hiding,"" he said.

MAYFIELD, Ky. (Reuters) - Until the power went out on Friday night, Rick Foley was closely tracking the storm system with the help of radar and television news. But when his house in Mayfield, Kentucky, went dark, all he could do was sit tight and wait. Finally he heard the roar.
""My ears popped, and debris started coming through the doorway and I just dropped down on my knees, covered my head, and it was gone in 30 seconds,” the 70-year-old retired boat carpenter said of the moment one of the most powerful tornados in Kentucky history slammed into his home. 
In what felt like less than a minute, the facade of the house was completely gone, leaving his living room fireplace exposed and surrounded by a field of rubble.
Stunned and having nowhere else to go, Foley stumbled to his bedroom. There he was shocked to see a framed oil painting of his late wife, Mary Ellen, lying on the ground nearly untouched, illustrating the randomness of the destruction. She died 38 years ago in childbirth, Foley said, tearing up.
He spent the rest of the night lying awake in his bedroom, its wall blown out, fully exposing the room to the street. But the roof overhead was hanging on, protecting him from the rain. 
“I kept hearing noises in the debris, hoping it was my cats,"" he said. But the cats have not returned home.
Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said dozens of people in his state were dead from the tornadoes that tore through the U.S. Midwest and South on Friday night, killing people in at least five states.
As with Foley, many residents of Mayfield were notified about the approach of the deadly weather system by television news. But many of those who survived said they were still powerless to defend themselves against its sheer force as it ripped through their little community on Friday evening. 
NBC affiliate WPSD-TV in Paducah, Kentucky, about 25 miles (40 km) north, pre-empted regular programming starting at 7:30 p.m. with meteorologists on the air live for the next five hours issuing tightly targeted alerts as the storm closed in. The warnings also went on social media and to the cellphones of the station's app users.
""I can't tell you the number of people and emails I received that parroted: 'You saved lives tonight,'"" station manager Bill Evans told Reuters by telephone.
The National Weather Service's Paducah office also issued a series of escalating social media alerts. A 9:03 p.m. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) post warned that tornadoes could hit Mayfield by 9:30. At 9:27 p.m., it said: ""TORNADO EMERGENCY FOR MAYFIELD. A VIOLENT TORNADO IS MOVING INTO THE CITY OF MAYFIELD. TAKE SHELTER NOW!""
PANIC ATTACK
Despite the warnings, many residents had nowhere to hide from the twister's killer force.
Laurie Lopez, 53, got an alert on her phone at 9:06 p.m. that said to take cover from the incoming tornado. She, her 19-year-old daughter and their two huskies took cover in the hallway between their kitchen and her bedroom. 
“We got down in the hallway and it wasn’t 20 minutes before our whole house started shaking. She was screaming, she went into a panic attack,” Lopez said of her daughter.
“We heard the rumbling and the whole house started shaking,"" she said.
On Sunday, the front of Lopez's two-story house appeared totally collapsed and part of the roof had fallen onto the front lawn. Lopez's car was buried somewhere under the mound of debris in front of where the house once stood.
When Timothy McDill got word that the storm was near, he fled to the basement with his family. Once downstairs, he tethered himself, his wife, two grandchildren, a pair of Chihuahuas and a cat to a drainpipe using a flagpole rope. Then they waited. 
""They were troopers. They didn't cry that much,"" McDill said of his grandchildren, 12 and 14. ""Me and my missus were doing all the crying. We were scared we were going to lose the kids, and they don't think of that.""
Marty Janes, 59, and his wife, Theresa, 69, were heading to bed on Friday night when he went to the bathroom.
“I just stepped out of the bathroom to go back to the bedroom and the roof came in, walls came in, there was glass flying everywhere.” 
Janes ducked under his dining room table and was “bleeding all over,” he said. He and his wife were shouting to each other from across the house but they could not reach each other.
Paramedics arrived and took Janes to the hospital. His wife was uninjured.
On Sunday, Janes was sitting next to his dilapidated house as volunteers removed his belongings to prepare the house for demolition. The roof and walls were gone. 

Inside the doorway of what used to be the dining room were handprints in dried blood from where Janes had tried to get back to the bedroom to reach his wife that night. 
“I don’t even want to stand out there and watch it,” he said. “I don’t wish this on anyone.”

BOGOTA ( Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Foundation) - A record number of U.S. states have sought to restrict access to abortion this year, but countries including Argentina, Mexico and Thailand have moved in the opposite direction - easing their strict laws on the procedure.
In the United States, 106 abortion restrictions were enacted across 19 states in 2021, according to reproductive health research organization the Guttmacher Institute.
The restrictive measures in mostly Republican-led states have included mandatory counseling, having to wait 24 hours before a second clinic visit, and reducing the number of weeks during which women can terminate a pregnancy.
Abortion rights in the United States are under attack unlike any time since the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling made abortion a legal and constitutional right nationwide, campaigners say.
""(This) was the worst legislative year for U.S. abortion rights since Roe v. Wade,"" said Elizabeth Nash, principal policy associate of state issues at the Guttmacher Institute.
""But this situation did not just suddenly appear - it's been years in the making as part of a coordinated campaign to ban abortion outright,"" Nash said. 
The U.S. Supreme Court - which has a 6-3 conservative majority - heard oral arguments in two separate major cases this year that could uphold restrictions on abortion rights.
The cases involve the states of Mississippi and Texas - where a near-total abortion ban came into effect in September that bans terminations after around the first six weeks of pregnancy.
Across the globe, numerous countries have revised their abortion laws in 2021, and several have also clamped down.
In Poland, a near total ban on abortion has been in effect since January, sparking nationwide protests.
The country's Constitutional Court said in October 2020 that terminating pregnancies due to fetal defects should be banned, ending the most common of the few legal grounds for abortion.
ATTITUDES SHIFT
In Latin America, some nations have liberalized access as women's rights movements demand change and attitudes shift.
But conservative resistance persists in the largely Roman Catholic region, and initiatives to ease access to terminations stalled in Chile and Colombia.
Chilean lawmakers rejected a bill in November that sought to expand legal access for women to get abortions, while Colombia's Constitutional Court suspended a case that would have considered whether to fully decriminalize the procedure.
As in much of the region, abortion in Colombia is only allowed if a woman's life is in danger, a fetus is unviable or when a pregnancy has resulted from rape or incest, but such restrictions are facing mounting challenges.
In El Salvador, where abortion has been totally banned since 1998, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled in November that the Central American nation had violated the rights of a woman imprisoned for an abortion crime.
The woman, known as Manuela, died in prison while serving a 30-year sentence after being convicted of having an illegal abortion and charged with aggravated homicide.
The top regional rights court ruled that Manuela had a miscarriage after suffering an ""obstetric emergency"" and ordered El Salvador to reform its stringent abortion laws.
Elsewhere in Latin America, 2021 saw major shifts towards liberalizing access to the procedure.
In Mexico, the world's second-biggest Catholic country, the Supreme Court ruled in September that penalizing abortion is unconstitutional, meaning courts can no longer prosecute abortion cases.
Supreme Court President Arturo Zaldivar hailed the ruling as ""a watershed moment"" for all women, especially the most vulnerable.
That followed Argentina's landmark decision to legalize abortion in late December 2020 to allow it through the 14th week of pregnancy, which came into effect earlier this year.
In Honduras, which has a blanket ban on terminations, abortion rights groups hope November's election of Xiomara Castro as the country's first woman president will bring change.
Castro has said she backs legalizing abortion in the case of rape, risk to the mother's life, and fetal deformity.
Thai lawmakers voted in January in favor of allowing abortion up to 12 weeks of pregnancy while retaining penalties for later terminations. 
Weeks later, the Constitutional Court ruled that existing laws criminalizing abortion were unconstitutional.

With the U.S. Supreme Court expected to rule on major next abortion cases next year, abortion rights campaigners say more must be done to ensure all women, especially the young and those from low-income segments, can access the procedure.
""Whether or not Roe is undermined by this Supreme Court, longer-term solutions are urgently needed to ensure that a person's income and ZIP code is never the determining factor in their ability to get an abortion,"" Nash said.

(Reuters) - Two weeks of emotional, explicit testimony at Ghislaine Maxwell's sex abuse trial from four women who said the British socialite groomed them as teenagers for deceased financier Jeffrey Epstein could largely undercut the defense's argument that prosecutors are using Maxwell as a scapegoat, legal experts said. 
The women - who say they met Maxwell at different times in places as far flung as Florida, New Mexico and London - all portrayed her as central to the sexual encounters they had with Epstein.
Maxwell's attorneys did rattle three of the four accusers during tough cross-examination and scored two favorable rulings from U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan, who said that two of the four women prosecutors called victims were old enough to consent at the time of the alleged encounters. 
But as the defense prepares to mount its case, persuading jurors that Maxwell was not involved will be difficult, some experts said. 
""The government has done a good job of keeping the jury focused on Maxwell,"" said Sarah Krissoff, a partner at law firm Day Pitney and former federal prosecutor. ""The government will argue that the fact that each victim has a different story – and didn't exaggerate Maxwell's role in that story – demonstrates the credibility of those accounts.""  
Prosecutors, who say Maxwell recruited and groomed four teenage girls for Epstein from 1994 to 2004, rested their case on Friday in Manhattan federal court.
Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to eight counts of sex trafficking and other charges. Her attorneys did not reply to a request for comment for this story.
Her attorneys have argued that she is a ""convenient stand in"" for Epstein, who died by suicide in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges.
The remarkably similar accounts of the accusers could help undermine that argument, experts said.
For example, a woman testifying under the pseudonym Kate said that Maxwell encouraged her to rub Epstein's feet when Kate was 17 in London in 1994. Weeks later, at Maxwell's request, Kate said she gave Epstein a full-body massage that escalated into a sexual encounter.
Annie Farmer, now 44, said she and Maxwell gave Epstein a foot massage at the financier's New Mexico ranch in 1996, when Farmer was 16. 
""I watched what she was doing and she instructed me,"" Farmer said.
Massages, and Maxwell's central role in them, came up repeatedly during the women's testimony. 
Jane, who said she was 14 in 1994 when Epstein first abused her, testified that Maxwell would sometimes participate when massages later escalated into sexual encounters. 
Prosecutors said the women's testimony provided them with details which are crucial to prove charges that Maxwell enticed the girls to travel across state lines and in some cases paid them for sexual activity.
Jane said Maxwell assisted her with arrangements when she traveled to Epstein's home in New York. And Carolyn, a woman who says Epstein abused her starting when she was 14, said she was paid $300 after she massaged Epstein. Once or twice, it was Maxwell who handed her the cash, Carolyn testified.
'ROOM FULL OF STRANGERS'
Maxwell's lawyers argued that the women's memories were corrupted in the decades since the alleged abuse, and that they were motivated by money.
Three of the four women frequently became agitated when the defense challenged their credibility by pointing to apparent inconsistencies between their testimonies and prior statements made to law enforcement. 
Maxwell attorney Laura Menninger grilled Jane about why she initially told the FBI that she did not recall being in a room alone with Epstein and Maxwell or Maxwell ever touching her. 
Jane called the notes ""incorrect,"" but on further questioning by prosecutors cried as she explained why she did not share certain details initially.
""I was sitting in a room full of strangers and telling them the most shameful, deepest secrets that I'd been carrying around with me my whole life,"" Jane said.
Later in the trial, Maxwell attorney Jeffrey Pagliuca pressed Carolyn about $3.25 million she received from a compensation fund set up for Epstein victims. 
""Why is that being mentioned more than once?"" said Carolyn, who later sobbed on the stand. 
Jeffrey Cohen, an associate professor at Boston College Law School and former federal prosecutor, said the defense may argue that the accusers' reactions under cross-examination could indicate ""they are simply out for vengeance and clouded by passion."" 
But in this case, he said, the jury would likely be ""forgiving of the victims' outrage.""
In a victory for the defense, U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan ruled that Kate and Farmer were old enough to consent at the time of their alleged encounters, meaning any physical contact they had with Epstein was not ""illegal sexual activity"" as prosecutors alleged in their 2021 indictment.
But the damage to the prosecution's case from that decision may be limited, experts said.
Neither Kate nor Farmer are the sole alleged victims underlying any of the charges Maxwell faces, meaning that jurors can use Kate and Farmer's testimony to back up the accounts of the other accusers. 

Kate and Farmer ""described strikingly similar patterns of behavior on Maxwell's part,"" bolstering Jane's and Carolyn's testimony, said Deborah Tuerkheimer, a professor at Northwestern (NASDAQ:NWE) University School of Law. 
""In important ways, the testimony of the women who were over the age of consent during the sexual interactions strongly corroborates the testimony of the two alleged victims,"" Tuerkheimer said.

791,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 05:10AM ET</span>",,,,,,"(Reuters) - California Governor Gavin Newsom said he plans to use a controversial U.S. Supreme Court ruling on strict abortion curbs in Texas to design a law that would allow private citizens to sue some gun manufacturers, distributors and sellers.
The Supreme Court on Friday left in effect the Texas law that enables private citizens to sue anyone who performs or assists a woman in getting an abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy.
The Texas law was designed by the state's Republican-controlled legislature to avoid normal means of legal challenge, because rather than making state officials responsible for enforcement, it instead gave private individuals anywhere the right to sue doctors who provide abortion services in Texas and anyone else who ""aids or abets"" the process.
While allowing the Texas law to remain in effect, the court ruled legal challenges may proceed against the measure, which critics say amounts to vigilante justice.
Newsom, a Democrat, said on Saturday his team will work with state Attorney General Rob Bonta and the legislature to draft a proposal in line with the Texas law that would let citizens sue manufacturers, sellers or distributors of assault weapons or ghost gun kits for at least $10,000 per violation.
""I am outraged by yesterday's U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing Texas's ban on most abortion services to remain in place,"" Newsom said in a statement https:// 
""If states can now shield their laws from review by the federal courts that compare assault weapons to Swiss Army knives, then California will use that authority to protect people's lives, where Texas used it to put women in harm's way.""

Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a dissent to Friday's decision, blasted the court's majority for failing to ""put an end to this madness"" and warned that other states could try to copy the Texas enforcement mechanism.
President Joe Biden said he was ""very concerned"" by the decision to leave in place the abortion ban but said it was ""encouraging"" that the court allowed part of the abortion providers' lawsuit to continue.

MAYFIELD, Ky. (Reuters) - At least 100 people were feared dead in Kentucky after a swarm of tornadoes tore a 200-mile path through the U.S. Midwest and South, demolishing homes, levelling businesses and setting off a scramble to find survivors beneath the rubble, officials said Saturday. 
The powerful twisters, which weather forecasters say are unusual in cooler months, destroyed a candle factory and the fire and police stations in a small town in Kentucky, ripped through a nursing home in neighboring Missouri, and killed at least six workers at an Amazon warehouse in Illinois.
Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said the collection of tornadoes was the most destructive in the state's history. He said about 40 workers had been rescued at the candle factory in the city of Mayfield, which had about 110 people inside when it was reduced to a pile of rubble. It would be a ""miracle"" to find anyone else alive under the debris, Beshear said. 
""The devastation is unlike anything I have seen in my life and I have trouble putting it into words,"" Beshear said at a press conference. ""It's very likely going to be over 100 people lost here in Kentucky."" 
Beshear said 189 National Guard personnel have been deployed to assist with the recovery. The rescue efforts will focus in large part on Mayfield, home to some 10,000 people in the southwestern corner of the state where it converges with Illinois, Missouri and Arkansas.
Video and photos posted on social media showed brick buildings in downtown Mayfield flattened, with parked cars nearly buried under debris. The steeple on the historic Graves County courthouse was toppled and the nearby First United Methodist Church partially collapsed.
Mayfield Fire Chief Jeremy Creason, whose own station was destroyed, said the candle factory was diminished to a ""pile of bent metal and steel and machinery"" and that responders had to at times ""crawl over casualties to get to live victims.""
Paige Tingle said she drove four hours to the site in the hope of finding her 52-year-old mother, Jill Monroe, who was working at the factory and was last heard from at 9:30 p.m.
""We don't know how to feel, we are just trying to find her,"" she said. ""It's a disaster here.""
The genesis of the tornado outbreak was a series of overnight thunderstorms, including a super cell storm that formed in northeast Arkansas. That storm moved from Arkansas and Missouri and into Tennessee and Kentucky.
Unusually high temperatures and humidity created the environment for such an extreme weather event at this time of year, said Victor Gensini, a professor in geographic and atmospheric sciences at Northern Illinois University. 
""This is an historic, if not generational event,"" Gensini said. 
Saying the disaster was likely one of the largest tornado outbreaks in U.S. history, President Joe Biden on Saturday approved an emergency declaration for Kentucky.
He told reporters he would be asking the Environmental Protection Agency to examine what role climate change may have played in fuelling the storms, and he raised questions about the tornado warning systems.
""What warning was there? And was it strong enough and was it heeded?"" Biden said. 
'LIKE A BIG BOMB'
About 130 miles east of Mayfield in Bowling Green, Kentucky, Justin Shepherd said his coffee shop was spared the worst of the storm, which struck other businesses hard on the busy commercial strip just off the bypass to U.S. Highway 31 West.
""We've got some siding and roof damage here, but just across the road there's a brewery that half of it is gone. It's just totally gone, like a big bomb exploded or something."" 
One person was killed and five seriously injured when a tornado tore through a nursing home with 90 beds in Monette, Arkansas, a small community near the border with Missouri, according to Craighead County Judge Marvin Day.
""We were very blessed that more people weren't killed or injured in that. It could have been a whole lot worse,"" Day told Reuters.
A few miles away in Leachville, Arkansas, a tornado destroyed a Dollar General (NYSE:DG) Store, killing one person, and laid waste to much of the city's downtown, said Lt. Chuck Brown of the Mississippi County Sheriff's Office in Arkansas. 
""It really sounded like a train roaring through town.""
In Illinois, at least six workers were confirmed killed after an Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) warehouse collapsed in the town of Edwardsville, when the winds ripped off the roof and reduced a wall longer than a football field to rubble.
Amazon truck driver Emily Epperson, 23, said she was anxiously waiting for information on the whereabouts of her workmate Austin McEwan late Saturday afternoon to relay to his girlfriend and parents. 
""We're so worried because we believe that, you know, he would have been found by now,"" she told Reuters. 
In Tennessee, the severe weather killed at least three people, said Dean Flener, spokesperson for the state's Emergency Management Agency. And two people, including a young child, were killed in their homes in Missouri, Governor Mike Parson said in a statement. 
The National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center said it received 36 reports of tornadoes touching down in Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Arkansas, and Mississippi.
The weather forecast was broadly clear for Saturday night, but temperatures were expected to drop and thousands of residents lack power and water after the storm. As of Saturday afternoon, nearly 99,000 customers in Kentucky and more than 71,000 in Tennessee were without power, according to PowerOutage.US, a website tracking power outages. 

Kentucky officials called on residents to stay off the roads and to donate blood, as responders rushed to rescue survivors and account for people in communities that had lost communications. 
""We've got Guardsmen who are out doing door knocks and checking up on folks because there's no other communication with some of these people,"" said Brigadier General Haldane Lamberton of the Kentucky National Guard.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Eight Hong Kong pro-democracy activists were sentenced to up to 14 months in prison on Monday for organising, taking part in and inciting participation in a banned vigil last year for victims of China's 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown.
The former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of wide-ranging freedoms, traditionally holds the largest June 4 vigil in the world, but police have rejected applications for the last two vigils, citing coronavirus restrictions.
Critics said authorities used the pandemic restrictions as an excuse to block the commemoration. The city government rejected that.
The sentencing is the latest blow to the city’s democracy movement, which has seen dozens of activists arrested, jailed or flee the Chinese-ruled territory since Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law last year.
Judge Amanda Woodcock said the defendants ""ignored and belittled a genuine public health crisis"" and ""wrongly and arrogantly believed"" in commemorating June 4 rather than protecting the health of the community.
Media tycoon Jimmy Lai, 74, who is already in jail, barrister Chow Hang Tung, 36, and activist Gwyneth Ho, 31, received sentences of 13, 12 and 6 months, respectively. They were found guilty by the court last Thursday.
The three, the highest profile of the eight, had pleaded not guilty to all charges. 
""If commemorate (sic) those who died because of injustice is a crime, then inflict on me that crime and let me suffer the punishment of this crime, so I may share the burden and glory of those young men and women who shed their blood on June 4th to proclaim truth, justice and goodness,"" Lai said in a mitigation letter, handwritten in prison, ahead of sentencing. 
Chow, in her mitigation said: ""If those in power had wished to kill the movement with prosecution and imprisonment, they shall be sorely disappointed. Indeed what they have done is breathe new life into the movement, rallying a new generation to this long struggle for truth, justice and democracy.""
Five others who had pleaded guilty, including Lee Cheuk-yan, leader of the now-disbanded vigil organiser Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, were sentenced to between just over 4 months and 14 months. 
""If there was a provocateur, it is the regime that fired at its own people,"" an emotional Lee, who received the highest sentence of 14 months, told the court on Nov. 17.
""If I must go to jail to affirm my will, then so be it.""
All sentences will be served concurrently with any the defendants are already facing in other cases. 
Sixteen other activists are already serving sentences of 4-10 months related to the 2020 vigil. Two democracy campaigners facing similar charges over the vigil, Nathan Law and Sunny Cheung, have fled Hong Kong.
After mass pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong in 2019, the global financial hub has taken a swift authoritarian turn with Beijing's imposition of a sweeping national security law last year impacting many aspects of life in the city.

China has never provided a full account of the 1989 crackdown on protest there that centred on Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
The death toll given by officials days later was about 300, most of them soldiers, but rights groups and witnesses say thousands of protesters may have been killed.

794,"<span>Dec 13, 2021 02:41AM ET</span>",,,,,,"ABU DHABI (Reuters) -Prime Minister Naftali Bennett began the first official visit by an Israeli leader to the United Arab Emirates on Sunday, seeking to strengthen Gulf ties at a time of heightened regional tension as world powers try to revive a nuclear deal with Iran.
Bennett, a far-right politician who took office as the head of a broad Israeli coalition government in June, plans to hold talks on Monday with the UAE's de facto leader, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan.
The diplomatic outreach comes as world powers negotiate with Iran on salvaging a 2015 nuclear deal opposed by Israel and abandoned in 2018 by then-U.S. President Donald Trump.
Since August 2020, the UAE, followed by Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco, have moved to normalise ties with Israel under a U.S.-sponsored initiative dubbed the ""Abraham Accords"" after the biblical patriarch revered by Jews, Christians and Muslims. 
Bennett's UAE trip is the first by an Israeli premier to any of those countries since the accords.
On arrival in Abu Dhabi after a flight from Tel Aviv, Bennett was welcomed by an honour guard and the UAE's foreign minister, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed.
""What a wonderful reception. I am very excited to be here on behalf of my people (on the) first official visit of an Israeli leader here,"" Bennett said. ""We are looking forward to strengthening the relationship,"" he added. 
Israel has broached setting up joint defences with Gulf Arab states that share its concern over Iranian activities. Pursuing economic, health and energy ties with its new ally, the UAE has signed dozens of memorandums of understanding with Israel since the Abraham Accords were signed.
Yet the UAE has also reached out to its Iran, sending its senior national security adviser there last Monday to meet his Iranian counterpart and President Ebrahim Raisi. 

A flight-tracking app showed Bennett's El Al Israel Airlines plane overflying Saudi Arabia, which does not have formal ties with Israel, en route to Abu Dhabi. Riyadh agreed last year to allow Israel-UAE flights to cross its territory despite the absence of official ties.
The rapprochement in the Gulf has been condemned by Palestinians, whose diplomacy with Israel stalled in 2014.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A video feed of a Taiwanese minister was cut during U.S. President Joe Biden's Summit for Democracy last week after a map in her slide presentation showed Taiwan in a different color to China, which claims the island as its own.
Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Friday's slide show by Taiwanese Digital Minister Audrey Tang caused consternation among U.S. officials after the map appeared in her video feed for about a minute. 
The sources, who did not want to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter, said the video feed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw2bfsjTXhA showing Tang was cut during a panel discussion and replaced with audio only - at the behest of the White House.
The White House was concerned that differentiating Taiwan and China on a map in a U.S.-hosted conference - to which Taiwan had been invited in a show of support at a time when it is under intense pressure from Beijing - could be seen as being at odds with Washington's ""one-China"" policy, which avoids taking a position as to whether Taiwan is part of China, the sources said.
The State Department said ""confusion"" over screen-sharing resulted in Tang's video feed being dropped, calling it ""an honest mistake.""
""We valued Minister Tang's participation, which showcased Taiwan's world-class expertise on issues of transparent governance, human rights, and countering disinformation,"" a spokesperson said.
Tang's presentation included a color-coded map from South African NGO CIVICUS, ranking the world by openness on civil rights. 
Most of Asia was shown, with Taiwan colored green, making it the only regional entity portrayed as ""open,"" while all the others, including several U.S. allies and partners, were labeled as being ""closed,"" ""repressed,"" ""obstructed"" or ""narrowed."" 
China, Laos, Vietnam and North Korea were colored red and labeled ""closed.""
When the moderator returned to Tang a few minutes later, there was no video of her, just audio, and a screenshot captioned: ""Minister Audrey Tang Taiwan."" An onscreen disclaimer later declared: ""Any opinions expressed by individuals on this panel are those of the individual, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the United States government.""
One source told Reuters the map generated an instant email flurry among U.S. officials and the White House National Security Council (NSC) angrily contacted the State Department, concerned it appeared to show Taiwan as a distinct country.
Washington complained to Taiwan's government, which in turn was angry that Tang's video had been cut. 
The source called the U.S. move an over-reaction as the map was not inherently about national boundaries, but the NSC was also angry as the slide had not appeared in ""dry-run"" versions of the presentation before the summit, raising questions as to whether there was intentional messaging by Tang and Taiwan.
""They choked,"" the source said of the White House reaction.
A second source directly involved in the summit said the video booth operator acted on White House instructions. ""It was clearly policy concerns,"" the source said, adding: ""This was completely an internal overreaction.""
The sources saw the move during a panel on ""countering digital authoritarianism"" as at odds with the summit's mission of bolstering democracy in the face of challenges from China and others. They also said it could signal that the administration's support for Taiwan was not as ""rock solid"" as it has repeatedly stated.
An NSC spokesman said Reuters' account of the incident was ""inaccurate"".
""At no time did the White House direct that Minister Tang's video feed be cut,"" the spokesman said in an email, also blaming it on confusion over screen-sharing and adding that the full video could be viewed on the summit web page. 
Asked whether she believed the U.S. government cut the video due to the slide, Tang told Reuters in an email: ""No, I do not believe that this has anything to do with the CIVICUS map in my slides, or U.S. allies in Asia for that matter.""
Taiwan's foreign ministry blamed ""technical problems.""
It later said Tang's presentation had been provided in advance and not shown at the last minute.
""Taiwan and the United States have fully communicated on this technical issue, and the two sides have a solid mutual trust and a solid and friendly relationship,"" it said.
The issue comes at a highly sensitive time for U.S.-Taiwan relations, when some Biden administration critics and foreign policy experts are calling for more overt shows of support for the island, including an end to a long-held policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" as to whether the United States would defend it militarily.
Taiwan experts said they did not see the color-coding of the map as a violation of unofficial U.S. guidelines, which bar use of overt symbols of sovereignty, such as Taiwan's flag.
""It was clearly not to distinguish sovereignty, but the degree of democratic expression,"" said Douglas Paal, a former unofficial U.S. ambassador to Taiwan.
Under U.S. government guidelines https://hiu.state.gov/cartographic_guidance_bulletins/37-Taiwan-2020.pdf as of 2020, U.S. government maps showing sovereignty by color require Taiwan to be shown with the same color as China, although exceptions can be made ""when context requires that Taiwan be specifically singled out.""

Bonnie Glaser of the German Marshall Fund of the United States said the guidelines would not apply to a non-U.S. government map, ""but the U.S. would likely want to avoid appearing to endorse that Taiwan is not part of China."" 
""It seems to me that a decision was made at the outset that Taiwan could/should be included in the Summit for Democracy, but only in ways consistent with U.S. policy.""

TAIPEI (Reuters) - A full Chinese invasion of Taiwan with troops landed and ports and airports seized would be very difficult to achieve due to problems China would have in landing and supplying troops, Taiwan's Defence Ministry said in its latest threat assessment.
Tensions between Taipei and Beijing, which claims the democratically-ruled island as its own territory, have risen in the past two years as China steps up military activities near Taiwan to pressure it to accept Chinese rule.
In a report to lawmakers, Taiwan's Defence Ministry said China's transport capacity was at present limited, it would not be able to land all its forces in one go, and would have to rely on ""non-standard"" roll-on, roll-off ships that would need to use port facilities and transport aircraft that would need airports.
""However, the nation's military strongly defends ports and airports, and they will not be easy to occupy in a short time. Landing operations will face extremely high risks,"" the ministry said in its report, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters.
China's logistics face challenges too, as any landing forces would need to be resupplied with weapons, food and medicines across the Taiwan Strait that separates the two, it added.
""The nation's military has the advantage of the Taiwan Strait being a natural moat and can use joint intercept operations, cutting off the Communist military's supplies, severely reducing the combat effectiveness and endurance of the landing forces.""
China would also need to keep some of its forces in reserve to prevent any foreign forces joining in to help Taiwan and to keep close watch on other fractious areas of China's border, like with India and in the South China Sea, the ministry said.
""U.S. and Japanese military bases are close to Taiwan, and any Chinese Communist attack would necessarily be closely monitored, plus it would need to reserve forces to prevent foreign military intervention,"" it added. 
""It is difficult to concentrate all its efforts on fighting with Taiwan.""
Experts say though that China has other means at its disposal to bring Taiwan to its knees short of a full out invasion, including a blockade or targeted missile attacks.

Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen is overseeing a military modernisation programme to make the island harder to attack, making the military more mobile and with precision weapons like longer-range missiles to take out an attacking force.
The government is planning an extra T$240 billion ($8.66 billion) over the next five years in military spending to go mostly toward naval weapons, including missiles and warships.

MAYFIELD, Ky. (Reuters) -A ray of hope emerged on Sunday from the aftermath of a barrage of tornadoes that obliterated a Kentucky town and killed people in five states, as representatives of a candle factory destroyed in the disaster said far fewer people may have died than previously feared.
Officials had said the death toll could soar past 100 from twisters that tore through at least six states in the U.S. Midwest and South on Friday night, while seeing little chance of finding survivors in the rubble two days later.
In Kentucky, Governor Andy Beshear https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ive-got-towns-that-are-gone-kentucky-governor-beshear-says-2021-12-12 estimated the death toll at 80 and said it was certain to rise above 100, but that was based on suspicion that scores were killed when a candle factory https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/an-instant-kentucky-factory-destroyed-dozens-employees-missing-2021-12-11 was destroyed in the small city of Mayfield.
Up to 70 people at the factory had been believed dead, but that number could be revised down to 16 or fewer, a company spokesman said, raising the possibility the governor's death toll estimate could come down significantly.
Among the 110 people who were at the factory, eight have been confirmed dead and eight others remained missing, said Bob Ferguson, a spokesperson for Mayfield Consumer Products.
""There were some early reports that as many as 70 could be dead in the factory. One is too many, but we thank God that the number is turning out to be far, far fewer,"" Ferguson told Reuters, adding that rescue teams were still searching for the eight who remained unaccounted for.
It was unclear how many factory workers Beshear was counting in his estimated death toll, which he formulated on Saturday and said on Sunday remained unchanged - at least for now.
""We're still getting information in on the candle factory. The owner has been in contact and believes he has some different information. We are trying to verify it. If so, it may be a better situation and the miracle we were hoping for,"" Beshear told a news conference earlier on Sunday evening.
The governor's office could not be reached for further comment late on Sunday. 
Dakota Moore, 20, was working at the candle factory when the tornado warning came. As was the drill, everyone – about 100 people - lined up in the hallway in the center of the building, near the bathrooms.
""My ears started ringing. I started looking around and everybody down on the other side by the women's bathroom started ducking down. The walls started coming in on that side. There was this old lady, I was trying to get to her, and the wall took me down,"" Moore said.
The next thing he knew, he was getting wet as the roof above him had collapsed and it was raining.
Moore said he tried to help another man who was stuck in rubble up to his neck, but was unable to lift him out.
""I was able to get to his neck to see if he had a pulse or anything. Flatline,"" he said.
SEARCH FOR SURVIVORS
Two days after disaster struck, rescue workers scoured debris for survivors and many people without power, water or even a roof over their heads salvaged what they could.
While Kentucky was hardest hit, six workers were killed https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/amazon-driver-died-bathroom-sheltering-tornado-with-colleagues-2021-12-12 at an Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) warehouse in Illinois after the plant buckled under the force of the tornado, including one cargo driver who died in the bathroom, where many workers told Reuters they had been directed to shelter.
A nursing home was struck in Arkansas, causing one of that state's two deaths. Four were reported dead in Tennessee and two in Missouri. 
Nowhere suffered as much as Mayfield, a community of about 10,000 in the southwestern corner of Kentucky, where the large twisters also destroyed the fire and police stations. 
The governor said the tornadoes were the most destructive in the state's history and that even the sturdiest structures of steel and brick were flattened. One twister tore across 227 miles (365 km) of terrain, almost all of that in Kentucky, Beshear said.
Forecasters say tornadoes are unusual during cold weather this late in the year, and President Joe Biden https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/biden-approves-kentucky-emergency-declaration-tornado-disaster-2021-12-11 told reporters he would ask the Environmental Protection Agency to examine what role climate change may have played in fueling the storms. 
""It didn't take a roof, which is what we've seen in the past. It exploded the whole house. People, animals ... just gone,"" Beshear said of the storm system. 

More than 300 members of the National Guard were going door to door and removing debris. Teams were working to distribute water and generators.
The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency was opening shelters and sending teams and supplies, including 30,000 meals and 45,000 liters (12,000 gallons) of water.

(Reuters) - A publicist accused of pressuring a Georgia election worker to confess to false allegations of committing voting fraud was not “associated” with rap star Kanye West at the time she visited the worker, a representative for West said.
Reuters reported on Friday that the publicist, Trevian Kutti, met on Jan. 4 with Ruby Freeman, a Fulton County election worker who had been targeted by then-President Donald Trump and his allies with baseless claims that she processed fraudulent votes to favor Democrat Joe Biden.
Freeman told Reuters that Kutti tried to implicate her in election fraud and warned her that she could be arrested. Kutti also said the election worker faced unspecified “danger,” according to a police report. She sought to pressure Freeman into confessing in exchange for help, according to Freeman, who said she ended the conversation.
A number of media reports have cited Kutti’s association with West since 2018.
Pierre Rougier, a spokesperson for West, said in a statement to Reuters on Sunday: “Trevian Kutti was not associated with Kanye West or any of his enterprises at the times of the facts that are reported in these articles or since these facts occurred.”
Rougier did not answer additional questions from Reuters on whether Kutti worked for West at other times, or whether West and Kutti knew one another. Before publishing Friday’s story, Reuters sought comment from a different representative for West but did not get a response.
Kutti did not respond to requests for comment made Sunday morning.
In October, the hip-hop artist changed his name from Kanye West to Ye.
A biography of Kutti described her as the founder of Trevian Worldwide, a media and entertainment advisory firm with offices in four cities. The biography, posted on the website of the Women’s Global Initiative, a business networking group, identified her as a member of “the Young Black Leadership Council under President Donald Trump.” It noted that, in September 2018, she “was secured as publicist to Kanye West” and “now serves as West’s Director of Operations.”
By Saturday, the bios of Kutti and other members of WGI’s team had been removed from the group’s website. The women’s initiative did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday.
Reuters has detailed a campaign of harassment and intimidation against Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, also a Fulton County election worker. The women received hundreds of threats and harassing messages after lawyers for Trump claimed in December 2020 that the women had pulled “suitcases” of fraudulent ballots from under a table on election night and fed them into vote tabulators.

The claims were quickly debunked by county and state election officials, who said the “suitcases” were standard ballot containers and the votes were properly counted.
Trump and his allies continued to falsely accuse the women of election fraud, sparking months of threats that they said upended their lives. Some angry Trump supporters visited Freeman’s home. The 62-year-old temporary election worker went into hiding.

CHAJUL, Guatemala (Reuters) -Family members of Guatemalan migrants involved in a deadly truck accident in Mexico said they are desperate for news of their loved ones and feel forgotten by governments that offer few opportunities and no protection on the perilous route to the United States. 
It was just four days ago that Domingo Yobani Raymundo Mateo, 18, left his small village of Chajul, an Ixil Maya community some 260 kms (160 miles) from Guatemala City, for his second attempt to reach the United States. This time, his family sold a house to pay for his journey with the hope he would secure work after crossing the border. 
Instead, they received word that he was killed just one day later when a truck trailer carrying more than 160 people overturned on a curve https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/least-49-people-killed-mexico-trailer-accident-officials-say-2021-12-09 outside the city of Tuxtla Gutierrez in Mexico's Chiapas state on Thursday. At least 55 migrants, most from Guatemala https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/most-54-dead-mexico-truck-crash-were-guatemalans-mexico-says-2021-12-10, were killed, one of the worst death tolls of migrants in Mexico in the past decade.
""A friend of my son who traveled with him survived and he informed us that Domingo was dead,"" his father, Pedro Raymundo Caba, told Reuters in Chajul. ""(His friend) said he closed his eyes and covered his face with a towel that he carried in his backpack."" 
The incident has put a spotlight on the dangers migrants face https://news.trust.org/item/20211210194511-6f6rg on the road to the U.S. border, often at the hands of human-traffickers known as coyotes. Dozens of migrants have died from violence or accidents in Mexico over the past decade. 
Relatives of migrants killed or injured in the accident said they are desperate for information about their family members and get few answers from the government. 
""What we need is help so that Domingo's body can return home to bury here in Chajul. The government still does not tell us anything, they do not answer calls,"" his mother, Teresa Mateo Mendoza, said during an interview at her modest home with no electricity, where she is raising four other children. 
Lucrecia Alba's husband, Celso Escun Pacheco, 34, was among the dozens of people injured when the trailer overturned. He left his home in the Guatemalan highlands days earlier, kissing his wife and two young daughters goodbye, before setting out for the dangerous journey to the United States, where he hoped to find a well-paying job. 
At the family's home in Pamezabal, a tiny village in Santa Lucia Utatlan, a municipality in the province of Solola, Alba said the amount of deadly incidents involving migrants made the family feel left behind by state authorities. 
""It is not the first time that an accident of this type has happened. I believe that no government is interested in the high risks because this has happened many times,"" Alba said. 
""We need the governments of Mexico and Guatemala to raise awareness - migrants need more security on the road,"" said Santos Juan Alba, Lucrecia Alba's uncle. ""People are leaving because there are no opportunities here."" 
The accident underscores the extreme conditions, including severe poverty and gang violence, that migrants from Central American countries flee. 
Dominga Tiniguar, who lives in an impoverished village called Xepol in Guatemala's Quiche province, has spent days in anguish, awaiting news of her son, a farm worker who planned to earn money in the United States before returning to Guatemala. 
""He was going to Chicago to work so he could build a house here in Xepol and buy a piece of land,"" Tiniguar said, holding a photo of her son, Elias Salvador Mateo Tiniguar. 
Elias had paid a coyote $3,800 and set out for the U.S. border, Tiniguar said. 
Tiniguar said the family saw a photo from the truck accident and recognized Elias laying on the ground from the blue shirt he was wearing - but they still do not know if he is dead or alive. 
Guatemala has not yet publicly identified the 55 people who were killed. 

""They give me no information. They don't answer the phone,"" Tiniguar said. ""Help me find my son."" 
Following the accident, Guatemalan officials urged the United States to invest in the region https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/guatemala-seeks-aid-smuggler-crackdown-after-mexico-migrant-deaths-2021-12-11 to boost development. The United States, Mexico, Guatemala and other countries pledged to crack down https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-coordinate-with-mexico-regional-countries-crackdown-people-smuggling-2021-12-12 on international people-smuggling networks they blamed for Thursday's accident.
